On the one hand are those who merely offer their own impressions of what is going on in the animal mind. These impressions are fine, but they don't offer any reason why one impression is better than the next. Books that fall under this category are Elizabeth Marshall Thomas' \\"Hidden Life of Dogs\\", Jeffrey Masson's \\"When Elephants Weep\\" and most recently George Page's \\"Inside the Animal Mind\\". Page's book attempts to bring in modern science, but since he doesn't understand the issues, he fails miserably. On the other hand are books that tend to be dry and academic, and often argue that animals lack any kind of intelligence. What Hauser's book brings to this field is a keen understanding of the science, experience as a researcher who has worked in the wild and in captivity, and a love of animals. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The writing is uninspired. The organization is poor. Evidence is largely anecdotal.

I think it's a good mix.Adrian Smith has an artistic style that lends a great aural addition to the text and ideas here. There are enough pictures that this does feel like a quality work all around. A removable poster map is included, but it's cleverly glued in so that it folds out easily.The rules set isn't so baroque that it changes d20 completely, a refreshing change from some other d20 products that aparently bought the license when they might as well have made their own system--silliness. The mechanics lend themselves well to the setting. New magic spells, skills, etc are included and none get in the way of play.It's a good buy because it inspires stories.If you are looking for something that puts the demonic spin on post-apocalypse, then this is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you Joking!!!","review":"Seems as if the author had a slight overdose of The Craft.

I put Lenard Ashleys book on my wish list. I wish my husband hadn't wasted his money. Some of the information in the book is informative. Some of it is interesting. The authors attitude throughout the book was very snide and belittleing. How lucky we (the readers) were, that he could teach us how superstitus, primative and especially stupid we were. His cutting remarks about Wiccans, Witches, Christians, etc, left no doubt that he felt above it all. Perhaps, his other (five) books are written the same way. I don't know, I haven't seen them in the bookstores. If I had had a chance to flip through this book in a bookstore, I would have slowly put the book down and run away.Anyone want to buy a used copy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by an Arrogant Jerk","review":"Luckily I did NOT buy this book, I picked it up at the local library. As I flipped through the first couple of pages I couldn't help but become increasingly offended. Dr. Ashley seems to know very little about Witchcraft or religion, probably because he doesn't care to know. He likes to scorn anything other than Christianity....there were even a few snide remarks directed at feminist. The whole book is written with an air of arrogance and prejudice.

However, most of this seems to be post christian, since much of the information has refrences to \\"God\\" or \\"Satan\\". The author had several comments on information that came off as satirical-in a negative way, espically towards the little bit of info that wasn't related to christian views. The author also has a very negitive view of wicca. This book has more to do with early christian magic, and how the two oppisite views were combined, before the church could convince people to give up those magical ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a Christian account of Withcraft...very bad.","review":"I rated this as one star because that is the lowest rating available. I just received my copy and will promptly return it. I was disgusted with almost all of the concepts in this book. When I read the spell for turning yourself into a hare, and it included the phrase \\"in the devil's name,\\" I had to close the book. The whole idea of the Devil and Satan are Christian concepts. They have nothing to do with Witchcraft.I feel that if you want a very narrow minded and sinister view of witchcraft, you will love this book. Writing like this fuels religious pejudices and breeds ignorance.Modern witches and wiccans have come a long ways in gaining acceptance in society, this kind of literature a major set back."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"Words fail me...

I used to enjoy the real life diet and exercise success stories, workout ideas and recipes but the last two months have been a huge dissapointed. I couldn't tell whether the most recent edition was supposed to be a fashion/beauty magazine or fitness. Nearly the first 60% was all fashion/beauty type stuff. If I wanted that I'd subscribe to Glamour. I got out some older editions to compare and was really suprised at how much less fitness nutrition info was in the last two. It's really a big bummer. If this keeps up I will not be renewing. And previous commenter is right, it's on the grocery store shelf before it gets to my mailbox which is also dissapointing. I subscribe to Shape to get fitness and diet inspiration and ideas, not to see how to pluck my eyebrows and what $300 dress to wear this spring with heels. Bring back the old Shape please!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More fashion and fluff than exercise stuff","review":"While I rarely subscribe to magazines, I was looking for something to motivate me to exercise and so I signed up for a one year subscription to Shape. Before and during college I was a ballet dancer, but after entering the real, 9-5 working world half a year ago, exercise time became more difficult to find. Unfortunately, I found that Shape magazine was not really about exercise at all. It was about beauty products, fancy new-age spas and resorts, and trendy workout accessories. I was also shocked by the models on the magazine's covers and pages. Not only were they skinny but they usually sported next to nothing. I finally cancelled my subscription when a magazine came with a woman in a see-through, lacy top on the front of it, visible nipples and all. Workout wear? I think not! Trust me, the woman belonged in a porn magazine, not my exercise magazine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good articles, but....","review":"Shape magazine has some good articles, and I especially liked the \\"success stories\\" of real people, but the magazine's image puts me off. As a mature woman and mother interested in exercise for health and fitness, I don't need or want to see scantily clad seductively posed teens on every page. Come on - do we need that image of \\"perfection\\" to inspire us to work out? I would prefer more emphasis to be placed on substance and up-to-date health and fitness information. Because of the skin-flashing covers,I was embarrassed to be seen reading the magazine, so I cancelled my subscription."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you like to Pretend your athletic","review":"Shape Magazine is a joke. This magazine has more make-up tips, clothing and weight watcher success stories than anything about atheletes.

Sadly, most of their workouts need access to gym equipment, which is great for those who do but most don't. The articles also leave less to be desired. Most starting with \\"According to blah blah blah 78% of women have blah blah blah.\\" I felt like I was reading a very thick survey/statistics overview as opposed to a health magazine. I've gotten more health information from a Seventeen magazine than Shape. If anything else, Shape is one big advertisement for the latest in exercise and beauty supplies. When my subscription ends, I will not miss it.

I was a little upset to realize that your target audience is white, young, upper-class, skinny women. The month of March 2002 only features 2 or 3 black women and a few women of other races, and one overweight woman (and that was to feature a success story). This is a joke, have you looked out the door lately? You can't exclude the diversity of races and sizes because you feel like it and throw one or two into the hundreds of women who portray the \\"perfect image\\", just so that you appear to be unbias.

MUCH better magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not diverse and too much fluff","review":"I have been subscribing to Shape for about two years now, and its the same thing every month. I agree with A.T. who posted a review sometime ago, that Shape is not diverse at all. I have never seen a woman of color on the cover, and maybe 1 or 2 African-American women models. I too am white, but I would love to see a lot more diversity. As far as the fitness articles, they have some usefull tips but other than that it is a bunch of \\"what to wear this spring\\" and all the clothing they advertise would look good on you if you were a size 5 with a nice flat tummy. I think Shape should be more realistic in reaching out to the average women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has nothing to do with fitness anymore","review":"I started reading Shape back in 03 when I went to college and I wanted to stay on a healthy track. It was great and had tons of fitness articles and helped me perfect my form. Since then its simply become all about beauty and fashion with maybe a little bit of fitness mixed in. And the fashion isn't even that good, who wants to spend $100 on a pair of workout pants? I don't. What is most sad is that its extremely repetitive, it shows the same movements different girl maybe on a beach or in a field somewhere.

It also would also contain very good articles addressing women's issues. Since the new editor Tara Kraft took over, this magazine has really gone down hill. The articles on fitness and nutrition are almost nil and the serious articles that really addressed women's issues are now very rarely there. She has basically turned this into a wanna be beauty magazine. On the editor's page, Valerie Latona would write about causes or women's concerns. Tara Kraft just presents a narcissistic catalog of all the extraordinarily expensive things she likes or wants.

I loved the magazine then; I liked how the pages looked and the articles and the success stories (those are the best!) When I heard that the editor-in-chief, Valerie Latona was leaving, I was really disappointed. Now they have this new editor Tara Kraft and she made the magazine so much worse. There aren't any interesting articles anymore, the layouts is weird, and as many people have stated, SO many darn advertisements! That just shows you that SHAPE needs all the money they can get out of those ads because of lack of subscribers. As soon as the January issue comes (that issue is the success story issue :) I will not be subscribing to this magazine anymore, that's for sure. Another thing I would like to add is that Shape magazine is always late; and I wanted to cancel my subscription but it looks like I will just have to ride it out I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give zero stars, I would","review":"I used to be a faithful Shape subscriber. Then I found more and more ads in it selling products that did not strike me as consistent with the good health/fitness advice the magazine claims to provide. There are all kinds of ads for quick fixes that have nothing to do with working out and eating healthy. You can find articles about how to have a healthy body image and a few pages later find ads for diet pills. I find more of the content about how to look pretty than how to be healthy. Then I started getting phone calls from Rodale (publisher) when I didn't renew. The phone calls got out of hand. They finally did stop, but now I cannot get them to stop emailing me. I have unsubscribed, emailed customer service for months now and the emails come regularly still. Just not what I want in a magazine.

When I first began reading Shape, it was almost solely dedicated to fitness and health. Now it's about 50% beauty and fashion (and a lot is articles that are simply trying to push products). I disagree with the writer who said that she wished they would stop showing moves with gym machines; this is one of the few sections of SHAPE I enjoy reading, as it does give great instructions on how to use the machines (definitely cheaper than hiring a personal trainer). But I do agree with the previous comments that the stories are starting to all sound the same from month to month - especially the success stories. If you're just starting to exercise, this magazine will be helpful for you. But if you're a long-time exerciser, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"I am a subscriber to Shape and I will not be renewing my subscription. If I had a self esteem problem looking at this magazine would just make it worse. I have been quite disappointed with the models used in the articles.

The clothes that are advertised are not affordable for the average working women and many of the articles are not that helpful.

The author also completely understands the subject he writes about.. whether it is abandoning one's inhibitions or dealing with childhood memories that come back to haunt you. He captures the emotions, feelings, and even physical aspects of any situation perfectly!

It really is a recipe book on how to increase your wealth. Once I got into it, I really began to change my way of thinking and started to slowly implement the suggestions here into my life.I am giving it 4 stars, not because I think it's just ok, but because I really enjoyed Think and Grow Rich and feel that one spoke to me more.

The author knows nothing about science -- there is no usage of the scientific method nor an understanding of the randomness in life. A better title of the book would be \\"The Religion of Greed\\" because he misuses quotes from the bible to justify getting rich. The book is just a bunch of redundant uses of the idea of positive thinking. \\"There is a thinking stuff from which all things are made, and which, in its original state, permeates, penetrates, and fills the interspaces of the universe. A thought in this substance produces the thing that is imaged by the thought.\\" Give me a break! If you must read the book at least download if free off of the web.

Actually, spiritualism itself was spawned in the late 1800s. Nothing new here, either, that has spawned books like The Secret and Robert Schienfeld's stuff.Think and it shall be given. I think JC said that as well. Pages and pages of repetitive nonsense. But it does have a compelling ring to it. What if it is true?I believe I will become rich.

It would be nice if it was the true voice of Wallace Wattles - because I'd keep it just for sentimental reasons, but it sounds like it was recorded in about 1970 in a closet with a $50 tape recorder. The reader is not professional - being short to of breath to speak whole sentences, and they are very monotone without expression (and I love this book so much, I want to hear it with some amount of conviction, strength and joy!)If you want a better audio version than this - simply record yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book but Powell has killed the original","review":"This one of the greatest books that I have ever read. I am grateful for the effort that Wallace D.

The speaker's voice is somewhat dull, but if you can get past that, you will find his words are worth digesting.

Personally, I think it's worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nuts and Bolts of The Secret","review":"For those who've read \\"The Secret,\\" this could be the main outline, the essential ingredients to that yarn. Wattles goes a little further to explain why you can't wish for things, they must be tied to positive action. Even though the title does not suggest religious overtones, Wattles is very much a christian, and casts his information in great humility. The unspecified action steps, he leaves to the reader. All you need to do is buy some discounted operating system software, grasshopper....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Wattles in Right On!","review":"Wow. That was my first impression of Dr. Wattles' message. This information, though written during the great industrial revolution, is Very vital to today.

Forget the deceptive title; this fantastic book teaches the reader how to achieve ALL goals and build a life of productivity and positive expectation/faith/confidence. It teaches you how to think properly and deliberately and move towards your goals with relentless fire and enthusiasm.My one gripe lies in the three or so typos from Editor Ruth Miller. As an editor, typos are absolutely disgraceful. Your job, for Pete's sake, is to spell the words correctly. It's an insult to Wallace Wattles and it shows laziness on her part.Content: 5 starsEditing: 1 star"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not rich","review":"Well, I did not get monetarily rich reading this book, however, I did get a new insight into my thinking processes.

I'm sure there are many who just won't get it. I will say tho that I have improved my life considerably and I have often gotten a good laugh when I ask and God sends his answer to my request.

The author took an idea and put so much puffery on it that you lost your train of thought on were he was going. Then he kept repeating himself over and over. It felt like i was listening to an old man ramble about the same thing for an hour and go knowhere. It felt as if each chapter he would forgot were he was taking the story so he had to repeat it.

I don't know how anyone could be inspired by this one.. And his style of writing was hard to read too. I know it was written many years ago, but not THAT long ago... A complete waste of my money - and I don't say that very often. If Rhonda Byrne was inspired by this book alone I have no idea how she really got around to making The Secret. This one is a depressing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding me ....","review":"Readers deserve a reward if they can stay awake during the reading of this 110-page book. It's hard to see what all the fuss is about. The book reads more like a philosophy text than a practical guide to riches. Maybe the science of getting rich lies in . . . writing a book purporting to tell others that there is a \\"science\\" to it.I'm sorry -- maybe it's just me but the book seemed like 100-year old drivel and seemed interminable, even at its slim length.Your mileage may vary ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"please","review":"He says on pg. 46 that \\"things are not brought into being by thinking about their opposites. Health is never to be attained by studying disease and thinking about disease.\\" Actually, health is almost always attined by studying diseases and figuring out what causes them. I didn't read this book because I wanted to get rich, but if you want to get rich, I would recommend you change your worldview. His understanding of \\"rich\\" is more like \\"happiness\\" and he gives a 100% guarantee. It reminds me of tonics and cheap marketing. He also pushes a lot of Hindu principles, essentially like cultivating your good karma. I guess Hinduism was pretty new and revolutionary for people in the early 1900's, but I suspect this author's other books on health and happiness are nearly identical to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless drivel","review":"Perhaps the biggest waste of time ever.

Instead of the clear, simple prose W.D. Wattles wrote, you are left with the mindless drivel that Dr. Powell uses as examples to illustrate Wattles' points. Wattles expressly left out examples, and it was very effective. If you want to read what Wattles wrote, your only choice at this time is to find it elsewhere on the net, as the original version is no longer in print.

The screen is bad, pronunciation is bad, and it lacks some major features.One is incremental search: while you type the first few letters of a word, it should jump to the appropriate section of the dictionary and show you a list of words that start with the prefix. This is useful mainly because you may not know the exact spelling and try several spellings. It doesn't have that.Also you can't navigate through the description.

Only con: a bit expensive","review":"Great tool for second-language learners. I find the pronunciation to be reliable, with the only problem being that the generated voice is a bit too metallic or robot like. All possible words that you may want to look up while reading can be found. And one of the games offered allows you to cheat while playing Scrabble...I definitely recommend this e-dictionary. It is unfortunate that there be no compatible version for PDAs (sure, the software exists for Palm devices, but the format is not as user-friendly, and I've heard that the pronunciation feature --which is indispensable to any studious foreigner who would like to know, for example, the correct way to pronounce \\"Worcester\\"-- is not included)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money!!","review":"If you really need it for one year or 6 month, it is ok to have.

I am so glad that I did!! What a great product! Definitely worth purchasing. I concur with all the previous positive comments. The keys are easy to use. It is very readable. I love the games especially the flash cards to review previously inputed words. I also like the SAT word review. The price point of $89.99 is definitely too high for this product in this day and age, but like someone else said...they have no competition!! My only negative comment is that for that price it should come with a PDA Protector!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Franklin Speaking Dictionary","review":"Easy to learn, easy to use. Very readable screen; you select the font size. Just select a word and press the \\"enter\\" key to see the meaning and pronunciation.

For example, the pronunciation of \\"quantitate\\" is wrong. It is misleading. English is my second language.

I was a little hesitant at first because it seemed to be a little pricy but I must say that it is worth every penny. The screen is easy to read and so far I have been able to find a definition for every word I searched. There are many games that are great for any of those \\"word games\\" fans (like me)and it also has an organizer and many handy learning tools. One of my favorite things to do is the spelling bee where it says a word and you have to type it correctly. I can actually spend a good amount of time on this little gadget. I am glad that I came across such a great product. If you have some spare money, don't settle on the cheap ones with the unreadable screens and the limited amounts of words....buy this dictionary!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable e-dictionary","review":"Based on Merriam-Webster dictionary, the defintions are accurate.

Ten years ago, I bought another speaking English dictionary (model: LM4000, which is also made by Franklin), that still sounds better.

It has some of the most wonderful Jewish jokes that exist. The most amazing thing for me personally, however, which makes me want to recommend it to others, is that I am a person who identifies a lot with being Jewish and it feels as though a huge amount of my Jewishness, and how it has affected my thinking and way of being, comes from Ausubel's Treasure of Jewish Folklore!!! I think it is one of the most enjoyable ways that a person could immerse him/herself in the essence of Jewish culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"The book came in great condition. The only negative was that there was a personal inscription that I'm pretty sure was not disclosed when I made the decision to buy it. I don't know if that is something booksellers routinely note.

The player forces you to reload a DVD multiple times before it will accept it (it locks up and won't play) and freezes up in the middle of movies. I received this unit as a gift and didn't want to take it back. That was a big mistake. Any DVD player that can't play all DVDs without flaws, is nearly worthless.

I called and emailed RCA for help and their customer service is horrible. They suggested I clean the BRAND new DVD player and brand new DVD, and would not suggest anything else.

I have absolutely no connection to this character. Is it too much to ask that she have some initiative, take some responsibility for the state of her life instead of blaming it all on her husband? And then she tries to solve her problem by sleeping with a tatooed, drug-using scumbag with no job, for whom she has to pay the rent on his bathroomless trailer?Disjointed, badly written, indiscernible motivation for most characters and events, and a really obvious attempt at forcing an unrealistically libertarian philosophy of relationships.

The reviews can still be useful if you're just wondering what features the new gizmo has, but still, they ought to be a bit more critical if they're going to be such a review based magazine.2) Many of the ads are from vendors with bad reputations. I believe they make some sort of claim about requiring a certain level of honesty from anyone they sell ad space from, but it sure doesn't look like they have ever kicked anyone out of the magazine to me.So what do you have when you have a magazine full of uncritical reviews, the occasional beginnerish article about technique, and a lot ads from stores of dubious virtue? At best a 2 star magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many ads","review":"I bought this magazine while waiting at the airport hopefully to learn something.

They are now threatening to send me to collections. Another magazine I ordered was never recieved.Amazon told me to contact the publishers.

He is very please, therefore, I am pleased too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best figure out of the series","review":"This is the best out of the recent series. It is much better than any of the Viking series, or the Samuri Warriors. This Raven figure looks like he could actually stand up in a fight against the regular Spawn, and even kick Spawn's behind. And the thorns on his wrists and legs are actually sharp. They wont cut you, but they do not have the look as if they have been machanically dulled at the manufacturer.My only complaint: his right ney gets a little loose after a while. But he is still able to stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"13 year old collector","review":"So far, this toy has proved to be an excellent advancement in the McFarlane series.

One would hope that this evidence will be reexamined in the light of a new day...or century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"Never seen this artist perform in person but I did see a televised concert performace by him and thought it was very impressive.

The book could have used a one page map to pinpointthe areas mentioned in the book. The book jumps between parts of Tibet, India, and China. Thestory is short (158 pages) and takes a bit of time to get moving. The first third of the bookessentially just introduces the main characters.The story revolves around saving the only child of the leader ofBalpur (described as an independent country bordering India) from the invading Chinese army.The story is pretty straightforward with no great surprises.The book is a quick read but there are many better stories written by Higgins."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL ARRAY OF ROSES!","review":"I'm a florist and I really enjoy using this book when I'm meeting with Wedding clients.

This woman who claims to write the best physiology textbooks around must be lying.Her book is [not good]. It leaves out too many details, has a bunch of senseless flow charts that tell you nothing and provides no explanation. I have a copy of her book and it is thinnner the most physiology textbooks. I wonder why its thinner then most other physiology textbooks? Well its because she does not take time to explain the physiology of the human body.She maybe a good teacher but she can't write a textbook for anything. A 10 year old child can write a better physiology textbook.I would not buy this book at all. Bad book!You want a good physiology and anatomy textbook? I recommend Hole's anatomy and physiology textbook. Hole's anatomy and physiology textbook makes Dr. Silverthorn's textbook look like something you clean your car windows with."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you see is not what you get","review":"This is not the classic game, it's the newer one with more categories but now their cut up into 2 sided cards with just one list on each side and where you put the cards has changed too now you stick them in this plastic thing inside the folder, it's not that it's worse it's still a fun game but I wanted the original like it shows in the picture and for that I gave this 1 star because what you see is not what you get. Don't get me wrong though it's essentially the same game with a few things changed I just hope the picture gets upgraded as did the game. Peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING. why can't I give it zero stars?","review":"This game bores me to tears. What I really dislike is that you spend about half the game NOT interacting with your friends. You are given an assignment (aren't we done with homework?), and you have to fill out a little form. Gee, that's what I like to do when I hang out with friends, fill out forms. Then you get together and compare answers. What is this, a study group? If someone thinks of an answer you didn't, your reaction will be something like \\"Hey, good one.\\" Shouldn't games get you more excited than that? If they think of something off the wall, you say, \\"What? that doesn't make sense.\\" And then they say \\"Yes it does\\" \\"No!\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"No!\\" Gee, I love games that get me in arguments about words. Compare this with games like taboo, guesstures, and cranium. In those, you're jumping around, yelling, laughing, singing, acting, having FUN. Don't buy scattergories."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE","review":"Beware of this game. It is absoutly no fun for kids 14 and under. the potential is there but if you don't know enought info you loose horribly and hate the game. I am 13 and very smart. Even i lost horribly. Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is fantastic for the first hundred times you play!","review":"My family and I love this game, when we first got it we played it ALL THE TIME. In fact we played it so much that we know all of the \\"answers\\" now. This game asks you to come up with objects or words that fit into a certain category and begin with the letter that was rolled on the die. It was fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone. I only wish that the makers would come out with a new addition that includes new categories so that my family and I can join in the fun again."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com","review":"This game is a modern classic in the world of party games. Players compete to try to fill in a unique answer for 12 different categories per round, all starting with the same letter. It's not as easy as it sounds, but it's loads of fun.One of the best things about this game is its portability. Due to the fact that there is no central game board, rather, each player has their own little folio with answer sheets, it can easily be played from every seat in the minivan (except the driver, of course). It can make long hours of driving much less tedious. It can be played on airplanes as well, but don't try to bring the electric timer, even if it gets past security (as ticking things tend NOT to), it's loud and slightly obnoxious to other passengers. Instead, steal an old-fashioned hourglass timer from another game (or an hourglass egg timer from the kitchen) and bring that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"CREATIVITY","review":"U CAN PLAY THIS GAME WITH 2 - 6 PLAYERS. BUT IT IS MUCH MORE FUN WITH ALL 6 PLAYERS. THE MORE CREATIVE U ARE WITH YOUR ANSWERS THE FUNNIER IT IS. IT IS CHALLENGING & ADDICTIVE. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH ANSWERS IN 12 DIFFERENT CATAGORIES, THAT START WITH THE SAME LETTER. THERE IS A DICE THAT HAS LETTERS INSTEAD OF #'S . SO IF U ROLL A \\"P\\", THEN ALL ANSWERS MUST START WITH A \\"P\\". SUCH AS NAMES, SPORTS TEAMS, FRUITS, TOYS, FLOWERS, THINGS FOUND IN A KITCHEN, ETC."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most fun game","review":"I love this game.

It was so much fun! Scattergories can really bring a family together. I give it a 5. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOTS OF FUN","review":"The game is a blast! To play with larger crowds I photo copy the answer sheets and lists, seperate them into bundles, and the extra people get to play along. This works better than teams in my opinion. Also per round I have people circle each \\"correct\\" answer then tally up winner for round and give winner a bingo chip. Person with most chips after the 12 lists winds the gaame! No more annoying paper scoring.One thing is, you better decide on a system for veto-ing answers. I use a simple hand raise vote. I am a big fan of the \\"creative\\" answer but some people just are not. If there is a question of an answer being valid just have all those in favor raise there hands.Great game, great fun. Needs expansion packs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Fun!","review":"This is a great game for families! Just fill in words that match the subject and letter. Easy words are worth equal points so children can easily play along."},{"rating":"2","title":"A game that never grows old","review":"This is a great game for the family because it can be played by a wide varity of ages. It is never the same twice, it is always different. It is fun and educational for the young players and keeps the older players mentally sharp. Working against the clock can be a hard thing but can also help you to learn to manage your stress level and help you to work under pressure. If I could find a fault with this game it would be that after playing it for ten years or so it would be nice to be able to purchase additional lists to work with. Would I buy it again? You bet. Would I give it as a gift? Been there,done that. Do I think it is a good gift for the younger set? By all means, if you want to give a gift that will help the child learn and yet have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Fun!","review":"A great game for families, older kids, or adults who are game players.

Impressive air to air action and photography, real - instead of CGI flying scenes, and best of all, no blatant violations of the laws of physics.

The real stars of this movie are the airplanes and the excellent flying sequences.

It's science and agriculture. It's care and preservation. It's timing and careful planning. But this book didn't scare me away from my notions, rather it provided me with the critical information I'll need to successfully care for my own colony of bees.

A group of incredibly bad actors take over as members of a \\"Survivor\\" type tv show that looks about as exciting as spin the bottle. Any attempt at plot coherence is shortshifted in the movie's attempts to parody reality shows, but there is no suspense or horror and Marino is especially bad as the vengeful pirate.

It's a tea to be savored."},{"rating":"1","title":"bitter","review":"I was greatly surprised by this, and now am stuck with 6 boxes of tea I can't stand. ANY other tea is better-even the cheapest in the grocery store. BTW, true Orange Pekoe tea has no orange flavor- it refers to grading by leaf appearance, and the appearance here is very good, so I am at a loss about the taste. If I use 1/2 tsp of this with 1/4 c of other loose teas, it ruins the flavor of the whole batch. I have not been disappointed by Twining's other varieties. This tastes NOTHING like Ceylon tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mild flavor","review":"In previous years the flavor was a bit stronger and fragant, in this batch I find that the orange scent is a bit weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well it was worth a shot","review":"Sadly, this is pretty crummy tea.

I like this album very much as it has for of the romance atmosphere than any other feeling. It is full of meaningful songs and none except \`Cheri Cheri Lady' are singles. I give this album 4 stars out of five and I say it is worth the money if you are looking for a romantic evening with someone you love. All the songs are slow and are very harmonious especially \`Heaven will know', \`Lady Of My Heart' and \`Wild Wild water' are to be listened to when relaxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Understanding John le Carre","review":"This book is a disgrace. Despite its academic paraphernalia (extensive bibliography, endnotes, etc.) the one chapter I read first contained 27 errors ranging from misspellings of characters' names to misquotation from texts. The style is embarrassing, littered with cliches, ridiculous and inflated diction and garbled grammar, which renders the book almost unreadable and totally meaningless. This book has nothing whatever of interest to say about John le Carre, beyond offering a bibliography of sensible proper books about the author. I wrote a letter of complaint to the author and to the publisher. The publisher replied with profuse apologies and refunded my money. The author has not yet replied to me. I strongly recommend you not to buy this book, and if you have already done so, write and claim a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game for little kids that like the Teletubbies!","review":"This is a great memory game!! Some of the cards are in different shapes so very young children (2 years old) can play a simplified game. The cards are very distinctive so there is no question for the child when they have a match like in other memory games (I am thinking of the Pooh memory game where some characters show up on multiple cards and young children get confused if they pick up two cards that have Pooh on them). There is just one character or item per card. I bought this when my daughter was 18 months and she liked just playing with the cards and idenitifying the character/object.The only problem - trying not to lose all of the pieces!!Overall, I highly recommend this games for any child from 2 years to 4 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"$ (...) goes a long way with this game","review":"This is best played with an adult.

You can only play about 2 different games with it, when it tells you what to do, or when it plays the noise and you have to pick what it did.

It's definately a waste of $ and there are other books out there that are a fraction of the cost and will help you build vocabulary.For those who have no understanding of the language and are just learning... this will be great because it explains why they use certain words and it goes reeeaaally slow and gives you a chance to practice speaking.As a general observative for all levels, it's basically a vocabulary builder and basis for everyday conversation and will not help with grammar/writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one.

There were times I felt the book was going around in circles aimlessly. At times, it seemed to go along at a very good pace, which made the read go quickly. I thought each character, and the Doctor in particular were outlined very close to the tv series. His manerisms and speech were like what I had seen of the tv series. The history period seemed very close to what history has written for us, with the 4 main characters just thrown in for the ride, trying to change history, but realizing that perhaps they cannot change history, except ever so slightly, and one small person at a time....I liked this book a lot, it got drug down at times by the silliness of the entire excursion, which is why I only gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST REMIX CD EVER!!!!!","review":"WOW I WATIED FOR THIS CD 2 B AVALIBAL ON AMAZON AND I FINALLY FOUND IT FOR 4.40 THE BEST MIX'S BY FAR ARE MARK'S HARDER MIX AND ALL THE TWO DOORS DOWN MIXES SOME MIXES OF PEACE TRAIN ARE NOT VERY GOOD BOUNCE EURO IS VERY HARD 2 LIKE AND I DON'T LIKE THE MIDDLE PART OF THE ARENA MIX IT IT 2 SLOW FOR A REMIX AND HOLY ROLLER IS TOO CHURCHY FOR ME AND SOUNDS LIKE C AND C MUSIC FACTORY OVERALL DOLLY IS BY FAR THE BEST CROSSOVER DIVA EVER"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I loved Dolly's original version and the Holy Roller mix of \\"Peace Train\\", both of which are on this cd.

I give the magazine one star for a very snazzy layout, and a second star for hiring writers that don't insult the reader's intelligence by abusing alliteration (unlike another magazine supposedly aimed at intelligent adults). However, the content is consistently concerned more with pop culture than with the lives of real people. I have also noticed a bias against introverts in article after article that attacks shyness as a serious character defect, rather than simply a personality trait (so, introverts, if you want to avoid yet another lecture on how your way of relating to the world is intrinsically wrong, avoid this rag)."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Sold out' publication!","review":"Psychology Today use to be great magazine with actual psychology that anyone could use on a level of laymen knowledge.

And then, hopefully, someone who wouldn't have otherwise read a factual, informational, psychological magazine will read it. I feel the stories are designed to be interesting to a wide range of people, and they keep the diction simple enough so that even if you're not a psych student you can make sense of it. I also think the stories bring relevance to psychology - it's not all about people with disorders and treatments, etc - it relates to day-to-day thought processes and behavior. Besides, if you're a psychology student, you shouldn't be expecting this magazine to substitute a textbook or published study. I'm a psychology student, and I find the articles refreshing - they're informative, relevant to society, thought-provoking, and teach without shoving theory after theory down your throat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop psych magazine","review":"Psychology Today is just another Glamour/Cosmo/People disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology.

But.. the articles make the subject accessible to the average reader, and do include insights into human behaviors and relationships that are fun and interesting. I am always engaged reading the articles, and find them topical and very current, unlike some psychology magazines which are too \`deep' and drenched in older principles. This is a very \`hip' psychology magazine and would be appreciated by those who are not necessarily scholars in the subject but who have a genuine interest in learning more. My favorite part is looking through the recommended books section, because there is usually something worthwhile to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading for those interested in psychology","review":"I'm not a psychology student, and at this time, I don't plan on becoming one. For now, I'm a 25-year-old with a history of depression and OCD and I consider myself a bit of an autodidact. I have taken a few psychology classes in the past and I've also been known to read psych textbooks for \\"fun\\".Psychology Today is certainly not a textbook and it's definitely made to appeal to Average Joe, which I think it does wonderfully. The articles are informative and interesting, but not too in depth.

I went to several different stores and drove 65 miles south and north of our hometown to find this toy. I was very happy to finally find it 60 miles from home after looking in a dozen toy stores. The look on my son's face was priceless on Christmas morning when he opened his gift. His eyes lit up and his smile was from ear to ear!! After anxiously waiting for us to assemble the gameboard, he was quickly saddened when the firing mechanism in one of the guns was not working. The marbles pop up and fall back into the players own side of the board. I have looked for an address to request a replacement part and have been unsuccessful. After all the searching and waiting, he never had a chance to play the game. It is now setting in the closet as I search once again to get a replacement gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game Ever!","review":"I have no idea what any of these morons are thinking! I am a professional board game critic and I've thoroughly investigated every aspect of this game.Fun: NONE AT ALL! What is the point of this game? It's a really bad game. I mean, how on earth is one supposed to have fun launching a steel ball torwards a plastic disc? This question has kept me up late at night. Also, there were no assembly instructions included. So, of course, it took me four hours to sift through the gaunlet of plastic pieces and jam them together into something that resembled the box. And, where are those half-fingered gloves like in the commercials?Educational Value: Ohhhhh pleeeaaaase! I learned nothing from this product except that splashing around in a toliet bowl is more fun.Durability: What in God's name is that supposed to mean?

Be the cool kid, buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had Crossfire as a child and loved it, so I was excited to see it show up on my son's Christmas wish list. However, we are very disappointed in this new version. My 7yo son cried the first (and therefore only) time he played it because it was too hard to fire the guns. He had to squeeze with both hands, which prevented him from being able to use one hand to reload. They often misfire and you have to jiggle them to get the balls to roll into place and that can mess up the whole playing surface. He also said it hurt his hand to pull the trigger. I tried to play the game to see how bad it was. I couldn't even finish the game because I developed a blister on my trigger finger. The next day, my whole hand was sore and the pain extended up my forearm.

After SWV broke up and i heard that Koko had a solo cd out, i eagerly awaited this solo project. After all, her voice dominated SWV and i enjoyed her singing when she was in that group. Koko's cd didn't live up to my expectations at all. I thought this was going to be at least as good as the material she put out when she was in SWV, or even better. I gave it one listen and ended up selling it. The songs are bland and many of the ballads are boring. And there are way too many ballads. Sorry, Koko, you missed the mark. What could have been a knockout project fizzled and turned lukewarm. You were hotter when you were with SWV. Going solo always doesn't guarantee a hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"no wonder you went gospel","review":"swv and coke was'nt cooking without each other this proved it solo coko sucks and we all knew why she so called flound jesus every artist who parties, lives it up has wild sex, and gets high turn to the lord when they go broke and times hit hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special at all","review":"the music sounds canned and her voice is alright but it's not getting treated right on this by the numbers formula R-N-B of today.she was stronger in SWV."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT COKO BURNT MY MOUTH IT WAS SOOO HOT!","review":"Hot Coko = DA BOMB!!!!

I just can't say no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOLID WORK...","review":"After hearing this CD and reading all the positively glowing reviews of it, all I can do is concur with them. It was never a secret that Coko was the one who held the vocals in SWV together with her powerful and dynamic voice. On \\"Hot Coko\\" she has taken her chance to shine and prove that fact beyond a shadow of a doubt. She has proven it with a solid, tightly well produced debut solo CD. She shines on tracks \\"Sunshine\\", \\"Triflin' feat. Eve\\", \\"I Ain't Feelin'You\\", \\"Bigger Than We\\" and \\"If This World Were Mine\\". A must have and wonderful addition to any CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of Coko!","review":"I sincerely hope \\"All My Lovin'\\" is her next single, or that she plans to release it in the future.

I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PEOPLE HAVE REALLY SLEPT ON THIS CD!","review":"Coko, put her foot in this album. This CD truly had Grammy material. Unfortunately, her record label RCA has once again let go of something that could've changed the face of music. With her slammin' tracks like \\"I Ain't Feelin you\\", \\"you and me\\", and \\"Everytime\\" (which was produced by SWV producer Brian Morgan,), Coko takes us back to real R&B. I look forward to her next LP also. If you haven't gotten this album already, GET IT NOW. Tracks 1-12 are all top Billboard songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars","review":"This is one of those R&B albums from the 90's that you were feeling when it dropped, but when you listen to it a few years later it's repetitive, formulaic, bland and undistinguished. There are a few good songs on here and the rest is really nothing special. Same old stuff that everybody was making back then. Rodney Jerkins production, repeat chorus ten times. I don't really recommend buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hottest R&B LP in 1999/2000","review":"This album is full of hits. I don't know what these few loose screws are talking about.

Sitchin's translations of the Sumerian clay tablets have opened the way for a more plausible creation theory that sparked interest in many folks to reread the Bible with a new perspective. This book incorporates much of the ancient Sumerians' cosmology with a decidedly fundamentalist Christian perspective to give a very unusual theory. For example, the author reveals the God of the Old Testament Bible to be Nannar-Sin with Marduk as the \\"anti-christ\\" who plans, with the assistance of Saddam Hussein, to ressurect King Nebuchadnezzar in the final days. She also reveals, \\"Those who die receive eternal life on (planet) Nibiru.\\" The notions here are entertainingly wacky but much is written here to polarize and promote unhealthy paranoia. Worth reading just to get a glimpse of a new type of religious nut we may all have to contend with."},{"rating":"1","title":"tight thighs","review":"this pant is made tight on the thigh so if you are athletic thighs than don't buy it! but for skinny people, it's great \\\\"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price, you can't beat it.....","review":"Definitely a buy for $12.98 but the fit is not for everyone.

It took me nearly a year to go through its French translation, but it was well worth it. I read it as though it were divided in three volumes. Nothing has given me a better feel for Russia shortly before the 1917 revolution and the irrationality and obsessiveness that were its background. People stopped thinking and just wanted to get rid of the Czar. What they got was much worse. A must for anybody interested in understanding Russia and the profound crisis of Western culture that reached its climax first with World War I, and later Hitler and his infernal madness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"You get what you pay for.

I have had a Reptiles magazine subscription a few years back and a current one. The previous order had a missing issue and my subscription was not extended. Now my most recent has annoyed me. I recieved three issues, and then no more isues. Even though the Reptiles mag site says I should have recieved at least two issues since then, and I got a supposed extension. After this subscription, no more. I'll do as I have in the past, purchase them as I see them and only if the subjects interest me.

Don't subscribe if you want in-depth, detailed information regarding Reptiles. The layout and design is playful and childish, and the content is thin. It's obvious the editors are hurting for content because they allow even the smallest story to consume an entire page.Plus, the goofy cartoons and silly \\"games\\" are just annoying. Too bad the Vivarium isn't available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This instructional DVD is actually incredibly helpful in trying to learn the dances. He's slow enough for everyone to get it, but not so slow that the quick learners are ready to throw something at the screen. My only complaint is that when you finally have the dance down and are ready for music, it's not the music you'd dance to at a country bar. I understand this is probably due to music rights and costs, but it does make for a totally different experience once you try it out in public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique approach to Panic Attacks","review":"Dr. Guller uses a unique approach to stopping panic attacks. Although the book was not very useful to me because his approach wasn't at the root of my problem, it was a very interesting read, and provided some insight into other caused of panic attacks. If you have no idea why you started having panic attacks, I reccomend you buy this book and read it cover to cover. Stop Panic may help you uncover the reason for your panic, and ultimately assist you in stopping them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life.","review":"Don't spend ton's of money on all those kits out there in the world.I found myself feeling completely different after reading this book.

Some unidentified Joe approaches a Navy Seal, gives him some money and tells him to assassinate an HVT, but don't tell your other team members? And he does it?

The storyline WAS totally ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product great, but get it somwhere else!","review":"Product is what you would expect, but for your own sake, do NOT deal with this company! They are shady and love to change their pricing once you place an order. So don't believe what their listed price on here is. Just wait for that email telling you that \\"Oops, we made a mistake, you still owe us additional $xyz\\".."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as creative as usual","review":"This book was not as good as I expected having thoroughly enjoyed his previous short story collections. Seeing as more than half of the stories are based on real life events, the creativeness and originality I have come to expect from a Jeffrey Archer short story were just not there. The stories came across basic and predictable, except for the few stories that were original. Actually quite a disappointing read overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and slow","review":"These stories would remain unpublished without Archer's name attached to them. Older writers need to know when to call it quits before dragging out every lame bit of narrative they have laying around the house. To Cut a Long Story short is perfect evidence of the fact that big publishers sell safe, well-know names not stories of true quality. Pity. Most of these are \\"based on actual events\\" so they are not even original creations of Archer's -- just junk pulled from newspaper headlines and turned into snooze fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dull indeed","review":"Surprised by all the good reviews, as I found this very dull and functional writing. None of the stories were overly interesting, clever or engaging. I was expecting a few twists and clever conclusions but was left unmoved by nearly all the stories.I wouldn't recommend this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a rest","review":"I have enjoyed most of this authors books. In this one he appears to have been writing in his sleep, the old \\"get up and grab the reader\\" is missing. Perhaps he has too much on his mind with his personal problems. He should take a break, then come back and wow us with his earlier skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"Archer has about 3 tricks he likes to use in this book. With 14 stories, this gets old. By then end I was reading the first couple pages and then skipping to the end of the story to read the clever little ending. A very unfulfilling way to read. I just got the feeling that the author found himself to be very clever. With a novel there can be character development and such that will mitigate this fact, but in a short story if the gimick is weak the rest will fail as well. With the exception of \\"The Endgame\\" I found the stories quite forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Although mercifully brisk and tightly written, the stories in \\"To Cut a Long Story Short\\" pivot shamelessly on the dustiest of mystery-genre cliches. One or two tickled my senses, but the balance triggered alarm bells of disappointment and regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"May not be his best but still a good read","review":"Of the entire collection of short stories in this book, I liked the following best: The End Game, Chalk & Cheese, & The Grass is Always Greener. These 3 seem to be the favorites among readers, based on th various reviews I have seen prior to writing my own. Their plots seem to be very real & interesting from start to end. Stories with legal background were enlightening as you see the loopholes in the profession; interesting at first but the endings were quite so-so. Others like Something for Nothing & A Weekend to Remember were simply ok while Too Many Coincidences was too long.Not all stories were excellent but overall, the book was one good & entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not as good as I expected","review":"I grew up in my father's gas station in the early 70s and remember seeing his mechanics using Lisle tools all the time. I also remember seeing them at the NAPA store and knowing they had to be top quality. 40 years later and times have changed. I bought this set so I could remove the bolts holding the gas tank in my car. The sockets are not forged, but pressed together out of 4 pieces of metal. Looking into the drive end of the sockets you can see the gaps between the separate chunks of steel. You cannot put much torque on these cheap sockets or they will fall apart like a cheap watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must have for Jeep Drivers","review":"As every Jeep driver knows, Chrysler is obsessed with using Torx screws, so when I got my Wrangler I couldn't take anything apart because EVERYTHING on a jeep is a torx head. I bought this set and have used the majority of the sizes multiple times and have no complaints. The black coating has start to scratch off on a few but I don't need black tools, I just need working one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No I don't remember the magic...","review":"There is no way this author was an employee of Horizon Air. This book overglorifies a group of managers that failed to uphold a dream of the airline's founder, Milt Kuolt. It is made out to be like an \\"ole' boys' club\\" atmosphere while, in truth, there was much turmoil. Former Vice-president turned CEO, George Bagley, tossing a cup of hot coffee in a Maintenance V.P.'s face??? not addressed. Mr. Bagley's written assault on his pilot group during contract negotiations calling them \\"juvenille deliquents in uniform...\\" and \\"cowards\\" (also not addressed). This book gives a good factual chronology of events in the airline's history but doesn't address the morale problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed","review":"An interesting subject matter, but the book is incredibly poorly written and organized given that it was written by a PR professional. It really jumps all over the place with often no background or addressing topics that it is assumed the reader understands even though they are only mentioned much later in the book. Also strange how the author writes himself into the story in the third person. This could have been a much, much better book but it seems the author wrote it more to please the \\"hero\\" than to objectively tell a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as fun as it could have been.","review":"I only got this because I am an extreme fan of Michael Pare\`. At least THAT part was good! Lots of shirtless good looking Michael but that doesn't make up for the content. This is all filmed in one building.

Justin Timberlake reminds me of a wannabe Michael Jackson -not very original."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Real useful information","review":"I work in digital production, and bought this book to get some background info before my interview with Sony Imageworks. Unfortunately, it is just a jumble of too general info and gee-whiz diagrams, that wouldn't be useful to anybody. Production pipelines vary from studio to studio, and are constantly changing. There are interviews with some impressive names, but most of it is this starry-eyed look at the digital future. The stupidest thing is the quote from Francis Ford Coppola \\"I knew it would happen all along\\". Give me a break! Spend your cash on some magazines like Computer Graphics world for the effects info."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Commercial for Avid, Circa 2000","review":"Written like a bad stereo manual and padded with self-serving industry interviews, this title was an in-house product of Avid Press, and an unabashed commercial for their system as it existed at the turn of the century. Just one chapter was devoted to HD, with nothing useful about how to actually shoot in this medium, and there was no coverage of DV moviemaking either. The book was targeted towards Hollywood industry types who planned to shoot on 35 mm film, digitize their footage, and rent an expensive Avid editing suite for all post-production. Even Avid has had to rethink their business model in the intervening years, as competitors have offered more affordable software for desktop computers. Unless you just want an historical journey through obsolete editing systems, don't waste half a c-note on this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great magazine except","review":"they could include more clothing patterns that are easy to follow. Most of the projects are for children's toys and doily's. For a prolific crocheter I suppose it's best to develop your own patterns because you will quickly get bored with the scant clothing items included in the magazine.This magazine prompted me to crochet years ago. I saw a pattern for a crochet bikini that I had to duplicate. I did it but I took it apart & never made another one. So I suppose I owe my crocheting career to this magazine. It's a shame they don't include more innovative clothing designs with different types of yarns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, content and customer service","review":"I somehow got on their mailing list and got sent several past due notices without ever getting a magazine. Did see the magazine and it's not something I would have ever subscribed to - very poor quality and nothing in it that the other better crochet magazines don't already have. The price is also outlandish for the black and white newspaper quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to like something you pay for and do not receive.","review":"I have had other issues of this magazine before so I know I will like it once it starts to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to get your Earl Grey fix!","review":"I used to buy Twinings Earl Grey Loose Tea locally, but now I can only find it in bags. I don't think the taste is much different, but I just prefer loose tea. With Amazon, I buy this on subscription and save even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bergamot taste, although a bit weak","review":"This loose tea product from Twinings was like all their other offerings a good medium grade tea for the money spent. I di find myself adding a little bit more tea than usual in order to bring out the bergamot, in my opinion they could have used a little more bergamot oil.A good deal economically, but if you drink lots of tea like I do, you get a bigger bang for your buck if you buy the 2.2 lb bags of loose tea from Harrowsgate.Nice tins, can be used for many other things when empty, a tip I fill mine with pennies and nickels and then give it to a nephew or niece when they come over to visit. Also good to do the same filled with Hershey kisses or hard candies, little toys, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tea","review":"This version of Earl Grey tea never fails to be my favorite. Amazon's price for the loose leaves - which can sometimes be hard to find - is really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very delicate cup of Earl","review":"This may be the best balanced Earl Grey I have ever drunk.The scent is delicate and not at all overly aromatic. The taste follows suite and imparts a thinner taste of oil onto the tongue than does the more commercially packaged (teabags) version; even those by Twinings.If you like a hint of Bergamot than this is the tea for you. If you really love to be overwhelmed by Bergamot, than you will want to try a different product.Cheers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Selling dented cans.","review":"Although packaging was perfectly intact, three of the six boxes of loose tea were received were dented. This gives me the impression that the seller is intentionally selling dented cans of the product. I would buy this product again but only from a store where the tin boxes could be visually inspected before purchase. Selling damaged merchandise is not good customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Tea","review":"Twinings Earl Grey tea is probably my favourite tea ever.Just a bit of milk, no sugar, some short bread biscuits and opera and it's enough to send me floating happily on a cloud.You just can't go wrong with a cup of Twinings tea on a cold winter day, or just to stay awake at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect tea.","review":"Well caffeinated, affordable, and the best tasting tea I've ever had.

I gave it 4 stars because it is hard to level the product which is necessary for it to run. Occasionally the chemical that you use in it will leak out and can sometimes stain your carpet. Also, while they recommend to empty the solution out after each application, that is not always easy to do. The last thing you need to watch out for is occasionally one of these units will have a very stiff spring in the cigarette lighter adapter and will be hard to remove. I actually pulled the whole thing out of my dash once before I figured out a way around it. My advice is not to buy this if you just want to remove an odor from your car every so often. It's not cost effective, and it won't get rid of everything.

It's a facinating look at the early days of cave diving when the rules were being written with blood. I'm an avid diver but not a cave diver. It was startling to realize just how many of the early cave divers died in persuit of the sport. Many of Exley's friends and buddies and ultimately Exley himself died in caves. It's generally well written. At times it did seem to jump around a bit and I'd have to back track to clear up some confusion but it was a very worthwhile read none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"1","review":"If you are a cave diver this is a must read, Major history of first time cave, and deep water diving experiences, and the foundations of Florida, and U.S., cave diving."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those interested in the more Technical side of SCUBA","review":"I always thought that I wouldn't like cave diving, until I read this book.

Turned out it's one, if not the worst magazine i've ever read. I get the feeling it's not much more than a picture layout for people with plenty of cash to entice them into buying more things. I really wanted to rate it one star but somehow those one star reviews somehow lose credibility- i mean how bad can it be? so ok, I'll give it one and a half. Complete garbage, and that's another thing i feel bad about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many ads!","review":"This used to be my favorite magazine, but now it's just ad after ad after ad.

Not to be too cynical about it, but I just don't find this mag to be as USEFUL as it was before. If you like LOTS of articles on who the coolest extreme sports stars are, how they got their abs, and what gear they're wearing, subscribe NOW. The magazine looks amazing, the photography is top notch and they still manage to come up with a thorny article on the environment periodically. But for my money, it just feels like the editorial staff has been plucked from New York image mags that do one thing really well - SELL. I read National Geographic Adventure, and unlike Outside, I USE IT for information because it has CONTENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Men's Journal...","review":"... or any other corporatized magazine. I've read Outside for several years now, and it's become just another glorified catalog to sell stuff with shallow writing: e.g. best Tequilas in Mexico, etc, etc. I used to enjoy this magazine when it contained incisive writing from John Krakauer and others, and it was about the outdoors. Now it's basically corporate drivel. If I covered the title it could be Men's Journal or any such mag. I imagine that these editors must go from place to place taking their homogeneity and dull corporate editorial skills with them. This will be the last year that I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Longer the Outside I Loved","review":"I subscribed to Outside when it first appeared many years ago. The writing was superb. The magazine truly covered the outside. Jon Krakauer's writing was top-notch and I really enjoyed David Quammen's informative \\"Natural Acts\\" articles. Then there was the monthly guide to what was happening in the night sky (meteor showers, lunar eclipses, etc.). It was an intelligent publication. Now? It's nothing but a place for gritty macho boys to show off, and for manufacturers of macho fossil-fuel-hogging motorized toys. The only time women are featured in this magazine now is when they're half- or less- dressed. It's sexist, it's superficial, and it's crap. I don't know why they changed the format, but it was definitely for the worst. I dropped my subscription back in the '90s and haven't been back since and have no desire to ever again subscribe to this cheapened version of what was once a great magazine.

They seem to fill up their pages with \\"Gear Guides\\" and half their magazine looks like a product catalog (with boots and jackets that most of us can't afford). Occasionally there used to be good articles, but even those seem to have disappeared. Outside is now just a magazine that is below mediocre and attempts to disguise its fluff with flashy graphics and self aggrandizing language.I thought it funny when they started sending me free issues of GO, their attempt at creating an upscale version of Outside for the rich people. I opened it up and it was filled with more gear guides, except the gear was even more expensive.If you are truly an outdoors person, pick up an issue of Backpacker. It will inspire you to get outside and explore vs. Outside mag, which just wants to inspire you to buy from their sponsors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale","review":"If you like Jack Johnson,Lance Armstrong, Kelly Slater (or the blonde surfer) this is the magazine for you- you'll be seeing alot of them.

Sadly it has lost it's direction, the content is now very variable and in my opinion frequently has hidden left wing political messages.

What I liked most about this book is the plain and simple approach to some complex topics. I would recommed this book to any technical person who wants to learn Oracle quickly.

But he is assured it is not by his grandpa. Unfortunately the granpa is wrong, this movie is undoubtedly \\"a kissing movie\\". That is just one of the many problems witht the movie. Most importantly there is the pathetic supposed to be funny but greatly failing humor and script. This includes the very annoying line. \\"no more rhyming I mean it! Anyone want a peanut?\\" I mean seriously that is not funny. There is also the horrible effects. It is amazing that this movie was made in 1987 because I would have guessed it was made in 1960. Between mechanical rodents, kissing, kissing, kissing, peanuts, and Indigo Montoya's fathers death this movie is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Horrible.","review":"I will preface this by saying I was ignorant to the storyline of \\"The Princess Bride\\" or the \\"type\\" of movie it is when I purchased it. I expected a warm, romantic, comedy - a \\"chick flick\\" if you will. That is my fault. But I was certain that regardless, I just HAD to see a movie that I have heard about so much over the years and that got such spectacular reviews. It is difficult to even give this one star. I absolutely hated this movie. I do not enjoy the \\"Monty Python type of humor\\", as I refer to it. I think it's stupid, humorless, and just downright frustrating. I know there are many who disagree with me, but I just have to give my honest review here.As is obvious from the many positive reviews, I'm the minority here, but I just could not finish this movie. Most certainly the worst movie I have ever seen (or mostly seen)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie hurt to watch","review":"This movie bothers me and I really mean it... anybody want a peanut? I particularly sick of hearing that phrase over and over again along with many others. If this movie could fall off the face of the earth, I wouldn't cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this movie at all costs.","review":"The most annoying collection of bad jokes/puns/gags ever seen on celluloid. The humor is dry, at best, and vaguely vaudvillian. And if Buttercup has perfect breasts, them I'm Rod Steiger. Could someone please let me know who decided to give Andre the Giant a speaking role? The only remotely redeeming scene is the Wesley/Montoya swordplay, and it too is a bit tedious. The fact that this movie was even released is inconceivable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth seeing","review":"This movie is, I am sorry to say, not really worth seeing.

This is one very boring movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of unbridled enthusiasm.","review":"This classic fairy tale springs to life in an explosion of colour and sound, thanks to director Rob Reiner's genius. The performance of the lovely Robin Wright as Princess Buttercup is rivaled only by that of Andre the Giant's portayal of the ineminable Fezzik. In addition, the hilarious hijinks of Inigo Montoya as he wastes his life in a hopeless, drunken stupor can be enjoyed by children of all ages. This movie truly has the frivolity of Weekend at Bernie's 2 coupled with the intense malaise of Shaft Goes to Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic.

I get the green screen when trying to play my LEGALLY-PURCHASED DVD on an average DVD player hooked up to an average LCD TV. Since there is no way for a consumer to know whether this DVD will play on their home system, the best bet is to AVOID IT ALTOGETHER and read the book instead, or watch some previous DVD release that isn't tainted with this ANTI-CONSUMER technology.That said, this is an awesome movie.

I guess I didn't think much of it and took it home. When I actually opened the package, I saw that the corner of the box that encloses the dvd was damaged, and that the plastic lining the dvd cover looked warped. The only reason I didn't return it and demand my money back was because I am currently stationed overseas and don't really have access to send packages.

About a week ago a friend finally lent me her copy to watch and I must confess that I am quite disappointed.Now as a lightheart childrens comedy then the Princess Bride is good, but in the universal scheme of things I, not personally being a child anymore, consider it bad.

Don't waste your money on the movie, but i recommend reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet dreams.","review":"Children's story based on William Golding's tongue-in-cheek, wink-wink novel. The movie tries to have a similar feel to the book, with the result that it's pretty smart-allecky for children's entertainment . . . and yet, it's not really sophisticated enough to be considered \\"adult\\" entertainment, either. The problem for this may not be Rob Reiner's direction, but probably the source material. At any rate, tongue-in-cheek swashbucklers have been done to death in cinema, from the silent films of Fairbanks to Indiana Jones, and *The Princess Bride* adds little to what is already a stale repetoire of stunts and gags. Another demerit is the look of the picture: the sets are cheap, looking rather like settings for a TV program rather than a movie (Reiner's backgroud, of course, is TV, e.g., *All in the Family*). The static compositions, proscenium set-ups, and relentless close-ups also bespeak the work of an amateur from TV-Land. But whatever -- the kids'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fantastic family fairy tale...","review":"i really loved this film, not just for the underlying plot of romance or Cary Elwes, but it is funny, good for a laugh and truly moving at times. it's beautiful music help to create a wonderful magical atmosphere and by the end of the film you'll really wish that life was one long fairy story to lose yourself in forever..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie that brought back alot of memories","review":"i saw this movie way way back when it first came out, i enjoyed it then and my gf loved this movie so i figured i would surprise her with the bluray version, when we watchd it it had so many extras and the pic and audio was dead on, very nice job at remastering it, i love when companys actully know how to remaster old movies to up to date standards,"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie. Ever.","review":"After more than 20 years, The Princess Bride remains my favorite movie of all time. It isn't simply because of nostalgia and fond memories, either; I continue to watch this movie no fewer than once per year and it continues to amuse me to no end. The humor, action, romance, and best of all humor (oh, did I say that already?) are top-notch and timeless. The only thing that hasn't been able to stand up over time is the 80s hair, but we can forgive that thanks to all of the film's other numerous virtues.You should own this movie. Watch it regularly.

The movie, while not perhaps, manages to pretty much pull off the same trick, and create a story that's enjoyable for everyone from young children (though perhaps not *too* young) to the most jaded adult.Mandy Patinkin's Ingo Montoya is an absolutely unforgettable character- no one having seen the film will ever forget his \\"My name is Ingo Montoya- you killed my father, and now I am going to kill you!\\". Christopher Guest's Count Rugen is so evil he makes Basil Rathbone's Sir Guy of Gismont seem like a pussycat.

I'm glad I only rented the first DVD, now I can buy the SE and add it to our family favorites shelf at home. This is one of the rare movies that the whole family can watch and enjoy together, with no concern with inappropriate language or content, or the now-pervasive toilet \\"humor\\".

I think I could have nightmares about this movie, it's that bad. The acting is terrible, and it's completely fake. The princess's tumble down the hill after her love is incredibly retarded.

It is cringeworthy on many levels, you'll just be waiting an eternity for some scenes to be OVER, already.And the lack of extras on the DVD doesn't justify the DVD price.Caution--if you believe this is a kids' movie...it really isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"People find this FUNNY?","review":"I've had to sit/sleep/complain my way through this thing two times more than I should have. (I've seen this movie, oddly enough, twice) I can't comprehend why so many people find this sort of low-brow humor amusing. (I guess the same geniouses who went to see Dumb and Dumber) I really hated that short little snot whose only claim to fame was being on Murphey Brown. (whoop) The quality of direction sort of reminds me of something I could have done with a home video camera, a bath tub, and a couple of toy boats. (I mean, come on! How many of you REALLY believed that was a full-sized ship they showed during the water scenes?

Considering it was released in 1987, that says something.The movie is tight; every line, every shot, every pause is there for a reason. There are no slow boring parts. The cast is flawless, everyone excellent, the perfect representation of their characters. The characters themselves are well-developed, despite this being a fairy tale.The story has everything. It's hilarious, full of adventure, and has romance and drama too. You don't even miss the latest special effects; the out of date obviously fake effects work well with the overall character of the moving. What could you possibly want that it doesn't have?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Been in my top 5 since I saw open in theaters","review":"Great movie. Quotes out the yin yang.

It combines every aspect of a movie, with an overall fantasy plot, into a dazzling masterpiece. This may also be its weakness - in order to appeal to a wide audience, the movie isn't a strict comedy, drama, etc. This movie is a REAL CLASSIC, and is one of the few truly outstanding films of the 20th century.

For all of you DVD collectors who are fed up with these re-re-releases, write to MGM and the other movie companies, tell them you're sick of it, and tell them you aren't buying their products anymore. There's no reason this, Patton, The Magnificent Seven, Airplane... just to name a few, should be reissued, with one or two little stupid extras. If the consumers are playing fair, why shouldn't these companies? After all, they have the gall to put ads against piracy before the movies on some of their DVD's?

A killer cast, great scenery, wonderful plot, spellbinding music - everything combines to make the kind of accomplishment that too few people know about today.No amount of flashy effects and pop songs can make a good children's movie for adults.

Another reviewer here said there were fewer features than on the \\"special edition\\", but then how have they made 2 discs? Does it have cast and/or director commentary, and a making-of? Cary Elwes video diary sounds interesting too. Please, Amazon - or some helpful reviewer - let me know what I will be getting so I don't waste my money on something I already have!

(not to mention a REALLY CUTE hero!!-sarah"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While the movie rates 5 stars, this edition of the DVD is a poor offering for a 20th anniversary edition. The text for the menus is incredibly tiny and hard to read, and the special features are seriously lacking compared with the 2006 Dread Pirate/Princess Buttercup editions. The Art of Fencing featurette is covered in the 2006 edition, really, and the Fairy Tales and Folklore one has an equivalent in the 2006 DVD as well. Only the Untold Tales Featurette is new, and it's only--like all 3 of these--about 8 minutes long.It's a must-have film for every DVD library, but do yourself a favor and get the 2006 Dread Pirate or Princess Buttercup release with the additional features, because the 3 featurettes on this DVD just aren't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody has seen this DVD version yet","review":"The Princess Bride on DVD! This is the most romantic, exciting, funny, and grab-your-interest/hold-on-tight movie of our generation. With tongue firmly planted in cheek, Goldman's story is delivered by the perfect cast, making the characters believable in an unbelievably quotable film. Heart-breaking that Andre has gone to that wrestling arena in the sky, alas Buttercup's Baby may never see Silver Screen. Buy this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply one of the best","review":"I've loved this movie since I was young and it only gets better with age. The characters are incredible, the writing is brisk and witty, and the jokes never get tired. Billy Crystal steals the show, which is impressive given how amazing all the other actors are. This movie is great for families, teens, young adults, and anyone who has ever heard a fairy tale. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Movie!","review":"I have watched this movie countless times and it never gets old! My whole family finds themselves quoting lines from the movie and sitting down with popcorn every night to watch it! Westley is so cool, Inigo is funny, Buttercup is cool, Fezzik is cool, Humperdink is an ... and hilarious name, and I love this movie! As soon as we bought a DVD player I bought this DVD! Don't pass up this wonderful family movie! It is the coolest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairy Tale","review":"The Princess Bride can be quite possibly the best example of a modern fairy tale amongst movies made in the last few decades. This story displays every element of a fairy tale. Possibly the most common and most celebrated element of this movie is the love existing between Wesley and Buttercup. Like most every other fairy tale, The Princess Bride revolves around the improbable love between a young couple. This love is characterized by their famous love pledge \\"as you wish\\". The next element covered is the element of danger. There is much sword fighting as well as hand to hand combat. Like in all fairy tales, the young hero must battle the evil forces. A third element that surfaces is a villain. What good is a fairy tale without a villain? Apart from these three elements this movie includes comedy, adventure, and intrigue. Lighthearted comedy is provided in this movie by the late Andre the Giant. This delightful modern fairy tale is widely viewed as a masterpiece and will be enjoyed by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kids' movie ever, and fun for adults too","review":"Simply the best kids' movie ever. It has lots of adventure, interesting characters, and beautiful scenery and sets. It is decidedly not saccharine. It has plenty of appeal for adults as well, but without all the sleazy double entendres. I loathe Disney movies because they are so uniformly Royalist sub-textually, so it's an added delight that, despite the title, it's about a couple of commoners. My 10 year-old son didn't want to watch it because - hey - the title has both _princess_ and _bride_ in it, but asked to see it a second time the next day, and declared it is the second-best movie he's seen, right after \\"Up\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent Humor for All Age Groups","review":"Great movie! Like the old cartoons, this movie can be enjoyed by people of any age. The little ones will love the action and romance, and the adults will enjoy the subtle and not so subtle humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Revamped","review":"My family happened to catch this classic on TV, and my son would not stop asking to watch it again.

It is a fantastic movie that is timeless. But the DVD is deplorable.The 20th Anniversary Edition falls short. The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because of the fact that the movie is on the DVD, at least. Am I crazy for thinking that for the 20th Edition all the extras on the past DVDs should be able to make it onto the ultra anniversary edition? There are a few select special features, but nothing to shake a stick at. The behind the scenes and everything from the past few editions are all gone and that's ridiculous!I would reccommend the original Special Edition if you want to get the most out of the DVD. That one at least has the best Special Features. But, until they decide to treat \\"The Princess Bride\\"'s fans right and put everything into one compilation, don't bother throwing your money at the DVD. Hopefully they will do it right just in time for the 25th anniversary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Book!","review":"I loved the movie to death!

The queen of filth...\\" I know like the entire movie by heart, word for word! It's a great movie and everyone should see it at least once in their lifetime. I just love when Princess Buttercup says, \\"Wesley and I are joined by the bonds of love and you can not break that, not with a thousand swords, and you can not track that, not with a thousands hounds. So when I say you are a coward that is only because you are the weakest coward ever to crawl the face of this earth!\\", and then Prince Humperdink goes, \\"I would not say such things if I were you!\\" I love it, I love it, I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It deserves 10000000000 stars!!!!!!!","review":"I swear this movie and book are definitely the best ever made!

Even for those people whose hearts have been hardened against love, this will make a romantic out of you. While the plot may seem a bit clichéd, this is well-executed by the brilliant acting of Carey Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, and the late André the Giant; the truly inspired directing of Rob Reiner; and the incredible writing of the script make this film truly timeless and great. Finally, the humor in it is well-timed and on the mark.I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special movie","review":"When my husband and I first met we watched this movie with some friends.

But you may want to wait before buying it on DVD. Let me explain ...This DVD has NO extras. It is simply a bare-bones, non-anamorphic release, and one that is only marginally better than the laserdisc or VHS in picture and sound quality. Before you run out to buy this disc, you should know that MGM is currently working on a special edition DVD of this film, with anamorphic widescreen for release NEXT year. That means if you are a fan of the film, as I am, you are going to have to buy it again next year to get the better DVD.Why would MGM release it now as a bare-bones disc at all, you ask? MONEY.

It's now on Blu-ray, but there's little need to watch it in hi-def. The movie was low budget and it stands out because of its writing and comedy rather than its visuals. Most of the scenery is forgettable, and very little effort was made to show it off. The medieval castle and costumes look good, but they also look good in standard definition.

Just him saying the rhymes with Inigo should have been enough. You will be able to incorporate the classic lines, especially those by Vizzini, Westley, Inigo, and, well, everybody into your everyday speech and keep yourself if not everybody else in stitches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the naysayers, true love really does conquer all.","review":"I am always a bit curious as to why people with no emotional depth or imagination take the time to write negative reviews of movies like this, as a few have done here. Those reviewers that liked the movie have already analyzed it to death so I will not go there. As someone who enjoys virtually all genres of film, I will just say that The Princess Bride occupies a rare niche: it is a movie that every member of the family can watch and enjoy again and again; laugh and giggle and feel a warm glow by the time it is all over. It is silly, idealistic and unbelievable and it appeals to the child in all of us who still connect with that part of ourselves. And when your kids or grand-kids say, \\"Can we watch it again, please?\\" (for even the Dread Pirate Roberts says, \\"please\\") you will always be happy to reply, \\"As you wish\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films I've seen.","review":"Simply put, this is one of the most clever, witty, and entertaining films I've ever seen. It's one that will always have a place of honor in my collection; it's more like a stage show than a full scale cinematic production, but that fact adds to it's charm I think.This is one of those films that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, young and old alike. I grew up on this film, and now as an adult, I enjoy some of the more subtle comedy on an entirely different level than when I was younger, and it never loses it's appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous Fun for the Family....","review":"This film is so creative and entertaining.

It has everything: Romance, castles, swordfights, danger, and the strong message that true love can be found. Don't ignore the kiddie title. It's a tale adults need to hear more often. The book from which it is based is a masterpiece, eventhough it was not a bestseller in America. Beautifully done, I think it's possibly the best romance novel ever written. The film was excellent in casting, location and musical score. You've gotta buy the soundtrack !

I also had a divorce once. Her depictions of both of these events was so spot on that I didn't know whether to cry or cheer. I loved this book. The main character, Verna, is so naive in some ways that she makes you afraid for her, but you also are solidly on her side. The ending was upbeat and also true to life.

They fall away from religion and get a divorce, and she leaves to try and find herself as she roams over California and Mexico. If this subject matter sounds interesting to you then you could very well enjoy it more then I did. The pace was a bit slow and many situations void of the emotional thunder I usually enjoy in a book.However, not everyone likes what I do, so thus the suggestion of interest.If you are anxious to try this author, or interested in unorthodox Mormon fiction, then I suggest \\"Red Water\\" which Freeman takes an unapologetic and sacreligious look at polygomy, the churches early practice of plural marraige."},{"rating":"1","title":"An honest, but depressive book with a hurried ending.","review":"The story is a very honest, depressing, and painfully detailed description of one woman's journey through childhood and youth in Utah and a mid-life attempt to flee the banality of her life by heading for California.

When I lived in Kenya, it was much easier for me to gain fluency in the language because I had read this book before hand.

Sorry, it falls far short of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work. Advanced vocabulary but choppy story line. It feels like a big story jammed into a small book. Characters are one-sided and undeveloped.

It even keeps track of the score.For those of you who have exhausted the cards and don't want to keep buying more might find the electronic version to your liking.

This particular story does not have likeable, interesting characters. (In most works of Dickens, the characters are incredibly unique and intriguing. They draw the reader into their world.)2. The actor playing the lead character, Martin Chuzzlewit, comes across the screen as incredibly boring. I couldn't decide if the problem was the character being played or the actor himself, but, I found myself fast-forwarding quite often.3. There were no redeeming set locations or supporting roles to make it worthwhile to watch. The whole production was just one long and boring drama.So sorry, Charles Dickens!

Parts 1,2, and 3 were neither on the single disc, nor on any other!!!It is certainly disappointing to me, a steady customer of Amazon.com and its DVDs, that there is no quality control over the product, and indeed not a soul or a voice to receive a complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing acting brings this tale to light","review":"What can truly be said of this magnificent adaptation of MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT is that the incredible ensemble of fine veteran actors makes this Dickens classic leap from the page.Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs.Gamp and Emma Chambers as Charity Pecksniff particularly made me laugh with glee as well as caused such a deep sense of respect for these wonderful ladies of the theatre.The entire cast is absolutely over the top in all ways.Truly one of the most enjoyable adaptations of anything brought to the screen.You must pay careful attention to the low English slang used by some of the characters.It can be a bit dodgey for these American ears.BUY THIS.THIS IS A KEEPER."},{"rating":"1","title":"BessWentworth","review":"While the sets, costuming and lighting were indeed gorgeous, the director dwelt almost entirely on Paul Scofield's witheringly biting delivery and on the comicality of different Dicken's characters.

Style won over warmth, and halfway through this beautiful and lavish production, it's lack of real heart simply drove me away. I tried and tried, but just couldn't slog my way through.

To be frank, I think it should be called a Bored game. It has a somewhat complicated game mechanism, with cards that you play to \\"morph\\" and affect the game. However, every time you play it, it's pretty much the same, and it relys too much on chance. I have foung it to be more challenging by distributing the morph cards so that you pick them up as you go around. I realize that Animorphs is also read by 7-10 year olds, and this is who the game is geared to. I am a 13 year old fan of Animorphs, and there are many older fans out there.

The author has worked only with children, and seems most involved with finding a way for school and child to fit together. In this search she has found and understood many differences between Asperger and neuro-typical approach to situations, and these are explained very well and non-judgmentally. This material is available elsewhere but it is always valuable to have many people's description of something that is subjective or perceptual. The author clearly makes the connection between children struggling in school with undisguised Asperger traits and adults in the families with slightly lesser or compensated Asperger traits. But she doesn't delve into addressing Asperger traits in adulthood (where there is a greater ability to work at change purposefully) The authors love of Asperger children is evident, but she clearly herself stands with the neuro-typicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Horrible.

Instead of writing in a more realistic manner he chooses to glorify gang life. he compromises the information because before long he is caaught up in trying to fit into this particular group. The authors objective when writing this type of an anthropological look at this group is to try to live among this group and observe their way of life. I think most people are aware that poverty has a way of making people lose all hope for any future outside the barrio. This is not to say that it\\"s impossible but looking at it realistically one has to know that it extremely difficult, and that few are able to make it out to a \\"normal life\\".

Overall, fans of the series probably already know everything in the book, but it's still a neat accompanyment if only as a book filled with visuals and concept drawings from the series.

There is a reason why Wall Street Journal called Paste the 'Best American Music Magazine.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not much about music anymore","review":"I subscribed to this magazine back in the first years of print. Have been off/on with for the many years since. Kept wanting to believe it was about the music but through the years it has become more political than about the music. They would also focus on artists that were of the political bent consistent with their beliefs who are of no interest to me.I would get sucked back in with covers of the Beatles, Led Zepplin etc., and after a few subsequent issues would become disappointed again and cancel the subscription. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappoint","review":"Rolling Stone has been going downhill for some time now.

What, they don't even play music anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"This rag is pathetic","review":"Over the years I have read thousands of music magazines. Rolling Stone never fails to be the lamest rag. This magazine jumps on every weak fad like it's a gift from God and the next big thing. They interview uninteresting people, ignore stars and bands that have survived 10, 20, or even 30 years, and make huge deals out of one hit wonders who will disappear in six months. I am proud to say I resent everything this magazine stands for. Go buy a Hit Parader or Metal Edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rollingstone","review":"It is (or was) a music magazine, right? So why is it the magazine relies more heavily on celebrity-watch, supposed political expose', and that ham-fisted Peter Travers movies section? Do yourself a favor.

Thompson and cover photography are/were its only claim to fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"old issues sent","review":"I am not reviewing the content of the magazine - rather I have issue with the fact that once I purchased the subscription I got in the mail 3 older issues - as if they had extras that didn't sell and took my subscription as an opportunity to unload old unsold issues. I surely wasn't interested in the issue from 2 nor 3 months ago.Poor service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Magazine, bad start to subscription","review":"I enjoy Rolling Stone magazine so no complaints there. What really annoys me is that my subscription started with three past issues all received on the same day, and my start date listed as the first old issue.I realize that this is a great way to for a magazine publisher to unload back issues that they wouldn't normally be able to sell, but I had been buying them at the newstand so they were worthless to me. I've written a letter to their subscription department requesting a remedy, but this practice is not appropriate for a music magazine that supposedly carries current news."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll put it simply...","review":"Rolling Stone Magazine lost any credibility it once had due to the 2003 \\"Greatest Guitar Players of All Time\\". Also, don't even get me started on its ill attempts at being politically savy. 1-star is being quite generous.

I use to read Rolling Stones to discover about bands I didn't know. Now is all about what you've seen or smell everywhere else. Nothing new, usually, is happening here. If you need to know about entertainment, that's what Rolling Stones covers now, get an Entertainemnt Weekly subscription, it's less bulky. Britney Spears on the cover...for christ sakes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to look forward to receiving it","review":"but that was years ago. I got a subscription not too long ago at a great price. Not worth it. It is full of ad's and a lot of the information on artists has hit the web several weeks before the magazine even gets to print & is very 'gossipy' - you can get 'gossipy' online free at various sites, if that is what you are into. I think that you are better off picking up a copy at a store and looking it over first. I really cannot recommend that enough. The album review section is still OK as the Billboard charts, but again, you can get all that info online WAY before Rolling Stone even gets it to print. I am not renewing my subscription either. Waste of time & money."},{"rating":"1","title":"..if you're a 50-something liberal white guy","review":"... if you're a 50-something Blue state white man, this is the magazine for you. If you think Bob Dylan is the most important artist of all time, Hunter S. Thomspon is the best writer, percussive-heavy music gives you a headache and sampling confuses you, and a half-naked Paris Hilton or Simpson sister turns you on, this magazine understands you perfectly. Otherwise it's like hanging out with your dad's friends who're trying to convince you they're still cool. I wish my subscription would hurry up and lapse already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rolling Stone has HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!","review":"I love Rolling Stone. It's in an oversized format, has great in-depth articles, and one of the world's great film critics, Peter Travers. Having said that, I have to say their \\"customer service\\" is the WORST. I am a subscriber and from time to time, for whatever reason, an issue doesn't make it to my mailbox. When I've contacted them about it I swear to god I'm talking to space aliens. When I've missed an issue, I want it REPLACED with the UNDELIVERED issue. So what happens? I won't bore you with the details, but I'll just say nobody there understands English; getting issues resolved is like pulling teeth with them. I am convinced Rolling Stone has contracted their customer service department to some third-party. Either that or RS truly doesn't give a damn about taking care of their subscribers.

There is no longer anything to seperate this rag from YM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter crap","review":"Rolling Stone takes itself way too seriously. It's a magazine about the entertainment industry. At least \\"Us\\" and \\"People\\" know their limits.Beyond that, they've turned into complete pop journalism. Their stories are stale and the topics have been covered by other magazines months or years before them.For example, at the time of the writing of this review, Dec. 2003, the cover has Brittney on it. \\"Brittney Who?\\" I have to ask. Her career is already on the decline, and Rolling Stone features her half-nude on the cover.Let's ignore the up and coming bands with talent, let's ignore the state of the music scene. Instead, let's indulge in pop journalism and try to write unskilled articles about politics and other things that have nothing to do with music.When I want news, I'll read the NYT or the WSJ.

Get your money back and subscribe to Classic Rock Magazine. It's a UK import so it's more expensive, but worth every penny. Never have I waited in anticipation so much for a new issue to come out so I could read it cover to cover.

Having been a subscriber for close to three decades, off and on, I find myself at odds with the direction of the magazine as well as the artists covered.While I am a firm supporter of liberal ideas, I do think the mag's overly leftist stance alienates a major segment of potential readers. More varied opinions would allow the magazine to broaden its clientele.Also, if one wants to see \\"flesh\\", he/she would pick up a Playboy or Playgirl, don't you think?

His writing style is just so annoying. He thinks he's witty but it's simply unbearable.

Yeah, you heard me, the best cd of 96 (according to me and many other people) got worst cd of the year in 1996 by Rolling Stone. And today its only getting worse.

I am just as much into music now as I was then (and maybe even more now). The cover stories have seemed to have strayed from talented musician to the popular vote of today's Tiger Beat star or reality show star. The reviews of the music are pitiful and could not be more off. I just do not enjoy it any more. I stopped my subscription over a year ago.I was browsing Amazon when I saw how poorly rated this magazine was and thought \\"wow, I'm not alone\\".Maybe it's just the poor state of music today.

With the exception of Frick's Picks they mostly review radio friendly albums marketed by large record companies that nobody will care about in a year. In addition most of the political coverage is either biased or poorly researched.I understand Rolling Stones desire to remain relevant by covering artists that will only have fleeting success, but they've gone too far in an effort to just sell magazines. They've sacraficed their ability to have any long term influence on the music industry and become simply a mirror of the reality show driven and celebrity obsessed pop culture that currently exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I Could give It 0 stars I would","review":"What else can I say that other reviewers haven't said already? I can add that I used to love this magazine back in its heyday and when I read it, the publishers seem to care about music & serious subjects but instead we get lame synthetic pop thats forcefed to people and R.S. seems to be going along with it. In this case, I think the old adage \\"Let the buyer beware\\" fits epecially well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Stone! ok that was bad","review":"The only reason I am giving this magazine 2 stars is that the articles on music artists and movies are pretty strong. The thing that I mostly dislike of this magazine is that the CD reviews are horrible. Whoever reviews the CDs must listen to 5 seconds of each song and find the lyrics of one song to critique the whole album.I also do not like that the magazine only reviews the most popular albums of the time. If lesser-known and/or underground artists are not able to get their CD reviewed, they will never be put out to the public and the public will not be able to find new artists to listen to. I recommend a magazine strictly for music and music-related media, such as Blender, which is very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I subscribed to this magazine hoping that I would get some good exclusive news and interviews with good music artists.This magazine is very short and is filled with usually old and stuff you have already heard from TV news.

Everything in this magazine is very liberal anti-bush politics. They have a section in the magazine were an editor reflects on current world affairs, expect nothing but Bush and right wing bashing in this one.Interviews are horrible. Nothing exciting. Muisc reviews are not detailed and don't acctually review the album all to much.

They also had something to say and weren't afraid to speak their minds. Then they both sold out... In the late seventies the band made a disco album which ruined their entire career, and made an enemy out of me. When Kurt Cobain died in '94 the magazine became extremely corporate and just a lame rip-off of People (which is also terrible). That 100 greatest guitarists list was bulls**t. Van Halen at 70? I didn't see Cantrell and Tony Iommi (the greatest metal guitarist ever) was at 86! Kurt Cobain and Kirk Hammett (two extremely overrated and bland guitarists) were at 12 and 11! The rappers list also had that hypocrit Eminem (one minute he's a homophoeb, the next he's a homoSEXUAL) in their top 10.

It seemed like they were trying to become a teen magazine - cover stories on Clay Aiken and the Britney Spears are for Teen Beat, not RS. My beloved Rolling Stone was going downhill fast.Happily things have improved recently. Now some might argue they skew too much towards classic rock - but as an \\"old fogie\\" I guess that's fine with me. The political writing has been excellent lately also, mainly thanks to Matt Taibbi's phenomenal coverage of the financial meltdown and the criminal scams on Wall Street (and in Washington).I have always enjoyed Peter Travers' film reviews also, although I think there are probably better sources for music reviews online these days than RS.

I'm able to read it faster then I'm able to reach cognitive thought. The $10 I spent on this item was well worth it because it helped me to free up some space in my bank account without having to make space for an item in my house!This magazine is AMAZING and if you like to tell people \\"Yeah, I'm subscribed to Rolling Stone Magazine\\" but don't actually wish to read it then go through Amazon to get your subscription!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I still have yet to receive it","review":"I have not received my first issue as yet. I'm not happy you take my money then I have to wait so long to receive it? If this is the way you do business then maybe I need to cancel. I'm not impressed so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 month still not received it","review":"I placed my order over 1 month ago and have still not received an issue for September or October. Hopefully it will come soon and I'll get all 12 months. As of now I'm not satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rolling Stone magazine subscription","review":"I was given an incentive opportunity to purchase the famous and great magazine, Rolling Stone, 5 weeks ago and asked today to review my subscription. I would be happy to do so however as of this date, I have yet to receive my first copy. Pretty frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't understand what I purchased","review":"I had thought I was purchasing a 1 year subscription to Rolling Stone. So I spent 9.95 and rec'd nothing!Think I'll stick with buying books."},{"rating":"1","title":"feel like paying for a biweekly advertising brochure?","review":"one need only look at RS's recent \\"women of rock\\" cover to realize how far the mighty has fallen - a celebration of such corporate, novelty flash in the pans like \\"pink\\" and \\"avril lavigne\\" alongside majestic performers of yesteryear like aretha and joni mitchell. truly interesting, dues-paying artists like nelly furtado and kasey chambers got half-page side mentions in this issue; lavigne got several pages of pictures and long-winded interview / drivel.if you enjoy having your intelligence insulted on a routine basis, this is the magazine for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"More music than your average fashion magazine","review":"Oddly enough the best articles in Rolling Stone are the political ones. You can find those once you wade through the cigarette and alcohol ads, somewhere sandwiched in between a few random articles dealing with music. Not bad if you only like mainstream pop, but if you want real coverage of rock, pop, hip hop, electronica, indie, and even a decent look at americana and rock and roll history, try \\"Mojo\\". Sad that a british mag could cover American music better than Rolling Stone, but RS has just gone downhill. I look through back issues from the early 90's and find interesting articles in every issue, the type which now come along every 6 months or so now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage Magazine","review":"Well, I suppose if you enjoy articles on lengthy men's members, the hottest pot schools in the country and the bitterness of liberals, this is the magazine for you.I've had a subscription for a few years now and the coverage of music versus politics and social commentary has dwindled down into virtually nothing. I didn't get the rag for the anti-Bush crap and the apparent praise and worship of thugs such as G-Unit, 50 Cent and the like.At least they will give a little focus to upcoming bands and artists. A little.Oh, by the way, \\"Get Your War On\\" (the little annoying comic strip in every issue) is about as obnoxious as they come."},{"rating":"1","title":"fed up","review":"I did not order this damn f*ing subscription!

This is how they sell print magazines now in a digital world. It's an old trick and I should have known. If you want to take advantage of $1 deals you need to be vigilant to unsubscribe in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Understanding does not mean ....","review":"Understanding the lament that times change and RS has to change with the times in order to define the times .... doesnt bring any satisfaction in receiving a magazine with Justin whatever on the cover. I have never had so many times of barely being able to get through articles ... it does not hold interest ... there is a bridge out with RS and I will certainly not renew - I subscribed for many years and am a long way for being too old to rock and roll but the surface skimming pop drivel ... not feeling it ... platitudes and rationalizations aside it appears that we are at a parting of the ways... uh its not you ..its me ...I dont like you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just bad.","review":"It does make a good place to train you dog and/or cat.Also some of the pictures are in color."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Isn't it amazing that the cost of a Rolling Stone subscription is barely enough to cover the cost of postage? The magazine is mostly advertisements, and the rest of it isn't worth reading. I grew up on Rolling Stone, but have realized that if I want a decent music review about music I care about, I'll go to pitchforkmedia.com. Even SPIN is better than this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Occasional profoundness, but overall its a yawn","review":"I subscribed to Rolling Stone five years ago, but I have since let it run out because it started drifting away from feature stories about talented rock and hip-hop groups and started focusing more on Britney Spears and N-Sync. Whereas it used to offer quite remarkably in depth stories about the lives and work of real musicians, it has started to cater more towards the pop fluff of teeny boppers and bubblegum blasphemy. Every now and then I will see it on the newsstand with an article about Bruce Springsteen or Keith Richards, real musicians who have quality stories to tell, but the majority of what I find is useless. You'll be better off to limit yourself to an issue-by-issue basis as opposed to buying 26 issues at once. But like I said, it can still please every now and then. I just feel its quality stories are too few and far between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Rolling Stone of my youth, but that's okay","review":"I stopped reading Rolling Stone magazine shortly after the Kurt Cobain Tribute issue. My boycott had nothing to do with the driving force behind Nirvana, necessarily.Shortly after Cobain committed suicide, Frank Zappa - a truly gifted musical pioneer - died from cancer. Yet, there was no Tribute issue commissioned on his behalf. Instead, (if I remember correctly), he received a couple paragraphs buried in one corner of a page. I found this to be disrespectful, and I cancelled my membership.Well, there's been a lot of water under that bridge, and I now find myself back to where I once belonged. I missed keeping up with the latest bands and band releases.I still haven't quite forgiven them for dissing Zappa, or for when they named Sinead O'Connor Artist of the Year, but I'm working on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Rolling Stone is a humongous waste of ink and paper. I'm scared to take it to the restroom with me because then I'll be tempted to use it as toilet paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaay past it's shelf life","review":"What was once the go-to magazine for music has fallen so far off the mark that putting a bullet through it today would still not excise the last fifteen years of shilling fashion and celebretards. Zero credibility these days...much like an athlete hanging on way past his prime and embarassing himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cancelled my subscribtion","review":"I did not realize when ordering that rolling stone doesn't have much to do with entertainment or music anymore. It turned out to be just another liberal newspaper. Not a magazine for music lovers as it was in the time past!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boycotting Rolling Stone","review":"Wenner Media, the owner of this magazine, is responsible for shameless attacks on Sarah Palin and obvious bias in journalism. I, for one, won't be buying anything associated with Wenner Media. If they go bankrupt, it's their own fault and rightly deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Best Music Mag","review":"Rolling Stone is and will always be an American icon. It delivers great music coverage, lots of interesting interviews and original features. I notice that people complain about the popstars on the cover - the bottom line is that RS represents and covers today's music scene. If people don't like Usher or Britney Spears then they should stop buying their albums and then maybe they wouldn't make the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why","review":"Why send me an offer that doesn't apply out side of the U.S.A ?You know I live in Australia fder fek sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"pop culture \\"lick my nuts\\"","review":"first of all justin whats his face isn't black you cracker. and You think that band like Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan are lame. have you ever heard of the pop culture bandwagon because you have jumped on it. the only thing that britney spears is good for is looking at, if you want to hear good music find a ac/dc or van halen cd. as for rolling stones mag its jumped on the band wagon with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puhleezzzz","review":"When, oh WHEN will Britney twig to the fact that \\"That Kiss\\" was a cynical attempt to ruin her career?(mind you, for once I may actually be in support of the ever nasty Madonna on that one)Britney dear, at least find a publicist with some brains.Rolling Stone, if only you had retired while still at the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame........","review":"This use to be the best music mag out there, with its great music info, reviews, and updates about big music news, but now.......now its just about selling the cover. It lacks the information, news, etc that made this mag sell like crazy. Now they just make a nice, \\"hot\\", glossy cover~expecting to get stupid people who dont actually read the mag to buy this.This \\"new age\\" of the mag, has really shamed its old good name. Any good review in this mag has lost its worthiness, at least for one old fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer a voice","review":"Wow, after being away for about ten years, I came back to find it's become People Magazine. The same thing that happened to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, happened to this magazine.

Goodbye forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe itll get better again??","review":"The only reason I'm still a subscriber to Rolling Stone is because when i got it, it was a lifetime subscription for 100$.

Unfortunately, it seems to have degenerated into a sad mixture of half-baked politics, overblown hype for new movies, silly fluff about \\"artists\\" like Britney Spears, and ads, ads, ads. In fact, \\"Rolling Stone\\" is now about as relevant and meaningful as \\"Tiger Beat\\" was in its day. Do you enjoy reading about trendy \\"stars\\" who will be forgotten by this time next year? Do you like to read article-length advertisements for the latest product from Hollywood? How about some ill-informed, poorly-composed political commentary? Are you fond of being bombarded with page after page of advertisements? If so, today's \\"Rolling Stone\\" is for you. If you are seeking worthwhile material about musicians and their music, look elsewhere - \\"Rolling Stone\\" has sold out."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is zero stars when you need it","review":"Listen, if you want to read a magazine based on music,don't get this.

I wish you could chose the size you wanted to get, like Readers Digest. I wasn't happy when they cut the size of this magazine, because I really liked it that way. I stopped getting Rolling Stone for about a year, because of the size increase, but I realized that's not why I shouldn't stop reading such a great magazine. I think Rolling Stone has great articles. The subscription is alright, I get issues in the mail before they are on newsstands sometimes, and that's great. I wish Rolling Stone would have better, and more reviews on new music releases. I think Rolling Stone is worth $20 a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too political and way too liberal.","review":"This magazine has become a platform for anything way, way liberal.

What was once an interesting magazine about music and musicians...is now just a trashy tabloid.

What a waste and what a downward spiral to witness. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the magazine, hate customer service","review":"I have been a subscriber for 15 years and still enjoy the magazine. No, its not the best magazine for music, but it is one of the best for for general pop culture news and I still occassionally find new artists because of the magazine, though I tend to find more new movies now.However, if you ever have a problem with customer service, forget it. I never got my copy of the 1,000 issue, and when I asked for a replacement, I was told they were out of that issue, but would extend my subscription by one issue. I pointed out that it was a double issue AND that they are still selling back issues on their web site for $20. If they don't resolve it quick, I might just cancel my subscription, I'm so disgusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex sells, but are we forgetting the music??","review":"Rolling Stone magazine has almost completely lost touch with what the music scene is all about. Pop culture will always be what most people want to read about, but what about the real revolutionaries? There is cutting edge, genre defining music being made everyday by bands who need to be given the chance to be recognized. Rollingstone mag. has become yet another publication (like the new Blender music mag) to feature beautiful people and their often times simple music. Here's a suggestion RS, sell your gorgeous pictures of sexy artists to Hollywood. I'm interested in reading meaningful reviews on musicians, not entertainers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shadow Of What It Was","review":"Don't bother, devoid of anything that doesn't have a corporate label attached"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected Better","review":"Here were the cover stories for 3 of the 6 issues that I recieved. Pink Floyd, The Beatles, and Nirvana. Talk about 3 horses that have been beaten to death. There is NOTHING current about this magazine, nothing cutting edge. If music had a history channel, this would be it, only they talk about stuff everyone knows already. They are in need of serious changes in the CEO level of this magazine, or i can see it going under in the next 10 years. The 60's are over, the 70's are over, the 90's are over, Rollng Stone needs to roll its calendar over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rolling Stone....old","review":"I'm not sure why when my first issue arrived, two previous issues arrived as well.

Also, they signed me up for another auto renewewal. I canceled and I got a refund, but I do not like that auto renewal at all. The magazine was not for me. I have two teenagers at home who love music so I got this, but there is a lot of swearing in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really two magazines...","review":"As an entertainment magazine, Rolling Stone is still fun and occasionally fresh, if rarely cutting edge.As a political magazine however, most of the articles and editorials read like sanctimonious rants from an overzealous, know-it-all freshman poly-sci major. To say that it's a left leaning magazine is to understate the obvious. But the insanely over-the-top invective in many of their articles is just downright unprofessional."},{"rating":"1","title":"how the mighty have fallen","review":"When I was in high school in the mid to late 80s, Rolling Stone was single-handedly responsible for getting me into a lot of the bands I loved then and still love today. Now, well, honestly, its just a bunch of crap. They seem to aspire to being some kind of subsidiary of tiger beat, with its emphasis on Brittany Spears, Justin Timberlake, and every other crap pop band out there. It would have been much better for the Stone if they had called it quits soon after the grunge explosion of the early nineties...at least they could have retired with dignity and class. The direction they have moved in now is truly unforgiveable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad...","review":"I am a huge fan of music... Rolling Stone no longer is the cutting-edge music magazine it once was... If you enjoy pop music, then this is a wonderful magazine for you. If you enjoy a diverse look at music that is happening now, and just enjoy music as an art form (i.e. musicians, not dancers with an attached microphone), then this is NOT the magazine for you. I wish Rolling Stone would go back to its glory days of rebellious writing and stop kissing the diamond rings of the rich and talentless...

Interviews, music and film reviews, political commentary, etc. Sounded like a good magazine.Then I started to read it. First off, the magazine is incredibly light on content; half of the pages are ads, and the many of the rest are filled with photos. For a monthly magazine, there is not enough text.The political commentary is left-wing. Depending on your political views, this is either a good or a bad thing, but even if you are a liberal, most of the writing isn't articulated very well, and just comes across as super-biased blabber.There is the occasional good article, and there are good writers on staff (film critic Peter Travers is exceptional), but when my subscription ended, I was more than ready to be done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"what an experience","review":"i read some of the negative reviews and am not sure these people actually read the magazine.

For the longest time they actually talked about music (Like when MTV used to play music). Now it seems to be marketed toward the Teen Beat crowd. If you love the Jonas Brothers and Adam Lambert, this is your magazine. Occasionally they still have a good article or two. Expect lots of stories about Nick Lachey and that dork married to Britney Spears. Also be aware that Rolling Stone thinks that the Jonas Brothers are on par with the Beatles. The last 20 issues I read ALL had an article about the Jo-Bros.This once great magazine is now horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad they care less about music and more about what they think may be cool","review":"I read rolling stone for the music and those who make it, not for some guilt ridden, agenda blasting editorial team that feels their politics (and guilt at being so much the establishment they wish they could hate) is something we should all read about at nauseum. when they stick to music, it's good, when they parade their shreiking political views, it's boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRING ME THE HEAD OF JANN S.

Before MTV and Crap Channel killed rock n' roll, Stationary Pebble put it on life support. Don't believe what your parents tell you kids, it was poorly written drivel in the 60's, and it's even worse now. Except in the 60's and 70's it was the only way you could really keep up on what was happening in pop culture.

Rolling Stone used to be good, but now it's really, really bad. The musicians they write about are weak. What happened? They used cover great artists like Lennon and Dylan. But nowadays they keep hyping up annoying people like M&M and Justin Timberlake. Besides you can't barely get thru the magazine because there are too many ads. I remember Rolling Stone when it had the best writers like Cameron Crowe and Ben Fong Torres, but now they are long gone. It's sad because this was once the best magazine out there. Now I don't recognize it anymore. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dream is over....","review":"At the age of 12, it was my dream to write for Rolling Stone magazine.

Don't believe the hype on the dvd cover sleeve which says that the film is loaded with nudity. There is very little and no frontal- everyone keeps their privates hidden. The story is also over the top and unbelievable. How could so many students just disappear from College without anyone wondering where they are. The film is overlong at 2 hours and also boring.When you can't write a decent story just pad it out with excessive violence as is the case here.truly a worthless film.Doesn't the director know that less is more.

There are aspects of David Lynch's work I enjoy very very much, and aspects that just annoy and/or bore me. I thought highly of Eraserhead and the Elephant Man, and the Twin Peaks that I've seen, enjoyed Lost Highway and Dune, was lukewarm on Blue Velvet, and just flat-out disliked this one, Wild At Heart. I tried hard to find something interesting and/or rewarding in it, but the struggle was in vain. Of the two stars I give it, one is there just for at least being original and unusual, and the other is there for a couple of genuinely hilarious lines. But on the whole this film seems painfully vapid and artless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overrated","review":"David Lynch has always made interesting films. Well, besides this one. I really can't see anything in this film that holds me to the screen the way Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, etc can.I'd say people should at least rent this one, maybe they'd like it. But I suggest renting one of Lynch's other works first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess I'm confused","review":"I'm noticing most of the reviews are rave.

Now that brings me to Wild at Heart,what a dogs breakfast of a movie, with possibly 2 of the least compelling characters I have ever seen on film.I dont know what bored me more,Dern & Cages hammy over acting, their yawn inducing love making or their constant inhaling of disgusting cigarette smoke! The scripting of this turkey was dire,the other characters repulsive especially Defoes horrble Mr.Peru! The only character that had any decency was the one played by the always reliable Harry Dean Stanton.The icing on this horrible cake was the inane & idiotic references to The wizard of Oz, what an insult to a classic.Mr.Lynch I still love you but this movie is something I abhor & now the copy I bought is land fill somewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie -- Terrible DVD Transfer","review":"This is one of my favorite movies.

The acting was somewhat descent but the script has got to go. \\"The Exorcist\\" was 100% better and those who haven't seen \\"The Exorcist\\" and choose to see this instead because you can't stand to watch old movies, you should be shot.

There were times when you were amazed by the sheer beauty of a shot, but that was soon eclipsed by overpowering music, graphic violence or sporatic camera movement.There were far too many holes in the plot, very few if any questions are ever answered.

His exact words were \\"Make Mary leave us, for females don't deserve life.\\" In fact they only use a small portion of the actual gospel, because it is the only part that gives a moral interpretation of jesus.

The pace of the movie was really slow, so you kept on waiting to see if there is any more to this movie other than watching Pat Arquette going through this spiritual agony. Yawn...Well guess what? There is nothing more. This movie was glorified by \\" The Exorcist\\" and that is how it made it's money.

She is strong and gritty, and sweet and vulnerable. She just knows how to convey emotions on screen, like no other actor can. And her scream...comes from her womb, not her head...so bllod curtling. Gabriel Byrne is also well utilized here, presenting strength here...we can see he is a human as well, not just a hero. if you want to think, if you want to be scared, if you want to be entertained and have something to talk about, see Stigmata. watch out fot the attack scenes...the most startling scenes ever shot on film...you feel as if you are being crucified!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Flick","review":"Somewhat panned by \\"professional\\" reviewers-- I just as soon as take the advice of those doing reviews here.

It claims that the Church is nothing more than brainwashing people into thinking that the only way to heaven is through them. this movie actually rips on all organized Christian religions, but especially Catholicism. Even non-Catholics should be outraged at this movie for ripping on Catholics, after-all, if a movie did nothing but rip on Blacks or Jews would we not boycott that movie, of course, so why not with Catholics? Lets write letters to the studio that made this and tell them we are going to boycott their garbage from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A forgetable religious/possession flick.","review":"The characters were uninspired, the story was full of holes (why didn't Patricia's mother become possessed since she first obtained the rosary?), and the ending felt really rushed. Despite a few good, scary posession scenes, this is an overall boring film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Script","review":"This movie was pretty lame, mostly because of the script. Not a very interesting story and not well told. Furthermore, Arquette is really not a very good actor. The Omen and the Exorcist are the leaders in this genre... Stigmata doesn't warrant your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"I never intended to see this movie. I rented it, out of boredom on a Saturday afternoon. Only because I love Gabriel Byrne. I was stunned! A very intense film. I'm now quite sad that I didn't see it in a theater. Beautifully done!FYI though, folks. This film came out when the \\"Gospel of Thomas\\" was all the rage. Please note, the Gospel of Thomas says women do not get into heaven. Jesus tells Peter he will turn Mary Magdalen into a MAN so she can gain heaven. Understand now why it this heretical \\"gospel\\" did not make it into official canon?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trashed by reviewers unjustly","review":"Stigmata may not make it to the hall of fame as the scariest movie of all time, but it did have enough action and special effects to keep you quite riveted. Despite some of the throwback nods towards \\"The Excorcist\\" in some scenes, overall I enjoyed this far more than the Sixth Sense which was grossly over rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget everything you've been taught about religion. . . .","review":"I found this to be a fantastic, highly intelligent movie. Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne were totally believable. This makes you wonder about the religion that has been shoved down our throats for all these years. I highly recommend this movie for anyone, whether religious, or questioning where you stand on your belief. This puts the power of God where it belongs. . . not necessarily in the multi-million dollar shrines people call churches. I will watch this one again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Supposed to be a horror/thriller. Intstead it's just silly.","review":"Despite a good performance by Patricia Arquette, cast as a working-class hairdresser in Pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a souvenir and somehow experiences Christ's wounds, this film is a loser. The subject itself might have been intriguing if it was anyway near what Catholic theology actually is, but the filmmaker got it all mixed up and targeted the film towards the outrageous and impossible. There's supposed to be a conspiracy to keep Christ's words from the faithful and there's also some sort of satanic possession going on which keeps the special effects people busy. Gabriel Byrne plays the priest who tries to help her and also is attracted to her, but he's just about as believable as the rest of this awful story. It's true that the film did move fast and held my interest, but only because it was so strange. I give this a \\"thumbs down\\". Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It don't deserve one star","review":"This movie has got to be the stupidest movie ever to come out of Hollywood. Not only do I NOT like how they portrayed Christ, but the acting was bad. And the people who say: \\"This makes me wonder about religion,\\" GET OVER IT! Nothing in this movie is remotely close to Christ's teachings, it is just a big money grab. Although, I am a Mormon, not a Catholic, I have no respect for the way they portrayed Christ, whom I personally believe in."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STARS: Boring, poorly done with terrible acting.","review":"What a disappointment \\"Stigmata\\" was for me. About 30 minutes into the movie, I was completely bored and could hardly pay attention. The characters in this movie are not likeable and certainly not characters that the audience sympathizes with whatsoever. The plot of the movie is lame and the directing is poor. I highly recommend that all sophisticated and intellingent horror movie fans stay away from this trash. Some people call \\"Stigmata\\" a horror movie...I just call it rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"What MTV would make --- if it made movies","review":"I tried to figure out who the producers and director of this bomb thought would be the likely audience profile for this movie. My best guess is they decided their target audience would be people who:(1) Regard MTV VJs as witty, brilliant thinkers,(2) Have spent more time in their life reading cereal boxes than the Bible,(3) Would prefer books with \\"lots of pictures\\" to those with nothing but words,(4) Have had their principal exposure to Catholic teachings come from people who know more about Martian horticulture than true Catholic teachings,(5) Think that Cosmo and Vogue are literary masterpieces,(6) Are angry that Bart Simpson never won an Emmy for best actor,(7) Think Melrose Place is a deep, thought-provoking series about real life.Sorry for the sarcasm, but this movie cries out for it. Some reviewers have suggested approaching this movie with an open mind. I recommend approaching it with a gas mask."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good at all!","review":"Stigmata centers around the story of a woman who becomes stigmatic. This means she is afflicted by the 5 wounds of christ. The problem with this movie definetly isnt the story. It has great potential, good plot and some good effects. These are the problems. Terrible casting aside from Byrne. The direction is all over the place. The film is so unclear. Whoever dircted this should have been fired. A few good moments but nothing worth seeing. End Of Days was 10 times better! Not for people who are offended by these severly reliogusly films. Not reccomended"},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb little flick","review":"This movie is so stupid it should have never been made. This is the worst exorcist rip off I've seen.Think about this for a second,if your a dead priest trying to spread the true meaning of God,would you A:Take possession of an idiot hair stylist and write important information on a wall,paint over it,slice your arms up and beat the snot out of the only guy who is trying to help you who is a priest ? Or B:Tell the priest what is going on and what to do and let as many people as you can know that the vatican just aint the nice folks they claim to be? you tell me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise but badly done","review":"I really liked the premise of this film (that religion should dwell in the individual instead of a church) but overall, this film is a mess. I had a headache by the time it was over after endless scenes of dripping water, people running out into traffic, car crashes and thundering doves flying over the place. The movie is extremely noisy and violent and yet when the characters are speaking, you can't hear them! Not recommended unless you enjoy seeing entire film sets destroyed with LOTS of noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Bull.","review":"A film that ATTEMPTS to be intelligent but just comes off as an Exorcist ripoff. Half of the movie is focused on Frankie's cries of pain and blood gushing out of her arms/feet/whatever. Its potrayal of the Catholic Church is amusing, in a sad sort of way. It potrays it as a sort of \\"mafia\\", and the ending statement to the film is nothing but anti-Catholic propaganda. The fact that an athiest can get stigmata is riduclious, but not as amusing as the fact that they make it seem you can get \\"infected\\" by the condition from a pair of rosary beads. A stupid, uncreative horror film that attemts to throw down the Church and comes off looking stupid and uneducated in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooorrrrrriiiiiinnnnnggggg","review":"As best I can tell, this movie appealed mainly to two groups: (1) adolescent males who think the quality of a movie is directly proportional to the number of special effects and the sound volume of the soundtrack; and (2) embittered, hateful neurotics who get cranked on any movie attacking religion generally or the Catholic Church specifically.True Sci-Fi fans will be disappointed. This isn't even a good Exorcist rip-off. The premise for the movie is unique, even though factually void.However, the WORST aspect of this movie is that it takes itself far too seriously, and once it does that it collapses. It degenerates into a preachy, self-absorbed sermon --- exactly the type of religious mentality it presumes to attack."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very negative review","review":"I hated this movie. I found the whole plot insulting, as if the writers and director felt that they could put together a mosaic of thoroughly pointless, unexplained scenes and sub plots just because it looked neat. The characters were unbelievable and stereotypical. The movie made a grand attempt to be deep and thought-provoking and failed miserably. Stigmata left me with the urge to gather the producer, director, writer, and all the cast together, spank them all very hard and send them to their rooms without their supper to think about what they have done. I am sorry if this review offended anyone who happened to enjoy this movie, but it hurt me very badly and I needed to hurt it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe the critics!","review":"This movie is much better than critics would like the public to believe. The movie is the most original movie I have seen in a while. Sure it can be weak at points, and borrows from other fils, but so do all contemporary movies. I amusually a harsh critic on these types of movies, but this one surprised me. Anyone who has \\"doubts\\" about organized religion will like the dramatic sub-plot. The stylized cinematography was perfect for setting the mood..."},{"rating":"1","title":"STYLISH NOTHINGNESS","review":"This trifle portends to be one of those spiritual razzle-dazzla thrillers on the order of The Exorcist, but fails to deliver the single most important ingredient: an engaging,coherent story. Instead, realizing the vacuum this movie truly is, the filmmakers-turned-stylists layer gauzy MTV-effect on top of effect. The movie exists in some kind of altered state, and is mind-numbing after the first fifteen minutes. Enough with the dripping water, already, and the badly reconstructed demon-personality moments; this movie is a crashing bore; but for the obvious artistic talent of the set designer, who creates a mood, and the pumped-up video-style score, this movie would get no stars from me. Endless, uninvolving and empty of any character development that pulls you in; there are no real scares and the distorted plot provides you with no shocks or enjoyable surprises. One of the worst movies to tackle the subject of spiritual horror/suspense -- buy The Exorcist instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but no.","review":"I'm sorry but this movie was very disappointing! First of all, I've read and heard a lot about how this is ripping off the exorcist. Well, I did see some elements of the exoricist present, but nothing major. The movie was very boring though. I could see a pathetic attempt to be scary, but it just didn't work. Now one element that was lacking was a good soundtrack. The Omen worked partially because of a great soundtrack. This movie could not keep my attention because it left me bored. The music did not build anything. Secondly, the whole point of the movie was left unanswered. It ended with that one special message, but why did the priest possess that girl? What was his purpose? I wonder if the writers even know! From what I saw, I think a bunch of people recognized that movies in this genre have done well in the past and that they would try to score off it as well. Sorry fellas, but you failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"i knew id like this movie, i ordered it before id seen it.","review":"id only seen the commersials for this movie, but even they looked fab.before id seen it i was either gonna cancel my order or just keep it as it it. i kept it.it reminds me of a kind of ''exorsist'' movie. but in a different kind of storey.two thumbs up. fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty deep religious thoughts here...","review":"Although the over-all cinematography in this one was dark and dreary, the storyline was excellent. It has cutting insights into modern religion, comparing them unfavorably with Christ's original intentions.The concept of a non-Catholic suffering from stigmata, and a dubious priest confronting a side of religion he hadn't previously encountered, is original and fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blazfemmy!!!","review":"Ok, first the music is done by Billy Corgan. That egg headed freak knows about as much about music as nuns know about birth control. The dead sea scrolls or secret sayings of Jesus are heresy. If Jesus wanted us to know these things, he would not want me to learn them in a Billy Corgan music video. They would be in the bible. I know the bible, and this stuff is not in the bible. The Catholic Church is hiding some things from us, but they are not lost in the couch cushions. They will be reveal to me, and maybe even you when the time is right.Patricia Arquette, David Arquette's wife, has some of the worst hair in movie history. Anybody who gets their hair cut in he salon must also find in acceptable to have her hair styled by Stevie Wonder. She looks like a bleach blonde chicken.

However, when I saw it I felt as though I was watching an MTV video. This movie was, unfortunately nothing more than a cut and paste movie. The beginning could have been at the end, and the end at the beginning. There was a great lack of any sense of continuity, and the storyline did not seem to make any attempt to reconcile this. Further, this movie seemed to have its own private agenda which it wished to get across, moreso than to make a decent flick. All in all, I was very disappointed and this was one of those many movies that leaves you saying, \\"at least the special effects were good.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stigmata","review":"This has got to be the worst movie ever made.

Potentially good premise is given the ham-fisted, no subtlelty approach, with a script that has no idea what it's trying to say, not to mention also featuring a distinct lack of intelligence. The direction is just as bad, with MTV-style and rapid-cut editing in place of genuine filmmaking.

By the end of the movie I could hardly get her to say anything. She was so freaked out that I thought she was in shock. I don't usally let things affect me like that. But the way i felt about the movie was that it was of the Devil himself. It left me with such a bad feeling that I wasn't sure what to believe. I am not a real religious person but I know with out a doubt that what I saw on that movie was pure blasphemy. I have never used that word before but that is the only word I could think of after I watched this movie.

You got to write the bluffs, read the bluffs, pass them around, collect them, etc. It's a pain. MALARKY is a much better bluffing game. Better questions, better game play. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was surprised at how creative I could get!","review":"By far and away my favorite game in the past two decades...right behind the game \\"Sorry\\" when I was seven. I love it. Most recently played it with a group of friends who didn't appear to be the \\"game playing\\" type. We all had a ball and have made it a regular part of hanging out"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the funniest game ever!","review":"I played this game while on vacation. There was five of us playing. At one time or another during the game we all had tears from laughing so hard. I recommand this game very highly!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did the box come with a dice?","review":"I was playing this with my family and when the first dasher went, he didn't roll the dice to determine the category and instead simply chose his own category. I protested (since obviously this provides an unfair advantage for the dasher). My protesting escalated but when I challenged my brother, I read the rules and was humbled. Apparently the dasher IS free to pick his own category. What nonsense!!! How do the publishers justify this? Not only was I humiliated in front of my entire family, but I became so frazzled that I ended up losing the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riotously funny sequel to the original","review":"We have introduced dozens of people to this game, and we've had hilarious fun each time we play. The new categories add a great dimension to the game and allows you to explore new facets of creativity.I've seen a couple of reviews here from fans of the original Balderdash expressing disdain for the new categories, but take that with a grain of salt! Coming up with definitions for not just words but people, dates, and movies actually flexes the mental muscles harder, multiplies the hilarity, and also evens out the playing field for those who aren't word-a-holics.This game is a blast, give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an awesome game","review":"This is a great game! I first played it at a family reunion and right away I wanted it. I put it on my wish list and got it for my birthday. My whole family loves it, but we dont play it so much any more because it's better with more people. The only bad thing is that when kids are playing none of the ideas sound right but the correct one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun for everyone","review":"this is a great game. it is funto play with the biggest group of players possible. it is a game fulll of laughs and everyone enjoys it. It is good as a family, a party game or just a rainy day gme. no matter where or when you willl enjoy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for 20-30 somethings!","review":"We love this game! Every time that we have played this with new people, they buy it for themselves and introduce it to others! It takes awhile to play the game, and the more people you have playing, the longer the game also. If you love trying to \\"pull one over\\" on your friends, this is the game. Regular balderdash is fun, but not as challenging. This game asks you to come up with events, and movie plot lines. This game is not for people looking for mindless fun. You have to have a sharp wit, some intelligence and the ability to write a good lie. A great gift for a new couple or college students!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Balderdash","review":"Beyond Balderdash is much better than Balderdash. The definitions are weirder along with the new movie titles, peoples, dates, and initials. I don't know when I laughed as hard as I did at a board game before. It's great because the silliest definition usually happens to be correct. Every family should own this game. If you play it and don't laugh than you must be the grinch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GAME ROCKS","review":"This game is fun for everyone. Even the smartest one in your group will not know the correct answers to these questions, but of course that is the whole point of the game, not to know the answer. For an evening of fun like you have never had before this is the game to play. Everytime our family and friends get together to play this game we laugh until we cry. This is definately one of my all time favorite games!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For those with a vivid imagination, nothing beats this game!","review":"Beyond Balderdash has been a huge hit at our house for nearly a year. We have so much fun playing this game that we don't even care who wins! For those with a vivid imagination and a creative mind, this game is tops. For those of you who are somewhat lacking in the creativity dept., this game could do the trick! It really is super."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Fun at the Original","review":"Being a big fan of the Original Balderdash, I wasn't impressed playing the new \\"Beyond Balderdash\\". I was expecting something closer to the \\"Original\\" with words and didn't enjoy the new categories. It is a good game on it's own merits, but beware lover's of the original, expect a different game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game, Buy it from [...]","review":"This game is fun.

Cleverly written definitions will stump everyone. Lots of fun to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure to have you rolling on the floor!","review":"This is one of the funniest games out there. It's better than regular balderdash, which was a lot of fun but wasn't really worth buying since you could play the same game on your own using a doorstopper dictionary, some scratch paper, and an agreement on how many points to play for. However, this version includes places and people, as well as words, and the creative answers that people come up with about what happened on a certain date will have you rolling on the floor, and hard pressed to tell the made up answers from the real ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Living Tradition of the great music of the 60's!","review":"Start with The Beatles, add extract of George Harrison for guitar solo, add a measure of The Animals & a dash of The Kinks; simmer in a broth of Huey Lewis, sprinkle a handful of Hall & Oates & finish off with a smidgen of Crosby, Stills & Nash And Young, topped with a flourish of Boz Scaggs & voila, there you have it, the music of The Rowland Brothers on \\"no sleep...\\". The guitar solo in Hydronic is as compelling as any I've heard from the artists mentioned. Its as if the music of the times of these bands has been preserved, carried forward & evolved to new forms of today, in a fusion with techo, ambient, progressive genres, that makes for a totally refreshing sound & a vibrantly resonating connection with that \\"Cambrian Explosion\\" of music that occurred beginning in the '60's. \\"Broz\\" Rowland has been making great that music since those times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Marketing Professional Should Own This Book","review":"This book is a must read if you are in marketing or advertising.

You see I had over a million hits on my own website in less than a month, and sold over 350,000 copies of my own book, many right here on Amazon.I used Viral techniques to do it.But now that I have read Mark Joyner's \\"Irresistible Offer\\" book, I have discovered some things I simply did not know. Even a way of thinking.Mark Joyners previous work \\"Mind Control Marketing\\" was an absolute masterpiece. I refer to it each and every week.

For the newbie, it has a lot of information, but you can probably find it elsewhere for free, if you have a few hours to search around the net. If you have a mailing list, this tells you things you can do with it, but you probably know them already. If you don't have a list or contacts (joint venture partners) with a list, it can be frustrating to hear what you can do with one. my two cents.. I would save your money by skipping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"no bullets in my gun","review":"This book didn't even begin to help me.

His argument that the \\"Irresistible Offer\\" is somehow different from a USP to me felt kind of weak. But that said, he does a great job of describing it. This book is a good, quick read that gives you a bird's eye view of marketing terrain in a way that you may not have seen before.The sections on viral marketing seemed somewhat disjointed and out of place, though he does attempt to weave this into the main thread.Though I disagree that his \\"Irresistible Offer\\" is some new and revolutionary marketing concept, I still recommend this book as it does a good job of conveying a critical idea to anyone involved in marketing or sales. It's a concept that is too often ignored to the peril of marketers everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me a Break!","review":"Fortunately for me I checked this book out of the local library. I've read many books on sales and marketing, and this is by far one of the worst books on the subject I have ever read. The author made a couple \\"good\\" points but none of them was anything new that you cannot find in any number of other books on the subject. Mr. Joyner is REALLY \\"selling the sizzle without the steak\\". I don't get the high praises this book is receiving. All I can say is purchase this mediocre book at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...total rehash of old material","review":"I cringed as I read the book. Joyner is trying to re-package 15-year old material on writing sales letters as something new. If you've never read a book on writing sales letters there's something here for you.

Although, he is a huge tubbies fan, he has shown no interest in this game. I don't think it is very appropriate for a 2 year old. I would say it is more for a 3 year old or older. Lots of small parts, & play dough. A parent's nightmare!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of possibilities","review":"Great game and activity. There are many possibilities.

It really holds his attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply the worst book I have ever read.","review":"The dull meandering nothings of a life wasted, this book is appallingly written, and its editing is even worse. The most disgraceful thing about this book is that the message contained within could be both interesting and useful, but is swamped by the aimless waffle about the retail industry, about pointless and meaningless petty squabbles with people from fifty years past. This is, quite simply, not worth the paper its printed on, the time it has consumed, or the avarice that was expended to produce it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Has Something I Enjoy","review":"This magazine always has a few things I enjoy reading.

The subscription price is incredibly reasonable. I find that it fits me and my lifestyle well. It definitely seems geared toward 30-40s aged women with families and young children.

I look forward to it each month."},{"rating":"1","title":"waiting-room shocker","review":"While waiting for my daughter in an orthodontic office last month (July 2005), I read through what I thought would be the familiar Redbook magazine of the past. Instead, I was shocked to come across a new sexual advice section in which the explicit techniques for giving your man satisfying oral sex without tiring yourself out was described. Another article within this section explained how a taller man can have sex with a shorter female partner while both standing.I felt embarrassed and outraged that this magazine was out on the tables in the waiting room for any age group to read. I am age 48, college educated and the mother of 2 teenagers. I would not want my 13 year-old daughter to consider this light reading or helpful advice, nor do I think it appropriate for a magazine such as Redbook.Parents please seriously consider whether you want this magazine on the end tables in your homes.

There were too many \\"shock-value\\" articles that just don't appeal to me now that I am in my 30s. Also, I didn't want my daughter stumbling upon one of the sizzling (often premarital) sex topics.

I have yet to be blessed with such assets, so a large portion of the magazine wasn't relevant to me. It seems to be geared towards the not-yet-middle-aged set with husbands and children to consider.

Davis is all for it.In fact, there are no hard and fast rules and we copywriters are not at all sure which way works. My personal belief is that each site is different and that hyperlinks can and do work if you write your scan words just right.

The Tudor period in England has always interested me, and the fate of Christopher Mrlowe has been puzzling people for centuries. Our author gives us her version of Marlowe's story, interwoven with a modern day mystery bound up with Marlowe's life and death. The characters are fairly well-drawn, and the mystery and suspense is non-stop. I hope to be able to read more thrillers from this author in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"EMBARRASSINGLY BAD","review":"An awful, insipid, mess. The contemporary stuff is AWFUL! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I'm usually a soft touch for books that jump between the present and historical settings (with the notable exception of Michael Crichton's Timeline). But Kate Morgan is totally unbelievable as a character, and is apparently the exaggerated alter-ego (with the emphasis on ego) of the Harvard-educated private-eye author. I found the portrayal of 16th Century London to be interesting, but that's about it. That was five hours that could have been better spent rereading The Time Traveler's Wife or Jack Finney's Time and Again."},{"rating":"1","title":"i would give it a lower score if that were possible","review":"Pretension without ability, ingenuity, or originality.Buy a real book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Such a great idea... such a terrible book. Aside from the anachronistic language and wish fulfillment in the Marlowe plot, the history was mildly interesting. But in terms of giving life and voice to Christopher Marlowe, a sci-fi book called \\"Armor of Light\\" does a much better job.Even so, I would have far rather spend more time with Silbert's version of Marlowe, than Silbert's poorly disguised version of herself, Kate Morgan. Ok sure, an investigator/government agent should be good at their job, but Mary S-er, Kate is an investigator/government agent/Renaissance Scholar/kick boxer/object of sexual desire of every male she meets/with a tragic romance in her past. Too perfectly perky and utterly unrealistic. I didn't want to cheer on her heroine, I wanted to slap her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing book","review":"Advertising for a new book comparing it to the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" is not a great recomendation in my opinion.That success of that overblown drivel is a mystery to me. Leslie Silbert is obviously a rookie. The historical part of this book holds some interest, but the modern day sleuth and her escapades are just inane. I am sick and tired of all these incredibly attractive medevil experts who just happen to own a black belt in some martial arts category.And the bad guys are all dark and sexy and brooding and give me a break...Even the least pretentious thriller{ and this one certainly isn't that modest} must possess the modicum of reality and common sense. Well to make it short, this lame attempt doesnt have any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is bad","review":"This is what the publishing industry has come to: Someone with absolutely no experience or talent can write a derivative, two-dimensional and utterly pointless novel and GET IT PUBLISHED AND ON THE BESTSELLERS LIST just because some other untalented hack managed to grip millions of readers with a conspiracy theory!! Ye gods!! There are tons of good books out there, people! Read Scotch River by Linda Little! Read A Short History of Indians in Canada by Thomas King! Hell, read a cereal box before you read The Intelligencer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Intelligencer","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever attempted to read, in fact so bad that I feel compelled to spend a few minutes wrtiing about it. How on earth could this author or her editor let a person in the 16th century find something \\"electrifying\\" and in \\"Present Day\\" let the heroine, no matter how tough, waltz down 5th Avenue with a multi-million dollar manuscript, that someone had just died over, in her bag. Wish I'd read the other reviews before wasting my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"I ordered this because it was compared to Mary Higgins Clark. There is no way this book or author could compare to MHC. Although the storyline sounded interesting, it not only drags on with an endless history lesson given by the characters, but one would get the impression that everyone in the 1500's was either gay or had no moral character whatsoever. The language and sexual content in this book is not something I want or should be needed in a successful novel. Mary Higgins Clark has been writing books for more years than I can count, and she has never needed to put smut or language in her books to have them pouring off the shelf. After reading about 1/2 of the book, and getting way too many sexually explicit pictures in my head, I had had enough, and decided to forget trying to finish it. Too bad you can't get a 'money-back-guarantee' on books.This author has alot of work to do to present a book with decent substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I wasn't sure about this book when I first started it. I really wasn't interested that much in the parts about Kit Marlowe. But after a while, I actually wanted to know more about Marlowe! I liked also how the author weaved the different parts of the story. It flowed well from present to past. The only part I had difficulty with was the extra story about the missing spy. That seemed like way too many coincidences. But still very good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Book Blues","review":"Leslie Silbert has great potential -much like her heroine, Kate Morgan. This was a neat premise for an histroical novel/detective story. The research is obviously meticulous in both the story lines. There were plenty of characters both fair and foul and there's even a gentleman burglar. Good stuff. The writing itself left something to be desired but that would have been more easily overlooked if Kate Morgan could have been more three-dimensional. She was too slick. Like a magazine photo. This is often the case with autobiographical characters, especially in first novels. Flawed characters are both more believable and more interesting. A novel isn't a job interview. When your reader asks \\"what is your worst characteristic?\\", you don't respond \\"i'm a perfectionist overachiever\\", you show us the whole bloody mess. Otherwise, why should we care?"},{"rating":"1","title":"a clever idea, but poorly done","review":"I bought this book to read on trains, planes, and busses while traveling in Italy. I was tremendously disapointed by it. I was surprised that it lasted me two overseas flights, two overnight train rides, and several bus rides, not to metion several days at the beach, yes, it was just that annoying. It is a clearly autobiographical story and would have been more credible if written as such. Further, what could have been an interesting plot gets lost in middle-school like tangeants about how very cool the main character is, a serious case of tell don't show, peppered with a little self-inflation. While Silbert is no doubt intelligent, her book is worked out around her desire for the reader to adore and admire her main character rather than around an intricate parallel murder story."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK plot, cardboard charaters, ho-hum writing style","review":"One of the blurbs on the cover compares this book to \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" and I should have taken that more seriously and not bought this book. Its only good feature is its intricate plot. Even that does not deliver a really sharp finale. There was such potential for really wonderful characterization here, with the book's back-and-forth story line between present and past, but none of the characters come to life. They are presented as no more than types, with nothing to make them human or interesting - very much like \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" in fact - and so I didn't much care what happened to any of them. Sadly, despite the author's credentials, the writing style is also poor, with trite, cliched descriptions and little to perk up the tone.If you read for plot only, you'll probably like this book. If you want some actual good writing to go with the plot, try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea Surrounded by Muck","review":"Take one great idea (Marlowe) and mix it up with tired, formula thriller elements and you get this book.

But don't dispair! Dion's back in Wolfs Bane and Wolfs Bane is either the best or ties for the best in the series. Grayheart suddenly brought forth about 10 new characters, each more dull than the last...except for the mysterious Coale...I won't say too much more since I don't want to ruin this for everyone. Basically, this book was dry, predictable and was only a fraction of Tara Harper's talent, since it skips into another time, decades later, you don't NEED to read this book to finish the series...since it basically has nothing to do with the others. My advice, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy grey heart","review":"This is the third book of the series I actually read. After following Dione on her adventures with the wolves, I just couldn't give a d*mn about her granddaughter, Rezsia.Sure, the girl was understandable, as a city girl suddenly bonded to a wolf and having no experience in the great outdoors. I actually kind of liked her bond with Gray Vlen.But most of the book was just too predictable. The love interest at the end was not just trite, it was ridiculous. Too much bio-this and bio-that, with conspiracies with rival biologists (I suppose?) and annoying details, like names of new characters and offhand references to their relations that don't add to the plot.I can appreciate Tara's love of wolves, and I certain share that sentiment, but this story just didn't hook me and pull me in. Maybe if Rezsia got her own series, it might have been worth the $6.99 I originally paid for it, but no more of this series, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suspense filled plot; Hardly one to put down.","review":"This book has a suspense filled plot that constantly leavesyou on the edge of your seat in anticipation.Definitely one for the casual reader who cannot stand\\"no-brainer\\" books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Descriptive","review":"I found this book to be my favorite. I like Star Wars novels usually, but the stories in the Wolfwalker series are truly my love. I have read Grayheart numerous times. The mixture of music is what truly makes it my favorite of the series. Grayheart is a wonderful character and the connection of family thought lost and then found is a wonderful resolution to old conflicts.

I trust that what I read on their pages is true to their best knowledge and not purely made up fictional stories that I commonly see while waiting in the grocery store checkout.

The articles are all really short and definitely without much depth, but most people aren't looking for that when they read Us weekly. The fashion police is pretty funny; it's just a bunch of comments about star's clothes from a group of people with no real authority on the subject.

The New Yorker of 1999-2003 was essential reading -- engaging, thought-provoking, clever, wry. Today's New Yorker is tired. The cartoons, once clever and relevant, are now either obtuse or worn out (how many more \\"stressed out\\" montages by Roz Chast must I flip past?). For my money, I get broader and deeper political coverage in The Economist, more innovative writing and photos in The Paris Review, and sharper liberal politics/commentary in Harper's.

The editorials, once a centerpiece of the magazine, has now become filled with left-wing rants about how Republicans are responsible for anything that happens. While these editorials may be appropriate for the New York Post and other hysterical tabloids, they are not appropriate for a magazine that has been world renowned for over 70 years.

I really avoided all of the Clinton-Monica justification stuff, and how it really all was a Republican conspiracy to put Monica up to it, and how she lied, and how the angelic Clinton was and is a saint. This left-wing refusal to view reality almost made me cancel my subscription.2. I think Tina Brown was the worst thing to happen to the New Yorker. I liked the articles that went on and on and on, and sometimes tested one's patience. However, it was almost always worth it to slog through some of them.

I think they lost their professionalism somewhere along the way, this knife definitely proves that. Looks great, but that's it. The plastic cap is cheap, too hard and cracks all the time, not to mention that it doesn't hold in place on the knife. And the worst part about this knife is that once you use it a few times the silicone part of it gets loose and you have to use pliers to hold the new blade while turning the rear section when replacing the blade because the front silicone part just spins around."},{"rating":"1","title":"cap doesn't stay on","review":"I use xacto knives almost every day.

Anyway, very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cap falls off - safety hazard","review":"I agree with another reviewer here that said the cap falls off. It is poorly designed. It does not \\"click\\" into place, but relies on friction to stay on. The surface area that the cap grips on the shaft is only about 1/8\\" deep. Even a slight lateral force will tip the cap off of the shaft, exposing the razor sharp blade. This is definitely a safety hazard. In one motion, you could knock the cap off and cut your hand. Don't ever carry this in your pocket. I was keeping the cap taped on, but eventually I told myself it wasn't worth the risk of having this thing around. I threw it away -- and I feel good that I probably saved me or someone else from a nasty cut. Exacto should pull this thing from the market until they redesign the cap -- and they should recall all the units already sold.

It provided a good balance of his personal and professional life while adding a lot of interesting notes about the early Soviet space program and political environment too. I would have preferred more information about his personal life and more photos. My only disappointment was that there was little said of the dogs that had gone up into space before him, most of them surviving and returning to ordinary lives. I was happy to learn that he and others were honored with a plaque left on the moon by our astronauts. The book ends with a bittersweet feeling, but it's very appropriate.

These kinds of errors will cause your code to not compile, and for a new learner makes learning difficult.Further the code examples are usually incomplete and you will find yourself constantly going back and forth through the text in order to write a complete application.

And as a real treat to film viewers, there are no sentimental or treacly moments that can often bog a film down.

I thought that the part where Travis Walton was picked up by the UFO was very realistic, and well done. The part about people's reaction to his abduction was also (unfortunately) quite realistic and believable.He appeared to have set off an automated defense system by going too close to the UFO. Many people who have intimate knowledge of this case think that Travis was dead, and was brought back to life by the aliens; this may explain the unusual length of his abduction.The part depicting events on board the alien ship was not so good, and not in accordance with Travis's report, but I'd rate the movie 4 stars overall, in spite of this.

I was not disappointed! Some people have criticized the fact the the story is told from the best friend's point of view, rather than from Walton's, but I think the choice was a good one. The movie is able to give a more rounded, yet personal view of the case without making you doubt either the friends or Walton. The acting is wonderful, believable, and, with only a couple of exceptions, not over the top - as is the norm for many alien flics. Definitely worth the time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the more believable","review":"The Travis Walton story is one of the more interesting, and maybe believable, of the alien abduction stories. I remember when the story came out in the seventies it sure got a lot of coverage in Arizona. I've hiked the White Mountains area, and it sure is beautiful, but I never ran into any aliens-- knock wood. At least not from outer space. This movie treats the story straight-faced and it kind of drags in places. Better pacing was needed. As a film, it really did not generate the spooky paranoia of say, Communion.

The aliens in this movie are violent and stick tubes down the main character's throat.In real life, this incident never occurred. In fact, in real life, the abductee actually scared the aliens away.

D.B. Sweeney plays the logger who, along with his co-workers, witnesses bizarre lights hovering in the sky. Travis attempts to get a closer look, and is seemingly beamed aboard and never seen again until five days later. While the events in the film differ from Walton's own account, Fire in the Sky manages to get under your skin once Travis has a flashback of the events that transpired aboard the spaceship. The alien beings are surprisingly well designed, and the ordeal Travis goes through will make your skin crawl despite the film's PG-13 rating. It's not perfect, but the cast (including T2's Robert Patrick, Peter Berg, Craig Sheffer, and James Garner) makes it work.

I sat on our couch and read for four strait hours. I just couldn't put it down. I was just so amazed with this story that I cant really explain how I felt. The way she told the story and the characters were just so unique. I was just totaly inspired. She really creates a whole new world when she writes her books.

I would recommend it to anyone. One of the things I liked the most is the characters are realistic. They do stuff people would really do. Gordy is my favorite character because boys really do do stuff like that. Margarte and Elizabeth are okay but their moms are annoying. I like how Margarte and Elizabeth have the courage to break their mothers rules about not crossing the railroad trakes. I like how at the beginning of the book it shows a map of the town so I really know where everything is located. I think Magarte's mom is a brat when she finds out about Stewart deserting the army. It is sad when Margaret's brother dies. TWO THUMBS UP!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"This book was really great. I thought this was one of the best books I have ever read!

It really touches your emotions. I could really understand how the people felt about Hitler. I also wish the book had gone on longer. I believe readers older than 12 would enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly rote.","review":"A group of German soldiers is trapped in Russian territory in this WWII drama from Sam Peckinpah. No doubt, the battle scenes are mostly excellent (for such a low budget), but the acting is pretty awful (James Coburn's German accent disappears slowly but surely), the sets are cheap and shaky-looking, and there's nothing about it thematically that distinguishes it from any other war film. The worst aspect must be the lack of a resolution, which I hear was due to shortage of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre, not entirely unpleasant experience.","review":"Cross of Iron is noted for being Sam Peckinpah's only war film. As expected, the film is packed to the brim with action (as a matter of fact, it's Peckinpah's most action-packed movie to date), delivering one well-executed battle scene after another until it reaches its ambiguous conclusion. Unfortunately, aside from all the mayhem, the movie offers nothing else.There's really not much of a plot here. The late James Coburn stars as Steiner, a coporal turned sergeant who incurs the wrath of Captain Stransky (Maximillian Schell) when he refuses to give Stransky credit for a counterattack he did not organize. This rivalry grows deadly, when Stransky eventually decides to leave Stransky and his men behind Russian territory..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Sam at his best","review":"Produced on a modest budget in Yugoslavia in 1976, Cross of Iron starring James Coburn is a tough, hardcore movie that holds up well. Even by today's standards, the sequence with a group of Russian female soldiers is truly horrific. Fine, vintage Peckinpah."},{"rating":"1","title":"great story, terrible DVD","review":"An interesting story on an obscure subject, the russian eastern front as the tide was turning against the Germans. Okay, blood and guts do fly and some of the characters over-act their parts, but it was an intersting movie when it was out on film (only a very short release as it wasn't popular movie fare). BUT... and I say again BUT with capital letters, the above was all overshadowed by the terrible job of transfering the film to DVD. My copy jumps scenes, skips, and the sound is terrible. I would have thought it was a fluke, but like a fool bought a second copy at a different store, SAME thing. If the problem would ever be fixed I would buy it again, but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"This movie truely shows the horrors of battle on the Eastern Front. Not only is it told from a German perspective exclusively- it shows all the feelings and emotions German soldiers felt while sitting in trenches waiting for the Russians to attack, and the komeraderie of the common soldier and his loyalty to his platoon.A great show from beginning to end, and one thats for the person who is tired of seeing endless American heroics in movies based on the Western Front."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Copy Disappointing of Cross of Iron","review":"I just purchased this movie. I saw it on the big screen in 1978. I had just finished the book by Willi Heinrich. I was very disappointed. The DVD quality was OK, but there was no widescreen, subtitles or anything beyond the ordinary on it. I had expected a lot more. I really had liked the movie when I saw it in 1978, but now that I've read the book, I didn't even finish watching the DVD. I thought [...] for the disk was way out of line considering what I got. Hen's Tooth pulled a bait-n-switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up with The Bunch","review":"Some of the reviewers of this very fine movie seem to need their eyes and ears examined. Mason does not play a \\"martinet\\", as Chute says; nor is he a Nazi. In fact he's the opposite of both. What's the point of writing a review if you haven't watched the movie? This is a really first-class analysis of the nature of camaraderie and loyalty among individual men, sharpened to an unbearable edge by the imminence of death. There are different aspects to this sense of brotherhood; sometimes, but not by any means in every case, releasing a concealed homosexuality. War is misogynic, and this is an anti-war movie, which several reviewers don't appear able to understand. The acting and action scenes throughout are outstanding, except that Coburn didn't seem quite square-headed enough. Also, Maximilian Schell's character, although perfectly played, is too unbelievably despicable to credit. Nevertheless, it's pretty much up there with the rest of Peckinpah's remarkably memorable output."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant movie, crappy DVD","review":"This is, without a doubt one of the best war movies evere made. It has enough action and drama to make you want to watch it again and again. But the DVD version is garbage. The people at Hen's Tooth Video should be tied down and forced to watch Hulk Hogan movies for ruining Sam Peckinpah's masterpice."},{"rating":"1","title":"how to destroy a great film","review":"As with most of the other reviews I can say with total honesty that my DVD of Cross of Iron is the worst duplication of any film onto DVD. How can such a second rate company get the rights to one of the greatest war films ever made. Unfortunately for me, living DownUnder, returning this title is not possible finacially. I am thankful I still have a VHS copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross of Iron--DVD---Hens Tooth Video","review":"Cross of Iron, Sam Peckinpah's last movie has been out of print on vhs for a long time. With a DVD release as poor as this it should have stayed in moratorium until someone who cared could have released a DVD worthy of this great antiwar film. I stilll have a vhs copy that looks better than this dungpile. So whether you are a fan of this movie or Sam Peckinpah do not support this horrible release of such a fine film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! A decent release.","review":"A good release of a great and underrated Peckinpah film. The picture quality is a huge improvement over the previous pan & scan from Hen's Tooth and seems to be a little better than the recent Korean all region release. The audio commentary by Stephen Prince is informative but a bit dry like the one he did for Criterion's Straw Dogs. One can't help but think that this should have been a Criterion release but overall it's a descent release. A second disc with material about the making of the film would have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie --Bad DVD","review":"While I am a big fan of Peckinpah, and feel that this movie was unfairly overlooked for many years, it was almost painful to watch the Hen's Tooth Video DVD version of this film. The interpositive used in the transfer is scratched, pitted, and otherwise in very poor shape for much of the film. The compression rate is terrible, resulting in the worst artifacting I have yet seen on this format, and to top it all off the video does not even preserve the film's aspect ratio.To sum it up: Very compelling movie, which does feel a bit \\"dated\\" in some of its techniques (but funding was also pulled out from under Peckinpah during production, and this film was made on a very low budget), but the film warrants viewing. It's merely unfortunate that the video distributor did not give the film the respect it deserved. I am returning my DVD copy today, and will wait for someone else to acquire the rights and do the job better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, bad DVD","review":"DVD transfer quality is sub-mediocre; looks like a copy imaged from VHS tape. It's also Full Screen. Sound quality is poor.The movie ultimately has merits along the lines that other reviewers have indicated. This is just such a piss-poor release of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Film is Great but the DVD is absolutely HORRIBLE","review":"The film is a gritty \\"no holds barred\\" look at the Russian Front in WWII. I would recommend the VHS version to all WWII movie fans. HOWEVER, the DVD is not widescreen and looks to be dubbed from a worn out copy of the VHS version. I bought this thinking that the DVD would be better quality, but my ancient VHS copy with the original cover art is still better even though there are a few worn spots on it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good WWII Movie","review":"This is a very good WWII movie with quite an interesting view from the Germansoldier perspective. Although, like many German made films, it concentrateson a small unit of men and their relationship with each other and their (inGerman made movies)typical negative feeling for their officers.(This isunderstandable given the Prussianization of the officer corps which alsoallows the enlisted men to try and escape the stigma of guilty conductthemselves for all that the Wermacht did to Jews, gypsies and foreign peoplesas well as their combat enemies during the war. Blame your conduct on theofficers.) But the action and acting is good. In fact I was surprised thatit was never nominated for any awards. If you are a fan of WWII movies youare going to like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad digitallization,definitely not from original film","review":"I share with other people with the good quality of the movie. But totally dissapointed by the poor quality of DVD, which is supposed to offer better resolution and contrast than the video tape. This version, by Hen's Tooth Video, seems to be digitallized from a video tape, but of even poorer quality. It is blurry, has ghost shadows(quite visible in the credits part, with characters on screen), and let me suspect that this DVD is digitallized from a video tape that had been in video rental store's circulation for months and the digital signal picked up from a worn out VCR! Such a good movie deserves better. The so called Hen's Tooth Video shouldn't have treated it so carelessly. I am really against any DVD that is not a true digitallization of the original film copy and strongly suggest that information about the reproduction source be available to the customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best war films I have ever seen","review":"This is one of my favorite films of all time. The battle actions is great and very realistic. Sergeant Steiner is a heroic combat veteren who has survived some of the fierces fighting against the Russian Juggernaut. In addition to having to fight the brave Russians, he has to endure the Military Politics that are ever present, even in battle. I spent twenty years in the U.S. Navy and know very well how the miliary social life is lived. The commaraderie displayed by the the Germans soldiers in this film draws an emotional bond known only by military personnel. This is truly a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth seeing.","review":"The Cross of Iron is a movie that is worth seeing for any interested in the German side of WWII. Unlike most war movies that are mostly action (and unrealistic at that), this movie depicts the politics, bordom, and horror of combat. Even more horrifying is the fact that those who are fighting know that they have already lost. This is a movie that anyone who has ever been in a no win situation will appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely terrible","review":"This without doubt is one of the worst films i have ever seen.Unfortunately the book on which it is based is excellent, the cast in theory should be excellent, and james coburn would seem to be the right man for the job.unfortunately the film is sloppily made and the action scenes would have embaressed the makers of the A team.i actually couldnt even bring myself to watch to the end, maybe better if you havent read the book, as it is a direct but poor translation, and maybe the 70s just wasnt the time to try making it.not worthy of an addition to your DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like a bad reenactment","review":"The movie \\"Cross of Iron\\" is based on the novel by Willi Heinrich. Heinrich's novel is a very well written account of warfare on the eastern front from the perspective of a German non-com. Peckinpah's \\"Cross of Iron\\" is unfortunately, is a low budget western with homo-erotic undertones. The \\"German\\" characters look like participants at a bad reenactment. Hell's Angels look more like real German Soldiers than the characters in this film.The dialogue in the film makes me wonder whether Peckinpah was drunk while he was directing this film as the acting and dialogue is overly melodramatic and ludicous.The creditable acting of Coburn, Schell and Mason are not enough to salvage this dreadful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, dull, pointless","review":"Here's a brief synopsis:People with German accents, hiding in a bunker in the woods. Lots of talking. Occasionally, they peek out and these random Hollywood explosions start happening. A few slow motion shots of people dropping dead.I rented this movie expecting a good depiction of some World War II battles. I wanted to see strategy...I wanted to see different battle theatres...instead, I got hundreds of shots of a few guys in the same location with occasional explosions. Boring. The only people I think that truly enjoy this movie either liked it when it first came out or like it just because Sam Peckinpah directed it. Truly forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review of the BluRay edition...","review":"Yes! I said BluRay... To conincide with the BluRay edition release, a limited screening of a new print of this classic war film was shown in Britian in June 2011... The Blu Ray edition is NOT availiable here in the U.S. The new edition is a beautiful edition...

The reason I only gave it 2 stars was the ending made no sense to me, otherwise I would have given it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will we get a full-length WS Region 1 DVD of this masterpiece?","review":"I have a Cross of Iron VHS made by \\"Media,\\" which runs 132 min and which, though full-frame (except for a short sequence in which the Russian boy is killed), is infinitely better than the poorly restored, shorter Hen's Tooth full-frame, DVD. The DVD from Oz is shorter than my VHS by 5 min. A few years ago in London, I saw a Cross of Iron released by UK Warner's, also shorter than my VHS. When will the studio that owns the rights to this masterpiece give us a WS, digitally remastered, Region 1 DVD of this masterpiece? It's about time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst transfer in the history of DVD","review":"As a movie, Cross of Iron is a five star experience. However, the American DVD by Hen's Tooth Video is daylight robbery. This is a video transfer, small screen, terrible print, appalling sound. At ever level this fails as a DVD. It is an expensive disgrace and an offense to Peckinpah. This is the ultimate example of a company abusing their rights and rushing a DVD into existence without making the slightest effort to satisfy the consumer. You might as well save a buck and buy the video. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody masterpiece!","review":"This is one of the greatest war movies i've ever watched. I can't say I enjoyed it more then Peckinpah's other brilliant movies Straw Dogs and The Wild Bunch, however it literally leaves you out of breath by the end.Firstly i'd like to concerntrate on the fight scenes. Although not as good as in other war films such as Hamburger Hill and Full Metal Jacket, they are pleasing to the eye, Peckinpah again using his unique style of slow motion whenever someone os killed, shot or even blow up. Gory as the gun shot wounds may be, it proved much less controversial as many of his other flicks, even though it contains a gruesome scene in which a woman bites of a soliders genitals, which you don't see in full, but leaves much to the imagination.The story is good and strong, it hangs a bit limp on some occasions however by the end gets much much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell on the Eastern front. Again.","review":"\\"Cross of Iron\\" is not a groundbreakingly original picture. Just about everything about the film has been done before and afterwards. But then again, that's a fact with most movies.The story is about the classical honest and heroical soldier fighting not only the war, but also a corrupt, lying and backstabbing officer.The picture gives you a realistic view of the war where there was no going home. Attention has been payed to detail, which is a great plus.All over it's a pretty good movie. It's definately worth the money if you're interested in WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closest thing to being there","review":"The details that went into making this film are fantastic. Almost every uniform and weapon is correct for the time. The use of real T-34 tanks is stunning. Coburn does a great job of playing the Wermacht NCO trying to keep his men alive on the eastern front while dealing with a glory seeking idiot. Brutal at times, this movie will grip you from the opening scene till the closing scene. Great score at the begining of the film. I'd love to get the soundtrack but I cannot find it. Strange seeing a film that has German soldiers as \\"The good guys\\" alot like the film Das Boot in that respect. Top notch, as must for all military film buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie cries out for director's cut","review":"I understand this movie was butchered before it was released. That is why so many of the scenes don't flow well. Too violent I guess. This movie really shows that war is hell. There have been many war movies in recent years that have effectively shown the horrible side of war, but at the time that this movie was made, war movies still pretty much glorified war. Please somebody do a director's cut on the movie. I think that it will then rank amoung Saving Private Ryan and Das Boot. James Coburn does a fantastic job in this movie, probably mostly because the character he plays fits his acting style so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect war movie","review":"Nobody can complain of this movie. Saving Private Ryan seems simply a stupid jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tragic Ripoff","review":"Leave it to the Japanese to do a better job in the DVD release of this epic WW2 film. It deserves much better than the poor VHS quality pan and scan vserion of this DVD by Hens Tooth.

This one has the same superb production values, the same actors, etc. It stands alone as a wonderful story of growing up in Southern France 100 years ago. However, seen AFTER the first one, it is even better. We care deeply about these people,and having met them before, the true-life events that befall them are very moving.The movie ends with a brilliant circularity that makes you draw your breath.I saw the movies before reading the books, and the films are very true to the books. In fact, having seen the films first, the faces and voices of the actors and the striking scenery filled my imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Glory","review":"As another reviewer has noted, this film has no sex or nudity. Yet despite that, it is still a movie to savour and worth repeated viewings.Yes, a bit of sex and nudity is never unwelcome, but this film, in its brilliant evocation of a sun-drenched childhood in the rugged countryside of Southern France, needs it not at all. It is simply a glorious experience, in its telling of Marcel Pagnol's autobiographical story.It's sad to know that the young boys were cruelly parted not long after the time of this tale by the random cruelty of the First World War. Marcel Pagnol is buried next to his childhood chum, parted from him in life but reunited in death.This is a worthy successor to 'My Father's Glory' -- the two must be seen as a coherent whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwhelmed by smoke","review":"What may be fine tea underneath is totally overpowered by throat burning smoke.

I can't believe that when I buy a computer, or any other mid or big size product, I receive it within 2 weeks, and that when I buy a magazine - A MAGAZINE! - it takes more than 2 months.Moral is, I'm not buying magazines from Amazon anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not ordering this great mag from Amazon","review":"I am canceling the order I put in today for this great mag.

Maybe for you.","review":"I got my subscription free with an Amazon purchase, but this magazine was a waste on me. If you are under thirty and enjoy getting emails without capitalization and punctuation, this is your magazine. If you pay $30 for a t-shirt that looks 30 yrs old and you paid extra for the tears in your $60+ jeans then you might like this magazine. Now if you remember Abercrombie & Fitch when it was the high end Eddie Bauer or LL Bean, then this might not be your type of magazine...very busy with no real substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wired Review","review":"I do not like this magazine. I only agreed to the subscription because it was free. I would like to STOP its delivery. DO NOT CHARGE MY CREDIT CARD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wired","review":"I tried to return this (it was a gift but I then found out that the recipient was already receiving it). Got the run-around from both Amazon and Conde Nast (the publisher). I can't seem to get it canceled nor can I get a refund (I've now called both at least twice). Horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite magazine.","review":"The only thing I would really like Wired to improve is their access to the digital version. I've been a happy subscriber for years, which means I can access the digital version as well as the print that is delivered to my house. Problem is, I don't own an iPad or a Nook; since I have a Nexus 7 I appear to be out of luck. This just doesn't seem right and I hope they resolve it very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many insert ads that they have to send it in a bag","review":"I subscribed to Wired to give it a shot as it was on sale for $10/year at the time. I wouldn't and won't subscribe again. There are some interesting articles here and there, but they are really geared to those who live, dream, and eat tech. I cannot stand getting each issue now. You open the bag and 4-5 advertisements fall on your lap right away. Then it's a non stop hassle when you try going through the pages. They are everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where would I be without Wired?","review":"I should start out by saying that I am a hardcore \\"nerd\\" but mask it in my daily life as I'm now a father, business owner, etc.Wired is one of those \\"mainsteam\\" nerdy magazines that seems to satisfy my monthly lust for technology, new ideas, and inside information into businesses that I've always wondered \\"how did they do that?\\"I like the magazine because it doesn't try to be something it isn't....it's just consistently good information that keeps me reading month after month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite magazine","review":"Wired Magazine is extremely interesting. If you like tech, culture trends, video games, cars, future predictions, reviews and news this magazine is definitely worth a look.

I've been reading Wired for years and it continues to be relevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, its time has passed.","review":"I used to love Wired, and read every issue cover-to-cover. Unfortunately, it's now just a shadow of its former self. Since being sold to Conde Nast publications (or even before?), Wired has been stripped of its meat and transformed into even more of an ad-laden pseudo-catalog than it once was. The irony of the title has become even more obvious as online forums and publications have matured while Wired's writing has lost its urgency and its ad/content ratio has degraded. Unless you're looking for a catalog of geek toys to flip through, your money is better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the subscription and worth renewing","review":"This is one of the very few magazines that I have renewed once the initial subscription ran out. Great articles for the technology geek and for just those who want to be informed of interesting contemporary events, items, and issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good way to stay wired to what's new in the world of tech","review":"I've been reading this magazine for years on and off but didn't subscribe until now because Amazon was offering a discount with some other purchase that I made. I've always liked the magazine, but it seems that lately it has become less techie and more into other subjects and some of the \\"fluff\\" articles that seem more commercial than a lot of the \\"hack into it yourself\\" articles of the past. Nonetheless, I still enjoy it although I don't read it cover to cover like I used to.It's a good magazine for finding out about the newest devices and has certainly been a factor in influencing my shopping over the years. There is always something that I can't wait to buy that I didn't even realize existed. It also contains a lot of good information and often answers questions about problems with computers or other electronics.It's a fun magazine and I'd recommend for anyone who has an interest in computers, electronics and new technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magazine for more than just the Technically Gifted","review":"I originally purchased this magazine subscription for my son who can make anything work without a manual, but since he is away at college, I am now reading it. It has exciting and interesting articles, and I enjoy it very much, even as a person who needs much help just setting up a new e-mail account. Very captivating reading--I would recommend it to anyone who really wants to learn, not just read about new technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"The survivor!","review":"If you are interested in the digital world this is a good magazine to read.

There is a reason this is one of a very few who survived!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuous, But Oh So Glossy!","review":"The allure of Wired is entirely beyond me. My problem with Wired is that it is devoid of content. In any given issue, the sum information that it provides could neatly be spread onto a low-tech 3x5 index card. Despite its pretense, Wired offers all of the stimulating substance of an issue of Tiger Beat or an episode of Mamma's Family. The magazine is far more concerned with glossy advertisements and mini-features that barely run over 200 words. If you actually want articles that delve into a subject with an expertise that is accessible without being alienating, then do not subscribe to this magazine. All in all, Wired seems to provide nothing more than a means for techno-yuppies to shop for new gadgets, and in that respect it actually does a fantastic job of mirroring the Web itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"ripoff","review":"This should get a Zero.

The tech reviews have absolutely no depth to them. Most articles are rather pretentious and boring. In the 5 issues I have received so far only the May 2006 issue had any thing interesting. And it only had two articles which were worth it. The first was \\"Robbed Blind\\" which was about RFID chips and the second article was \\"DIY ways to go green\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Not Wired, More like Science Magazine.","review":"I ordered this magazine for myself because I am in web design and wanted to stay up-to-date with technology. The description of the magazine sounded like it fit this bill, plus had rave reviews. I am three issues in and could not be more disappointed! I want to cancel this magazine!There is very little in this magazine that has to do with technology of any kind. It is filled with ads, and any actually material seems to be more like science than technology. I mean, how they give elephants vasectomy?! What the heck does this have to do with being \\"wired\\" or technology. This is science.I have also found that the topics on the cover are either not in the magazine or they are a tiny blurb and not a article.This magazine is really bad.

What else do you need to read if you are genuinely interested in getting to know what to happen?Not just about technology or politics but more about techno-politics as in geo-politics or socio-politics. As technology plays more and more crucial role in every aspect of business, culture, politics and society, WIRED still shines as a guiding post for the readers looking for interdisciplinary insight into the future.It seems other magazines or news media follow the issues two or three months after WIRED tackled them. WIRED also introduced me to further readings and great authors such as Lawrence Lessig and Scott McCloud to name a few. I highly recommend WIRED for anyone I meet.THANKS WIRED FOR ENTERTAINING ME WITH PRECIENT AND INTELLIGENT STORIES.jean"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Technology Inside","review":"Despite the dot.com implosion and tech industry chaos reverberating throughout Silcon Valley/Alley, Wired nontheless continues to publish excellent articles on important technological breakthroughs around the world. Why would I associate Wired with NASDAQ hysteria? Well, around the same time Startup.com was being filmed, I felt the magazine was focusing too heavily on the Horatio Algers of the world, placing more importance on the players than the technology. Alas, all good things come to an end and we return to our roots, which for Wired, was thankfully a place where interesting technology matters. I've renewed my subscription 4 times now, and will continue to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for back issues!","review":"Price is great!

However, the last few issues have been filled with advertisements. It got to the point with the latest isse that I ended up halfway through and quit reading the magazine and just started counting the ads. There was an advertisement on every other page. Sadly it is time to let this subscription lapse and move on to something that puts more effort into filling the pages with content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wired Magazine","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of the most exciting, visually and mentally stimulating magazines I have ever read.

Unlike other hard-tech magazines I read, WIRED is unique in that it places a \\"human\\" face on technology, no matter how razor-edged it might be. How many tech and/or hard science magazines even pretend to present the \\"big picture\\"? Humans are developing tech at a furious rate, and WIRED helps me ponder tech's implications/impact on society, the environment, finance, etc. Yes, I am interested not only in tech, but in hard and soft sciences, socio-economics, politics and other arenas which impact our world. WIRED satisfies all these interests."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read, look forward to it arriving each month","review":"This a quite a magazine.

But one day last year I was casually looking through one at his place and was hooked on it! I got a subscription for myself after having borrowed his old ones, which he always wanted returned to him. I read this magazine for the entertainment and information about techie stuff that I don't typically get exposed to otherwise. They have a wide variety of products, technologies and companies represented in the articles, which keeps things interesting. I like to get cultural perspectives and ideas from reading it and I feel informed about what is happening with technology that will surely impact my life soon if it hasn't already without me knowing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"While \\"Wired\\" remains at the forefront of technology magazines, a few things keep it from truely reaching greatness.In every issue there is always a few interesting articles; but the writing and editing seems, at times, fairly unprofessional. Also the magazine tends to lack focus in reaching their target audience (are they trying to appeal towards 20 to 30 somethings with a technology related career? Because I'm in this category and the topics and writing sometimes seems geared toward even younger readers).Fortunately the cost of \\"Wired\\" evens out all of its downfalls. At $10 for 12 issues it's worth it for even one good article a month and it still remains an informative and interesting magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Fluff, Not an Electronics Buying Guide","review":"This magazine does not just high light the newest in gadgetry, but is an analysis of technology, and its social implications. It is fascinating to read the big picture, not big as in \\"internet\\" but big as in western civilication's impact on and changes caused by techonology and global communication.Sure it shows you hot new gadgets, but it also predictions, explains and deduces what those gadget mean in the grand scheme of things.It is always a fascinating read. Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase here","review":"Good magazine, but if you are an international subscriber, don't purchase here.

Then I saw a 1-year sub here for $10. Boy have I regretted spending that $10 on this rag. Not much in it is Techy anymore. Most of it seems to be just gossipy trash promoting wacko psuedo science and thinly veiled political viewpoints. I just throw them away now without bothering to even crack them open. Also almost every other page is a full page ad and what pages aren't full page ads have quarter to half sized page ads. No wonder this thing is $10 for a year, it's not even worth that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for homes with young children","review":"Even thought many of the articles are interesting and well written, I will never renew this subscription. This magazine came to my home with a very vulgar ad for GQ shrink wrapped with the magazine. The picture was blatantly displayed full page on the back of the Wired magazine. I have young children at home and having a magazine delivered to my mailbox with a completely naked woman (and I mean completely) positioned to hide the bare minimum isn't acceptable.

Irreverent and snarky writing style can be seriously funny. I usually laugh out loud at least once per issue as I read it.

It seems like a lot to pay for a magazine that has so many ads."},{"rating":"1","title":"a tremendous disappointment","review":"this magazine has much going for it but almost, without fail, falls far short. The articles, mostly, have the merits to be decent read and something you can find informative, unfortunately --either the editors edit out the content or the writers only write fluff-- the articles are filled with nothing of substance. For instance, in an article several years ago about the need to move to nuclear power, the author tries to disprove all other forms of power in one 6 sentence paragraph. Now if that isn't fair reporting, then I guess I don't know what an argument is. Afterwards, as most articles in Wired, it starts fluffing out instead of actually reporting anything.In short, the reviews only look at the neatest features and not the price or quality (ie the review is nothing more than you can find by 5 minutes at Best Buy). The articles suck, give you nothing, and make you a little bit more ignorant of subject matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needle in a Haystack","review":"After reading many interesting articles on the Wired website, I figured I'd try the magazine since it is cheap.

The first issue that arrived is this one pictured, the underworld issue, and it tells you how to smuggle coke on an airplane, gives some fabulous information on human body part sales on the black market, and an informative breakdown of the ingredients in heroin.

This year I am a different school, so I bought a 1 yr subscription. This magazine is perfect for the discriminating readers who want a little bit of everything. Science is a main part, but is subtlety hidden. Plus you won't feel embarrassed when your friends walk in, like other magazines such as People.

Maybe my excitement had built too much during the 3 months it took for the damn thing to arrive, but the first issue was quite disappointing.

It tries to be a lot of things (new technology reporter, product reviewer, political commentator) but doesn't quite cut it in any of these categories. As a result it becomes a rather disjointed read. In the end you get bored quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wired Magazine","review":"Mag is not very good. Apparently, this was an auto renew but I wasn't notified...not very professional.

It is simply not worth subscribing to.Why? The writers either fawn excessively over some product or person or they are so naive that they believe anything a celebrity/writer/etc tells them. You could sell them just about any story as real even if it was about aliens in Roswell. I have never encountered a magazine that continually passes off truths based on total hearsay.

Namely stuff you don't have, stuff you can't afford, and stuff that if you do own you aren't using to its full potential. The stuff is so pervasive through the magazine that it's hard to tell ads from articles. And the ads. You have to go through 15 pages of ads just to get to the table of contents. After that it's another 15 pages before you get to any content. The categories are so eclectic you never know what you're getting in each issue. One issue may contain reviews of folding bicycles while another issue will have the beauty secrets of Japanese teens. Online stories from Wired are among the most informative and well researched out there. In the magazine there usually aren't more than 2 that are worth reading. Wired represents traditional print competing with online sources. If you were to open up 20 random web pages, you'll get a pretty good approximation of what Wired is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really that good","review":"Maybe I'm way too geeky for Wired. I find the content neither serious enough to be taken seriously, nor hip enough so I can impress women on the subway reading it.

Not that either one of these really falls into the category of \\"racing\\" movies. This thing just outright sucked! Save your money.

Cole is involved in a near fatal wreck and falls for his doctor(Nicole Kidman). He struggles to get back to his old ways on the race track, but eventually gets back to his old self.

Nascar is badass and it needs to have a film that does it some justice. Also Nicole Kidman as a Nascar babe? Bob Duval and Randy Quaid rock. Nascar is all about mustaches and dudes named Randy.

It has cardboard characters, and was pretty bad. However, I must say, I did read it to the end in one sitting, and what more can you ask of an author? I might even be willing to give the author another try. I was orginally going to say the plot was predictable, but who could imagine a catholic church full of cold blooded killer priests and an actual inquisitional torture chamber (with blacksmith type torturer, even!). Why would they have such a place? \\"To keep in practice\\" as the priests say in the book! I fault the editor, however, more than the author, who is fairly new at the business. All it would have taken was a stress on this group being a separatist, crazy faction, and it would have been more believable, and less crude.But, hey, if you want a couple of hours of adventure reading, with an interesting premise, it is worth that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Read","review":"I picked up this book because the original paperback cover had 3 pages with increasingly interesting statements and pictures. What I found was one of my absolute favorite books. I have reread this book several times over the years and in my enthusiasm begged my brothers to try to read it. They hated reading and after just the prologue they were hooked! Since then they have read almost all of James Rollin's books. (Even though I still find it odd to see them stuck in a book). He has written some wonderful stories, but excavation will stick with me forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This was a great book...a pleasure to read. A lot of these reviewers on here do not know how to give a review. They'll say 'the book was good, but...' then they go on to point out small things, eventually giving the book 3 or 4 stars. The object of the book should be to allow you to enjoy the read, period. No book is perfect, mmkay? Was the book a pleasure to read? Most likely yes, so then give it 5 stars. It preformed it's function correctly alright. I've learned to quit going by the reviews here on Amazon because people just don't know how to do it correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excavation'- definitely NOT Rolins best work","review":"I think James Rollins is a great adventure/history/science/archaeology type author. Unique in the blend and very fun and interesting to read. I arrived on the James Rollin scene a bit later, however, having read the Sigma Force books first, then 'Ice Hunt'. I expected the same quality in all his works. 'Excavation', however, just does not cut the Rollins mustard. It has a fairly interesting story- not as imaginative as most of his works- but, well, to be honest, it reads like it was written by the graduate students in the novel. Never was edited by the thesis advisor, however. I think I'll skip 'Subterranean' and just wait for ' The Doomsday Key '."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible (not Horror) Story","review":"What a ridiculous book! Preston Douglas you ought to be ashamed to have a positive comment on the front jacket of Excavation. This book does not compare to any of your excellent stories - either real or fiction. Readers - don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little... simple","review":"This read more like a first book from an author. The story just seemed a little forced at times, and the dialog was a little silly. I didn't really end up caring much about the characters despite the authors obvious efforts to get me too. The fact that it was so obvious should tell you something. I did read the whole thing and it was ok. Fairly predictable, but still interesting. Somewhat of a Clive Cussler story, without the interesting characters. If I wasn't on a plane I'm not sure if I would of finished it or not. Sorry, it just didn't grab me."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"Obviously mine is not the popular opinion, but I found Excavation to be terribly disappointing. Granted, I have not read Subterranean, so maybe I was assuming too much of Rollins as an author. Still, from the Irish character whose brogue comes and goes (and never actually convincingly), to the ridiculous conclusion, I have to say that I felt I had wasted my time. My apologies to his fans...obviously I'm in the minority. As fascinating as the peripheral images of the book were, and even at times the plot itself, I felt overall it was pretty disappointing. It gets one star for having an interesting title, and one star for the character Denal. I did like him."},{"rating":"2","title":"He has better books","review":"I enjoyed the read, but think that he has many other better books. If you like a fast read with a somewhat predictable ending, you will enjoy this book. It is worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turns and Twists","review":"The story has several turns and twist, along with with a variety of characters. The end is not what was expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUPED!!!","review":"I purchased this book recently because it was touted as a \\"new\\" book. Paid hardback price for it - and when I began reading it, well, familiarity rang out. I checked my book shelf - which I should have done to begin with - and there IN PAPERBACK, was Excavation. This hardback is a reprint and I should have read the fine print closer. My mistake. So I donated the paperback to the library and put the hardback on the shelf. This book is okay - barely. Reads like Indiana Jones and Harry Potter and not up to Rollins' ability - but it is still a Rollins and I am a die hard fan. So next time I read the text closer and don't purchase twice. Still - READ the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stark out of reality","review":"Although great part of the book's fast paced, how many alien persecutions can you read in a book? How many times can they get out of trouble to find another one a sec later? So to keep this review short, after the third persecution you'll start to bore of reading the same again and again.The book's finish is scrumptiously preposterous. I don't know if there is or not some kind of alien's life somewhere in the universe. But if they had the technology described in this book they wouldn't have been discovered by anyone. Not today and not 500 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more research","review":"I made it to page 22 before I found glaring errors in Mr Rollins'research. Some people might call it nitpicking BUT I am a CT tech and it irritates me to have someone talk about CT and then describe a MRI machine. CT scanners do not clank, the sound is a whirring noise that the x-ray tube makes as it rotates around the scanning bed. There are no magnets involved in CT--the CT is a modified x-ray machine designed to take a volume of information and convert the data to images showing the inside of the body. The error is akin to having a fictional surgeon using a rib spreader to do an appendectomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Read","review":"Good premise to begin but this got more and more out there as it went. I'm sorry I continued to devote time to it so I could get to the finish--it was wierd, unbelieveable and amaturish. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"J. Rollins has me reading like I've never done....","review":"Since gobbling-up his first novel, Subterranean, I've continued with this one and was even more pleased. I was simply immersed in this world: the story was gripping, fast-paced, new and exciting. I can \\"see\\" his imagery. The ending had me on the edge of my seat! I've already teed-up his his next novel in my Kindle, and off I go...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never a Dull Moment","review":"I hated the fact this book came too an end. I wanted it to keep going. James Rollins won't let you be bored with his writing, he just keeps things happening. This is great to read at night especially, if you don't want to catch any sleep, it'll keep you up. Beyond summer reading fare, if you are finding yourself with nothing to do, this book will keep you happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"High adventure in the Andes","review":"A friend lent me a copy of Subterranean. I loved it then went out to buy a copy for my own library and there was another Rollins book! I grabbed it up. Read it in 2 days! I literally could not put it down. It kept drawing me deeper and deeper into the story, until the big surprise on the very last page. Well done! I will be first in line for the next Rollins book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book first!","review":"I read Excavation first, then Subterranean (all in the same week). I enjoyed Excavation better due to the amount of scientific detail, and I found Subterranean's level of action to be a bit over the top at times. I give Excavation five stars, Subterranean four."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"This book makes you wonder about humans as a species, where we are genetically and where we are headed. You may not be able to put this one down, I couldn't, and the ending will leave you speechless and wondering. A definite must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly as Silly can be","review":"Yes, I read this book so I'm to blame, it was so far fetched and unbelievable, I was somewhat embarrassed while reading it, so if anyone asked me if I read any good books lately? I usually kept this one to myself.Two things I didn't like were the Space Gold, and 3 tiers of existence. If you read the book you'll know what I talking about. TOO SILLY for me.However if you're only into brain candy books this is the one for you. It has Non-stop action, funny dialogue and interesting characters make this fun \\"for kids.\\" This could make a good cartoon movie. Sorry it doesn't have that Preston and Child quality I was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rip-snorting Pulp Adventure","review":"Rollins has an utter lack of pretense or literary aspirations, but he surely can write a pulp-style adventure yarn.This Indiana Jones/Doc Savage type romp has everything but the kitchen sink. Subterranean was a bit restrained and a hair more conventional, but this time Rollins gives us gold, murderous mutants, an Incan temple, ancient alien astronauts, psychic powers, and the Spanish Inquisition (and who expects that!).It's all neat, and consistent and barrels forward with plenty of energy. A great read for sheer ham-fisted fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"Not one of my favorites, despite being set in one of my favorite locales. I found it difficult to get into, perhaps because Rollins mixes too much sci-fi into what I expected to be an archeolgical plot. I'm not much of a fan of paranormal fiction, and Rollins apparently is. He must have wanted to mix several genres to see how it might go over. I think you really, really have to like \\"high\\" adventure to appreciate this book (or be high). If you like the movie \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" with Richard Chamberlain, this is probably a book for you. If you expect more substance, nore believability, and want a more engrossing storyline, I'd recommend Grisham's \\"Testament,\\" Marcotte's \\"Gold in the Shadow,\\" Preston's \\"The Relic,\\" or even Cussler's \\"Serpent.\\" If you liked \\"Subterranean\\" and enjoy Rollins' overall style, you may like it more than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Seen This Movie Before","review":"Having enjoyed the author's previous novel _Subterranean_, I figured _Excavation_ would be just as good, but it really wasn't. Rather, it tries too hard be the next Indiana Jones movie, complete with the sort of ancient booby traps that were cool in _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ but come off as derivative in this novel. Things eventually degenerate into the standard action-movie cliches, right down to the Exploding Temple and Kiss the Girl happy ending. Yadda yadda. Very disappointing, since the author can clearly do better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, solid book.","review":"EXCAVATION is not the best book in the world, but ranks up there with one I would recommend. It held my attention, and that right there says something. Other reviewers have complained at the implausibe ending. To this, I just say that is a matter of opinion on whether that will ruin the story for you. Me, I like creative stories that break from the normal action-thriller books. To me, if I heard the ending was too sci-fi, that would just urge me to read the book MORE. It would just say, there was something mysterious to look forward to, and it wouldn't end with a six-o'clock news story ending.All in all, if you like the idea of a group digging up ancient secrets and thrown into action-packed, life or death struggles leading up to one out-of-this world ending, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The ending was extremely disappointing. If there had been a plausible scientific explanation at the end of the book, I would've given it 4 stars. But, in the last chapter, it seemed like Rollins was out of ideas and fell back on a lame, cop-out ending (it was all the aliens!!!). DUH? What the . . .? It made me SO mad that I had wasted all the time reading the book. I wish I could say it was worthwhile. I definitely do *not* recommend. There are far better adventures out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble-gum for the brain","review":"Pure mindless entertainment is what this book is. The writing is atrocious, characters are flatter than the state of Florida, subtlety virtually nonexistent. The whole enterprise can be described in two words: Indiana Jones. If you liked that movie, you will most definitely like \\"Excavation\\". Is it fun to read? You bet. With the whole plot consisting of a series of adventures, each more unbelievable than the previous one, this is a perfect brain-free reading. Prepare to roll your eyes about every 15 pages or so as we're treated to various utterly lame attempts to bring characters to life by bestowing upon them a bouquet of psychological issues ranging from survivor's guilt to post-divorce romance.Apparently this is not James Rollins' first book. And since person's writing tends to improve with each successive book, I can only shudder when wondering just how much worse his previous attempts at writing were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bury It!","review":"Merciful Zeus! Let no innocent excavate Excavation! Bury the path to its covers for eternity with flaming lava spouted from Mount Olympus! Cast this book into the deepest fathoms beneath the mighty Kraken's lair! Seal it forever in grim Hades' darkest vault! Or mercifully blind the good populace of Athens like King Oedipus, that their eyes may never accidentally transgress all that is holy and fall upon these pages, ever after to be haunted by the foul Furies that plague the House of Agamemnon!Or at least warn them, Zeus, warn them that this book is a nine-year-old's crayon novelization of the Richard Chamberlain movie version of King Solomon's Mines!Please, Zeus, please! I beg you, on my knees!Never mind, Zeus. I'll do it for you.Seriously, this book is so badly researched and inconsistent, it makes Marvel comic books read like Classics Illustrated. Even a lower-I.Q. junior high school student wouldn't believe any of it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Originality?","review":"This was one really bad book. It pained me to read adventure book cliche after cliche. Mr. Rollins must be a big fan of Indiana Jones, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Congo, as well as a host of other books and movies, as this book had plenty of ideas borrowed from them.My recommendation... Skip this piece of pop literature garbage and get a classic adventure novel instead. You'll be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"about as good as getting your teeth pulled","review":"i really didn't like this novel, this tries to mix cheap indiana jones style adventure, a romance novel, and a sci-fi book all into one and fails. If you really want a good book grab The Relic by Douglas Preston."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am revising my previous review","review":"Previously, I thought this was a pretty awful book, but worth sitting for an hour or two if you had nothing better to do. Yet, it has haunted me. Its putrid plot has risen to the top of my list of appalling books. And yet, somehow, it has generated enough opinion to merit over 50 reviews!! That is more than some of Iris Murdoch's wonderful books. And it has garnered some really high ratings. 5 stars! Amazing. That would put it on a par with War and Peace. Golly! I stand in awe of the public's taste. Having said all that negative stuff, I think any book that can generate that much discussion, and willingness to review, must have some merit i missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It kept me reading before, during & after my flight","review":"While some people may say that the plot steals something from other books and some others say that there are no plots left unturned in this book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. In fact, I ran a search on Amazon to find out what else he has written.You can read some of the other reviews to find out the plot, ending, etc., but, I really enjoyed this fast paced book.Nuf said...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great allegory","review":"This novel has everything: it is a horror novel - it is a science novel - it is also a thriller. And it is well written. We have credible characters, we have a well developed plot, and we have action - tremendous action. The novel combines the qualities of the good old Gothic horror novel with the action thriller of today. And the author has created an excellent combination here. The old world clashes with modern civilization, and our code of values is at stake. In a way this is what happens all the time at the moment. Perhaps this is what makes this book so readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVOLUTION 101","review":"THIS IS THE SECOND BOOK I'VE READ BY ROLLINS, AND HE SEEMS TO WRITE THE SAME BOOK OVER, AND OVER AGAIN, IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS.I READ HIS NEWEST BOOK AMAZONIA BEFORE READING THIS ONE, AND I FIND THE PLOTS TO BE VERY SIMILAR. HIS INTEREST IN WRITING NOVELS IS ONLY A MEDIA TO PREACH HIS RELIGION OF EVOLUTION. (WHICH I DON'T ADHERE TO!) THIS BOOK HAS A BIT TOO MUCH ROMANCE INTEREST FOR MY TASTE, TO THE EXCLUSION OF ACTION SCENES THIS BOOK REALLY NEEDS TO BE TRULY INTERESTING(FOR MY TASTES.) OTHER READERS HAVE COMPARED HIS BOOKS TO AN INDIANA JONES MOVIE - NOT QUITE! TRY INSTEAD MATHEW REILY'S \\"TEMPLE\\" IF YOU REALLY WANT AN ARCHEOLOGICAL STORY THAT \\"ROCKS\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Entertaining","review":"This is not the type of book I uaually read, but when heavy rain kept me indoors for two week this summer I was desperate. I picked up this novel and I was immediately hooked. It was a really great book! It grabs you from the start and dosen't let you down and the story is very well told. However, be warned it is a little weird, it starts off normal, but then... Overall I was impressed by this book, and I'll probably be reading his first book and keeping an eye out for any new ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excavation","review":"You simply cannot go wrong with a James Rollins book! I have read every title he has written. Some are better than others, but they all have a unique subject line and his research into said subjects is thorough. Excavation is intriguing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Entertaining and exciting. It captivated my imagination. I am a Rollins fan and can't seem to put his books down. This wan didn't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"forgot I was reading this book.........","review":"I love this type of book, but this one was very hard to stick with. The action was good, the characters had potential, great story line.It was just a bumpy ride, no flow, hard to get into. At one point I picked up another book and completely forgot about this one!The only reason I made myself finish it was because I wanted to find out the end. Pass on this, there are so many more good books!Try Patrick Lee's \\"The Breach\\" instead - now there is a book you will think about all day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there before","review":"James Rollins had to spend a lot of late nights watching old movies as he wrote this book because reading it felt like jumping in and out of scenes from familiar movies. First there are the obvious Raiders Of The Lost Ark scenes. Then there are there are scenes that seemed to come from The Time Machine. Throw in a touch of Star Trek: DS9, Lost Horizon, and James Bond and you've got most of the book covered.I found it hard to finish. Had I not been traveling and in need of something to kill time, I probably wouldn't have finished it. Aside from the fact that probably 85% of the book was predictable, I found the author's refrences to the Catholic religion disturbing. His words are filled with bigotry and hatred to the point that I almost felt I was reading some hate group's propaganda. AND I'M NOT EVEN CATHOLIC.It will have to take an exceedingly long, boring trip before I pick up another James Rollins novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea + lousy writing = disappointing read","review":"If you're a fan of the Preston/Childs books, you might be drawn to this adventure story, but watch out. It's about as hokey as they come. From an embarrassingly bad romance between two aging archeologists to an even more embarrassing friendship between a redneck gay-basher and his new gay buddy (he learns, of course, that gays are \\"just like us\\") this book suffers from too much PC garbage, too much sappy dialogue, and too many derivative plot devices.I was bothered by Preston's apparent endorsement of the book (his comment, \\"it's a real page turner,\\" is emblazoned on the cover of the paperback). But I guess if you take Preston literally, the comment makes sense. Yes, the book is a \\"real page turner\\" -- I ended up skipping more of them than I actually read.If you're looking for a good adventure story in the Preston/Childs mold, try \\"Neanderthal,\\" or Crichton's \\"Timeline.\\" Rollins just isn't a good enough writer to carry it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't I Read All This Before Somewhere?","review":"Reading James Rollins gives one a tremendous experience of deja vu. These adventures seem to be cobbled together from everything and everywhere in a hit or miss way that keeps the reader asking himself if he's read this before. Well, he has. Probably in childhood adventure stories and all the modern thriller writers. Only it's all been done better and it's all been done to death. While this \\"writer\\" may have a following, I prefer not to read light thrillers that should have footnotes giving credit to other source material. Maybe something original would be nice. All authors build on the work of others but they all don't borrow as blatantly and produce epics like these in a by-the-numbers method on an assembly line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story concept, disappointing result","review":"From a conceptual standpoint, Excavation presents a very attractive package of adventure-style reading. Unfortunately, the author is nowhere near skilled enough to deliver on this promise. What you find are wooden, stereotypical characters and illogical plot developments, leading to the realization that the book just isn't good enough to invoke true suspension of disbelief in a discerning reader.The ending is extremely weak, following a general decline in excitement and core cohesiveness as the book progresses. In the end, I was left wondering what the concept could have been like in the hands of a more competent writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Display - Garbage !!!","review":"An outstanding display of GARBAGE !!! This is the second book by him that I read (the first was The Judas Strain - a little bit better than this one). Thousands of Tarantulas, hoards of Monster Cave-Dwellers and add a lost Inca Tribe. Why waste your time on this author when they are some Good Authors out there ???"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a reprint of an older book, NOT A NEW BOOK","review":"Even though this just came out in hardback, it was originally published in 2000. It's early Rollins and not all that good, with some very creepy parts. I mostly wanted to alert readers that this is not new, since one would naturally ASSUME that a new hardback is a new title.Personally, I find it poor business practice to try to cheat the readers with this type of tactic. While it does say on the copyright page that it was originally copyrighted in 2000, everything else about it is as if it's a new title. Save your money, pick it up as a used paperback, it's not worth more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"Ok, I think I need to start ordering more than 2 books at a time!Again a book I couldn't put down.This one is filled with excitement!Definately a page turner!

Something else happens and you find yourself still turning the pages!Way to go James! Keep them coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters please - not cartoons","review":"Ever read a book that just screamed - \\"Make this into a movie that teen age boys will go see?\\" Heavy on action, quick paced plot and characters drawn with crayon... oh and the perfect hollywood action flick ending.If anyone else has read the book... Maggie's seizures... dehabilitating and then they disappear, completely gone \\"poof\\".Oh, and the bad guys? Well, nobody ever expects them ;-)Not even a twinge of piety? - and the sadistic drooling torturer - geez! \\"Central casting... big guy, balding, big belly - leacherous looking would be good... just for one scene - oh, would be good if he was comfortable around pyrotechnics\\"Save a few bucks - wait for the movie - or maybe just the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more excavation","review":"This is, in my opinion, a really poorly written book. Had read Subterranean and thought it was much better, although suffering from some of the same problems. The author uses all of the stereotypes you can imagine-blacks die, gays are weak, Texans are heroes, etc. The language sounds like a grade-B movie of 50 years ago. A 30 minute plane ride in the Andes is described as being a four hour flight. The best thing about the book is the plot, and it's pretty weak. Very little technical research done,if any, for this book. I won't buy this author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down.","review":"If you like action...you'll like this book. And if you get this, get his other books, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put this in your shoping cart now!","review":"This is the first book that I have read by James and it will not be the last. I could not set it down. Very intriging concept. I am usually one to be discouraged by long chapters, This book only has 7 chapters all about 80 pages, but I could not stop reading it. It just kept going and going and getting better and better. I can't wait for my next Amazon order to get the other two books. If you are reading this order this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indiana Jones...the B-rated version.","review":"Mr. Rollins has compilied a group of characters that reads like the cast list for a USA Up All Night movie. I was amazed at the marks my fellow reviewers gave this novel. I fought the yawns through page after page of this journey into ancient Incan mystery, and to be honest; I don't have the energy to do it once again to point out the many reasons that this novel is bland. So be warned my fellow readers, wait for some fool film company to make this into a movie and watch it. At least that way you will only waste 90 minutes of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"The beginning of this book was very dynamic and really pulled me in, and the plot I really did like as it had a great Indiana Jones feel to it. But the characters were made of cardboard and unbelievable, with the dialogue between them almost painful. So much so I just gave up on the book two thirds of the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old story","review":"The book started out very well, seemed to have a good story line and an engaging story line. Had a little of Indiana Jones at the beginning when they were trapped in the cave. Then the plot turned to the same old story line, I think the Rollins books use the same story line and just change the hero's and setting. Again, too much sci-fi. I was given many of the Rollins books for Christmas, I wished the money would have been spent on something else. I have 5 more books to read, I just hope one of them comes close to a Cussler or Ludlum novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre story","review":"This book starts well, so you get drawn into the characters to some extent. At about 75% through you realise you have just wasted 3 hours reading this crap. Ludicrous story topped off with a even more ludicrous twist that is explained in the last page as an afterthought.This should have been a B grade telemovie. The premise is OK, just really badly implemented in the last half of the book. I want my money and my time back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gread Read!!","review":"I really liked this book as it was filled just enough reality that it could happen. It is very well written and easy to follow and just a great Adventure story. I have all of his books and I have enjoyed them all. James Rollins seems like a really nice guy too. He sighned all my books and even spent a little lime talking with me about them. His books are that way too. very personable and real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the Premise But...","review":"I liked the description on the cover....liked the beginning chapters....then holes in the characters and in the premise started building up. By the time I got half way into the book, the unbelievability of the entire story got to be too much to continue. The traps and obstacles built into the underground rooms by the ancients, the \\"bad guys\\" above ground, the lame rescue scenario, etc., etc., got to be too much. I finally did what I seldom do and quit without finishing the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great after Amazonia","review":"I read Amazonia first and loved it. This novel was not as well-structured and compelling as Amazonia. Excavation was a really solid idea and exciting premise with the liquid gold idea, but it kind of flattened and got somewhat trite toward the end. I liked it very very much and will read more of Rollins' work definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indiana Jones meets X-Files","review":"Excavation is a very fast read, grabs you from the first page and doesn't let go. This is my first James Rollins book and I was very impressed. The story and characters hold up well, and yes I do believe the catholic church is arrogent enough to TRY to bring about the second coming... The only problem I had with the book was that the climax was too short, it was almost like Rollings had just so many pages to work with, because the book just ended. But the last couple of pages are very interesting. Leaves you thinking, Could this book be the first of a series? Now if you liked Raider's or the X-Files you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"Excavation was the first book that I had read which was written by James Rollins. The book was excellent the first time I read it, but the second time it just wasn't as good. His first book, Subterranean was was a better book, and worth reading again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I had such high hopes for this book. Thank heaven, someone gave it to me for it is not worth the money to buy it. I liked neither the heroine nor especially the hero. Dead characters, no charisma. I plugged thru to the end and was relieved to finish it. Get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book started great, but then it went to the dumps.","review":"When a person finds a dead body in the basement, you call the police. I can not believe that Tess did not do that. After that the book seemed to go down hill. I figured out that Ike was the skeleton and who had killed him before I was even half way through the book.I did enjoy the interactions of the characters to each other. I really enjoyed Dolly Thorne's daughter, the little princess. I like that Tess was not any wimp by any standards, and the fact that she was not perfect in figuring out the mystery.

The Carriage House started out pretty well and I was excited to start another of her books but several chapters into the book I noticed a big change; the characters had turned to cardboard and most of what they said was stupid and forced. The romance and the suspense had turned to pure boredom. I started wondering if Carla had written the first few chapters and someone else had finished to book for her. It just wasn't the same caliber of author from the first two books I had read."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXCELLENT READ !! BRAVO!!","review":"I loved this book. Actually, I love all of Carla Neggers' books. I love her New England settings and her plots which throw ordinary characters into extraordinary situations. THE CABIN is the perfect book to read on vacation or on a rainy day, but not if you are in the mood for blood and gore and shoot-'em ups. THE CABIN is like a story being told by good friends--you care about what happens because you care about the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started well... then went downhill","review":"As a great fan of romantic suspense, I was really excited by the premise and the interesting beginning of the novel... but as it went along I found myself getting frustrated and wanting to throw the book across the room. Tess's (the heroine's) thoughts seemed to jump around, stupid choices were made (for a supposedly smart woman) and scenes and dialog were sometimes hard to follow. Motivations were often unclear and information omitted. The relationship between Tess and Andrew was very tepid - there was little hint of true passion and growing affection between them, and their meager love scenes were mediocre. The characters of Dolly and Harl were sweet and/or quirky, but not enough to rescue the novel's flaws. I felt sadly let down at the end and expected better of Carla Neggers.

The curved part of the pillow is OK to sleep on if you ONLY sleep on your side, but if you lay on your back and far enough up on the pillow for neck support, the projecting edges poke you in the shoulders. This is built for someone with 10\\" wide shoulders, or some species with an odd anatomy, perhaps with a hump-back or dorsal fin. Weird. I liked my old Contour Pillow that had straight sides, and without the memory foam. The memory foam on this one is too hard. Just not comfortable all around. I see it's out of stock now. I would recommend that Amazon leave it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great shape,WAY TOO FIRM","review":"My husband has a NEARLY identical pillow which has the same shape and the blue foam base but the top layer is foam rubber instead of memory foam. It is by far the best pillow I have ever used(and I have tried MANY-I run a chiropractic clinic). Unsuccessful for years searching for another, I was hopeful for this one. The memory foam is way too firm, so I sliced it off with an electric knife, added 3- 1\\" foam layers to the blue base and I am close to the perfect pillow.

A lot of people said it was superior to other memory foam pillows. Unfortunately, I did not find that to be the case at all. As a petite woman with broad shoulders and a long neck I need a lot of firm support. Not only is this pillow too soft, but it's also too thin! Regular memory foam pillows work much better for me. Now, if only I'd kept the box so I could return this expensive item!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful","review":"I was told by my chiropractor that my neck was not aligned, so I thought I would try this pillow to help support while I slept. I sleep on my side and my back both during the night. The first couple nights I didn't really notice because my back/neck was already in pain, hence looking for a new pillow. Finally after about a week, the pain in my upper back/shoulders/lower neck became unbearable. Last night in the middle of the night, I threw this pillow on the ground and grabbed my old one for the remainder of the night, and when I woke, the pain was less. I'm visiting the chiropractor again today, bringing the pillow with me to ask his opinion. I can't help but think the pillow had something to do with my increased neck/back pain...just be careful, make sure you choose the right one for your position and shoulder height and all that.

There is some information about business etiquette that could potentially be useful for the business traveler.But I find the title to be a misnomer. It isn't a book about doing things the French way. There are very few cues on how to avoid faux pas. This is not a useful book for the average traveler, and I'm sorry I bought it.

This was an explosion waiting to happen and in my opinion, by the time Leo Frank was kidnapped and murdered by a group of thugs, the motivation no longer had anything to do with Mary Phagan's murder - it was just a convenient excuse.If you're interested in this case and plan to only read one book on the subject, this is the one to buy. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"And The Dead Shall Rise","review":"This book is an incredibly detailed and inciteful account of the trial and lynching of Leo Frank for the murder of Mary Phagan in 1913 Marietta, GA. It also explains the Southern and Brooklyn worlds, as they were then, and in doing so gives us a much better understanding of why and how this happened in the first place. It is a HUGE book, so be prepared to be reading for quite awhile, but it is a MUST read for anyone who has an interest in this groundbreaking trial, and in finding out what we ALL need to know about the way Americans were, and can still be, capable of treating others when prejudice and politics rear their ugly heads. This is a trial that should NEVER have gotten as far as it did, and even today, if you ask Georgians about this case, many are still too embarrassed to talk about it, while others still insist that Frank was guilty (he was not).You MUST read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Story","review":"I have not read this book from start to finish yet; however, I bought the book after much research on this particular trial.

I remembered the issues I read in the time of my youth and looked forward to time to read these new issues. The name of the magazine is the same and there are still cartoons, maybe even more cartoons, that are witty. Other than those two things, the new magazine is nothing like the magazine one thinks of when one says The Saturday Evening Post. This magazine is an impostor using an honored name to profit while peddling fluff and hype. Of course, keep in mind that I was looking for something from my youth and that is not always reasonable nor realistic. Don't buy it for its name or you'll likely be disappointed.

I'd reccomend this magazine to anyone who enjoy the Sun, the Globe, the Weekly World News, or any print gurus who want to see how NOT to craft a magazine.

Maybe I should say, a Catholic tweak on world history. By trying to Catholicize history, the author provides a fresh look but makes no contribution and actually distorts many issues.There are major advantages to this book. It gives a point of view not normally found in other texts. It covers history in a readable style. It is primarily a survey book.There are major cons. The author ignores the contributions of major civilizations or glosses oevr them. The author also attributes ideas to time periods where they did not enter into play.

For my history class, our family uses these books. I am big about my Catholic faith, but I cannot recommend this book to people. First off, it presents a VERY biased view of history. Everything revolves around the Church, and while God is the center of our existence, the entire world did not revolve around Catholicism. Another problem is the fact that the viewpoint presented is: If you are not Catholic, you are evil. If someone was Protestant, they are automatically evil, and while there was some truly evil non-Catholics in history, the same goes for the Catholics.All in all, this book seems to be spouting off as much Pro-Catholic, Anti-Everything-Else propaganda as possible.

Our son was expecting to see the astronauts depicted as people.

The game play has a lot more going for it because they added several new ways to play. This game always created a lot of excitement, shouting, laughing, and carrying-on. Now it is even better.The guy who wrote the negative review obviously did not understand that some of the cards are reserved for the new sections of play. And the fact that some have the same answer repeated is not only intentional, but helpful and funny all at the same time.THIS IS A GREATER GAME - (It was already a classic!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"...This version of Outburst (Ultimate)seems to have been thrown together, for the sole purpose of cashing in on the success of the original Outburst(which was excellent). Categories are repeated (\\"GLASS\\" and \\"THINGS MADE OF GLASS\\") and the idea that the repeated words on the cards is meant to be 'part of the game' is ludicrous. The object of the game is to come up with TEN items for the category, not 3 items plus 4 ways of saying the same item! Sloppy quality control if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the original Outburst game","review":"I couldn't believe how BAD this game was. Most cards often have several of the same answers listed. For example: suitcase, a suitcase, the suitcase. I am not joking. It was so prevalent I called the company. They said it is supposed to be that way since people often shout out the same answer! But nowhere in the directions does it tell you to keep shouting out the same answers because they may be listed two or three times. Some cards actually only had 4 or 5 different answers & those answers were just repeated to make the list of 10. It's stupid. My sister was in a marketing/previewing group for this game. It wasn't that way when they previewed it. The new twists on the game such as Reverse Outburst are a good idea, but you can do that with the old game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is a real party pleaser!!!","review":"The perfect game to make the quietest of your friends jump in and start yelling.

Pretty refreshing really!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adults may take it or leave it, but it's a hit for my 7 year old","review":"I admit, endless churning out of Barbie movies every 6-8 months is a bit much. I could take them or leave them; the animation is cute, the story is harmless and of course there's lots of Barbie and her friends movie tie-in merchandise for your Barbie lover. That being said, my 7 year old daughter loves this movie. She enjoys dancing to the songs and has asked to watch it over and over. The good guys win in the end and the evil queen is scary, but not *too* scary. The story has a nice message about how it's ok to be different and unlike many other movies, the title character isn't waiting around for a prince to rescue her and save the day. As I'm not the target audience, I'll give it the five stars and two enthusiastic thumbs up my daughter emphatically states that it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get back to the good stuff.","review":"This was a major disappointment.

Donnie's album the colored section let's us embrace many of the things that we have already known about black life. His songs have conscious lyrics and a strong message: Better yourself!! On Cloud 9 he says, \\"Happy to be nappy/ I'm black and I'm proud/ That I have been chosen to wear the conscious cloud/ And I'm fine under cloud 9\\" Messages such as this stole my mind as well as my ears throughout the whole CD and his point was proven. Proven with a neosoul unique head bopping sound that you probably have not heard since the 70's. His message come across to me like this don't play the blame game because of societies woes.

It is extremely light weight. I have a Trek Valencia with disc brakes and installation was a breeze although looking at where my brake hardware is, I probably didn't need the disc brake version of this rack.I use this rack with the Topeak MTX which fits perfectly and stores all my tools, lock/cable, with enough room for a lunch/snack. I also bought a bungy net cage for it also.Bottom line: I don't think you can lose with this rack. My only beef with it is i feel it should already have a rear tail light reflector or a universal light mounding bracket on it. It does come with a bracket, but no screws for it and it won't fit other mfg lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check width first","review":"The bottom rear of my bike frame where a rack attaches is 6 inches wide, so I emailed Topeak's outsourced customer support to see if this would fit. They said it should fit. When I received it, I found that it was 4 inches wide at the bottom connection points and could not fit.

I've returned it to Bikesource; they've been fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Topeak Explorer Bicycle Rack - Disc Brake","review":"Excellent, sturdy rack which mounted fairly easily. Nice idea with the offset mounting for disc brakes.

This Topeak Explorer rack was really the only solution I found. The assembly was relatively easy, though it required removing the rear wheel and realigning it with the disc brake after putting the wheel back on.A few cons would be(like other reviews have stated) that it scratches easily and it is difficult to find a standard reflector to attach to the rear of it (I ended up using one from a very old road bike). I also had to slightly adjust the hooks on my panniers to fit the large tubing of the rack.None of these cons are really an issue and at the end of the day this is a sturdy rack that gets the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely everything you need to run a successful daycare","review":"I ran a daycare myself for several years and thought I had everything I needed to be a great daycare provider.

Cloaking himself in the persona of a country vampire certainly works for this batch of tunes about such matters as stalking, perversion, lust, drinking, trailer life, and peeping Tom's. Unknown Hinson himself plays all the instruments on this batch of twisted tales, albeit some better than others, but one tends to overlook any deficiencies because his lyrics demand the same careful attention accorded to the mad doctor who tells his helpless victims what is in store before beginning his grim work.I cannot recommend a steady diet of this music, but it does fit well if you are on a weekend escape in a remote cabin or blockhouse, and you can suspend your disbelief long enough to shake your head and grin.

One of the funniest things I have ever heard in my life. Unknown is faithful to the genre while he makes fun of it. He also happens to be a fantastic guitar player.

At the time I was impressed by what I saw; The stage presence, the funny lyrics, and terrific guitar playing. This stuff would sound great on Disc.The one positive is that the lyrics are pretty funny, along with great titles like I make faces when I make love, and the doll song is too funny.One of the attractive aspects of seeing the Unkown one live was the great sound achieve with a three piece band.

The Millinium Edition has a new style of almost transparent plastic currency that is difficult to read. If you hold a bill in your hands for only a few seconds it begins to curl so much so that you cannot read the denomination. Sure, the plastic is trendy and more durable but it curls up and won't uncurl unless pressed flat applying warmth. AND the shiny holographic surface of the board looks great, but try picking up the card stacks to replace a played card. The surface is too slippery. The only upgrades I liked were the new tokens and the stacking houses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. Orange undertones.","review":"I am a huge fan of Paula Dorf makeup. I use her oil free liquid foundation and all her brushes. I have been ordering this powder for over 5 years. The last 2 pressed powders I received are a different formula.

(Why can't toy makers at least get this right? Kids learn by repeating!) Second, you can't turn it off. When you ignore it, Mr. Potato Head yawns and tells the kid to push a button before he goes to sleep. If you have direction-oriented kids as I do, this thing will NEVER turn off. At one point, my 3 year old was apologizing to the toy, saying that she couldn't press the button because she was holding Mama's hand.

My daughter who is 8 now received one when she turned 2 and played with it often. It takes a little learning with trial and error but by the time she was almost 3 she had it down pat. I gave my SIL my daughters this year for her twin boys who will be two in October. There was a problem because they both wanted it at the same time. Be careful around liquids with this toy since that is how they broke it, by spilling milk on it. So, they now each have one that I bought to replace the broke one and it has resolved the fighting over the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightening Grammar","review":"If you do well, Mr. Potato Head says, \\"You did good!\\" Yikes!

I purchased this toy thinking it would be a good diversion for my three-year old on a long car trip. Boy was I wrong. He liked it well enough, but quickly became bored with it. And the fact that you can't turn it off is a real TURN OFF! Arghhh! We have woken up in the middle of the night to hear \\"Hi, I'm Mister Potato Head\\"...when the toy was in the toy box. It seems to be easily 'set-off' and will jabber on for about 5 minutes before shutting itself off. I'd steer clear of this one. There are plenty of other toys out there that DO have an off switch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a good side to not having an off switch!","review":"It saves on batteries! My daughter picked it out at a second hand store when she was 3- the batteries were already in it- I have never replaced them yet a year later. And yes, it HAS gotten many hours of play. (If it did have an off switch, it would get left on and I'd have shelled out plenty for batteries by now) She adored it for quite a while, and her 3yr cousin goes straight to it when she comes over. I don't know that I would pay full price for it, but if you can find it on sale, I think its a good buy. It does at least teach kids how to listen to instructions. My daughter is smart- but impatient. So it was a good tool for her to learn to LISTEN and pay attention to what Mr Potato asks you to do. So if your kid asks for it- I think they will enjoy it! Just ignore Mr P for a few minutes when your kid is done playing with him and he will go to 'sleep' :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A busy Mom","review":"My daughter is five and loves this toy. I was actually shocked to see so many poor reviews. The automatic shut off isnt that bad, it's actually a blessing if you ask me, It prompts the child to play (pay attention) about 4 times and then shuts itself off.My daughter loves the different activities it offers, and she just totally gets a kick out of making Mr. Potato head dress silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This is a game they can play in the car and use there imagination.

My 3 year old son, however, will use this game weekly and be entertained by it for at least 20 minutes. It has been great for car rides and waiting in restaurants. It can be annoying because it takes a while to turn off, but at least it turns off by itself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, be quiet already","review":"My daughter enjoyed this toy for about a week - it was her first handheld game so she was naturally excited about it even though it's not much fun. It's biggest problem is that it doesn't have an OFF button and it goes on and on before it finally gets quiet (back in the days she occasionally played with it, she would shove it into a closet or under a pillow when she was finished). The second biggest problem is that it seems to have a mind of its own and randomly starts talking when no one is touching it (Nothing I hate more than a haunted toy). I haven't even seem my daughter's game since moving into a new house four months ago. I know it's there because I hear it talking on a regular basis. If I ever find it, it's going in the give away pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING!!!!","review":"For one thing you can not turn this game off and it becomes very annoying listening to it prompt you to push a button.Next, it does not hold my daughters attention.

Zamperini certainly led an interesting life, and clearly had a run of incredibly good luck over the decades. His experiences as a captive of the Japanese are interesting in their own right, although there is really nothing exceptional in his story. My biggest complaint about the book -- other than the fact that it's just an average memoir -- is the excessive attention given to his involvement with Billy Graham and his personal faith. Had I known this facet of the story beforehand, I would never had bought the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring story","review":"I read Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken before I read this book. From reading Unbroken, I know that everything he says in this book is true and documented. It is an amazing story. I liked this book better than Unbroken, but would never just read one without the other. This is a story about his life so how can anyone be offended by the fact that he is religious--that is his life. Also, I think you need to be an overly optimistic person in order to have survived all that he did. He is a survivor, and survivors tend to be opportunists and self promoters, but what is wrong with that. I would bet that if he were growing up today he would be diagnosed with ADD or ADHD and would not have been able to have accomplished all that he did because he would have been stifled by treatment and a system that wants everyone to be the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!

After hearing part of his ordeal, I knew this was an interesting man. I just had to read his full story. It was shocking! My husband and daughter also read the book. Once you started reading it, you couldn't put it down. I can't believe he survived after all the horror he went through on the raft for 47 days BEFORE getting rescued by the enemy! His 2 year prison ordeals were so inhumane. I just wanted him to get home safe without anymore harm. I'm happy he conquered his many demons and was able to forgive.

Contrary to some of the comments in other reviews, Zamperini's account of his faith is integral to the story and very well done. Far from \\"preachy\\", this part of the story comes across with the same matter-of-fact honesty and integrity as the rest of his story and is essential to telling the entire story of this very amazing character. Zamperini's honesty throughout this book is very remarkable achievement in itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil at My Heels","review":"This was a great book,by a,humanly great and courageous man.

I also liked his honesty about his feelings and fears when he returned home from Japan as a ex-POW.

From his delinquent childhood, to his running days, to his war experiences, to his post-war life, the authors did a marvelous job.I just wish there had been more details. Not puffery, mind you, just more details I could wallow in.A great read and well worth your time.Enjoy, folks!UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW:I just finished Hillenbrand's book, \\"Unbroken,\\" and in it, I found the details that were lacking from Zamperini's book. \\"Unbroken\\" was excellent, and I think it would be good to read them both, reading Louis' book first.

Well if you have not read it yet then you should!In my opinion i think that this book was very interesting because, I thought about how the characters in the story felt in the events that have happened in this book, for example I thought about how the cats could return the parrot to Petunia's Pet Shop with out the owner of the cats which is a girl named Amanda finding out about the bird and how the cats ordered it.Also I thought about why Mrs.Oddgrass was named that and how the author came up with that name, actually I think that she came up with that name because she was always acting odd around people for example she never wanted things to change that she had in her past.

Another thing that I liked about the book was that in every chapter there was a point, and every time I finished a chapter, I felt that I knew more then I expected to know about it.

I smell too much alcohol in the product and it gives me a headache. The product was wrapped in bubble wrap and did not come in a box as I thought it should. I will not know for sure until I can get to a store that I know carries Eau du Soir and do a comparison. I wanted to wait until I compared my product to one at a department store that carries it but I do not know how soon I can get to the mall so I am submitting my review.If indeed when I sample the product at a retail store and still believe it is not a legitimate product, I will report it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eau du Soir","review":"The Amazon description is correct. Although rose plays the key role in this fragrance, Eau du Soir does also contain moss and woods. And they are quite noticeable since it is a chypre floral fragrance. One of the best of this kind. Perhaps THE best. Undoubtedly, my favourite perfume. It is light, crispy, fresh. I am not a huge fan of the rose fragrances, but in Eau du Soir rose is calm and mild. And very green. Eau du Soir is the kind of scent that makes you want to be a better person. However, I wouldn't advise buying this perfume without giving it a try first. As it often happens with chypre fragrances, it is not going to appeal to everybody. Or, to put it another way, it is the kind of scent that is not trying to appeal to everybody. It stands on its own and speaks for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"S'Alright toy.","review":"My boy recieved this one for Christmas last year. I have to confess that I probably played with it more than he did, and it was consigned to the closet soon after. The problem is that it outpaces reaction time at an incredible rate.If your kid's the type to be turned off by that lack of instant gratification, and the lack of a difficulty switch, don't bother.But if you want one for yourself, for the fun of whacking something, have at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TEASE","review":"This toy is entertaining when playing with two or more individuals.

After hours of play, the bop it wouldn't \\"bop\\" anymore. After three weeks of play, the bop it extreme would not receive the \\"pull it\\" action.It was frutstrating and embarrassing.

We take it when we go places..even when we tell my sister's family we are coming over, they say bring \\"BOP It\\". Everyone loves it! It's very exciting and challenging!

Isn't that like the old \\"Electronic Simon\\" game? Yes, it is. Only updated for kids who play too much nintendo. Only unlike nintendo, they can get a full body workout with this thing! My 12-year-old loved it, and after my initial resistance, I couldn't seem to get enough of it either. It only got four stars because she loved (past tense) it. The toy didn't have much staying power.

The song started to get really annoying so I went over and asked him what it was. Once I tried it, I was totally addicted to it and had to get one. I am 24! I got my mom and my sister one and they both became Bop It addicts as well. Although I have to say, after about 3 days it gets really old. But, I just put mine down and pick it up a few days later and it's fun again.The Pro's: It's really fun and can be somewhat challenging. It's not as mindless a game as most other ones on the market.The Cons: Sometimes it doesn't start correctly. Also, sometimes when you do what it tells you to do, it still screams at you. Mine only works right about 60% of the time, but usually if you play with it long enough it starts working again.NOTE: A word of advice.

I seem to remember enjoying the electronic game 'Simon' as a child, and had read good reviews of 'Bop-It' here, so I ordered one. It was fun for about the first 15 minutes. The song and voice are too repetetive (and annoying), and for an adult, the challenge of the game just wasn't fun. There are only 2 different versions of basically the same game programmed into it (boring). I'd recommend going to a toy store and finding the much more creative version of the same principle, an electronic game called 'Brain Warp' which pleases many different intellects. I did pass 'Bop-It' around at a party of educators and of 15 of us only 2 enjoyed this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing game","review":"This toy was a hit when I recieved it for my birthday!

It also is very loud so you have to turn the speaker away from your body. Its insults (like \\"You win, not!) are very annoying sometimes when youdon't get to many points. But it also makes you want to play more. Another annoying thing about this toy is that if you don't play with it for a couple of minutes it will go to \\"sleep\\" so you have to press the pull it button a few times to have it wake up.it is kinda educational cause it teaches you ear and i coordination."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS GAME!!

As for the volume control that other reviewers have expressed concern about,we found a very easy solution, when you want to turn down thevolume, just put some tape over the speaker part of the game,this worked wonders! Sometimes you like it louder so youcan hear the commands better, but then it can get on other's nerves if you are trying to visit. Some masking tape did the job!

It has 4 was to play: box bob (the original), box bop pass it (original only passing to different people), beep bop(it makes the noises of the parts), beep bop pass it ( sounds only passing it). Bop It extreme also has 3 new buttons on it: flick it, spin it, and twist it. This verison is so much more fun and chanlenging. I can play this for hours on end just trying to break my own records. This is also educational because you have to learn how to follow orders as they get faster. Supprisinly this is durably I dropped it so many times and nothing ever happpenes to it. Another good thing about this is that it dosent eat up batteries like most other games, I went almost two years untill I had to get new batteries.

A View To a Kill is possibly the series' weakest effort. The action is crummy and very cheesey, Tanya Roberts almost brings down the whole film herself, and Grace jones is SO weird. Roger Moore looks like he's 7O and the only good actors in this film were Christopher walken and Patrick Macnee.

The critics also were not kind to this outing, but it still managed to make a decent $152,000,000 at the box office. The movie finds Bond fighting against the maniacal Max Zorin (played deliciously evil by Christopher Walken) who attampts to destroy the Silicon Valley in California.Other greats in the film include Grace Jones (in her campiest role ever) and the beautiful and former Charlie's Angels star Tanya Roberts as Bond's girl.San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and Paris' Eiffel Tower were used as backdrops in \\"A View to a Kill\\" with filming shot on location in Switzerland, Iceland and other locales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Bond","review":"I have enjoyed nearly all of the Bond films that have been made, but think that this is one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lock the DANG windows youself James !","review":"Notice that Bond instructs Stacey to lock the doors and windowsin her house (because they might return).

Absolutely UNWATCHABLE and made for TV caliber script, acting, direction and camera work...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"Roger Moore's last Bond film, \\"A View to a Kill\\", is considered by many to be one of the worst films in the series. In my opinion it's underrated. Yes, Roger Moore was getting a bit too old for the part but he still does a good job. My main complaint is Tanya Roberts's character, Stacey Sutton. She's not a very good Bond girl, but it is somewhat redeemed by Grace Jones's May Day character, one of the more colorful (no pun intended) Bond girls. Christopher Walken is a good villain and Bond gets help from Patrick Macnee who also does a good job.The story is something of a rework of \\"Goldfinger\\", but it' still fun and has added some nice twists and been updated to fit the 1980s. The movie offers lots of fun action and in my opinon delivers what I expect from a Bond movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"An All-Time Low","review":"All the Roger Moore Bonds are pretty bad, but \\"A View to a Kill\\" is the worst of the lot. How Broccoli and Company managed to coast on sheer ineptitude for 12 years (1973-85) is truly mind-boggling. Seen today, the Moore films are more dated than the Sean Connery efforts.

Christopher Walken portrayal as Max Zorin is great. If anyone can play a psycho its him. Roger Moore plays the role with class and style, not his fault the storyline was weak and the producers couldn't get Brosnan or Dalton to fill in, Moore plays Bond great one last time. Now the Bad. First the plot was a really bad spinoff of Goldfinger, both Zorin and Goldfinger portrayed villains obsessed with dominating the global market with their respective loves (computer chips for Zorin and gold for Goldfinger). The destruction of silicone valley and Fort Knox. Skilled Henchpersons, you get the idea. The other really bad element of the movie was the Bond girl (Stacey Sutton, played by Tanya Roberts), even Goodnight in TMWTGG was more capable. Good thing Dalton or Brosnan did not do this film, neither could have saved it. A Bad way for Moore to go out."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst Moore","review":"Here is why this is the worst Moore film.

I was mesmerized by it, and being only 5 or 6, it really didn't have an impact on me until later when I saw the film on TBS.I had wished that I had watched it earlier, because it is quite a good Bond movie, and it really ends the Moore era with a flourish.The plot revolves around Max Zorin's insane, and yet diablolical plot to flood 'Silicon Valley' and Bond investigates the plan.While Moore was looking old enough to be Tanya Roberts father, his adventerous additude was still there. That is what the best part of the film is about, it's not about him being old, its about him saving the world.This is a good Bond film........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest of the franchise","review":"Some Bond films are excellent (From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball) some are good (Goldeneye, The Living Daylights, The Spy who Loved Me) and some are just awful. Which brings us to A View to a Kill. This lacklustre addition to the franchise is plain..., with boring, laboured action, a hackneyed plot (some rubbish about computer chips and silicon valley) and puerile dialogue.The only good points in this film are Christopher Walken as Zorin, the main villain and Grace Jones as his assistant. Regardless, Walken's villain is one of the weakest in the series and Grace Jones looks somewhat out of place in this film.And it has to be said that Roger Moore by 1985 was too old to be Bond. However, it's good that Timothy Dalton didn't take this one to be his first outing as Bond and turned up in the superior The Living Daylights or his movie career would have finished before it started."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very underrated Bond Movie !","review":"Roger Moore's last Bond adventure and one of his best.

Also starring Tanya Roberts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bondview","review":"As Bond films go, this one ranks low although the title song is still catchy even now (Duran Duran). Our Main objection is there is no mention of municipal bonds.... James Bond films have plenty of financial plot devices mostly having to do with paying the villain's ransom or else. But they really should mention other bonds. Bondview is the main source for municipal bond information.Maybe the next bond film will mention it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"This is my least favorite Bond out of all the 7 I've seen. It barely even feels like a Bond film at all. The film is about Max Zorin, who wants to make his own microchips, and in order to do so he must destroy the Silicon Valley. Of course, it's 007 to the rescue! Moore by this point was way too old to play Bond, and he kind of walks through it, you know?There are 3 good points in this film. One is the action. Like in every Bond film, even the worst can be held up by good action sequences. Two is Christopher Walken as Max Zorin. Zorin is one of THE best Bond villans. His henchwoman May Day, is one of the worst. Third is the title song by Duran Duran.Avoid it at all costs, except for the great extras on the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good skiing scene","review":"Bond films quite often feature skiing scenes, some of them quite breathtaking.

THE BEST ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to you 007?","review":"A View To A Kill has to be the lowpoint of the series. It's a shame that a good theme song was wasted on this trite film. How can you make a classic Bond film like Octopussy, and then make this? It's just a basic retread of Goldfinger. This ranks up there with Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, Goldeneye, and Tomorrow Never Dies as the worst of the series. Christopher Walken is way over the top. Tanya Roberts couldn't act her way out of a paper-bag. Bond films are supposed to be made like From Russia With Love, For Your Eyes Only, and the Living Daylights. Those are films with intelligent plots, realistic villians, and great action. Shame on Roger Moore for agreeing to be in this. Thank god the series got a second wind with The Living Daylights."},{"rating":"1","title":"A View To A Bore","review":"All I have to say is this... it's really sad that Duran Duran's music video for the title track was more exciting than the movie itself.

Walken is okay as the bad guy but the script really limits him, and Tanya Roberts is badly in need of some acting lessons. She is simply awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ever?","review":"This is in strong competition for the worst Bond movie ever. Certainly \\"Never Say Never Again\\" is the worst, but it's questionable whether that one is even a real Bond movie.But \\"A View To A Kill\\" is so tired and cliche, and downright boring, it's a shame. Tanya Roberts is one of the worst actresses ever, and ruins the whole film. Christopher Walken was a pretty good villian, but Grace Jones... Well, she's had her 15 minutes now -- Grace, don't let the door hit your bum on the way out to obscurity, dear.In the unlikely event you're new to the Bond franchise, I can honestly report that this is one movie you can skip completely. You won't be missing a thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BOND!!!!!!!!","review":"This Bond is excellent as well, this, and License to Kill are one of the best, but there are many more good ones. This is the last James Bond film to star Roger Moore. It's excellent, lots of people say it's bad, but I enjoyed it. This time, Bond goes after Max Zorin, a madman who has plans to flood Silicon Valley in San Francisco, killing millions. By blowing up a mine. But the Bond girl Mayday, is uglyyyyy! Otherwise, this Bond is great, and has an excellent fight scene on the Golden Gate Bridge. Definately worth checking out. The next Bond was, THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS with Timothy Dalton, another excellent Bond."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am enjoying my movie","review":"Yes, I'm enjoying my movie that I purchase from Amazon.com, Ian Fleming's,\\"View to a Kill.\\" I have tried for years to run across one, and I have had no luck at all.

Roger was way to old, the films plot was borrowed from Goldfinger, the main hench women, and the bond girl. But aside from all of that, this is a pretty good film. Christopher Walken plays one of the best villiens of the bond saga. I like the CLASS thats in this movie also. There are some action stunts that are out of place, \\"Namely the firetruck scene\\", but there are great moments as well. The pre title is one of the best. The music score is one of the best. The music title is one of the best. There are some bad moments in the film, but there again, there are some bad things about all bond films, so give this bond flick a try.

Yes, he's a little bit older this time, but you can hardly notice it. I love this film, as I love all the James Bond films. The new villain, Max Zorin is going to destroy Silicon Valley in order to control the microchips in that area. His sidekick is the evil MayDay, who puts up a match that could even stop 007. The new Bond girl, Stacy Sutton.....is just a stupid bimbo. Okay lets ove on to better things. Such as the music! Duran Duran gives us all an explosive rock song that charted as No.1 in the billboard charts.On a much sadder note- this is last film to feature Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny. Although many others have portrayed Miss Moneypenny in the Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan era's, none will ever stand up to Lois Maxwell who as a true James Bond veteran stayed with the series for 14 stunning James Bond 007 films!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"After the lame Octopussy, there is finally a movie that most Bond fans should like.

Roger Moore's plays James Bond for the last time.

Whether it's following a sequence of lights or matching the colored fireflies (i.e. pressing the unlit red firefly if the other red firefly is currently lit) this is way too repetitious for even unsophisticated 4 year olds.

Now it's celeb fluff or (the worst) some socialite with too much money complaining about how her ballgowns won't fit in her closet and that she picks the kids up from school and not the nanny. Honestly, I'm all about Carine Roitfeld and blame Anna Wintour. Roitfeld has style and Wintour lost it years ago. I miss the old Vogue but cannot reltate to this crap.

I subscribed in January 2013, when their February issue was already out and received November, December and January issues (the same day!). So although I paid for 12 issues, I will actually receive only 9 (new) issues.

If you want a REAL fashion magazine, try Vogue Italia....much better than its ... American counterpart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Ads, Not Enough Content","review":"When you get a copy of the American Vogue, the first 5 pages at least are full page ads for fashion, fragrance, or whatever else. The table of contents is typically 1-2 pages. Once you start flipping through the magazine, you find the average length of an article is 1/2 to 1 page long. It's difficult to discern the fashion photo shoots that are part of the actual magazine content from the articles themselves. The fashion tips and photo shoots are not based on any real style insight but rather on who has bought sponsorship in the magazine. If you really want to read this magazine, I suggest you flip through it at the library or while waiting for an appointment at some office that has a subscription. It will take you less than 30 minutes to read the entire magazine from cover to cover and the only thing you'll be left with is knowing that is 30 minutes of your life you are never going to get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vogue Paris -- Paris free","review":"If you're into fashion, but prefer getting it without a daily dose of whats happening in the lives of nyc socialities, then opt for Vogue Paris.

The magazine has reduced in size, now smaller than US letter paper. The spine measures less than 1/4 inch. The printing and paper quality are low. The content of the July issue, in particular was watery. Vogue used to contain expansive descriptions of trends and details, but if the last few issues are an indicator, they must have fired a lot of writers. What exists now is not much more than product placement ads. The photo pages are few in number as well. I know that there is much more to fashion now that what was in Vogue lately. What's going on? Maybe there needs to be a change in editorial leadership. In the meanwhile, sadly I probably won't renew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ads, ads and more ads","review":"Vogue is full of ads. I pick this magazine up and I don't start getting to the articles until I am a fourth through the thing. I find the articles quite boring and not informative at all.

While the Classic version is fine, it is nothing more than a stylized version of the original game. The Episode I edition has so many cool features that it is almost impossible to remember them all. The character tokens are quite exceptional; the Deed Cards which are placed on the board at their appropriate lots makes it nearly impossible to lose them. However, I find the stackable (I'll call them houses and hotels) the best feature. No more can you accidentally bump the table and scatter the appropriations around the board; they are affixed to the board. For anyone who enjoys a rousing game of a true classic (whether or not you are partial to the classic that is Star Wars) this is the version to get. Bring on the Episode II version!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Force is strong in this one...","review":"I was never much of an avid Monopoly player, but I really enjoyed playing this game.

If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll love it! The money system is based on credits (from the Star Wars galaxy), as well as there are tokens of recognizable characters from the movie. I would highly recommend this to any Star Wars fan or someone who would like to play the classic Monopoly game with a change of perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom's Mom","review":"My family loves playing this game! Until now, I had never thought of Monopoly as being educational; but my six year old son's ability to add in his head has improved tremendously. I grew up playing the original Monopoly. The new 3-D game board is ingenious. When the board gets bumped the pieces don't shift all over the place. It's a must have for Monopoly fans whether you're Star Wars fans or not! I have no doubt that my family will continue to enjoy this improved version of the game for years to come. A classic made even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great country/rock CD about life and love.","review":"Tim McGuire is an excellent singer and musician. He is also a great songwriter who uses his own life experiences, and those of his friends, to tell stories through his music to which almost everyone can relate. He has the voice and ability to perform a vast array of musical styles, including country, rock and blues. This CD is a wonderful way to introduce the new listener to a very talented and long overlooked musician on the national scene. If you are a long-time Tim McGuire fan, this is another \\"must have\\" for your collection. I urge everyone to give this CD first priority on your \\"next to buy\\" list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns Your Hands when you Open the Lid!!!","review":"This steamer would be great if the handle to open it was on the top and not the sides.

It cooks rice perfectly as well as hard cooks eggs and steams many things to just the right degree of doneness. It is very easy to use and clean. All together, an excellent product. It needs to be higher up on the search list. I almost did not find it when I was searching Amazon for a rice cooker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Having had one of the old style models for probably 12 years, it sadly just quit working. I missed it so much but could only find it on line. When I received this I was very disappointed in how flimsy it is and the redesign which made things a little more difficult to use. Not sure why they messed with a good thing.

For the price, you can't go wrong. Joe"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I have to return this item.

All in all a frustrating book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this Cold Country leaves me cold","review":"I finished this book only because it was assigned by my book club. It reminds me of the books I read in sixth and seventh grade, found in the \\"Young Adult\\" section of my neighborhood library in the l950's. Everything about the book, both plot and character development, as well as use of language, is thin, without depth or complexity or passion. If one likes simple reading, and this is a novel of simple reading, I would recommend Catherine Cookson. At least, she has great stories told with feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Angelas Ashes","review":"This book is not worth the time or effort.

After a wave of gee-aren't-I-clever tomes, like \\"A Staggering Work of Heartbreaking Genius\\" and \\"The Corrections\\" I was thrilled to get this passed to me by a friend.Davis-Goff is amusing and intelligent, telling a story of a young woman in a time and place that seems very far away and, in the shadow of recent world events, not that distant at the same time. This book is not packed with action, just wonderful words -- it will remind you why you like reading so much in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bookworm","review":"This book started well with Daisy, working as a landgirl, meeting Patrick whom she marries in a short time. After moving to his ancestral home in S. Ireland, she meets his rather odd family and finds out the family are in dire financial straits. There is a murder which is never solved in the book, also can Daisy resurrect her marriage eventually? There are other events never fully explained which left me feeling unsatisfied. I searched to find out if the author had written a sequel which would explain what happened to all the characters, but there is none. The book starts at the beginning of World War 2 in 1940 and ends in 1942 so everything is left hanging in the plot. Not a good ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I found this book to be more boring as it went along. The characters are thin and undeveloped -- couldn't even get a handle on Daisy and what made her the way she was, or the other characters for that matter. They just seem to appear out of nowhere. The reader is denied any glimpse into the development of Daisy's romance. The prose is thin and boring, the author shows no gift for a turn of phrase. Even a bad plot can be saved by wonderful writing -- this book gave me no investment in anything going on. I only finished it because I blew 20 bucks on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out well, then languishes","review":"I enjoyed the first hundred pages of this book, as Daisy, a 20 year old English girl, tries to find her way in the world. But after she marries and moves to Ireland, the book starts to drag. The characters she meets there are never fully fleshed out, so their eccentricities seem incomprehensible.I skimmed the second half.I recommend The Dower House, also by Annabel David Goff, instead of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"summer reading","review":"both of my boys pick this book for their required summer reading list for school.

It can be a little disappointing seeing Kiefer Sutherland running amok and crazy but this film tells it like it is. It is about his foray into the music production business and focuses alot on one of his potential stars. I never realized that he partied so heavily. Heavy drinking and smoking and trying to act like a rock star. Still, if you are a Kiefer Sutherland fan like I am - it is worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never would have heard of the band if I hadn't seen this....","review":"I actually picked this DVD up at the local video store. I saw Keifer on the cover and being the 24 fan that I am I read the description on the back of the DVD and thought \\"Why not\\", so I rented it. I was impressed by this documentary. I thought it was cool seeing Keifer drunk; he's hilarious. If there was one person in the world I would like to spend the day with, it would be him. But, the main attraction in my oppinion is definitely Rocco Deluca & The Burden. I love their southern fried sound! I probably never would have heard of them if I hadn't taken a chance on this DVD. I love Rocco's unique voice. The band member's are great at what they do. I eventually bought this DVD because I liked it so much. I would love to see them live.

I then had the great honor of watching them play in Oxford (UK) in Sept. And I have just seen Rocco play solo acoustic in London (17th Dec).This documentary is a great introduction to a great band and a great artist, one who is likely to remain on the music scene for many, many years to come.I would recommend it to any who love live music, love a great voice, and love a good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Testament Commentary","review":"I was enjoying using this reference; but when there was an upgrade on my tablet, I lost all the e-books I had purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"hiba","review":"this is one of the golden album from tanzanian although the price is not that reasonable but maybe one day it will drop down , this kind of music gives comfort to all tanzanians in exile"},{"rating":"1","title":"Texas locations should be advertizing; not other states...","review":"Ads take up most of magazine.

This is not the Texas Monthly magazine I used to be fond of. Instead it seems thicker with far more ads and less articles and the articles about restaurants seemed poorly researched.

It was an enjoyable read about far off places like El Paso, Amarillo and Brownsville as well as a source of information as to the working of my own hometown. Sadly, this once proud publication has become a mouthpiece for the \\"limousine liberal\\" set. Out of 275 pages, 100 are dedicated to boutiques in the Dallas and Houston Galleria areas, 75 are for advetisements for plastic surgeons and/or attorneys, 40 are for bashing Conservatives, 35 are for what people from the Northeast want to pretend Texas is about and 25 are actually well written, thought provoking articles. The magazine has gone from a celebration of our state to a source of contempt of everything that made Texas what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Texas Magazine, Worldwide Appeal","review":"I once heard that if anyone you meet has had anything to do with Harvard, the television industry or the state of Texas, he will let you know in the first five minutes of a conversation.

I also read it a lot as a teen when my parents subscribed. But this year I let my subscription lapse without renewal. A few reviewers have criticized the liberal bias. Some of the articles are liberal to be sure, but overall I don't think it's a leftwing rag. I just noticed that the number of articles that interested me declined in number. In my opinion there were only about 4 great articles per year. Most of the others were either 'so-so' or just unreadable. Paul Burka is the only gem left in the Magazine. Even when I disagree with him I enjoy reading his articles. He's a very gifted writer. But he alone wasn't worth keeping the subscription going. From now on I will just peruse TM at the library. Hopefully a new editor will come along in the near future and return the magazine to it's former greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bird cage liner","review":"I bought this magazine with high hopes that it would focus on issues pertaining to Texas. It does in part, but there is a blatant political bias in almost all the articles that is not representative of Texas as a whole. The writing in this magazine smacks of elitism under the guise of Lone Star pride (although there have been a few superb articles that defy the norm). If you like ads, this is your magazine. If you like an editor with a political axe to grind, this is your magazine. If you like to line the bottom of your birdcage with something other than newsprint, sadly, this is your magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going down hill.","review":"I have subscribed to this magazine off and on for the last 15 years.

Well first this movie was made in the 80's when ice hockey was alot more violent and you can go and tell the canadians that played then that they were not as physical as the movie depicts. Thia movie shows what teams do to players on the team and the hardships endured with college hockey.

This screenplay is a basic formulaic story with interesting trivia attached to it. Rob Lowe stars as Youngblood and he took his inspiration (he says) for the portrayal of his committed athlete character from a guy he went to high school with - DEAN CAIN. Cain, as fans of this \\"Superman\\" know, was committed to high school football, made all-American at Princeton, then went on to be a rookie with Buffalo Bills. This background makes for a guilty pleasure you don't always get from a sports film, or any film for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites.","review":"This movie is on my top 10 list of favorites.

The \\"action\\" moves at a snail's pace and I really don't think there's a league out there that lets two players hold what looks like a boxing match at centre ice. The only redeeming quality of \\"Youngblood\\" is the scenes that are so bad they're funny - specifically, any time that a young Keanu Reeves tries to speak in a french accent. This movie is truly terrible, the hockey scenes are a joke and the plot is as cliched as they come. If you want to see hockey in a movie, even \\"The Mighty Ducks\\" is better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hockey Flick","review":"While this movie is probably best reserved for extreme Hockey Fans, it also has a certain flare that makes a person realize how pure the game of Hockey really is. I saw this movie when I was younger and it a sparked a desire and love for the game that is with me even today. Hockey is the only sport left in which players play with heart and passion for the game, and this movie is excellent at betraying that feeling to it's audience. I personally enjoy this movie at least once a year (to get me in a Hockey mood) and can't wait to get it on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good movie","review":"an all time fav of ours thank you i finely got the movie i saw it as a kid and loved it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Youngblood Review","review":"No movie deserves 5 stars. :)Youngblood is a good movie and well casted with professional acting.Not much else to say.. ...

Whether he's singing his own compositions or someone else's, they all flow together wonderfully well on \\"Awakening.\\" And the album's concept, about the many seasons in a man's life, is deep and well developed in both the songs and Roger's style. My favorite tracks are the emotional \\"It Rains in the Heat of the Night;\\" \\"Shoot For the Moon,\\" a lovely duet with Lene Siel; and the R&B-styled \\"Window of the Heart.\\" Try this album without preconceived notions, and you'll be rewarded with the disc's richness and depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointment","review":"As a PMP and member of a new PMO attempting to establish the value and credibility of a PMO within our organization I found this book to be a bitter disapointment.

We put this in the tank cabinet and turned this on with the air valves off. The sound that came from the pump was the equivalent of a loud TV. There is no way to have a normal conversation in the same room as this pump when it was running. As a test, I turned it on, closed the cabinet, and made a call from my speaker phone that is about 10' from the tank, and the person on the other line asked me what the noise was without me prompting them.

I grew up on the Moore flicks and they were always fun and campy. Here we see Moore's first efforts as he travels to exotic locales such as Haiti and downtown Harlem. The title song is fab and the action is fun. Jane Seyour is the main Bond babe, Solitaire, who has a hip connection to the Tarot. You can't lose with this! It has alligators, a wacky hillbilly sheriff and a Voodoo priest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Bond Film","review":"Live and Let Die, the first appearence from Roger Moore as James Bond, is easily one of the top three James Bond films ever made. Moore does an excellent job with 007 as he goes up against Mr. Big, aka Kananga, who is plotting to give away free heroine, drive the mafia out of business, increase addicts, and thus take over the drug world. With my favorite Bond girl Solitaire, played by the gorgeous Jane Seymour, Live and Let Die has more humor than most Bonds, great action, intriguing plot, and a superb boat chase through the Louisiana bayous. LALD also has two great henchmen in Tee Hee and Baron Samedi. The opening song by Paul McCartney is the greatest opening song and Roger Moore delivers a more than convincing performance, making Live and Let Die a must have for any viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bond movie","review":"This was a gift for a family member.

This film has a little bit of everything. Dr. Kananga is a drug dealer that also plays the harlem guy Mr. Big. Solitare plays the bond girl that uses her special powers to help Kananga. Of course 007 uses his own powers on her and the stage is set for boat chases, crocodile escapes and voodoo ceremonies! Paul McCartney and the Wings perform one of the most memorable songs in the series! This film is GREAT!

For example, I will review the villains. There were many strong villains, and an immortal Baron Samedi and robot-armed Tee-Hee were interesting, but too far-fetched. I liked the ending, but Baron Samedi alive and on riding the front of a train is too fantastic. Jane Seymour was very pretty, but looked too young and innocent. I would like to quote Steven Jay Rubin when I say that when she is in bed with Bond, she looks almost like \\"she's being taken advantage of\\". Roger Moore is Bond in this one, and I've never accepted him as Bond, despite his seven Bond films. To see a Bond film that is good (despite Roger Moore) I'd recommend \\"The Spy who Loved Me\\", \\"For Your Eyes Only\\", or \\"Octopussy\\". Of Moore's films (which seemed to be either very good or very bad), this ranks right in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"live and let die conditions","review":"We received the movie over two weeks ago from the UK, however,on the first screen it says to remove the disc since it is notfitted to play in this area.

Bond is not too intelligent and not too wise, because the villians are something off of a Shaft movie, and didn't really scare me like the villians of previous bonds with Connery. Also, i dont like Roger Moore as Bond so that didnt help either lol. He make a good Q replacement but not Bond. The movie is so corny its shameful. That plastic green snake in the beginning of the movie just before the music intro was so [unrealistic], ...You didn't even see the bite mark on that guy before he fake his death. And agents getting stab on a corner, not once but it happen twice it too much. What i like about this movie, solitair played by jane seymore and the paul mcartney song 'live and let die' at the beginning. It's probably the best song next to the Octapussy song by Rita. If your a bond fan, watch it but dont say i didnt warn ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring film in the 007 series!","review":"Yes, the most boring James Bond flick of them all. The action scenes are dull as wood compared to the over-the-top stuff you see in the Connery films and in Moore's better efforts like \\"Moonraker\\" (Moore's most under-rated 007 film, and the movie that made me a Bond fan in the first place, way back at the tender age of 10) and \\"The Spy Who Loved Me.\\" It takes at least half an hour before James even kills anybody!The film also suffers from Q's (Desmond Llewellyn's) hiatus.What's more, the Wings' title track is okay, but it's over-rated! It blows my mind that, and the title track to \\"A View to a Kill\\" are the most popular Bond songs of all time, yet they accompany the two dullest Bond films of all time.Too much time wasted on voodoo schlock as well, especially the closing bit with that laughing creep.Roger Moore did much better with the aforementioned titles . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Name Is Bland . . . James Bland","review":"If you want to pinpoint where the 007 series took a nosedive into unadulterated silliness, look no further than \\"Live and Let Die\\" (1973). Roger Moore makes his debut as James Bland in this ridiculous blaxploitation-style thriller with slapstick action sequences. The only redeeming aspect is Paul McCartney's Oscar-nominated title song, which deserved a far better film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger Moore's First Bond Movie","review":"Roger Moore is my favorite Bond. This one is not one of the best Bond movies he has done but it still gets four stars in my book. In this movie Bond goes to Louisiana among other places to find out why three agents have been killed. It all stems from a drug lord who has connections with pimps and those who deal in voodoo/black magic. It has the famous boat chase through the bayou (with the sheriff chasing behind them) as well as the alligator farm that could be the end of Bond....Anyways this movie has a lot of action and a good story.

Lets not forget George Martin's generic and mundane music score either! The movie is for the \\"diehardest\\" of Bond fans, such as myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewwwwwww","review":"What a way to start this movie. We first see Bond in bed with some unknown woman, yay. Quite a turn off. And Moore is quite a let down after Sean Connery (unargueably the best Bond, by the way). Bond is sent to the deep south of the U.S. after drug dealers. The only good part about this whole escapade is the black guy with only one arm, he's pretty cool. Anyway, when they put him in those crocodile infested waters and tried to drown him, I was going for the bad guys, really. After what seemed like 10 hours of nothing but Roger Moore's \\"Bond\\" I was sick of it, totally. The only good thing about this movie is the theme song, which is pretty cool. Come to tink of it, the theme songs are the only good things that have ever come out of the 7 Bond films Roger Moore did, quite interesting.

Thank my lucky stars I rented it on DVD rather than buying it. It's a real piece of garbage from start to finish. They must have been sweating bullets when they handed this film to United Artists for distribution - it's that bad and plenty Moore.Several misteps take place early in the film. For example, Q drops by Bonds house to give him an assignement. I don't know about any of my readers out there, but to me it's taboo to show Bond's house. It takes so much mystery away from the character. In my opinion, Bond shows up for violence and sex -- he doesn't serve expressos to his boss.Finally, the depiction of black mobsters in this film is clearly from the UK perspective. At one point, \\"Bond\\" offers a cabby a $20 tip if he takes him into Harlem.

It sure ain't that great for a Bond film. The film's story seemed just ridiculous. I mean, the villains alone have as much gadgets as Bond himself and always seem to know where he is. They seem to capture Bond on several occasions so easily. Bond is a secret agent, so how how do they about him?Not the best debut for Roger Moore as Bond, but his performance as 007 would get better by latter films in the series (1977's The Spy Who Loved Me), but still, his performance as Bond in Live and Let Die is a change after the departures of Sean Connery and George Lazenby. Jane Seymour (TV's Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman) plays Solitaire, the Bond girl in this film. Yaphet Kotto plays the villain, who is an international drug dealer.

Highly recommend!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game for young kids with little fingers!","review":"This game arrived under the Christmas tree for my 3-year-old. He likes playing the game and especially likes playing with the cherries! Good for counting, adding & subtracting. 3 stars for durablilty because I'm sure these cherries won't be around long. Game comes with only enough for 4 players...no extras for the ones that get lost in the sofa! Only other complaint is that the cherries and buckets are too small. My husband and I have a difficult time picking cherries out of the bucket. Would it have killed the makers to add just a few inches to the board?! And throw in a few extra cherries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a hit for this family","review":"My two boys didn't find this board game very interesting at all. The game itself is cheaply made.

But if you don't have bottomless pockets, you'd be better off getting the likes of the Michel Thomas CDs and the Living Language courses, which provide way more information about the French language, which is far more complex than the Pimsleur course allows for.

I just started volume III and I'm not sure I can continue. I have the 1998 edition and I have to say they chose the worst speakers they could find.The female speaker (Carpenter) talks like an old lady in a high pitch voice like she's always screaming. The male speaker (DeRobert) varies his speech that you think he is trying to over act a play or trying to win a reading contest. He sometimes does not fully pronounce the words. The French instructor speaker (Clement) is very good though.It's a huge difference from volume I and II. If you;re getting volume III, get a different edition with different speakers.

These are just Mexican-made \\"Howard Leight Hearing Protection\\" product.These are typical sub-$10 units, though they do a decent job of actually blocking sound and are reasonably comfortable for me. The quality is poor, however. The crude headband length adjustment goes from much too tight to much too loose very quickly and the cheap plastic of the earpads quickly starts to degrade and harden after exposure to body oils. The pads are glued to the cups and this glue also begins to lose its grip very soon in prolonged use.I have hyperacusis and wear hearing protectors for many hours at a time every day. These simply do not hold up. If you only use hearing protectors occasionally and for very brief periods, these may be entirely adequate for your purposes, but they are in no way professional grade units for daily extended use in noisy environments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the Peltor H10A muffs","review":"These Milwaukee muffs are cheap things. I bought a pair about a year ago, but they turned brittle and were never very comfortable. I also found they aren't very good - they are okay. I didn't expect a lot for the price, but a few months ago I purchased a pair of Peltor H10A muffs for just about $10.00 more, and boy were they worth it! They're much better made, better looking, more comfortable, and reduce noise levels more. Now I really regret the time I spent with Milwaukee muffs. They're just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves its purpose","review":"Serve their purpose, fit snuggly and very low key.Only drawback I could think of is they can't be adjusted but I think that's actually a good thing.

They fit perfectly and stay put."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and do what they're supposed to do","review":"Bought 4 pair total so far. Gave the first 2 away to people who needed them. They're so cheap you can do so without feeling bad. They do what they're supposed to do. No more, no less. They do fold up nicely though.

Barna presents facts and stats and uses them to interpret trends in culture and specifically in the church.

It is written in evangelical speak and articulates the principles of emerging faith communities well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolution by George Barna","review":"As I read the description of Barna's \\"Revolutionaries\\" I found myself seeing faces of people in our church and friends in ministry. He is so on target in his description of \\"church\\" as it is in this period of history. I would encourage anyone in ministry to read and discuss the material. It should serve as a loud wake-up call to all of us concerning where we are now, and where we are headed in the future. If Barna is correct in his thoughts on where spiritual growth is headed, we -- the Church -- must take a long hard look at what and how we function and be open to where the Lord leads us.It is an easy read (except that it took me a long time because I wanted to highlight almost ever sentence) and well worth the time.

We have to agree with him and be on board and support those with whom we disagree because George Barna says so? This is classical emergent church baloney.George Barna is an emergent church participant. The emergent church seeks to reinvent the Bible for its own suitings and is heretical at best.

The church is not a building and never has been. Jesus never endorsed a building as the Church and He was always rebuking the religious leaders of His day.Why don't you (everyone reading these posts) study to so yourself approved unto God instead of being spoon fed the same pabulum puke you have for years.

Barna has traditionally written great books that are so well-researched. But this was a carpet salesman's worst pitch. Barna goes to an area where he's honestly just not gifted -- unbridled advocacy. What's worse he tries to weave this book as half research and half blatant lobbyist for the \\"simple church\\" -- and fails on both fronts. There are so many things noticeably absent in this book that would be vintage Barna. Where's the chapter on potential flaws and pitfalls of a simple church? He certainly presents a laundry list of flaws with traditional churches. Where's the explanation that house churches existed in the first century largely because of persecution -- not that it was Jesus' preferred model."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"Lotta preaching on Barna's part, and he doesn't know what he's talking about.Very little information.Had to force myself to pick it up.Gave up half way thru.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not great!","review":"I strongly agree with the simple church and house church structure.

If that doesn't do it Les Baxter's theme music by way of Mike Curb should do the trick. This is a Lifetime movie if it were conceived by Austin Powers. Star Raquel Welch seems pretty clueless in her one-note readings. It's as though she's working on a Sports Illustrated swimsuit spread instead of a dramatic venture. Strange as well is some of Welch's nameless co-stars appear topless while she has one dance sequence in a low-cut leotard. Luke Askew does get the film's camp potential doing his best Dennis Hopper playing a deranged killer. It's without irony that Askew appeared in \\"Easy Rider\\" with Hopper the same year this film was released. Welch's love interest played by James Stacy is kind of reminiscent of Alec Baldwin. \\"Flareup\\" isn't a great film but if you are looking for some unintended hoots this is the flick for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiga and Ajax: Louder than a Bomb!!","review":"I'm a DJ and first of all I worship Tiga.

He and a fine host of musicians have created a romantic compilation that is perfectly conducive for sitting in front of a cozy fire with the one you love. If that scenario sounds too schmaltzy, then this CD isn't made for you. My stand out tracks are Watching the Snow, Said the Snowflake, and Island Christmas.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed.Although \\"Marrying Off Mother\\" has much of the same wonderful timing & wit that's in other Durrell books, it seems to be missing their soul. This is a cynical book, and the timing & wit (that in earlier books shows Durrell's innonence and passion) conveys smugness and superiority in \\"Marrying off Mother\\".

As a mother of a two year old who loves nothing more than parking himself in front of Walt Disney's treasury of videos, this book provides a welcome change from the glassy eyed gaze of a video transfixed toddler, to an eager, hands-on explorer of one of Disney's best loved films. Kids will love how the images come alive as they work their way through the book. It is very interactive and it provides hours of entertainment. This is a must buy for any young fan of Disney and any parent who would like to vary their children's intake of pop culture. A great stocking stuffer or Hanukkah gift for a young person. If you are looking for something different, give this book a try and prepare to be very pleased with your purchase"},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect story for children as they learn about life","review":"This book will delight children. There is a great deal of bright, contrasting colors and the pop-ups have a great deal of detail.

Of course, the story is a timeless one of despair, aid and assistance, battles between good and evil, more despair and then triumph, as Snow White, the prince and the Seven Dwarfs all live happily ever after. A perfect story for children as they begin their journey to understand what life is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"those clever Germans","review":"Neubauten has always had the rare ability to make conceptual art which communicates clearly with the audience.

There is even room for humor within the scientific subject matter and Neubauten's continual explorations in sound. The track \\"Helium\\" features Blixa singing on helium, which is clever for artistic reasons, but mostly just funny. This recording does continue the path away from the \\"industrial sound\\" and disinent clatter of earlier works. the experimental noises are still there, but mixed with symphonic arrangements and manipulated into easier to swallow rythms.

He didn't have much screen time in Annie Hall but you sure remembered him!I agree with the five star reviews of King of New York. Walken sure can creep you out! In any movie that he has been in, your eyes rivit to him immediately, he has such a huge presence in everything he does. Even on Saturday Night Live when he portrayed The Continental. He's a genius.

The look of the film is great, I'll give them credit for that, but the script is uninteresting. The ending leaves you so empty, that they should re-make this film.

A seasoned, brilliant actor like Walken lowers himself to such a film and it is an insult to his skill. He relies to much on his purposely awkward speech to define the role, along with a sullen countenance of a tired old man, which is not hard to do...we have seen it by many great actors in coming of age films (pacino, godfather III), (Deniro, Raging Bull). Walken taints his reputation as a serious actor with this film which is mostly a barrage of bologne. I do like the early performances by Fishburne, Snipes and Carusso.

What kind of a long term relationship will that gain for anybody?Adoption is about more than acquiring a baby. It sets up a lifetime relationship between adoptive parents, birthparents, and a child. Before you take Susan Burns' advice, think about how you'll feel about what you've done when your child is twenty, and her birthparents get to explain everything that happened when she was born.

In the 4th, Vanska attempts to use fast tempos and a vehement and blustery approach to wring extra drama from the work, but instead only manages to miss the depth, grandeur, and excitement that it naturally conveys under other conductors. The music ends up seeming somewhat trivialized. Likewise, I don't understand why in the 3rd symphony, called the \\"Expansiva,\\" and in its second movement, called a \\"pastorale,\\" it is necessary to rush breathlessly through, again missing the \\"expansiveness\\" that was surely intended. Vanska's recording of Nielsen's 1st is excellent, making it all the harder to understand why here he just doesn't seem in sympaty with the music.

Getting back to Octopussy, the stunts are great, the action is some of the best I've seen in Bond films.

Oh, there were better Bond stories, no doubt, but I do doubt there were any more entertaining than this one.In \\"Octopussy,\\" we get more of an Indiana Jones-type adventure story than the usual spy farce. In fact, there is so much adventure in here it gets tiring, to be frank. It's almost too much....but it is a lot of fun along the way.The best part of the film isn't the wild adventure, either: it's the humor. This has more laughs in it - stupid and clever - than any Bond film I can recall.Roger Moore, Maud Adams, Louis Jordan, Kristina Wayborn, Steven Berkoff and Kabir Bedi must have had a lot of fun - and been worn out - making this film.

I know lots of people like Moore and it is OK if you accept it for what it is - fun junk.But then, I never could accept any other Bond after the Connery era, which made the adventure somewhat believable and with more subtle humor.Recommended if you know you like Moore, but if you are hoping for something a little better, forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable as ever","review":"Released in 1983 , the world was about to witness something never seen before or since, two Bond films relesed in space of a few months . Octopussy, the ofifcial Albert R. Broccoli produced Bond with Roger Moore and Never Say Never Again, the unofficial Kevin McClory produced Bond with Sean Connery making a comeback. But was Octopussy that more than doubled Never Say Never Again at the box-office. Octopussy comes from a short story written by Ian Fleminga and has our hero on the trail of the leader of an international smugglers ring and an exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan) who forms an alliance with a power crazed Russian General.

Minimizes the relevance of the raising of 1934, praises the behaviour of Largo Caballero and blames the CEDA for everything. He denies the existence of violence during the 2nd Republic and minimizes the responsibility of organizations linked with the PSOE with the violence. Of course the war was the responsiblity of the pro-fascist who delivered the coup and completed the raising, but pretending that the 2nd Republic was a modern democracy is simply out of the historical reality.

Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining and deceptively profound","review":"On the surface, the Underdog is a wild romp of a book. A 128-pound human dynamo, Davis takes on one unlikely contest after another -- arm wrestling, bullfighting, sumo wrestling, backward running, competitive sauna-sitting. In each case, he is spectacularly unqualified and generally unprepared (though he does seem to have some natural talent for bullfighting).But there is more going on here than fish-out-of-water hilarity and reality-TV humiliation. The real subject of this funny and touching book is the struggle to achieve manhood. Through each successive contest, Davis tests his reserves of courage and strength and learns more about himself and the world. Davis doesn't allow himself pat answers or easy conclusions. The result is a deeply felt and penetrating memoir. His insights are hard won. And that's the real victory of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writing with wit.","review":"This book is something to look forward to as you sink into the sheets of your cozy bed.

There is no way small children can set this up by themselves and frankly, it can take an adult so long to get all the pieces together that the children lose interest and go off to do something else.

Chilling is certainly not a word I would use, unless you count the way they try to make Donald Sutherland into a sex symbol (eeeeww). What's sad about the whole thing is that you've got all the elements for a great suspense/horror film - a dead child, psychic abilities, strange ocurrences, unexplained accidents - but they never gel into a cohesive plot, nor do they frighten you or cause you to feel any suspense.

The studio really made an effort to make this 30 year old movie look good on DVD. The movie has a far greater impact now as compared to the VHS version. The sound quality is also excellent.

Based on a Daphne DuMaurier story, this tale of the supernatural, set in Venice, is extremely intelligent, and opens doors for much analysis of how and why thoughts of the supernatural obsess people as they do. Roeg's interest in self-reflexivity in cinema, more fully realized in BAD TIMING, is invoked here as well; Sutherland and Christie give excellent performances; and, lowbrow as it seems to say this, the sex scene between them is one of the most interesting and intense in the history of mainstream cinema. It's a great, flawless thriller -- though if you think you might be a moron, you'd probably best stay away from it; it's no slasher movie. Oh, yeah -- Venice is lovely, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay book, but not great.","review":"My son does love this book, but as far as its purpose goes, it falls far short of expectations. There is almost no focus on the purpose of a potty at all. I had hoped that the photographs would be helpful, but they are very cute, posed, and lack the body parts involved in the actual process of using the toilet. There is only one page that even mentions the prohibited bodily functions. I don't enjoy the choice of wording, and it feels like a cheap attempt by a publishing company to get a book out of as few pictures and words as possible. Inexpensive to make, yes, but helpful to toilet-training parents? An emphatic no."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good first book","review":"If you want to start talking about potty training with your son, this is a good first book.

From the paleodiet persepctive, it seems that obtaining fruit would have been rare on a weekly, monthy, yearly basis. On top of that fruit is always seasonal and spoils quickly. So even a semi-regular diet of it seems unlikely and therefore unnatural. Fasting is however, very common! Who knows more of the details of Steve's pancreas problems?

It basically advocates a fruitarian diet. Sweet fruits mainly but some vegetables are really fruits botanically speaking so they can be included. Some common veggies that are really fruits would be peppers, cukes, tomatoes, squash, etc... It would be very healthy but would be lacking in some essential fats so you would need to add some healthy fats, perhaps on a salad.What I like about this book in particular is that the author had a medical condition that he healed using this system and he also experimented on himself so that you get a first hand narrative of his experiments. He practiced various forms of fasting also and gives good advice on fasting and also how to transition into a fruitarian diet.I have attempted to become fruitarian in the past but found it rather restrictive and it got boring after awhile.

My interest has always been primarily on the ceramic art. Too often works purported to be about these tribes are either dry archaelogical reports or museum books fascinated with the glitter of the immense gold collections in public and private collections. This work gives the most up to date information about the archeological work done in a concise summary form. It also provides rich detailed maps of the various tribes, Tumaco, Narino, Quimbaya, Sinu, Tairona, their cultural overlap and a good idea about the complex mountain and river system of Colombia.

This book talks about the social stigma over survivors, how they are not the ones who should feel shame, but those who abused them, helping rape and incest survivors understand they can be proud of the people they are. It also makes a beautiful connection that it doesn't matter what someone did to you, if it was a word, a touch, a brutal attack, it is how that interaction made you feel, how it hurt your spirit. This book does not minimize what happened to you and how that made you feel. It is a guide with eye opening stats, and useful advice to help protect children along with conversation starters. Even if you do not know anyone who has had this life experience, but unfortunately we all do, this is a great read for everyone to be better educated to support someone or prevent others from being hurt.

For anyone interested in business and trade, obviously we need to keep our eyes on what's happening in China. Ross offers a very relevant critique of current business models and at the same time provides captivating history and culture lessons. Also, it's really well written, the author has a very nice style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Time and Money - Just Read My Review","review":"Ross correctly points out that China is the subject of many concerns - growth in military spending, environmental degradation, resource acquisition, and loss of jobs in the U.S. He then goes on to assert (correctly, in my opinion) that the most telling development is that the number of foreign-sponsored R&D; centers in China has jumped from 200 to 600 between 2002 and 2004 - thus, China's impact will not be limited to low-end jobs, and can be expected to increase in impact.Finally, Ross goes on to provide evidence that the insecurity created for American employees by Chinese workers is also imposed upon current Chinese workers via those further inland who have not yet acquired jobs - eg. underemployed farmers and those thrown out of work by rationalization of formerly government employers.The bad news is that this pretty well sums up the book's 280+ pages. The good news is that having read this review, you no longer have any need to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"free trade is fair trade","review":"The author obviously doesn't understand basic economics.

Ward, Greg Brown and so on, but after listening to it I could not believe how pedestrian it is. Not that there is anything \\"bad\\" about this music but like Ryan Adams' music there is nothing here I haven't heard done better years ago. I would describe this music as Poco and/or Eagles inspired music(depending on the song) with a little Keith Richards guitar thrown in here and there.

If this is \\"Normal For Bridgewater\\" I don't expect I will be headed there to listen to music anytime soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant but empty","review":"As in all of Stephen Lawhead's novels, the strength here lies in the setting. Though I'm not expert enough to say whether he accurately depicted the Crusades, the scenes in the book evoke realistic images.The story has its merits, though there's not much to distinguish it from other 'quest' stories. Perhaps my memory is faulty but I recall 'Byzantium' to have had a much stronger plot. At times during the novel (particularly scenes with Emperor Alexius) I had to resist the urge to skip ahead. Looking back now I'm sorry I didn't. The scenes didn't convey any vital information and only served to disrupt the flow of the story.At the conclusion of the book it felt like I was reading a Horatio Alger novel. Our Hero gets the riches, gets huge tracts of land, and gets the girl, all by being honest and brave.Definitely not Lawhead's best work. Try the Empyrion books or the Albion trilogy for excellent fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen Lawhead does it again","review":"Once again, I found myself pulled into a world almost 1000 years old. Each of Lawhead's books has affected me in a very strong way. This book did it again. The story pulled at all my emotions, pulling laughter, enjoyment, and tears out of me at different points. I enjoyed the book very much and would recomend it to anyone interested in the time of the Crusades. It makes them real in a sense that I could never get from a textbook. Lawhead also tends to make his stories morality plays, and this happens in this story. Sometimes, when I finish a book, even though I enjoyed it I feel that it really does not have much of a point to it. I have not found this to be true of any of Lawhead's books, definitely not this one. The only reason I did not give this book a full five stars is that it is not as good as Merlin, my favorite of his books. But it is an incredible book that I highly recomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of the Crusades will enjoy this book","review":"This is a story full of adventure that will keep you going all the way. It's entertaining, it's instructive and most of all, it's orginal. Nice to see the involvement of the men from Orkney in the Crusades. Same goes for the Norsemen. There are some endearing characters in this book as well as some interesting twists. In all, a different look at a very documented time in history, the Crusades, which atmosphere and horror are well detailed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldnt put it down","review":"This is my second read from Lawhead, the first being \\"Patrick, Son of Ireland\\". Patrick was just good enough to get me to try again and I'm glad I did. The Iron Lance was great from start to finish. I simply could not put it down and finished it in 2 days. I can't wait to get started on books 2 and 3 in this Celtic Crusades series. Hopefully Santa will bring them! Also, if this is your cup of tea, check out Bernard Cornwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic Lore As It Should Be Told","review":"Stephen Lawhead, long known for his tales of middle earth and refrence to actual history sheds refreshing light on the way the ACTUAL crussades probably were. The portrayal of a corrupt Roman orthodox is, in this day and age, sadly accurate and revealing. He does not glorify the brutality of war but instead shows that these things of our human history did happen...and to everyday people of the age. He shows how a person can surmout the impossible and grow as a creature created for a purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best So Far!","review":"This is by far the best example of this type ofhistorical fantasy from an interesting and fresh perspective: that ofa young celtic nobleman. If you liked Byzantium, or even liked the idea of Byzantium but haven't read it or didn't like it, then get this book, you won't be dissappointed. The wealth of culture from the crusader era is fantastic and offers tremendous insights into the world at that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair to putrid","review":"This book definitely did not meet my expectations.For starters, I didn't find Murdo to be all that sympathetic a character. In fact, I was much more interested in the plight of his mother and girlfriend, left behind in the Orkneys to fend for themselves.Second, the whole turn-of-the-century, secret society plot twist was completely uninteresting and distracting from the main story line. It was tempting to keep turning the pages and skip over most of that stuff.Third, the portrayal of Emperor Alexius and the Byzantines is wildly inaccurate and biased.Fourth and lastly, the church characters such as the bishop and the abbot are portrayed as greedy, arrogant, treacherous and power hungry (qualities that certainly describe the Byzantines. Oh irony!). The western crusaders are also cartoon villains who are painted as either dullards and morons or pyschopathic, homicidal maniacs.Overall, unless you are a fanatic historical fiction reader I don't think you'll enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid portrayal of colliding cultures","review":"Though not my favourite among Lawhead's works, the way he is able to put the reader *into* the setting is once again fantastic, almost cinematic (think OmniMax) in scope. Another repeat feature is the depiction of each culture through the eyes of the other: how Byzantines might have perceived the Germanic Crusaders, and vice-versa. It makes their motives more understandable to us in the end-20th century.

Or the real Jimmy coming out to play?Ever since then, whenever I look at a Stewart film, I appreciate the acting, but the whole \\"I am nice boy from a small town\\" schtick is just a Hollywood facade that of which he actively participated in.When I knew nothing of Stewarts's career, this book provided the \\"basic\\" info I needed but based on that comment made towards the 1970's decade of his career, I am glad that I don't know more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent astronomy binoculars","review":"I had been looking for binoculars for general use and astronomy.

Hawk was about as scary/dangerous as a reflection. The whit was there, the easy repartee, the cooking and all the other things that make Spencer an excellent read, but had I never read this book it wouldn't have mattered one iota. BUT - not to worry, the other books are excellent, worth your time and money and re-readable several times.

Will greatly miss Robert B. Parker's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Spenser story","review":"I have enjoyed all of the Robert B Parker books I have read. This book was no exception. I had to giggle about some of the fashion references. I read it on Kindle and was surprised by the number of errors I saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Hawk-- but doesn't offer much else","review":"We finally meet the delightful Hawk... and that's about all the fun there is to be had in this fourth outing in the series. A great deal of time is spent on the dynamics of marriage, sex, and women's liberation and it's all pretty boring. Maybe if it fed somehow into the mystery, of which there is little, it would fit. Mostly though, it seems like Parker is shoehorning some societal concerns into a nominal Spenser story. He and Susan go round and round, declaring their love for each other, eating, drinking, carousing, making love, etc. The bad guys are met, tricked, and defeated without much ado. I'm reading these in order and I have to say, this one's enough to put me off the whole thing entirely. Fortunately, I am reassured to find others rate this book poorly and that the series grows from here on out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this fun book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Every character in this book had something to keep it interesting, even poor Harvey. It's sad, funny and I didn't want to put it down. Loved Spencer and Susan. They really compliment each other.

I shall try another one to confirm this is how I feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spenser's take on feminism in the 70s","review":"I thought this was a very interesting Spenser book. The focus was more on feminism, midlife crises, crumbling marriages, and Spenser's fairly new relationship with Susan, than it was on crime or being a tough guy (though this was included toward the end, seemingly as an afterthought). It took place in the 70s, when i was born. I enjoyed seeing how men and women related to each other then and reading the 70s slang (though some of it was a little impenetrable). There were some errors in the Kindle edition, but it was still a good reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early yet timeless Spenser","review":"If you aren't familiar with the Spenser series, this is the fourth book. Not that you have to read them in any particular order--but it is interesting to follow the development of the series chronologically. In this tale, Spenser ends up involved in finding a runaway wife--and bailing out her husband from his own mess too. This being an earlier Spenser book gives us a glimpse at how Spenser's relationship with Susan Silverman evolves and a foreshadowing of events to come in the relationship's future. Most notable is the introduction of Hawk to the series (not necessarily as an ally!). Parker's excellent characterization of Spenser through the character's musings, witty remarks, and ethical action are as strong in this novel as any of the other Spenser books I've read thus far. The plot itself has an entertaining build up and even better conclusion--I'd definitely recommend Promised Land to anyone curious about the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, but don't get it on your Kindle","review":"I have read many books on my Kindle and have been pleased with the rendering of all of them, except for this one. I'm not sure how this book was transcribed to the Kindle, but the transcription is awful. Page after page of spelling errors, well, the words are real, but not the correct word. It passed the spell-check, but the sentence is nonsense. From the context you can generally figure out what word was intended, but it happens so often that it really detracts from the book. Read the book? Absolutely - it's a four star book, but get it in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dated, smug Spenser","review":"This book is more than 20 years old, and it hasn't aged well. Spenser is flip and condescending as he deals with women in search of themselves in the long-ago days of Phil Donahue, Alan Alda and Patty Hearst. At times, he is so smug (Susan's word, by the way) that I was sorry I picked up the book. For diehard fans of the series, this edition is noteworthy for the introduction of Hawk. Now that gentleman has indeed aged well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promised Land","review":"The book is very good, but this version for the Kindle is bad, very bad. Misspelled words, poor format, accasional different font type - really detracting and sad that Amazon would sell such a product. Read this book, but not in the Kindle format. I have read over fifty books on my Kindle, and this one is the worst. Don't buy this book in the Kindle format!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spenser is getting more likeable","review":"This book is a turning point for Spenser. He is in love, the caring side of Spenser is really starting to show. In this book, Hawk is introduced. He kind of reminds me of Bubba in the Kenzie/Angela Gennaro series by Lehane.Anyway, this book was about a missing wife, guns, burgulary, murder...all taking place outside of Boston in Cape Cod to New Bedford. Spenser is growing on me and I am looking forward to the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"great magazine!","review":"Arrived quickly, about 3 weeks...

I don't know what's up with the plastic-box card holder thing. It's not big enough to hold an entire row of cards, so you're always changing them, and it's not designed well either, so the cards don't sit in it nicely.

The difficulty of the questions is the main obstacle; my friends and I (all 20-somethings) had never heard of most of the movies and TV shows in this game, and we thought we were real Loonie Tunes and Cartoon Network buffs. Why couldn't the game have stuck to it's advertising: Bugs, Daffy, Dorothy, Dexter's Lab, and Cow and Chicken? Because who would by a game with \\"Thor\\" and \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" -- the answers to at least 15 of the questions -- plastered all over the box? About as many people who would buy something like \\"Lifetime Movie of the Week Trivial Pursuit.\\" A big letdown sums it all up: it's worth maybe one or two plays, and then it would look nice on your shelf, or in a display case to show off the attractive pewter figurines.

The adventure vignettes he presents make for easy, casual night-time reading; it is easy to pick up where you last left the story. Interviews with many of today's legends of exploration round out the reading experience; Sir Edmund Hillary, the son of his climbing partner Jamling Norgay, astronaut Buzz Aldrin, and four minute miler Roger Bannister are among the many.

But this is not what one would expect from Mr. Mailer. This is one novel, 2 novellas and a myth in one book about Ancient Egypt. The first part is a surreal scene which introduces us to the Egyptian concept of 'soul'. In the Judeo-Christian world view we have 'a' soul: the Egyptians had many, including the ba and ka to name two. The next is a wonderful retelling of the Osiris myth. The middle half of this large book is the story of Ramesses the Great's military expedition against the Hittites told by his charioteer. (This may be the section of the book most identified as 'Mailer'.) The last part is a dreamy view of life among the royals of ancient Egypt. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Stream of Consciousness.","review":"Packs a lot of thought and realizations, story telling, in a short time span, without moving around, yet that's exactly what you feel is going on. Very vividly told, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful.","review":"This was a magnificent waste of time -- not only is it hard to read, but there is no pay off! From start to finish the book is a tangled morass of hallucinogenic flashbacks. As others have mentioned, the bizarre sexual imagery is pervasive and oppressive. There are plenty of other great sources for learning about Ancient Egypt -- skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lewd, Disgusting but at times Enlightening & Powerful","review":"Full of characters who eat the excrement, flesh or [body parts] of a variety of animals in order to gain the wisdom and strength that they offer, Ancient Evenings journeys a path into a world of Ancient Egypt that I have never known. Nor frankly, for that matter, care to. Yet, Mailer's portrait of Rameses II, Usermare as he is known is this work, is incredible. Divine and human, Horus and Set are woven so well into the fabric of of this pharoah's character that his struggle to maintain harmony between these two opposing forces alone is worth wading through the rest of the book. My faith in Ancient Egypt as a whole and its actual traditions is restored by Mailer, however, by the conclusion of this work but not before I have been thoroughly disgusted by a variety of acts descibed by the protagonist Menehetet."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!!","review":"Everyone worships Mailer so I thought I would read this one. It was awful! This guy is so out of touch with what people are really interested in today. Isn't a writer supposed to be able to entertain?

If you find ancient Egypt fascinating there are about 100 books you should try before you waste a cent or second on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"dire.. no really","review":"Self indulgent garbage from the pen of the once (it seemed to me anyway) infallible Mailer. What the hell was he thinking? I find it hard to believe that this mess came from the mind of the same man that wrote The Naked And The Dead. Ok, at some points the narrative can be readable, even enjoyable; a few protagonists certainly succeed in stimulating the reader at a few points; but by and large this is a rambling piece of piss. If you enjoyed this then I envy you because you are certainly easily amused, more than I can say.Too often this book relies on nothing more than cheap shock value to engage the reader, artless descriptions of intercourse/ copulation which probably means heaven on earth for some panting voyeurs out there but sadly left me unmoved. Some might say I'm being a bit too scathing but I'm only voicing my opinion and I honestly think this book should be burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing to a Mailer Fan","review":"I've read most of his books and thoroughly enjoyed them, but not this one.

This is the third Mailer book I've read, after The Naked And The Dead and The Fight. Both, in their different ways, utterly brilliant. This book just goes on interminably and you get the impression Mailer just gets sick of it, wraps things up quickly and gets out of there. If you can make it that far though, the last few pages are great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All sound and no fury","review":"This book is a dud, and a long and painful one at that. I've been reading Mailer my entire life. He's written masterpieces (Armies of the Night, Executioner's Song) and there are the great collections of journalism (Advertisements for Myself, Existential Errands, etc), but let's face it, he's never written even a good novel, and this one doesn't even come close. There's a lot of huffing and puffing and certainly some interesting recreations of the Ancient Egypt, but the book goes nowhere and adds up to nothing. Norman Mailer needs an enema -- and fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well researched but very strange...","review":"Mailer seems obsessed with sex. And not just sex, but what one would normally construe as perverted sex. Initially I dismissed it. Mailer seemed intent on placing the profane and sacred close beside one another. The beautiful and the ugly. This coming together of opposites tended to draw you into the mythological perspective of the book. The 'one-ness' of the sexes, the power and might associated with the act itself. Death and rebirth tossed together in a swirling and nondescript pool of incestuous desires. There was much similarity to passages in the Tibetan Book of the Dead. However, the continuing sexual onslaught of homosexual lust did grow tedious. In fact boring. Whenever two males were left alone, you only had to wait a paragraph or so before they would have homosexual relations. Seemed to me to go a bit beyond the need to establish a mythological basis for the book. Somewhat Freudian even."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Love Story in Beautiful Italy's Countryside","review":"I've seen this movie a few times and finally broke down and got myself a copy since Amazon's price was awesome.

The cemetery, however, is filling up, with only three spaces left. So Reno's task is to do everything he can, fair but nearly foul, if necessary, to prevent anyone else dying. His frenetic efforts are in stark contrast to Roseanna's calm and settled manner of dealing with her situation. Its a charmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Roseanna","review":"This was a great movie.

The jaunty \\"Innocent\\" serves as a sensible opener. On \\"That's What You Get\\", he bares his punk, folk and country (dobro in the outro) influences. The romantically adrift \\"Gina\\" is sharp and detailed. He sing-speaks \\"Nature Boy\\", akin to Lou Reed, with guitar feedback as he tempers his frustration with wicked humor. The folky \\"No Violins\\" has R&B shadings in its melody and electric guitar. It's catchy and funny as hell. And has anyone ever shared a sadder tale on acoustic guitar-and-vocal only than Freedy has on \\"Tucumcari\\"?

Returning characters include Sgt Carey Mahoney, Hightower, Hooks, Jones, Callahan, Tackleberry and two recruits from the previous picture, Sweetchuck and Zed. The story of Commandant Lassard wanting to implement a new citizen outreach program with the usual opposition from Captain Harris is worthy of another sequel but it is Zed who steals the thunder of the other cast members and takes the spotlight to new heights of hilarium.

Here we get to see a young David Spade in his first movie and he was the lucky winner to be included in this mediocre junk. This is also Steve Guttenbergs last movie playing the role as Mahoney and I do not blame him for wanting out. The jokes are the same as in the first movie. The script is like a joke compared to the first movie and the citizens on patrol idea was just stupid. The music is terrible and sounds like the cheapest 80's music that they could possibly find.

Grieve's theory that Pound displaces the self from the poetry fails to convince, as some of his work is clearly about the struggle to be a poet in an unpoetic change.

However, the book was a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful classic","review":"I read the book, then the movie. Overall the movie is faithful to the spirit of the book despite several changes. Kathy Bates made an absolutely top-notch Annie Wilkes. She went perfectly between the role of sweet and concerned nurse/caretaker to the psychotic, obsessed fan. I can never forget the scene where Annie actually takes a sledgehammer and... no, I don't want to spoil it for you. This movie is a definite treat for any Kathy Bates fans, but James Caan also does a great job. Both of them carried the story rather well, especially considering that these two are pretty much the only people in the film aside a few bit players."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Thriller","review":"Misery is one of the best in the horror/suspense genre. I have to say I don't think I've seen a better movie that was based off of a book.

He awakes from being unconscious to find himself in the home and care of a very obsessed fan(Kathy Bates). As he gets better he begins to realize his caretaker has no intention on letting him go anywhere.Exceptional thriller which anyone would enjoy.

Locked in his room, addicted to the drug Narville she gives him to heel his pain, and at the mercy of this unstable female he doesn't have much choice.

The print they had to work with is decent, but nowhere near perfect.One of the better King adaptations, largely due to Caan and Bates, but only 2 stars for a second lame DVD transfer.

Annie wants Paul to write a new Misery Chastain novel just for her or she'll get nasty! The scene with a sledge hammer is not for the faint-hearted. The performances & plot are very convincing, and Kathy Bates even won the best actress oscar for her amazing realistic performance. Not nearly as gruesome and nasty as the Stephen King novel but still veryenjoyable nontheless. Rated R for violence & profanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense thriller","review":"An acting tour de force for stars James Caan and Kathy Bates and a triumph for director Rob Reiner. The action is mostly confined to a single house and involves conflict between just two characters, yet the tension is palpable.

William Goldman's script also deserves mention: the characters behave intelligently, so it is enjoyable to watch the cat-and-mouse game that unfolds before us."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I honestly expected Misery to bore me.

I received the order from Amazon quickly, read the instructions and placed the heater. I noticed that after it had built up heat I could see that it was working. The area around the surface ice had melted. Good enough. The next day I went out and thought it odd that a little snow had collected on top of the de-icer and the space around the de-icer seemed to have frozen again. I left things go for several more hours and decided to pull the heater out only to discover that it was no longer working. It wasn't warm at all. So, I made return arrangements with Amazon and purchased a different de-icer.Needless to say, I was incredibly disappointed with this purchase. I had hopes that it would do a decent job but to stop working after a day and a half puts this product squarely in my junk category."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for only one season","review":"This is the second one of these I have purchased.

Some say the first two Police Academy movies were the best in the series. However, most people I know have said that Police Academy 5 was the first flop in the series and here are some reasons why. First of all, any sequel in a series of films that is direct to video is most likely not as good as it's previous sequels. Second, Carrey Mahoney (Steve Guttenburg) is very much missed in this movie. Third, G.W. Bailey does not do as good of a job playing Captain Harris in this film as he did in Police Academy 1 & 4. Fourth, I realize that the plots in the Police Academy moives are not supposed to be taken seriously. However, the plot for Police Academy 5 was just not interesting in the least. Sure, it was a good idea to have Police Academy 5 take place in Miami Beach but everything else pretty much fails for the movie. Skip this one if you haven't already seen it and watch Police Academy 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Love the Police Academy movies love comedies if someone loves wacky comics this is a must own for you yes indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rene Auberjonois saves it","review":"At this point in the Police Academy Series they have literally played all their cards in the joke department and have literally gotten repetitive and formulaic. So why not at this point put all your money on the villain which is exactly what Assignment Miami Beach does. Rene Auberjonois steals every single scene he is in and overshadows just about everyone else in the movie with his antics. For those who are bit more contemporary this is Odo from Star Trek Deep Space Nine. That's right. Odo is HILARIOUS! I remember Rene from Benson but I never remembered him in PA: 5 and after rewatching this I never remember him being this funny. If it wasn't for Rene's strengths as an actor, PA 5 would have been an utter failure. PA 5 may be ringing the last drops out of an exhausted franchise but at least Rene is strong enough to make those final drops worth anyone's while."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE ABSENCE OF STEVE GUTTENBERG MADE IT WORSE","review":"THIS TIME, THE BUMBLING POLICE OFFICERS GO ON A MISSION IN MIAMI BEACH.

It's written in this typical style: \\"if this-and-that happened 10.000 years ago then we might expect this to happen again.\\". This becomes very annoying after a number of chapters. Besides dubious content, the book is not properly formatted. Sentences and sometimes complete paragraphs are broken off with their remainders spilled into other sentences or paragraphs, making reading the book a challenge...

Edmonds was an excellent and engaging author; I truly wish there were more like him. He grew up in the Mohawk Valley of New York, the setting of this book, and his knowledge of that area's history cannot be surpassed among people who lived in recent times.

This is terrible and the author needs to take the advice of her friend who left the note suggesting that she gets an editor. I've got an even better idea. Don't stop at one. Get two or three editors.

I must commend the author for having the courage to follow her dream; however, I must also express my dissatisfaction with the book for the following reasons:-Grammatical errors.-Numerous typos.-Extremely weak development of all characters.-What was her goal in writing the book? Are the readers supposed to relate/absorb themselves/fantasize about the characters?-No \\"quoted\\" dialogue between characters.-No real transition from chapter to chapter.I am no expert in this field by any means but, did the author utilize \\"writers' help manuals\\" to assist her with her writing?

The Pianist is appealing on so many different levels. The beauty of the music that Szpilman uses to keep himself alive set against the backdrop of the most horrific scenes of human degradation imaginable. This film puts Polanski on a whole new level of filmmaker, easily surpassing Speilberg's Schindler's List in quality of sets, locations, editing, musicianship - everything! It is authentic in that Polanski uses mainly Polish craft workers in the production. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Felt the movie,now feel the music that truly inspires..","review":"The Pianist is a great and \\"fantaztisch\\" movie itself! Note the great actors Adrien Brody and Thomas Kretschmann. Now, how would the movie be without the music itself that inspired and still inspiring thousands of people who listened to it.All the piano works are classical and have a story of it's own.From the Nocturnes; sad, moving and played on the first part of the movie (yes, the intro) and when the jews are fighting and facing their nightmares.To Ballade 1 & 2, which was played by Spilzman (adrien brody) in that movie when he met up with the german officer Hosenfeld (thomas kretschmann)..Just by listening to the soundtrack you could already see and feel the whole movie. Especially the Nocturnes... very touching.. recommending this album to those who fell in love to the piano works in the movie like i was, just by listening it for the first time! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"jangly guitars and upbeat pop with a twist of country twang.","review":"This album combines the vocals of Sam Prekop from the Sea and Cake with twangy country style guitars and even a banjo, with a grounded but jaunty rhythm section.

Having studied German, French, and Latin, I found that Elementary Standard Arabic was set up more like a text for an ancient language rather than a modern one. I clearly remember even now how to say, \\"Egypt relies heavily on the waters of the High Dam\\". Any complaints I voiced fell on deaf ears, because no other texts existed at that time period. The fact that people are still having to use this dreadful series is an indictment of progress in Arabic pedagogy over the past 30 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid, Humourless, Boring, AWFUL","review":"I used this textbook as an undergraduate. Happily my instructor was enthusiastic and competent, plus my Hebrew helped, AND I had Lebanese friends who tutored me...because this textbook was just AWFUL. If you're on your own, I suppose you can make it work to get a grounding in bookish Arabic...if you're utterly determined and there's nothing else available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful but needs updating","review":"I found the book to be very helpful. The section on the alphabet starts from the easiest letter and builds from there, hammering in the information until you know it forward and backward. The information builds, like language, and is not just thrown out to you. The book was, however, written with a typewriter and, for the writing section, by hand, and so contains a few blotches in the Arabic. With new computer technology, the book as it is written could use a better print. The book contains many exercises that are thorough and will ensure that any student will learn the material. The exercises develop a strong, gradual base of learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Digest","review":"I teach Elementary Arabic at the University of Indiana from this book. It is strict grammar translation. The material is very dry and hard for the students to comprehend. It doesn't contain much in the way of actual Arabic material. There is one short dialogue per chapter and the topic of the dialogue progresses from the University to the Office to Famous Arabic Literary figures. Using this book you would never get around to asking someone where the bathroom is or be able to talk about your family. It is best used as a grammar supplement only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find Something Else","review":"Though some people obviously find this book useful in their study of Arabic, I have not. I used this book for the first two years of Arabic study and found it trying at best. Yes, Arabic is difficult, however this book does not provide desperately needed grammatical explanations. Also, it teaches you random vocabulary that neglects the essentials that normal language books teach you at the beginning. Not to mention the lack of modern type settings, making it more difficult to read the Arabic text.If you are interested in newspaper Arabic, I recommend Media Arabic published by the University of Edinburgh Press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book if you never want to speak to an Arab","review":"This book has been overshadowed by its successors. The vocabulary is atrocious, and the book seems to be designed for some kind of a military/political purpose that I can't glean, even after using it for years.This book will serve you well if you want to appear totally illiterate to your conversation partner. You'll know the word for \\"republic\\", but you'll probably never learn the words for anything in your kitchen, let alone your living room or the world we all live in. Do yourself a favor and skip this if you're interested in learning Arabic."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is horrible","review":"My instructor thinks this text is great. He is wrong.Even with the arabic cassettes to accompany this textthe lessons are dull and difficult to comprehend fromthe examples.

If youwant to be confused buy this book. The studentsin my class that speak Arabic, but don't knowhow to read or write complain about this text."},{"rating":"2","title":"very helpful!","review":"When I first approached this book it looked extremely dry and boring, as many people have already commented. My intention was to be able to learn Arabic with a view to understanding the Quran and also for daily use. In this respect the book presents the language very succinctly and logically and endows you with a firm foundation in understanding its structure which allows you to go away and generalise very easily; very useful for further learning. This, I think, more than makes up for a more ad hoc approach. After all, MSA is descended from the Quran whose language is extremely mathematically elegant. It only seems right that we try to understand the language at this depth if we are to truly appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible layout and typography","review":"Unless you're an accomplish grammarian you should avoid this book at all costs.

The tapes that come with it are recommended to assist in comprehension. Now if you are going to purchase it to learn how to read the Quraan and Ahadeeth and texts of the Ulamaa's books then this book has my Jarh automatically! The type is soooo old that you can tell the Arabic script was done with an Arabic typewriter waay back in the 70's! It is not recommended for communication either unless you want an Arab to ask you why you are speaking like a textbook. My recommendation is to go straight to the Madeenah Grammar Books and complete the four mustaweeyaat available at the Islamic University of Madeenah's homepage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating book to learn from","review":"This book is awful. My professors despise it and are switching next year. I skipped a year of Arabic and came into a class that was in the middle of this book. What a headache trying to figure out the format of the book. As far as the vocab, it is pretty irrelevant to someone who wants to learn to have an actual conversation in Arabic. I know all kinds of words for business and can tell you about Egypt's economic independence upon the Nile, but I have no idea how to ask where the restroom is. The dual for any form of verb is simply not listed. You don't even learn the numbers until half way through the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and Dreadful","review":"Arabic has the reputation of being one of the most difficult languages in the world, and this book is one of the reasons. It is accurate, authoritative, and widely-used, but is is also very large, highly-technical, and devoid of visual stimulation. Students can (and do) spend months pouring over this material, only to be dismayed at how little of the book they have completed. In addition, the recorded material, on which many of the exercises are based, is difficult to obtain and prohibitively-priced. The book is useful as a last resort, but fortunately there are now many other better texts available."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent advance in the way Arabic is taught","review":"This textbook is designed to cover the first year of instruction in Modern Standard Arabic. It will teach students to read, speak, and write Arabic. The text also provides information about the geography of the Arab world, prominent characters in history, festivities in Arab culture, the media, daily life, and the family. Exercises in comprehension, vocabulary, grammar, and writing attend to both form and meaning and develop functional abilities and knowledge about the Arabic sound, writing, and language systems. The book needs an updating and it will be an excellent book.

It's the worst Arabic textbook out there, except all those other ones.Some of the grammar rules it states are misleading. The vocabulary in the book is in fairly impractical, unless you are going to be spending a lot of time in the office of the director, and on top of that, the font is very bad and at times illegible, which is akin to salt in the wounds of someone not familiar with the alefabet. Out of the 10 or so foreign language textbooks I've used, this is by far the worst foreign language textbook I've ever encountered. On the plus side, it's (sadly) the best one for Arabic out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good textbook","review":"I think it's a good textbook despite its dryness, bad fonts and absence of pictures. The main advantage compared to many other Arabic textbooks - you can use it on your own! I was able to find some audio files for Elementary MSA 1 and practiced pronunciation with other textbooks. It's definitely worth republishing in a better format even without changing the contents. I gave it 4 out of 5 because of the above flaws but if you are looking for a good and accurate textbook, it is the one!

At the same time Aladdin and his monkey, Abu, are good, and Jaffar and Jago are evil. So the stage is set.Alassin is the poor unassuming hero with a heart of gold, and he becomes the hero only because of his attraction to the sultan's beautiful and headstrong daughter. The villian does all he can to place himself in power, and the genie and the most cleaver character in the whole movie - the magic carpet - provide the comic relief.The movie is definitely watchable, it's fun, and extremely Disneyesque.You will definitely be glad you have your own copy of this disc. It's a kid-pleaser, but it is not a 5-star offering in my opinion. Very good, but not great.4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie is great!

The package was also delivered quicker than expected, which is always a nice perk. I would recommend using this seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"LD may be OUT, but this was a good replacement for my VHS","review":"I am not reviewing the movie.I am just saying that when my collection of VHS tapes became old and the analog magnetic media was faltering due to playback, I wanted to get digital of my old movies. But new Disney movies are about $20 even when used.When Disney movies first came out you could spend up to $100 to get a video that went back in the Disney vault.Well, same thing is happening with DVD, while we wait for the videos to come out on Blu-ray.So my solution is to seek out the older videos on the stable LaserDisc format, they are digital and usually disney videos are not subject as much to Laser Rot that damaged discs (there are resources to check if the LD was subject to laser rot)So I get the classics in digital about 425 lines of resolution as opposed to VHS which is about 220 lines. Not as good as DVD or Blu-ray but great for watching my favorite Disney Video's again, without spending tons of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney rocks","review":"I saw this movie and loved it. Aladdin is a commoner who is homeless and steals what he needs in order to survive, along with his trusty monkey Abu. He is tricked by Royal Viser Jaffar into stealing a lamp. Jafar tries to turn the tables on Aladdin by double crossing him and killing him while stealing the lamp back, but Abu bites Jafar causing him to lose control of the lamp. Aladdin befriends a genie and the adventure goes on from there. Eventually Aladdin does fall in love with a princess, but also makes a promise to the genie to use his last wish to free him. I thought this movie was really sweet in many areas. I would recommend this film to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish we could buy digital copy","review":"The Disney vault is an outdated concept that is hurting sales, I would love to purchase a digital copy of this for my kids but alas we just rented instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift","review":"Great Christmas surprise!

Was so nice seeing it through his eyes all over again. My favorite Disney movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story Holds Up Well; Animation Somewhat Dated","review":"The kids had never seen this movie and I hadn't watched it in about 10 years. We all enjoyed it a lot. Robin Williams is a master of voiceover and completely in his element. His performance is reason alone to rent this movie. The storyline is appropriate for most kids and while there are some scary parts, they aren't too intense and are not graphic. The theme of being oneself carries through the whole movie and doesn't come across in a moralistic manner.The animation is at times grainy and flat. I remember it being quite good at the time it came out. Technology has simply advanced so far in the intervening years that older animation seems antiquated. That said, it's not too bothersome and is saved by the skill of the Disney talent pool at developing the characters personality through their actions and expressions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible....","review":"Why this new edition? I really do not understand the reason...There was no need to change the music..'A whole new world' sung by Regina Belle and Peabo Bryson IS a masterpiece,maybe one of the most beautiful song and interpretation of the last decades...And the new awful,disastrous version by Jessica Simpson and her Hubby really makes me feel so...depressed about the hard times we are living in the US now...because all this shameful,TV-derivated trash which surround us is the mirror of our current society and culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aladdin","review":"Got DVD in timely matter, sooner than expected and Granddaughtr loves it.

About this movie Aladdin is a teenage boy who has a pet monkey name Abu they both live in desert city name Agrabah, (I don't know wear in is in real life). They are very poor it even's get to the point wear Aladdin might have no choice but to steal some food and run from the palace guards. Jasman is a princess living in a big palace wear she is force to marry a prince accourding by law but the law is wrong she wants to marry for love another thing she hates is she never even been outside the palace walls and the world is a big place, one night she snuck out into the city and meat Aladdin."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute must for fans!!","review":"I'm an avid fan of Disney and had this pre-ordered months in advance... And it really was worth the wait!!There's a huge amount of extras... Read the specs above for details... There are interviews, making of... Stuff for kids... Just loads and loads.Something I seemed to miss, however, was the included signed sketches from the animators... WOW... Great!! Most certainly something you don't pick up with the average DVD.Whilst this set is fantastic, it's more for die-hard Disney fans. If you just want to see the original movie, pick up a cheap DVD off eBay... You'll certainly be missing out, though!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Mix","review":"This movie is the perfect mix of action, adventure, romance, magic, friendship, and comedy. The genie is hilarious, and at one part my brother and I backed up the video at least five times to hear him repeat a funny comment. Aladdin himself is a good main character, and Abu the monkey makes a fun sidekick. Finally, I must comment on the beautiful Princess Jasmine. She is headstrong, and independant; but still loving and easily upset. The animation is colorful, the songs are catchy, and overall I would say this is a great family movie! The best Aladdin movie out of the ones made."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WAS NOT AN A ORIGINAL !!!!!!","review":"This was a gift for my daughter. It was a copy of the movie re-wrapped. If it was a great copy I might not have mind so much, but it wasn't. I will never again buy a movie from another seller on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst message to children","review":"I am appalled by all the positive reviews. This movie sends the worst message to children. Please everyone, strip away the visuals and the catchy music and look carefully at the storyline. It is about a poor boy who has big dreams. But rather than trying to work his way up, he resorts to stealing. Apparently the only way one can succeed in life is by finding a magic Genie in a bottle. But worst of them all is the princess. She is a rich spoiled girl who is bored to death, complaining about her life while ignoring the street children eating out of trash cans outside her palace wall. There are never any indication that these two did anything to help anybody else but themselves. Shame on you, Disney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vault this Disney!!!!","review":"I'm so tired of waiting for Disney to release their movies onto DVD. Then after several months they'll vault them for ten years, by then my son won't care about watching Disney movies. Why can't they make them available to parents on demand? \\"Building consumer demand\\", sounds like Disney doesn't really want my money anyway. If you're lucky enough to get this movie before the dealers grab them all up (just to charge you triple or more of the original price after it's re-vaulted.)then you're doing good. Pixar was smart enough to say enough is enough when will we, as consumers do the same. Do yourself a favor buy a Dreamworks animated film like Antz, Chicken Run or Shrek. Disney films are way to over-rated. My son really enjoys 'Quest for Camelot' and 'Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much talent in this film.","review":"With the wonderful success of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" a movie that i truly admire for being something original from Disney which is VERY rare since the death of Walt. This movie is almost an exact same copy of \\"Beauty\\".Basically i'm talking about the music score. If you hear the music carefully you'll notice that most of the songs are the same songs as in \\"Beauty\\" but just altured enough to give it just a slight difference.This is because the talent that comes from Disney is nothing like it use to be when Walt ran the business. So this movie is pretty poor in my estimations. There is nothing original about this music score. Save your money folks,,,it's not worth the plastic it was recorded on."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPOINTING...","review":"This has GOT to be one of Disney's worse films ever made! Even \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" was better!! I'll admit that the voices are pretty good but the Special-FX are kinda cheesy! \\"Aladdin\\" just doesn't have that good ol' Disney touch. The storyline is rather dumb, the characters are boring, and the lyrics to the songs are so, sooooo annoying! (I don't know how many times I heard the \\"Whole New World\\" theme on the radio.)

The quality of the materials is good and thin enough for me (although the leather is a bit stiff).However, my right hand glove has a thumb that is comically large. You can literally fight three of my fingers in that thumb.The left hand size is a lot better; almost a 90% fit to my fingers and thumb.It's not worth my time or money to return, but you may also get unlucky.

The barrel of the tips that go into the iron is 3/8 inch wide in diameter and over 1.5 inch long. Most tips have a smaller diameter and a shorter insertion length limiting the selection I have found to the three blunt chisel tips from Weller. They do not offer a screwdriver tip which in Weller speak appears to have the bevel length I prefer.

As a professional couple, we will probably find a place amongst the 20% employed - for as long as the corporate masters need us anyway - should we be willing to follow the new corporate slogan of \\"if you are awake, you are at work\\". And as someone who grew up in the so-called \\"third world\\", I have seen a few sides of the argument. I would describe the book as \\"sane\\" rather than \\"left-wing\\".

As for the movie itself, it is clearly trying to cash in on Paranormal Activity fans but this movie is not a direct copycat. It mirrors an episode of Ghost Hunters much more then any found footage movie. Its also nice that this flick is based off true events of a real killer. My only beef with the film was the needless nudity... Very lame and took away some credibility. Other then that I recommened it very much for fans of Blair Witch / Paranormal Actvitiy type movies.

I, on the other hand, found it be extremely boring and badly acted, not to mentioned bloodless. It's basically trying to cash in on the success of The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, which I honestly wasn't a fan of either of those. But I wanted to see 8213: Gacy House because I am fascinated with William H. Gacy, and I had just seen the interesting Dear Mr. Gacy. But this movie is just a silly joke. \\"Gacy\\" doesn't even appear until toward the end of the movie, a movie which doesn't contain anything scary, awesome, or cool. For a better movie about Gacy, check out the aforementioned Dear Mr. Gacy or even Gacy. And for a better haunted house flick, check out The House On Haunted Hill or Thirteen Ghosts. Just for God's sake, stay away from 8213: Gacy House.

Despite blair, I enjoy that movie concept but recognize that, again given its predecessors, it must be done well. This one not so much. While its technically sound (ok acting, ok lighting, sets, etc.), it just fails to deliver a scare.

It is melodic and textured without ever being in danger of becoming prepackaged top 40 music. At first listen, the relationship between this album and the rest of YLT's oeuvre may appear puzzling or nonexistent.

We've tried pureed fruit with yogurt and various fruit juices, and they worked like a charm for many uses. They sit nicely in the freezer, but do take up a good deal of room.

These work great and I do like the stand feature and the fact that they're dishwasher safe. They just make huge popsicles! Or at least bigger than I was expecting/wanting. That aside, these work perfectly fine and I'll continue to use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy!","review":"These are great for adults or older children, they are large, but a great buy. They are sturdy and don't fall over in the freezer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy Popsicle Molds","review":"These popsicle molds are very nice. The size and shape of them are perfect. I like smoothies, but can't always finish them. I pour the leftovers into the popsicle molds and freeze them for later. I especially like that these are BPA free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make your own frozen treats","review":"I bought these molds a few months ago as we love frozen treats during the summer and I wanted to try making my own. The molds are easy to use and are a nice size for all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall, but a little unsteady/breakable","review":"These popsicle molds are nice, although a bit frail after frozen. They are large (larger than the picture leads one to believe), and they do have a tendency to fall out of the tray if standing upright in the freezer. I had one fall out onto my vinyl floor and the bottom portion (which secures the popsicle in the tray) snapped off. Otherwise, they clean easily and the finished popsicles come out easily after running the molds under warm water for about 20 seconds. I also like that they do not contain bisphenol-A (BPA)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too big pop molds","review":"I only read other reviews about how well-made it is. How it's easy to use, etc. I should have read the reviews more comprehensively. These are extremely big pop molds. It's overwhelmingly big for young children (2 and 5 yr old). It might be good for teenagers and adults. But there should be a note somewhere how much oz. of liquid it holds and freezes etc. There is product dimension for pop mold stand which holds them. But that doesn't give me any idea how big these mmolds are. When I opened the box, we were disappointed how big these molds are. Purchasing something like this online without viewing in real life is a risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as stated, good price, good seller","review":"Does the trick for me. I love ice-cream but want to make healthy treats. With these molds, I can make things like home-made yogurt pops - home-made yogurt blended with fresh or frozen fruit - which provide the satisfaction of a sweet frozen treat while not compromising my health goals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Popsicles","review":"I'm really happy with these popsicle molds. They make large popsicles, perfect for my husband and I, and they're very easy to use and clean. The pops come out of the molds easily when dipped in hot water for a few seconds, and the mold can be immediately refilled and put back in the freezer. Very much recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice and high quality","review":"These popsicle molds are very nice and sturdy, easy to fill and to wash out. I like them especially because you can just take one out of the freezer compared to other molds that are all-in-one mold. The only negative is that they are a little messy to eat. If you don't pay attention and don't hold the popsicle straight you will most certainly end up with a couple drips here and there from the popsicle melting while you eat it. Would definetly buy again though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"These things are great!!! Constructed very well, I thought they would be more flimsy but was happily surprised. I foresee many wonderful years of popscicle making. So far I made orange juice pops, chocolate pudding pops, and frozen yogurt pops.......the choices are endless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell out of freezer and broke!","review":"I just received these popsicle molds a few days ago, have never used the frozen smoothie popsicles...a few minutes ago the whole set fell on the floor, and every single mold broke....do not buy these!I went to Target and bought two less expensive popsicle molds, about $3.00 each, much better, more stable, more flexible plastic. Popsicles release easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to get out","review":"The stand is nice and can take 1 out at time... we make popsicles with a bit of jello and kool-aid - really hard to get out. Run under hot water and wiggle for 2-3 minutes and hope the stick doesn't break or pull out."},{"rating":"1","title":"too big for toddlers and small children","review":"These are great molds, BPA free, well designed, sturdy, good-looking, except they are.... huge!I read the review saying they are too big for small kids and I got them anyway, thinking, how big can they be? Answer: as long as my todder's fingertips to her elbow. If an adult had a popsicle this big it would be the size of a shoebox.Even if she could hold them, they need a lot of juice to fill, likely to melt (and make a large puddle!) I took a photo, don't see a way to upload here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged & now can't return","review":"I live in Ohio and we don't get blazing hot temps around here until late June and into July most summers. I bought these molds this spring and just opened the box to use them for the July 4th weekend. They have some kind of black oil or something all over them -- like it was rubbed on something in the factory or got caught in a machine at the factory and marred. Every single one had this stuff and I have tried to get it off but can't. Amazon says I missed the window for return by three weeks. This was a very short window of time in which to return something and I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with Amazon on this point. Beyond that, the picture they have and the actual item don't look a thing alike. I would beware and look elsewhere for ice pop molds."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HAPPY","review":"Very unhappy with purchase. The ice pop molds are entirely too large for an infant popsicle ! They were also over priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn it! Hard to open.","review":"I wish that somewhere in ANY of these reviews that even one person had mentioned that these ice molds are not good for people with weak or injured hands or wrists. I have a torn wrist, and now that the pop is frozen, I cannot open the damn thing without further injuring myself. Looks like I'll have to wait for the ice to melt to get it open, so what's the point?Will be returning this and continuing to purchase Fruit Floes from Trader Joe's.Such a disappointment...I waited so long and eagerly for these to arrive...so bummed.PS. I gave it 2 stars because I can tell that this would be a good product for someone who has healthy hands and wrists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Quality","review":"These molds looked flimsy in the photo, but they are sturdy. I use them daily and there is nothing I've found that comes close to being this good. They are easy to handle and stand up straight in the base, no tipping. Easy to wash, they don't stain and the pops slide out of the sleeve handily after being put in warm water for a few seconds. Best of all, the molds are individual. The sticks stay in place, too. I make fudgesickles by doubling diet packaged hot chocolate (Nestle or Swiss Miss), letting it cool and pouring it in the molds. Each mold holds 1/2 cup liquid ...terrific! Cristal Light is great, too (mix it a little strong). Have treats all day and stay skinny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Iced Pleasure on a Stick!","review":"I had tried other Popsicle molds before finding Tovolo and was sorely disappointed. The plastic sticks would break after just a couple of uses, the molds did not hold very much, and the holder was not that steady in my freezer. These Tovolo Yellow Groovy Pop Molds, in my opinion, work on every level. The molds make a beautiful Popsicle with an abundant amount of iced product, the sticks are strong, and the container holding the 6 molds are sturdy in my over-stuffed freezer. The molds go through the dishwasher without an issue and don't retain any coloring nor odor from their last use. I am thrilled and would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely the BEST...hands down","review":"i got the sudden urge to make ice pops a few months ago and i almost made an impulse buy at the supermarket and bought some crappy ice pop trays....but instead, i did my research and found THESE. and they were 100% worth the wait...they are the best EVEr.... it's the perfect size pop (some other reviewers said they're too big but if you measure how much they hold, which i did, it's less than 1/2 a cup, so in terms of a serving size, one pop is completely reasonable for 1 person, if not 2. i use grapefruit juice a lot and 1/2 a cup of pure juice, not watered down, is only 45 calories. they could NOT be easier to remove from the molds either, just place under hot running water from the sink for no more than 6 seconds and jiggle it a bit, gently, and WA LA! easy to clean, plastic doesn't absorb the taste or color of whatever mixtures you put in...i recently made pina colada pops (yogurt, shredded coconut and chunks of pineapple) sheer heaven"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Pop Molds","review":"I love this Ice Pop Mold. I have used it over and over through out the summer. It's high desert where I live, so these cold treats really hit the spot. They make good size treats too, and I won a blue ribbon when I published the recipe I created for these. I recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to pricy store bought pops","review":"I'm really a child at heart and love to eat those Otter Pops and other popsicles from the store on a hot day. That little indulgence can quickly add up, so I began looking for a suitable alternative and these pop molds are just what I needed. The molds are great! The offer a large sized popsicle and have easy to use molds that are BPA free. I've used these a whole lot already, so they are also durable. Great product that I would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...but a little room for improvement","review":"My kiddos are popsicle experts. We were looking for BPA free popsicle molds and these looked great. Overall we are pleased. The molds snap into the tray and help keep them stable in the freezer. The popsicles come out easily and the molds are large enough to make quite a generous pop.But, as my son pointed out, there only three holes on the stick. This leaves a fair amount of stick without anything to hold the popsicle on the stick after it's partially eaten and semi-melted. If they had just added one more hole to the stick, they would have perfection. Our suggestion: Eat 'um quick until the manufacturer decides to add another hole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"These are great. Received five instead of six and emailed them and they promptly sent me the sixth one. Maybe a bit big for kids, but they're fine for me and my family. I like that they're bpa free. Just have to run them under warm water or they're a bit difficult to get out, but not really a big issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"sticks to the mold","review":"This is my first time with my own popsicle molds; I've tried two batches and I have the hardest time to get the popscicles out of the molds!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pop Mold","review":"My kids just love this.

In fact, I'm ordering an extra set so I can always have frozen treats made. I do have to run hot water over them for a few seconds so they'll easily slide out. But they're sturdy, dishwasher safe an do the intended job quite well. I make fruit pops with them...blend fresh or frozen fruit with some skim milk and sometimes some Greek Yogurt for added creaminess. Often I also add cinnamon, cocoa powder or vanilla extract. One time I even added some leftover baked butternut squash and that turned out better than expected! The set holds around 3 or 3 1/2 cups of mixture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"When these say FREEZE OVERNIGHT, you should do it. If you try to take the popsicle out before it's completely frozen, it will make a big mess. However, let it freeze overnight, then run it under hot water, they come out in about thirty seconds. They ARE big, but they are the perfect size for my husband and I. I would highly recommend these!! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tovolo 80-8003Y Popsicle mold","review":"I have owned these for over one month now. The first set of ice pops were perfect. But for some reason any additonal ice pops that I have made the stick slides out without the ice pop. I end up scraping out the treat. I feel that I have wasted my money and it's too late for me to get a full refund from Amazon. Make sure you check the return policy and not overlap the return time in order to get a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdly expensive and bulky to store","review":"$12.99 for a half-dozen molds is outrageous. The base is convenient to hold the molds upright, but it's size is awkward and it does not fit well in a conventional freezer. These are durable, but they should be - because they are very over-priced. Count on these taking about .75 cubic feet of storage space in your cabinet no matter how you try to manipulate them. Will keep these, but disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea, but","review":"I like this, it holds up well, but I've yet to get my popcicle to actually stick to the handle. It stays in the cup fine, but you dont want that in a holder. I'm still working out the kinks so if someone knows how to actually make this happen please let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, great value.","review":"Perfect for ice pops. Easy to use and easy to clean. You get a quality product for a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than expected","review":"I thought that since Tupperware popcycle molds were twice the price these would be really cheap in construction. I was totally surprised to find them heavily constructed and well fitting and the stand to hold them while freezing is terrific. I quickly made dark chocolate ice cream to fill them and it was a huge hit with my friends. The box is heavy construction also so keep it to store them away when you aren't using them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice popcicle holder","review":"Great to make your favorite flavors at home.

We made icecream and I was not too comfortable at thought of eating it completely.2. Drip Protector is also an issue because most of ice cream stuck in there is too hard to eat.

We'd let them thaw on the counter about five minutes, then jiggled them. Two worked, and two snapped. We had to throw out the popsicles for the two that snapped to make sure we wouldn't eat plastic pieces. I'm very disappointed and am contacting Tovolo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!

I dont' have young kids, so theses treats are only for my enjoyment and I didn't want those small molds. They are Very convenient because they are individual, great size (4 x 2.5 x 1) they are actually adult size molds. They arrived on time.

I have difficulty getting the product out of the mold. Perhaps I am overlooking something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like when I was a kid","review":"In the summer time, I love a popsicle or ice cream in the evening. When I was a child, we had a similar product. One day this occurred to me, and I realized it would probably be cheaper to buy juice (or make smoothies or freeze soda or anything of the like) than to buy popsicles. These have been nice. I thought I ordered the star shaped ones, which I thought would be fun to eat, but I see that I did not. That was my fault. The only problem with these is that even with the stick guard, when you tilt the popsicle to your mouth melted juice leaks on you. Despite my best efforts and quick eating, I have not found a way around this. I hope with more pratice I will not get dripped on. But it is a small price to pay for a tasty pop. I have bought Juicy Juice to fill them and the Strawberry Kiwi flavor was tasty! I want to try coconut juice next with pieces of coconut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't release well","review":"Have to submerged under hot water to get the mold to release without the stick pulling out of the popsicle. A portion of the popsicle is left in the lower part of the handle, either get it out with a utensil or it's all over the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Mediocre","review":"I got these during Black Friday week for a pretty good deal off of Amazon. That being said, it's pretty impossible to get the popsicle out of the mold! I use hot water, but I still end up taking off the top part of the popsicle. Meaning, I end up with 3/4 of a popsicle. Which is fine, I keep my world in perspective. It's a popsicle. Not sure I would recommend them though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice product with minor flaws","review":"I agree that these are pretty large for children. However, the more serious problem, at least for me, was that there were small plastic strings and uneven plastics around the edges and holes on the sticks. I happened to find those bad finishing and I had to cut them out with a knife. Still there are sticking out parts inside the drip protectors. The outer mold looks perfect though. The inside finishing should have been better with that price and brand.I think the quality of the inside and outside molds should have been switched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Glad these worked out for some people. They're pretty much a waste for us. They are HUGE for small children--our boys can't finish one, even in the hottest weather, so that's good organic (i.e. expensive) juice down the drain. Because our freezer is apartment-sized, we cannot use the base that holds the mold because it takes up too much room, so I have to tuck the pops in wherever we can fit them. Which brings me to the last problem--the bases do *not* snap snugly onto the mold, so there are frequent spillovers in our freezer. I've used them two summers now, but I give up and am now looking for some classic Tupperware ones like we had growing up. They were the right size for children, the seal snapped good and tight, and they didn't take up scads of space in the freezer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to remove pop from mold","review":"These work as expected, however it was rather difficult to remove the frozen pops from their molds. We had to resort to 20 seconds of running each mold under hot water to free its pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"healthy snacks","review":"I have 2 daughters and they love frozen snacks. I don't like buying pops from stores because I think making my own is much healthier. Using these molds is very easy. I just pour different kinds of juices into it and put it into the freezer for an hour or 2 and the pop will be done. My daughters are happy because they get frozen snacks and I am happy because I know they are eating healthy. These molds also come in different designs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I debated about ordering these so long last summer, that summer was over! Finally got them ordered this year, they just came, and I love them! My kids are in high school so we like the large size. If they were younger, I would need a smaller mold. I used my Magic Bullet and put in what I do for a smoothie - about a cup of frozen berries (1/3 blueberries 2/3 raspberries) about 1/3 cup Greek plain Greek yogurt (for protein), splash of vanilla flavoring, a couple of Splenda packets, and fill it to within 1/2\\" of the brim with milk. Mixed it up, and it filled 4 of the pops with a couple of sips left. Easily popped them out after about four hours - perfect! I got all fancy and drizzled a little chocolate Magic Shell topping (since when did food become so Magic anyway? LOL) on the side and added a few sprinkles for fun. I know I'm going to love these molds more with each use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I am very happy with this product, it is BPA free and safe to use. Comes with the handy stand, which is easily put away. Amazon's delivery was timely, quick, and product is well packaged. There is a very basic, generic recipe on the box, which I cut out for future use. The only thing that would have made this uber-perfect would have been an accompanying recipe booklet! I have searched the internet for recipes, and am using those. It's actually VERY easy, but the only problem with most of the recipes is once frozen, the pops taste \\"icy\\" - not as smooth and soft as you get with the purchased stuff. Luckily I found the \\"secret\\" on Martha Stewart's web site, just add simple syrup to the recipe [...] - hope this helps, because I would encourage people to purchase these Groovy molds, as they are safe, easy to use and store, and really much healthier and CHEAPER than the ready-made store bought ones! You really cannot beat the price. Thank you, Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic cracks after just a few uses","review":"I purchased these to replace an older Popsicle maker.

Not what I'd expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great popsicle mold.......quite large though","review":"The best thing about these molds is that you can do them individually. They are quite large though, so be prepared for that. I don't like the drip guard cause it doesn't work. The melting liquid just accumulates in their and then spills all over you when you tilt the popsicle to eat it. Other than that I think they are nice. Fit in their slots perfectly and steadily. No spilling and really nice to take them out individually and replace with a newly filled one easily.I think I am going to try to leave more room when filling to allow tongue to get under the popsicle to catch the drips though. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"can not get these things to work","review":"I have given up on using these pop molds.

It broke off in her lips and she handed it to me...***OMG IT WAS RAZOR SHARP AND JAGGED*** had she been a younger child and more apt to 'explore' she could have been seriously harmed if not killed.These are either going to be returned or put in the garbage...

I got Seasons 1 & 2 the very first day they were released. Season 3 is one of the best seasons and ends on a cliffhanger that continues and starts off Season 4. Even though we know what's going to happen we still get anxious and what to know what's next! I really hope Sony to take another 100 years to release the rest of the seasons.

The show is overflowing with sarcasm and irreverence. Fran Drescher is great as a nanny who doesn't respect boundaries - both personal and comedic. I love how Niles personifies the sarcastic butler. The kids are adorable, especially Grace, who talks back with an attitude. Every once in a while when I watch \\"The Nanny\\" I find myself bursting with laughter.Unfortunately, the show didn't get much attention when it was on.

I thought this was going to be another one of those unfinished series on DVD. I'm very excited to have it, but I'm not impressed with the packaging. A standard DVD case that holds all three discs on one spindle. One thing manufacturers tell you not to do is stack CDs and DVDs on top of one another because they scratch very easily. Yet this is how Sony packaged them. I thought the slim case packaging worked just fine. Oh well.

Then you are frusterated and are determined to do it again. Even if you beat Simon it is still calling you to play again. It is very addicting hand held. I go to O.T. and my theripist introduced me to Simon and I started playing it and I spent 30 minutes trying to beat Simon. I did beat him once and I beat him again right when I was about to leave. I still can't beat it again. My theripist tryed to do it and wasn't even close. She spent 10 minutes figuring it out. She didn't get after 10 minutes and gave up. So if you decide to make more Simon hand helds, for your sake in money you might want to make it more difficult so it will be even more addicting."},{"rating":"2","title":"brain on the go","review":"I've bought this toy for my daugther ( she's 6 ) and she loves it, it's a good toy to use alone, to share with friends or even with her parents ( myself ).

The only changes I'd like to see are more information about restaurants and a larger--fold out--map of the subject region.

After the flooding ebbs, Joshua performs routine tasks that put him in a position to notice similarities that link the sick babies. His suspicions lead him, his friend David, and his younger sister Kelly to the intersection of a natural disaster with human greed. Their decisions take the kids more deeply into mystery and danger.\\"Menace in the Walls\\" combines the suspense of two mysteries--a whodunnit with a whahappened? It satisfies a reader's desire to learn something as he or she is engaged and entertained. Let's hope that N. L. Eskeland continues Joshua's adventures.

She and the detective (who is actually a suspended detective) get involved right off the bat. The character development was about nil. Somehow the reclusive lady (a recluse for reasons not fully explained) falls for the cop and is able to overcome whatever it is that made her wall herself off from the world. How she got from A to B I never did figure out. The suspense plot (insurance fraud, codes, what have you) could have been very interesting, but was also not well-developed.

A true Guitar Virtuoso! All of it is very complex, but it never sounds that way. I have read magazines where he is compared to Allan Holdsworth and Scott Henderson. This just is not so. The compositions alone are through-composed, as opposed to most jazz CD's where there is a melody , boring long winded solos over the chords, and the melody again. Each tune is drastically different. In addition, his solos are sometimes blistering, sometimes more soft,yet still innovative. If you want to perk your ears up, this is one to get. It is a regular on my CD rotation.

If you love the Islands like I do, Dennis Pavao is \\"da man.\\" His rich baritone and remarkable falsetto capabilities gave him a vocal range not many males can emulate.

It is, undoubtedly, Led Zeppelin at their most mellow.The material contained herein is not what most people think of when the topic of Led Zeppelin is raised and it was a shock to even the most ardent fans when it was released in 1970.It would be fair to say that most people were expecting material that was more in the vain of the first two albums and were surprised upon receiving this record.Even so, it does contain some crunching hard rock moments, such as the unrelenting opener, 'Immigrant Song' and the pleasingly offbeat 'Out on the Tiles'.I guarantee that this release will grow on you and you too will realise just what a risk it was for Led Zeppelin to step out of the rock 'n' roll mould for just a little while. Led Zeppelin III was a gutsy manoeuvre that paid tremendous musical dividends.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dig deeper and discover this gem","review":"In the grand scheme of things, Led Zeppelin's third record (1970) was the most dramatic shift the band had ever taken from its previous releases, but was necessary to produce their best record a year later. It is often referred to as the \\"acoustic\\" record, but the fact is that it boasts one of the early \\"heavy metal\\" tunes (the single, \\"Immigrant Song\\") two outright rockers (\\"Celebration\\", \\"Out on the Tiles\\"), and arguably their best original blues song (\\"Since I've Been Loving You\\"). The other six songs are acoustic, but explore a number of diverse avenues, from pure blues (\\"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\\") to traditional folk (\\"Gallow's Pole\\") to hand-clapping boogie (\\"Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp\\") to spacey pop (\\"Tangerine\\") to affecting ballads (\\"That's The Way\\"). I highly recommend this LP and 'Physical Graphitti' as a starting point for anyone who wants to get beyond obvious hit records down into the real LZ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest thing you ever can do now...","review":"...would be to set aside some time for this album. It's impossible to say which Zeppelin ablum is best (best to whom?); really, all we can do is pick favorites.

There's a tremendous variety of songs here, and perhaps nowhere else does Led Zeppelin sound less like any other band. I'll leave it to others to run through all the songs (that's always more fun to write than to read) but I will say this: \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is beautiful and will at times even strike me emotionally; \\"Friends\\" is a lovable oddity which is sooo much fun to play on an acoustic, bizarre tuning and all; and \\"Bron Yr Aur Stomp\\" is so foot-stompin good that even my mom feels it.

That's insane. \\"OOTT\\" is one of their great lost classics, and I can't believe that anyone could be aware of that tune and not like it.This album definitely benefits from its lack of radio saturation (i.e. Zeppelin IV).

He really seems to enjoy them now. These aren't as well made as the original Lincoln Logs, but what seems to be these days? But they will do. I find the grooves aren't as deep, so the logs sometimes just don't fit or stay together that well.

You pay for every roll that you eat. It's little tidbits like this that make for some very interesting reading.It's a very light read, and you can probably finish it on the plane ride to Germany.

I can't anymore. It is putting me to sleep. I keep wanting it to be over...

This is the third book in this series I have read; if it weren't for the fascinating idea of the alternate American history, I couldn't have done it. James Whitmore quoted Harry Truman telling a story about a black man in 1920's Missouri. The man told Harry his boss gave him a bottle of whiskey as a gift. Harry asked him, \\"Well, how was it\\"? The man replied, \\"It was just about right. If it was any better he wouldn't have given it to me and if it was any worse, I wouldn't have drunk it\\". If this book were written any more poorly, I wouldn't have read it.Turtledove's writing is putrid. He would do better by teaming up with a competent writer; he has interesting ideas and plots.It is like a typical Star Trek movie. Take a great idea and ruin it by letting William Shatner or Jonathan Frakes direct it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I couldn't make it past the first 100 pages or so.

And at least one female, single-mom, Socialist congresswoman. The story is written from the congresswoman's POV, and very much emphases intelligence and understanding over physical strength, so you'd think it would appeal to a woman, but it didn't hold my attention. I always felt as though I were reading a book, rather than slipping into another world.I did enjoy the free download of Charlie Huston's book (Caught Stealing) and am looking forward to reading more of Huston's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"This book is very informative in techniques for woodgraining painted surfaces.

It's really nice to see well balanced people that love, appreciate, and enjoy their craziness with each other. I think the most striking thing about these little episodes (having spent most of my life in schools, counselling and psychology) is how openly affectionate this family is with each other without ever crossing the \\"ugh\\" line. It is encouraging. I once heard that there are basically two reasons that people watch a TV show: 1.) They'd like to hang out with the people in the show. 2.) They become emotionally attached to one or more of the characters and want to see what happens next. This has both. This is also one of the rare shows that both my boyfriend and I have watched over and over. That's why we bought the box set: Great packaging by the way! Love it.

More types should be illustrated.The equipment section is not very helpful, specific rod and reel models would be more appropriate even for beginners. Too many times, beginners buy junk tackle and expect it to handle decent sized trout, it won't.

The game helped me to understand the Pokemon world and gave my son and me 2 hours of real time together. Yes, 2+ hours. The game does take awhile so only start if you have at least an hour.

It was a major box office disappointment, however, and the studio decided to \\"save\\" the movie by RE-EDITING it and ADDING SEVERAL SONGS and a MUSICAL soundtrack.

Right from the start this album takes you on a adventure that you don't want to end. The powerful melodies of Black Dog and Rock n Roll are the start of this adventure.

This is by far a great album and deserves full credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zeppelin's best.","review":"No, it's not because of \\"Stairway\\", it's because of the whole album. Each song has it's own life and is so complex, you know that they took their time with each song. Jon Bonham proves to create new ideas, with the unbeliveable drumming sound on \\"When The Levee Breaks.\\" To me, that's their Stairway. Rock n' Roll and Black Dog are amazing too. Very good bluesy stuff. Battle Of Evermore is a really good folish song. It influnced a lot of power metal, but this is the starter. Stairway to Heavenn, however good it may be, is overrated.

However, it IS their most famous, most marketable, and is a great album for non die-harders. The first two albums can not be touched even if Manute Bol had a 30-foot pole. The album is well-produced (for those who like a clean, smooth sound) and contains the most beautiful, wonderful song of all time by any band in any age... FOUR STICKS!!!! Just kidding, you know I mean Stairway to Heaven. However, the other seven songs can hold their own with the best of them as well. So, if you like Led Zeppelin as a band, this is the album to have.

What's that nonesense all about???This isn't lyrics this is Noddy talk, now in my opinion the greatest rock band are Bon Jovi, they rock, Always is better than anything Led Zeppelin have done and they could only dream of doing an album as good as These Days and that's average on Bon Jovi standards.Also Going to California...BORING...give me Celine Dion any day...pleaseAlso what is Misty Hop about why can't he sing properly like that guy from Good Charlotte.Greatest worst ever rock album ever!!!!Don't buy this, buy Celine Dion instead!!!!P.SThe E stands for Expert"},{"rating":"1","title":"MOST OVERRATED BANDS OF ALL TIME","review":"WOW!!!!! I can't believe a lot of people like LED ZEPPELIN so much. THEY JUST SCREAM. AND THIS IS PURE TRASH WITH NASTY SONGSLIKE BLACK DOG, AND MISTY MOUNTAIN.

This Led Zeppelin's more appropriate 0 STARS","review":"Led Zeppelin are one of the worst bands besides THE BEATLES, AND THE ROLLING STONES. They have only made 1 decent song in KASHMIR.Rest of their other albums is junk!!! Besides this album has someof their worst songs in Black Dog, and Misty Mountain Hop. Andthe singer screams, is he on drugs??????? Anyway, don't listen to the 5 star reviewers, this album is worth ZERO.

They really suck and they are one of the most overrated and stupidest bands in history. They are just a joke and never made anything decent. Even Metallica and Nirvanaare better than Zeppelin.

I can't belive any one could like them as each and every album from them sucks. I hear them all the time on radios too. What is it with Led Zeppelin? Their singer just screams. Don't buy any of the albums of Led Zeppelin or any other albums of Beatles Rolling Stones Pink Floyd and AC/DC. Go with Nirvana Nevermind insted.PS. Led Zeppelin is for babies. Do you know what I mean by that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"The boys in Led Zeppelin actually could be better than average, but they didn't make up any revolutionary rap dances, so they suck.Buy D4L's \\"Down For Life\\" and Dem Franchize Boyz \\"On Top of Our Game\\" instead. The guitar solos would make Jimmy Page cringe in fear, and their thought-provoking lyrics are just amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!!! Led Zeppelin sucks.","review":"Blah!! Led Zeppelin are crappy, each and every song on this album is bad, even Stairway to Heaven.

Then go with my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is rock? LOL!","review":"I can't believe you people think this is good music. Led Zeppelin were just a bunch of druggies who made music to get with groupies. All of their songs sound exactly the same, too. Try some REAL rock, like Limp Bizkit. They created hard rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me say something.........","review":"...........This isn't the best Led Zeppelin album. But there's always this, Led Zeppelin is a legend of a band and they have some of the best cd's I've ever heard, and just because this one isn't good compared to their other one's doesn't mean it's bad. I mean, this was the cd to release \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", which is an amazing song. Also, \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" and \\"Black Dog\\". These guys are amazing. Great songwriting, great beats, and awesome guitar work, if your looking to improve your Led Zeppelin collection and you don't have this one, give it a try, and if your a beginner get this, and then get the others. They'll get better even though this one is a masterpiece itself. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not love this album?","review":"I can't understand how anyone who claims to be a true fan of classic rock n' roll can not love this album to death. It's truly one of the few albums (right along Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon) that you can listen to the entire album straight through repetitively.Although this album will always be remembered for \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and \\"Black Dog,\\" I feel that the true bright spots of the album are \\"Battle of Evermore\\" and \\"When the Levee Breaks.\\" However, i have a hard time understanding why some people have reviewed the album stating that \\"Stairway to Heaven's\\" 8 minute melody is too long. \\"Free Bird\\" is over 10 minutes long and no one seems to complain about that. Some of Floyd's best stuff (\\"Echoes,\\" \\"Dogs,\\" \\"Atom Heart Mother\\") is also well over 15-20 minutes.In closing, unless you truly have some kind of vendetta against rock n'roll or Led Zeppelin, i find it almost impossible for someone not to enjoy this album thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I love led zeppelin...

It's definately a CD you can put in and listen to from the beginning to the end. As far as rating the Zeppelin albums, this one is up there with II, III, and Phyical Graffiti.

How can you get that from the fourth Led Zeppelin album! which brings me to my next point, does it really matter what it is called? The reason I'm asking this is because whenever I talk about this 'album' with Zeppelin fans they are always like: \\"It is not called Led Zeppelin 4, it is the fourth Led Zeppelin album.\\" How are people supposed to know what the heck I am talkin about if I can't use any roman numerals! This is a disgrace, I should give it 0 stars! But then again the package looks cool, I think I'll give it 5. But then again, I don't need to listen to Stairway to Heaven again, 4 points to team Zeppelin and that's the game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously overrated album","review":"Now, before you flame me for this, pretend Stairway to Heaven never existed and listen to everything else they've ever done. The album certainly kicks ass, just don't base opinions on one song! The intro is world class and unforgettable then it just goes. It's not as full and soul-reaching as some of their other efforts, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, give me those \\"non-helpful\\" votes!","review":"I do indeed happen to think that Led Zeppelin IV is way overrated. True, \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is an alright tune but hey, it doesn't come near to the great tunes (and rythms!) of say Moody Blues \\"Every good boy deserves favour\\". What about the rocking side? Well, Led Zeppelin is competent in that area but you have to turn to LZ II which easily gets 5 stars. Every track on LZ II (except Moby Dick) is way above anything on LZ IV.They never delivered another album like LZ II again (but possibly there are some great live recordings out there which I don't know)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!","review":"Stay away from this 'deal'.

Robert Plant is supposed to be one of Rock's best screaming vocals, no way! Paul McCartney's screaming vocals in Helter Skelter and Oh!Darling simply embarrass Zeppelin because he manages to maintain his masculinity, not only could Paul do that, he could also write beautiful acoustic numbers like Blackbird and cool piano tunes like Martha My Dear. Led Zeppelin to me does not have enough range to be so praised by. The Beatles own Zeppelin forever. Plant's vocals are quite annoying. There are a couple decent tracks on the record but a big band like Zeppelin should make their records with a bit more substance. If you want true quality buy the Beatles double record masterpiece:The White Album and you will never go back to Zeppelin again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Led Zeppelin is over rated","review":"Some people say that led zeppelin changed the world of rock and they probably did. I just dont like them this album out of all of them was definatly not my favorite and I would rather listen to the first album but they are just sloppy and borring. It would maby be good If you were on pot or other drugs but i for one was not totaly blown away like others said they were. I still dont get the whole stairway to heaven thing i think people just say they like it just to be cool but it is a really boring, long, repetative, overrated song and i just cant stand it.

A couple others are The Who's Quadrophenia, The Smiths' debut album, and Pink Floyd's The Wall. Still, this particular Led Zeppelin album practically outranks all others. I do not dislike a single track. My personal favorites make up most of the album: \\"Black Dog,\\" \\"The Battle of Evermore,\\" \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" \\"Misty Mountain Hop,\\" \\"Going to California,\\" and \\"When the Levee Breaks.\\" Lyrically and musically, this album is a gorgeous and powerful demonstration of all the qualities that make Led Zeppelin superior to many bands of their time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Led Zeppelin's Best Album Ever","review":"IV is the best Led Zeppelin album ever to come out. All of the songs are still played on classic-rock radio today, so discussing what one is the best is really pointless. You've got your pure-blood rockers (\\"Black Dog\\", \\"Rock & Roll\\", \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\"); cautionary anthems (\\"Stairway To Heaven\\", \\"When The Levee Breaks\\"); acoustic ballads (\\"The Battle Of Evermore\\", \\"Goin' To California\\"),and the unusual \\"Four Sticks.\\" Some people like to listen to this one really loud, but its uniqueness can only be truly appreciated at a low-to-moderate volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"You already own this","review":"I think this sold like a billion copies.

Can anyone seriously claim Black Dog, Four Sticks, Misty Mountain Hop and Four Sticks aren't the exact same song with different yet equally meaningless lyrics. Stairway to Heaven was never that great but it was at least listenable the first oh 700 times. Going To California is the only decent song on this album. The Battle Of Evermore and When The Levee Breaks are mind-blowingly boring. Why classic rock radio feels the need to play this dull little band's catalog to death I shall never understand. The geniuses who claimed this to be \\"the definition of Rock 'n' Roll\\" or \\"the best album of the 70's\\" should check out what's out there. If you want some real Rock, not uncreative, repetitive and boring drivel, check out bands like the Rolling Stones, the Who or even Aerosmith. Led Zeppelin couldn't could their guitar picks. Save your money! I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be second-best","review":"This should be the second-best selling album of all time (behind the first Led Zeppelin album).

I will admit that John Bonham was an excellent drummer and Jimmy Page does blend his guitar at times. However, lead screamer(eh.. singer), Robert Plant ruins many of the tracks(Misty Mountain Hop and Black Dog specifically) with his screetching caterwaling. In addition, the songs lack development. The great opening riff of Black Dog is wasted due to the lack of a good secondary melody. Four Sticks doesn't even have a memorable initial melody. Even Stairway To Heaven admist some creativity drags in a few spots. A nice song yes. A classic HELL NO! Going To California and Rock N Roll are my favorites on here. The Battle for Evermore and When The Levee Breaks are decent as well.

Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham are/were all artists. Their songs are polished, meaningful, and sublimely beautiful, but they don't tell you what to think or how to interpret them.

This album took alot of credit away from other great bands of that era, and gave the mindset to rock fans that all Led Zeppelin music was fast-paced blues. This album made me think that all Led Zeppelin albums sounded this crappy, but they are sooooo much better. I hate this album because it makes Zeppelins other albums look like nothing and Led Zeppelin IV gets all the credit!!! If I didn't hear Led Zeppelin II, I would still be hating Led Zeppelin. This is definately the sellout album.P.S.:I know I originally wrote a review slandering Led Zeppelin as a band and all their other albums, but after hearing Led Zeppelin again and Led Zeppelin II, I've had a change of heart, so listen to this review and not the last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"aka Spinal Tap","review":"This music is as bad as Spinal Tap.

This frothy prattle is for jerkwads who pepper everyday conversations with Pippi Longstocking and J.R.R. Tolkien references.

Any one who criticizes this album is not a fan of Rock. Personaly, I have spent most of my adult life researching pretty much every Rock band that has made any success at all.(It is my job) I have come to a conclusion that Led Zeppelin is most impressing band there is. To many, Jimmy page is the best guitarist ever. That can be debated. The same issue can be considered about John Bonham. Robert Plant has an extremely attractive voice. He has very impressive variety, and sounds excellent. Jihn Paul Jones allows Led Zeppelin to be such an amazing band and still have only 4 members. I think that it is a complete miracle of life that these 4 people of different talent found each other. This album is a result insane talent. There is no better explanation. I also suggest buying the new DvD and CD. It will take breath from you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Album","review":"Led Zeppelin is a great band and almost everyone of their albums is great.

Black Dog, Levees Breaking and Stairways to heaven as you're going to California. It's all there.You know exactly what i mean don't you? Only now, the songs are crisper, there is no skip on the album and you can even hit \\"random play\\" and leave yourself open to fate.If you own just ONE Led Zeppelin album, (and who doesn't??)

Trust me, you WILL enjoy the jump to the new millenium of compact discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Jude can suck my kiss like a baby!!!!!","review":"Well, who wants to read Hey Jude's review? Not me. Thus, I hate Led Zeppelin. They are overplayed on every radio station in the world and they are super-over rated. Unless their only good songis Kashmir...Rest of their other songs stink!

Right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-B-B-B-BORINGGGGGG","review":"Overrated album, Overrated band, overrated everything.Zeppelins music is the most boring music I have ever listened to.

This album only has 1 good song in Stairway to Heaven. Rest of the other songs are really, really bad. Metallica and Dire Straits are much better than this, avoid this and go with the bands I mentioned who are actully great and enjoyable and avoid all albums from LED ZEPPELIN who suck.Don't read the previous 5 star reviewer, LED ZEPPELIN ARE LEGENDS. He can go straight back to hell or heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats The Bigg Deal??","review":"Hey hey all, what is down?? Wow, every time I turn on the radio, all I hear is songs from this lame, dated album!! The singer is like a dying whiney girl, the guitar playa only plays like 4 cords, the bassist isn't even plugged in, and the drummer is just a lazy oaf hitting stale bread!! For better musik, I would recommend you play Korn, Linkin Park, Fall Out Boy, Atreyu, Taking Back Sunday, Limp Bizkit, Staind, My Chemical Romance, Kidd Rock and the legendary Michael Jackson!! Go Bengals!! The bengals will be football's 2007 champs!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When will the popularity of such mediocre artists end?","review":"Why is it all of a sudden a big trend to listen to classic rock bands? When you can be listening to good modern music.Led Zeppelin (minus the booze, drugs, and satanism) are merely a group of average rockers. None of these tracks actually stand out, and this cd has not passed the test of time.For truly inspiring music just listen to Korn, Slipknot, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, or any emo/hardcore or nu metal band out there... MTV is the place for good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are they so overrated????????????????","review":"Led Zeppelin were simply the most overrated band of all time who were just as bad as NIRVANA and ACDC. They only made about a decent song in \\"Stairway To Heaven\\". Rest of the songs just STINK!!! Plant sounds more like a big monkey than a real singer and can't sing at all, HE JUST SCREAMS. Like good singers??????? I recommend go with Foreigner, Dire Straits who were equally the greatest bands with the greatest singers in LOU GRAMM, and MARK KNOPFLER. They are a billion times better than LED ZEPPELIN. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this page, avoid this piece of junk and go with Foreigner insted. They are legends, not ZEPPELIN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, No, Not At All.","review":"Led Zeppelin are one of the worst bands of the 70's.

However it is indeed hard to find words adequate enough to praise this cd. It could be considered almost a greatest hits album in itself. As varied as the tracks are they are all increidible songs. While some of the tracks are vintage heavy metal, that assault the ears with fantastic and powerful rythms. But at the same time delicate songs such as stairway to heaven, and going to california, however one thing remains common throughout the all the songs. The musianship and vocals are superb on all the tracks. If you are looking to purchase a first led zeppelin cd, or looking to recommend one to a newcomer make it this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you...","review":"Ok first off I'm not a Zeppelin hater, Zeppelin 2 is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I think everyone should own it. I also love the work they did after this album with Houses of the Holy and Physical Graffiti. But this album is so bad it makes me sick. The people who wrote these reviews giving this album 5 stars are either... or totally consumed with the image brought on by the name of the band. Not everything this band recorded was good, no matter what their millions of worshipers say. And nothing proves that point more than listening to this album. So if you're looking for a Zeppelin album I suggest buying either Houses of the Holy or Led Zeppelin 2. But no matter what you do leave this piece of trash on the shelf because trust me you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best for its time...","review":"I read a lot of the reviews submitted to this sight and for the most part agree with those who feel this album is great. Is it the greatest of all time ? No. Is it one of the best albums of it's time ? Yes. For those of you comparing this album to Pink Floyd or The Stones or The Doors or another super group, there is no comparison because each one identified a different type of music. This Led Zeppelin album strikes a hard chord with me because nobody else at the time of its release was producing the kind of rock it contains. NOBODY. Were there other great rock albums ? yes but not like this one. I give it 5 stars for creativity, musicianship, color, depth and tightness. I can go into Bonham's polyrhythmic drum parts on Black Dog or Jimmy's lead on the same song or Robert's vocals on Stairway to Heaven John Paul's simple but effective keyboards on Misty Mountain but its all good. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do...."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly a stairway to musical heaven","review":"There's no song in history that compares to the beauty, level, and perfection of stairway to heaven. It combines unrepeted tunes with perfect performances by Page and Plant. This album came out way before my time but I know a classic. Possibly the closest to perfect song the world will ever hear! That alone is worth all of this cd and so much more. But wait there is more! Misty Mountain Hop, and Black Dog are also excellent songs.

While Led Zeppelin III may be my favorite, this album is clearly a classic and is not overrated one bit.

In any case, this is Led Zeppelin, and whats more to say? I am sure you have at least heard of the song \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", which is one of their catchiest and best songs ever in my opinion. I did not find the rest of the album as enjoyable as their previous work, but there is still no denying the great feeling I still get when I listen to Zep. Listening to them just makes you ask the question: \\"what the hell has happened to rock these days?\\" If you have somehow not heard Led Zeppelin before, well now is a good time to start. An obvious big thumbs up.Best tracks: \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Black Dog\\", and \\"Rock and Roll\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless classic rock","review":"Everyone I knew had this album when I was a teenage stoner and it's not only because it's what all the other stoners expected you to have - it's just a damn good album and thanks to all those Zep heads out there, it's now been remastered with a little help by some of the members.

(Is Four Sticks their most neglected classic?) And I defy any band out today to unearth a granite slab of sound like \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" and live to tell about it. Crawl back to your little holes when you hear the name Zep. Weak points? Possibly STH, because it's been overplayed. Not their fault, mind you. Best harp playing ever: WTLB. Essential essential essential. Essential! (And STOP comparing bands, O ye who can't spell!

Picking a favorite Zeppelin album is like deciding which of your kids you like best, but with such instantly recognizable tunes as \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\", Led Zeppelin IV is a good introduction to a great classic rock act. There is not a bad song on this album. If this is the first Zeppelin album to go in your collection, you'll be adding more soon afterwardsThe only thing that makes the compact disc edition a little awkward is the continuity. The vinyl and cassette editions flipped side after \\"Stairway\\" and it was like starting new. Now the continuity goes uninterupted from \\"Stairway\\" to \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\". It's a little different, but it's a small price to pay for the convienience of the compact disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. CD.

Much heavier than its predicessors but is just amazing. Each track so different and catchy riffs. Then the AMAZING Stairway....i mean. who doesn't know stairway? And everybody has a Led Zeppelin reference. What is there to say about this album? This was at the peak of rock. The climax. When blazing guitars and screaming bloody murder vocals along with a heavy blast of pounding drums and a amazingly grooving bass met and created musical rock fusion. As for those idiotic satanic messages.... yes. It does say Satan when you play it backwards. But if you actually listen to the lyrics it sounds like they're making fun of him and how moronic he is.

With only a few worthwhile exceptions, the tracks on this album represent the musicians attempting a level of art they weren't capable of reaching, and the results are spectacularly crass and mindless.

They singlehandely made 4 great albums in a row. With this album, Led Zeppelin no longer played clubs, and was soon playing only arenas. Anyway, the music is very good, starting with an excellent opener, Black Dog. Fine riff by John Paul Jones. Rock and Roll is another great song, despite being used for a car commercial (UGH!). Battle of Evermore is a brilliant folk song with Sandy Denny singing on it (check out Fairport Convention, the band she's in). Stairway is overrated but it's an ok song nonetheless. Misty Mountain Hop and Four Sticks gets my vote for best songs on the album. Going To California is another nice folk song, extended live. When The Levee Breaks is perfect, with great drum production and a very trippy riff. It's a perfect closer to a classic record."},{"rating":"2","title":"4th place to led 1, 2, and Physical Grafitti","review":"Black Dog- Awesome, sing along lyrics and great jams 5/5Rock and Roll- a classic, impossible to hate, man, the opening guitar is worth the $15 for the whole album 5/5Battle of Evermore- My favorite led zeppelin is when they depart from catchy rock like \\"rock and roll\\" and \\"Misty Mountain Hops\\" but this time, they don't do anything particularly great 3/5Stairway to Heaven- epic, not just the best song on this album, or the best song by Led Zeppelin, but the greatest song in rock history 5/5Misty Mountain Hops- a great song, would be 5/5 but it signifies the change from blues/hard rock visionaries to pop success, and for that alone, it goes down down a notch to 4/5Four Sticks- great song, and different from anything that they had ever done before 4/5Goin' to California- Good Folk song 4/5When the Levee Breaks- Spectacular, great way to end the album, lets you know that led's still got it 5/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good things, but zep is shallow","review":"This band is one of the richest and most popular in history, It is also the most pretentious overrated shallow music you'll ever here, except the boy bands.

That's just not true-Led Zepplelin are really primarily a pop group.They don't have half the anger or ferocity of many other bands.\\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Rock n Roll\\" sound so bland and stale that's it's laughable. And don't even bother listening to garbage like \\"The Battle Of Evermore\\" \\"Going To California\\" or \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", they would send you to sleep if they weren't so annoying. If you like Led Zeppelin you'll like N Sync or Back Street Boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far and away the best thing in the universe.","review":"Oh I just creamed in my pants at the very mention of the two God like words Led Zeppelin.

I don't think Led Zeppelin has a troo future making music. They come nowhere close to the unbelievably fresh sounds of Nickelback, Limp Bizkit (step off Fred Durst), Staind, Puddle of Mudd, and the awesome Default. To me, Led Zeppelin is boring brand rock, corporate and too drawn out. The guitar player stretches out his over-the-top solos way too long, the singer sounds like he has pliers clenching his English gonads, and the drummer is way off time.In short, avoid this band like the plague, and stick with troo metal muscle like Bizkit and Staind. Like I said, \\"Stairway\\" is a truly good song..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated crap","review":"To all you die hard Zepplin Fans out there I have to tell you guys that your wrong about them bein the greatest Rock N Roll Band. I was 9 when I started listining to them and it took me a month and a half to not like these guys. I'm 14 now and I don't listen to the crap made today (I listen to The Velvet Underground The Doors and Dylan.) All the kids in my school think Zepplin is god well they aren't there a bunch of drunken satanic buffons. Oh and the Foggy notion that they were the first band to involve Medieval Literature you are wrong. The Velvets and The Doors did in fact Sterling Morrison of The Velvets had a P.H.D in Medieval Literature IN '70 a year before this crap came out. All you Zep fans are wrong about music get a Velvet Underground album thats hard rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Led zeppelin IV? Trash","review":"This sucks!!

I highly recommend you purchase this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of all time","review":"You know, there are actually some people in the world who don't own this album? What a shame. It's a classic! From the manic vocals on \\"Black Dog\\" through the thundering backbeat and jagged guitar lines of \\"Four Sticks,\\" to the rough Mississippi Delta blues of \\"When the Levee Breaks,\\" the album is epic. And of course, the album's centerpiece is \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" a slow building folk rock masterpiece which climaxes in a volley of hard rock guitar lines with Plant's wailing vocals over the top.That's not to say that the album is all brawn and no melody. On the contrary, \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" and \\"Going to California\\" are beautiful folk ballads which perfect the folk sound that Led Zeppelin had been experimenting with ever since their first album came out.At any rate, if you don't own this album, then you ought to go out and buy it. Just to have one of the greatest CD's ever in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best rock album ever","review":"Usually there is one excellent song in an album that alone makes it worth buying.

From classic staples such as Black Dog, Rock and Roll, and Going to California to the undoubtedly greatest song of all time, Stairway to Heaven. Also, how can anyone forget about Robert Plant's Vocals in Misty Mountain hop. Four Sticks, When the Levee Breaks, and Battle For Evermore are also songs that you can listen to over and over, and keep liking them better each time you hear it. This whole album shows that Led Zeppelin never lost its touch or its roots from its previous great albums. I have most of the led zeppelin albums, and i gotta say that this one tops them all. If you do not have this album, then get it or your record collection is not complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUIT WHINING","review":"Hey losers if you don't like Led Zeppelin's 4th album don't buy it. I love it. It shows how the band continued to evolve during their years together. The Album has great songs on it. Stairway To Heaven IS one of the best songs EVER.By the way it's NOT titled 'IV', 'Runes', 'Symbols', or 'ZOSO'. Led Zeppelin said when it was released and surviving members still say now IT IS \\"UNTITLED\\" THEIR IS NO NAME FOR IT. The only thing to do is call it their 4th ablum. Don't try to name it"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album ever","review":"This is the best album of all time, it starts off with Black Dog which is just a great song, and then is following that is Rock and Roll which Bonzo is just awsome on the drums. Then their is The Battle of Evermore which is a good song but not the best on hear, and then their is Stairway to Heaven the greatest song ever. It may be overplayed but its still the best song ever and no song can compare to it. After that you got MMH which is a great song better than black dog in my opinion, and after that you got suck songs as four sticks and going to california and then When the Levee Breaks which is an outstanding song which Jimmy Paige and Bonzo play so well. This album proves that they are the greatest band of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true American classic.","review":"Rarely does an album come along that is completely perfect in every way. In 1971 an album was released that is truly flawless, Led Zeppelin 4. Everything about this album is perfect. The art is so stunningly cool. As cool as the art is, the music is what really matters. \\"Black Dog\\" is a classic. \\"Rock N Roll\\" is amazing. \\"Battle\\" is an amazing epic. \\"Stairway\\" is a beautiful, but very overplayed song. \\"MMH\\" is a great song. \\"Four Sticks\\" is an amazing song as well. \\"Going to California\\" is so much more beautiful than \\"Stairway\\". The best song is saved for last however, \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" is Zeppelin's best take on the blues. Overall, this is the best album, musically, ever made by anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC ZEPPELIN","review":"The original album is the first Zeppelin CD I bought. Plant, Page, Bonham, and Jones deliver some of their best stuff ever. Jimmy Page's chords are magical as usual, Plant's lyrics are second to none. He really belts out the words that penetrate through the soul of the listener. Bonham is his usual drum pounding self. If I were to recommend any Zeppelin CD this is the one to buy. If an individual really wants to get a sense of what Zepelin is like at the very hardcore. Here it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Words.....The Best Ever!","review":"To quote David Spade, I liked Pearl Jam's \\"Given to Fly\\" a lot better the first time I heard it, when it was called \\"Going to California\\".

But look past that and there are 7 other kick *** songs by one of the best bands ever. Black Dog, going back and forth between calm and crazy, Rock and Roll, which is just that, and When The Levee breaks, one hell of a powerful blues song. Zeppelin can do it all.

Then yesterday (seven months later) it will no longer take a charge.Ordinarily, a single battery that died would not cause me to write a one-star review; after all, batteries die. The reason for this review is because the battery warranty is a joke. Even for something as light as a battery, they want a $7.50 \\"processing fee\\" to ship you a new one, and that is AFTER you ship them the old one at your own expense. As another poster pointed out, why on earth would I ever do this for a $12 item? Charging you a \\"processing fee\\" to replace a defective item is an insult.As a corollary to this, why on earth would I ever buy a Lenmar battery ever again?

Although I have not done volume photo shoots (Christmas, weddings, traveling) during 2012, my batteries did not last long.

I haven't been disappointed with them at all.I take bird and wildlife photos so oftentimes I set up my camera and hold the focus for a few minutes waiting for the shot I want.

I returned it and got my money back, but I am loath to purchase Perfection again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but a goodie...","review":"I had this as a kid, purchased it for my kids. Game is fun, helps with coordiantion. This can be hard for the younger set, but they can also just have fun playing the game without the timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY!","review":"Read all of the reviews and question the odd positive reviews, because we bought 3 of these from 2 different stores and NONE of the timers worked. The all counted about 3/4 the way down and stuck. To make such a simple toy and do such a bad job is a real shame. We also have one of these from about 25 years ago and it works fine!20 bucks each, couldn't find the receipt so we're out 60 dollars, but hopefully people will see this review (and the others). The people making these \\"classic\\" games should have a bit more class and respect for the memories they're ruining, but I'm sure they sleep just fine. That's the nature of the world we live in.Capt. RBNY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splat!","review":"Get all the pieces in the board before time runs out or you will hear splat! And all the pieces will pop out this toy coulds entertain you for hours! Great for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same game I had 40 years ago as a kid.","review":"It's put together well enough and the mechanics have been holding up for just about a year. It's not a toy that you will play with a lot, but it's a lot of fun when you pull it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timer dose not work","review":"Like many other reviews state...THE TIMER DOES NOT WORK!!!! Opened it today and returning it today. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"great toy! used for Special needs children. teaches great fine motor skills as well as academic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another childhood memory post- but not bogus","review":"As many have posted, I also enjoyed this toy as a child and thought my 5 yr old would love it too. Well...it's a hit! It's basically how I remember it, and I had to do it a few times to beat the timer. The little one is still trying to beat the timer, but it is almost as much fun to lose on this game.Yes, the parts are a little cheaper than what you may remember, but so is just about everything else you buy now. No batteries to replace, a cute and fun quick thinking game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for ruining my childhood, Hasbro. :(","review":"I loved this game when I was a kid. I bought it for my five-year-old daughter for christmas and it didn't work. I guess I should have tried it out before wrapping it, but you assume that something will function properly when its brand new. Pieces are all there, but the timer doesn't run, which kind of defeats the purpose of the game. A big disappointment. No wonder people just play videogames these days. Could just be a dud, and I'll try to replace it, but still a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is truly an outstanding piece of work. If you take the lush strings and piano of William Orbit; the otherworldly atmospherics of Zero-One; and the driving percussive beats of Delerium; you will have what I believe is one of the best Nu Ambient releases of the past couple of years. There is not one flaw on this cd. The production value is top notch and the layers of sound will keep you engaged from start to finish. Lloyd Barde from Backroads Music turned me on to this release,and the man knows his music. This is a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid Work","review":"Not the best text book I've used.DVD does not appear to work, having tried three different working DVD drives and players. Package seal (probably illegally) says once broken that you foreit all return rights.The book is based around tutorials, a lot of space is devoted to listing what you will be doing and the \\"course\\" structure. Once past the initial, and confusing parts, the rather basic illustrations do give you a reasonably structured introduction to using the application, and solid modelling.Perhaps OK for students, but does seem rather expensive, considering the DVD apparently does not work in the UK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining!","review":"The writing and the illustrations are both helpful and funny. However, the one thing this book absolutely needs is a \\"tree\\" diagram, either in the front matter or the back matter, that shows how all the cacti are classified. He covers it in the book but who is going to remember it unless they draw their own diagram. So it should have been in there after, what, 40 some different printings! On a different matter, I don't think actual photographs would help. There are many other books about cacti which have them and are available for purchase. This book has a certain character and charm in its cartoonish drawings which would be negatively impacted by the presence of photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Love","review":"In this book, Plato narrates a masterminded love description by Socrates. While reading it, I found myself in an intriguing rediscovering of the real definition and meaning of the concept known as \\"love\\". Written in a humble and inquisitive tone, the Banquet represents one of the greatest expressions of ancient philosophers profound intellect. Throughout the narration the reader may identify with any of the characters' personal view of love. Nevertheless, the final conclusion made by Socrates is in impressive agreement with important concepts of modern science, such as \\"evolution\\" and \\"natural selection\\". After reading this masterpiece, you will find that at the end the reader has the final word"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is a must see. As an African American women who loves the stories of my people I find this film to be one that must be viewed. One must know from where they came to know where they are going, because a people that forget their past are doomed to repeat it in the future.I implore all that read this review to heed my words and add this wonderful work to their collection of movies to be viewed again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughters of the Dust","review":"Calling daughters of the dust an unusual film is somewhat of an understatement. the film doesn't follow most Hollywood film conventions. That being said i think daughters of the dust is a good film, worth watching for, if nothing else, its originality. it shows the life of a family living on the Gullah islands, days before they plan on moving to mainland America.The film is quite simple with most of the time spent showing the character's relationships and interactions with each other. The actors in the film do a great job at playing there characters honestly and realistically. Daughters of the Dust intentionally doesn't follow a strong linear plot. Julie dash wanted to create a new kind of film and she seems to have succeeded. The power of this movie is in its images, music and relationships of its character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully filmed","review":"I enjoyed this movie. Good story which could have used a little more background fill-in.Strong female performances and somewhat lyrical."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor is Buck Naked","review":"I was eagerly anticipating seeing this film, since it received so much praise. To say that I was bitterly disappointed is a sad understatement. Despite the fact that I'm interested in Gullah culture and African-American history in general, this film managed to put me to sleep after the first 15 minutes. No character development, no plot, no coherence (being a Jim Jarmusch fan, I can't even believe I'm writing this). I couldn't figure out the relation of half the characters to each other, or in some cases, even their names, because the dialect is almost unintelligible and there are no subtitles. It's as if you're dropped off in the middle of a strange family on an island, and during the time you stay there, they reveal nothing about themselves. Most student filmmakers could do better. I agree with the other review writer who stated this was one of the worst films they'd ever seen. Rent a Spike Lee film instead, or a PBS show about Gullahs."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL MOVIE","review":"This movie is so unrealistic you just stand in stupid awe as it goes on and on and on and on. What black people do you know that just stands around on a beach dressed in white basically doing nothing? No, not in my world! It touches on witchcraft which I despise. It's a very boring movie. I kept waiting for the plot to begin and kept looking for it throughout the movie. This is the worse movie I have seen so far! No real plot, no real acting, nothing to look forward to at all. A genuine waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was so boring","review":"I was very bored with this movie and there wasn't any plot to it..it was to long....and I don't feel like I fully understood it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful scenery, awful movie","review":"Avoid this movie! Save your money to go visit the obviously beautiful island this movie is filmed at, because that is the only thing worthwhile in this very strange and disturbing movie. My class was forced to watch it at school and no one I talked to enjoyed it (or even understood most of it). It is a very bizarre movie that very few people could enjoy. Basically, it is a movie which poindexter professors will think is intetellectual, but in reality is only strange. It also has a very negative agenda. Over all, it is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a beautiful mess","review":"I really wanted to like this moving, since I am from that part of the country. The scenery was beautiful. Thats about all though. There is no chararcter development. There are several people that have the start of interesting stories but they are never followed through. The family dynamic is the hart of the story, there are family members that have returned to the family their stories are not explored. There is a story of marital problems that is not dealt with. All in all the story needs to be deeper. Maybe instead of so many family members they could have focused on fewer and explored more of each persons story as well as the history of the Gullah people."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],N={key:0},W={key:1};function H(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return i(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",R,[(i(!0),o(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(i(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),o("span",W,"Loading...")):(i(),o("span",N,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const C=d(B,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-15839868"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/22.md","filePath":"guide/22.md"}'),x={name:"guide/22.md"},j=Object.assign(x,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(i(),o("div",null,[v(C)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
