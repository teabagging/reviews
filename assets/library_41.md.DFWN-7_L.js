Having grown up together, they were as close as two sides of the same paper. The themes are close friendship, suicide, sexual abuse. So well written, and so haunting. I'm writing this review two years after having read THE PACT, and it still haunts me. It was, yes, disturbing, and at the same time, an insight into the emotional decision making of adolescence."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A GREAT HEARTBURNING READ","review":"Well, I work in a bookshop & have been reading since I was a young little thing, but I must say that of all the books I have read in such a long time none have come close to touching me so deeply as this book. It deals with all the issues; young love, family pressures, friendships, and that all in the first few pages!! Jodi Picoult really knows how to write exactly the right thing at exactly the right time. None of her books have been a disappointment, & believe me, out of all the booksI recommend to friends, families & customers, this would have to be one of the few which I always get great feedback about. So, If you're thinking about getting this great book, hesitate no longer, do yourself a favour. Put your feet up, make free a whole afternoon, & get immersed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pact","review":"As a high school teacher, I thought this book might be interesting. Instead of just a teenagers' novel, I found a book I couldn't put down! The characters are believable, the story line riveting, and the ending a shock. As an adult, you will be reminded of your childhood and teenage years. As a teenager, you can get a feeling of what it might be like to be the living member of a suicide pact. A must read for teenagers, teachers, and parents of teenagers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully slow","review":"The plot had such potential then offered very little. To many characters undeveloped I like to know my characters feel thier pain,happiness ect. I was not able to connect. The ending was also a source of great disappointment Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"I agree with \\"Lily\\" in when she says\\" I definitely disagree with some of the reviews about the book being breathtaking and \\"not able to put down.\\"\\".It dragged on a lot to me, and the jumping from past to present was a pain to read through, especially with multiple(!) points of view. I also had trouble really getting into it, I found the story lacked real depth/detail, color, and texture. For example, Emily Golde's character is talked about a lot but we hardly know anything about her. Why care so much about someone you know nothing about?I also expected a twist, some kind of interesting explanation for why the tragic event occurred, but I got nothing that satisfied me. I would say more but I do not want to spoil it for those of you that will read it anyway.This is the first and last book of hers I will read. I need something I can really get into.I read 'Water For elephants' before this book, and that book makes this book look almost like child's play."},{"rating":"1","title":"thought I would never get through this book.","review":"This was my first Jodi Picoult book, and may be my last. I felt like I was climbing up a steep hill, never to reach the top. The book starts out with a murder ?, suicide ?, and goes downhill from there. Tedious trial, and many unanswered questions. Why was this teenage girl so miserable and unhappy? Some hints of abuse, but nothing is clear or validated. Her parents were clueless. Depressing story, with really no answers, not a romantic love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing! Not up to Picoult's standards","review":"What a disappointment. I've read everything published by Ms. Picoult and loved nearly all of it until this book. She fails to create a plausible picture of the factors compelling Em to be desperately suicidal, and why-oh-why wouldn't Chris try to get the woman he loves help? -- that is help to live, not to die? Unlike Picoult's usual work, The Pact is awkward and slow-moving, and the plot is full of holes. Too bad; not up to Picoult's standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not realistic....","review":"First of all, I love Jodi Picoult. I think she handles difficult subjects well and is very good at conveying despair and disbelief. But she has already written a similar story (Mercy)about sucide and while I bought the ending in Mercy due to the small town atmosphere and very clear facts I flat out refuse to believe the ending in this book as remotely realistic. This ruined the book for me. I have a degree in Criminal Justice, but even if I didn't, anyone who watches Law and Order knows that the circumstances in this book are pretty clear cut legally. Sad, but clear cut. I know that Ms. Picoult is a good author and not afraid of difficult endings,(My Sister's Keeper). Why take the easy way out with this book when she could have produced a thoughtful, if painful narrative of how the real world sometimes works?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising tenderness with a tender topic","review":"Jodi Picoult really handles the tough situation in this book with care. She brings us the story of love, but that love has consquences. The interesting point of this book is how people handle tragedy, not only in their own household but with their friends as well.The book touched me as a mother and as a teacher. After reading this book I thought about how much parents and teachers do not notice. If we did, the world would be a safe place for all to live. But the truth is that as parents and teachers we only see what we want (and need) to see and hope for the best.I think this book really brings home several different messages to parents and teens, all of which I will leave out so that I do not ruin any of the story for you.Happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Longest book ever","review":"This book just drug on for days.

Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not ring true","review":"It seemed very contrived. The reason for the suicide was very unbelievable and none of the character seemed real. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pact","review":"This book is wonderful. I felt the character's hurt and dreams slip away. The author captured their soul in these pages. She showed how loving someone can be so scary..esp if the love is not the same. The author showed feelings in these characters that I feel no other author could find. From title page to conclusion, Jodi Picoult had my feelings and my mind. Great Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unsatisfying Exploration of Suicide","review":"As a survivor of suicide--my older brother died the same way Em did--I was expecting a rich, in-depth exploration of the reasons why someone would feel so desperate, she would take her own life. Unfortunately, this was terribly lacking. Em's reasons for committing suicide struck me as archaic and inadequate--even simplistic. The fierce love Chris's mother has for her son is deeply felt, but, after Em's death, her parents fade into the background. Even more troubling is the presentation of Chris's younger sister, who seems to be placed in the novel simply to serve as a counterpoint to Em. Overall, this was a disappointing albeit compelling read--by far, my least favorite Picoult novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"It is depressing and sad, but the emotions in the story are so real. I loved this book and read it and a matter of a few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a parent it makes you think.","review":"Can you imagine lovng someone so much you would do anything for them. You could not live your life without them. Now imagine you are only 17 and having those feelings. Its like a modern day Romeo and Juliet with a twist. The parents are best friends, the Hartes and the Golds. They have brought their children up to be best friends and as they grow older eventually lovers. They are inseparable. But something is eating Emily Gold up inside. Being with Chris Harte is sometimes like being with a brother but she can't imagine being with anyone else. So Emily and Chris make a pact. What will happen when it gets to be too much for the both of them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet story","review":"The Pact is a story about Chris and Emily, childhood friends whose relationship grows into something more as they get into their teen years. They are best friends, soul mates. The story actually begins on the horrible night that their parents got the call...Emily is dead and Chris is in the hospital. Chris describes a suicide pact gone wrong but is subsequently arrested for Emily's murder.The story unfolds through both a series of flashbacks and present day events. I really loved the flashbacks to give us a deeper look into the lives of the characters involved.I really liked the different points of view that we got throughout the book. It was really neat to be able to see the story playing out through the eyes of so many people. I thought the author did a great job of doing this without making the story confusing.This is one of the sweetest books I have ever read. I don't usually get emotional over books, but this book had me in tears almost the whole way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"this book was probably one of the most incredible books i've ever read. i started it and set it down, picked it back up a week or two later and in a matter of three days i finished this book. it was the most inspiring books i've ever read. i have never cried so hard over a book in my life. this is a must have. and i recommend it to any and everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting!","review":"The first time I read this book, it was in one sitting. And even though I remembered more-or-less how it would end, it still made for an exciting read.It follows the time-skipping format, concluding in the same court room drama asMercyandNineteen Minutes. It is a very realistic novel and more true-to-heart and it's no coincidence that the cover of my copy advertises that it's going to be made into a Lifetime movie. I wonder if it ever did...It also introduces the recurring character, defense attorney Jordan McAfee who is quite likable in each of his sporadic appearances, especially his close relationship with his son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy to finish.","review":"The Jacket to this book really caught my attention, what could have happened to these young lovers that would make them want to kill themselves. The book starts off with a Bang but quickly looses its momentum. I find Chris to be a believable character until he helps Emily put the gun to her head, Emily in my opinion is not very believable, if the two of them were so close she would have confided in him about the baby. This book drug at times and was painful at others....I was happy when I was finished reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"this is my favorite of jodi piccoults books. there were many different elements to the book that kept it interesting. i would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Love Story","review":"I thought The Pact was captivating and very easy to read. I couldn't put it down. Jodi really captured the love between two people and developed the characters in the book so that I felt as if I knew them personally. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a mystery & love story intertwined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative","review":"I first checked this book out from the library but it was so good that I had to buy it. The two main characters are Emily and Chris, who have grown up next door to eachother all of their lives. Anyone who has been in an intense relationship where you cannot really seperate yourself from that person will find this book to be easy to relate to. By the end I was bawling my eyes out. After reading this book I made my boyfriend and my sister and anyone that I could read it. The ending was a bit of a surprise, I was definitely thinking that it would end more like Romeo and Juliet. I highly recommend this book for anyone over the age of 14. Jodi Picoult is a wonderful author and this left me addicted to her books. By the way another great book is the Dogs of Babel, by Carolyn Parkhurst."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"i thought this book was pretty good...good story line good story telling i found it to be well written a good overall read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"This book speaks volumes on true love, on being a teenager, and dealing with suicide. Absolutely amazing from front to back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an easy read, but an intense one","review":"I had an interesting experience reading \\"The Pact\\" - I couldn't put it down, yet I almost couldn't bear to feel the pain of the characters as the plot continuously unwound. The story is brilliantly written, bouncing from perspective to perspective, giving us a unique view of the picture as a whole while leaving out key fragments until we, the readers, were ready to read them. Picoult's writing is poignant and touching, putting things in such a way that I couldn't help but feel sympathy for every character in the book in some way. It is an intense journey that will leave you guessing at what the truth actually is until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pact","review":"She's done it again!!!! Loved the book. It is quite obvious that Picoult does her research on whatever \\"hot topic\\" she may choose to weave her story around, The Pact is no exception. Having lost a family member to suicide, the subject matter was especially poignant to me, especially as it relates to how deeply depression can carve into the dark place of the soul. The book is worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like this one","review":"I didn't like how Emily was closed off to Chris even though she loved him very much. She should have let Chris know what happened to her in the Men's bathroom at least when they became a couple. He would have been more understanding towards her when it came to the way she felt about sex. I thought she was extremely selfish for not thinking of what would happen to Chris once she was gone. The fact that she was so closed off and very selfish made me not like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vexed","review":"I kept wondering why up to page 95 I was still getting the characters mixed up as to who was who and which couple was the parent of which child? Was there some deep meaning I missed in giving one of the women a man's name to make it all even more incomprehensible with zero dimensional characters mixed up in a go-nowhere plot? A tragic piece of fluff exploiting a seriously tragic social problem. Flashlight with dead batteries lost in a black hole."},{"rating":"2","title":"started slow but when you got into it I could not put the book down","review":"I found this book very good had a lots of twists and gave a good look into your courts and justice"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"I like this author but then I don't. Is she being controversial just to say she was? I want to love the books I have read of hers but they piss me off too much. Besides this, I have read My Sister's Keeper and The Plain Truth.

It's very well crafted, yet I wouldn't recommend it unless you're looking for emotional pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pact","review":"All of Picoult's books are very good. Worth the read. This one is no different. This is not your typical love story. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this love story!","review":"I'm new to Jodi Picoult and I am now a true fan! What a great story. Jodi does an amazing job of capturing the reader in the first few sentences...I could not and did not want to put this book down! I cried, laughed and cried again! I found myself not wanting it to end...this is my new favorite book! Some people were disappointed with the ending, but I found it to fit the book! I highly recommend this book, I can't wait to read more from Jodi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Powerful!","review":"\\"The Pact: A Love Story\\" is an amazing book with so many layers. The main story of young love is easily thought of as the binding force, but I think the story of these two families is the real heart and soul of this novel. These two families have shared everything, been everything to eachother and in one night all their hopes are dreams are crushed. A friendship cannot withstand the heartbreak and deception that is told in this story. There is only so much that people can take before they crack.This book is amazingly powerful, emotional and thought provoking. I was completely transfixed and engrossed in this story of young love and loss. It's a wonderful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! I did not got me!","review":"I had read other Picoult books, which I liked a lot. My Sister's Keeper, Nineteen minutes are good books that got me from page one till the end. This book was hard for me to read. I wasn't interested in the characters, none of them. The author didn't let me get to know Emily very well, I couldn't felt sorry for her. I really got bored with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"I am typically a fan of Picoult but this book was missing something. I had trouble caring about the characters and I just felt creeped out the entire book, the closeness of the two families and the dating of the kids felt almost incestuous. I did not like this book and was really disappointed; I would recommend Vanishing Acts or Salem Falls instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly disappointing!","review":"This is the second novel I have read by this author and I have come to the conclusion that she has a problem with endings. She starts out great and the stories are interesting and she is taking on tough issues but then she wimps out. The first one of hers I read was My Sister's Keeper. Like this one, I picked it up because the synopsis sounded intriguing and like this one I was disappointed because she doesn't handle the very issue she's writing about. In The Pact even she admits (in an interview) she let Chris off and the ending wasn't right. Then why write it? Her endings are emotional cheats. If you don't really want to face an issue don't write about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"It's a page turner. Very much written in her Jodi Picoult style, and very reminiscent of her book Nineteen Minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tear jerker!","review":"The Pact is a story that really makes you think, like most Jodi Picoult books. What would you do if your son was accused of killing his girlfriend? The girlfriend being your best friend's daughter and the kids meeting when he was 6 months old and she was a few hours old. They grew up together and everyone knew they would eventually be together. When secrets are revealed, what would you do? This book is fully of suspense and love. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pact","review":"I read this book in 2 days and I must say, I was sad to be finished with it. It wasn't so much the plot or circumstance that was so riveting. It was the characters. I felt so close to them, I found myself thinking about Chris and Emily when I was driving. It sounds kind of silly but now that I am finished with the book, I miss them! I hope I feel this close to the characters in the next book that I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good easy read","review":"I read this book in about two days. I found myself staying up as late as I could to finish it. It was a nice, easy read. I look forward to reading more from Picoult."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful, intriguing story","review":"This story begs the question \\"How far would you go for someone you love?\\" It's a heartwrenching story of two families whose lives are intertwined to the point where their children seem more like siblings than neighborhood playmates. A very powerful book about relationships and how strong or fragile they can be under duress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing...","review":"I've read a lot of great books over the years, but this book is, by far, the most incredible book i have ever read. I absolutely could not put it down--everything around me became obsolete while I became engrossed in this book. It was given to me by a friend, and the first I have ever read by Jodi Picoult. Well, I finished it in less than 4 days. I could not even think of anything else while reading this. It felt as though I was a part of Chris and Emily's lives and experiencing all the anguish and pain, as well as the love and passion, that these two had. I have never read a book before where my mouth dropped open in shock, or when I have cried for a brief, fleeting second simply because the scene seemed so real and endearing. I can seriously say that nothing could have added to this book to make it any more perfect--but as I reached the last page, I wanted nothing more than for the book to continue on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read almost every Jodi Picoulet book and this was the first one that I didn't enjoy. Without spoiling the story for others, I'll just say that to me the whole thing just seemed unbelievable.

Thank you, Ms. Picoult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I really enjoyed this book. As a parent, I can totally see both sides of the pain that these families endured.

Can't wait to read another one of her books!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"For a brief moment, I missed being a teenager in love. What a sad and tragic book. It brought back a lot of adolescent memories. The twists in this book make it worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous & Heartbreaking","review":"I would have to say that \\"The Pact\\" was the best novel I have read in quite a while. The format in which it was written made it so much better--going back and forth from past and present. The author was able to truly capture the essence of the human spirit in this novel. I was amazed by it and found it to be very beautiful. This book was somewhat about a crime,and it could have been a cheesy crime drama, but she was able to build so much around it that it became a wonderful novel. This was a novel that once I opened it, I wanted to do nothing but continue reading it. It felt so real,and some sections of the novel were almost heartbreaking. What I loved about this book, is that Ms. Picoult was able to portray love and grief, without cliches, it was portrayed originally and beautifully, and that it why it is such an outstanding novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Having read many of Jody Picoult's books, I really enjoyed reading The Pact. The emotions all of the characters displayed were true to life. Makes you wonder how you would handle being the parent of the victim and/or the accused."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book for everybody","review":"I strongly recommend this book, I think there isn't anything more to say. A great story with wonderful characters and so well written you will just keep reading until you finish it. Wonderful. A book to read one time and another and another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great author terrible book. *SPOILER ALERT*","review":"I have now read 4 Picoult novels, 2 of which were GREAT. I loved Vanishing Acts and Plain Truth. However, My Sister's Keeper and The Pact had TERRIBLE endings. Both books were good until the very end. The ending of The Pact is a complete joke! She had me until the verdict. Closing the book was so disappointing, the entire book was an emotional experience and then this let huge down. Is Chris just going to go off to college like nothing happened? Come on! Give me a break! I hope my next Picoult experience will much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book Packed With Strange Information","review":"I was introduced to this book by a good friend who raved about it and convinced me to read it myself. So I guess when I got it I was expecting this great novel, but half way through it, I couldn't read any more. Picoult doesn't portray teenage lives very realistically. She describes Emily's sink towards depression, but she doesn't develop why this occurs. She presents Emily's thoughts well, but gives no back-up for them. You don't feel like you \\"know\\" Emily because the author doesn't go deep into her charachter development. I feel that the story moved fast, but the plot didn't move at all. Years went by, and there was little or no advancement in the plot. The book wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and overwritten","review":"The Pact could have been about half as long as it was. It was repetitious and far too wordy. Picoult does not appear to re-read what she has written and leaves in much extraneous stuff.The two teenage characters wouldn't have been so awful if they weren't so tedious and boring. I found them and their situation unbelievable, and there was no suspense about how Emily's death occurred. It was obvious from the beginning.Picoult has written much better books. This time she was lazy about both the story and her writing style. I found myself thinking that even she didn't care much about the people she created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it immensely, until the end","review":"I found this book in my house, having been left accidentally by someone. I picked it up out of boredom and was soon unable to put it down. It was a very compelling story, and the two main characters were developed extraordinarily well.But I found it ultimately unsatisfying. There was a major issue that was unresolved, and I felt that it needed to be explored in greater depth - especially Melanie's understanding of this issue.I also felt that the relationship between Gus and Michael could have been explored in greater detail.It was almost as if the author was under time pressure to get this finished, and did not have the time to fully wrap up some key details that had been introduced.Still, it was a good read and I would recommend it without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly intriguing....","review":"I bought The Pact looking for a good read, and was not disappointed. I could not put it down. Picoult's writing was strong, fast paced, and the ideas in the story were very intriguing to me... how well do any of us ever know our children? How do events that happened earlier shape our lives? How close can two people be?The only drawback which made it not suitable for my book club is the themes dealing with sex and a tad bit of language. I thought these themes were very well done, and true to life, but was very surprised to find them in the book, as the back cover blurb said nothing about them. If you can see the value of some scenes of that nature, to express a point, develop a character, etc... than I could reccommend this book with a clear conscience. If you prefer not to read things of that nature, I'd pass this one up..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Story","review":"They were meant to be together forever...or were they? Emily Gold and Chris Harte grew up hand in hand. Their families were best friends and neighbors. They grew together like twins...brother and sister. They became lovers, and wanted things to stay the same forever. But the only thing constant about life is change. Emily felt that there was only one way to accomplish keeping things the same. She dies with Chris. Now he is charged with murder. But was it murder? Was it suicide? Was it from love? Was it from secrets? Was it a pact?I felt this book was written well. I enjoyed the novel but feel indifferently as to how the story ended. If you enjoy books that are depressing and leave you with questions, I feel you would like The Pact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This is the third book I have read by Jody Picoult and she is certainly my favorite author now. The first was \\"The Plain Truth\\", the second which I could not put down was \\"Keeping Faith\\" and now \\"The Pact\\". All of her books are so completely different, not like some of the same \\"been there..done that\\" type book where you can guess the ending. Her books keep you thinking about the characters and especially the way she ends each of her books.When I was growing up my mother always told me that in a relationship there is always one person who loves more. In this book I kept thinking of that when it came to Chris. This is not a book I will forget quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beach Reading","review":"I enjoyed this book and the story of two teens who grew up almost as close as siblings. I had a difficult time putting the book down and spent hours reading it on the beach. As a school counselor I enjoyed the psychological aspect of this book and the descriptive way the author portrays the characters. I recommended it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Formulaic Picoult Novel","review":"Overall, I have to give this book 2 stars. In the scheme of all books, it's a sold 2 star book. For what it is, it is much higher.What it is: a Jodi Picoult novel that deals with an emotionally supercharged situation and progresses through a trial. The truth of what actually happened is revealed in the last 5% of the book. The writing is solid, the characters are heartfelt, and the conclusion is what you expect.What's different about this novel, and what was frankly distracting was the sexual situations. Too many. I read enough \\"he entered her\\" sentences to last me a lifetime. Gave the book kind of an ick factor.If you're a Jodi Picoult fan, this is a book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I found Chris and Emily's relationship chiche, and unrealistic. Some of the descriptions literally made me cringe at how sickeningly sweet Picoault tried to make their relationship seem. The ending was a let down, and seemed rushed. Too many loose ends with no explaination. However, what annoyed me most was the repetition of phrases (\\"She snorted\\".), as well as some inconsistencies which should have been caught by an editor. I didn't hate it, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it. I liked this the least of all her books I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome story","review":"Could not put this book down from the time I picked it up and since I knit while I read my kindle, I almost made it through to jumpers in two weeks! Very typical style of Jodi Picoult, and if you enjoy her books this is one to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pact","review":"I LOVE JODI PICOULT!!! With that said I have to say that The Pact was not one of her better books that she has written. I think that the book went a slow and I was finding it VERY hard to get through. I would not recommend you read this book and try one of her other ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I am amazed this book got such great reviews. I had to push myself through it, and was bored the entire time. For the first half of the book I was still confusing the characters (whose mom was Gus again?). I attribute this to lack of character development. The story was painfully predictable, but had the characters been a little bit more interesting I may not have cared so much. A complete bore from first page to last. Not one of the characters seemed \\"real\\", and I find it hard to believe that anyone (like in previous reviews) could have shed a tear reading this lifeless story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Unconvincing","review":"I read this book on the basis of the many glowing reviews previously written and I was very disappointed. The characters were unsympathetic and one-dimensional. I guess I don't understand the \\"small town\\" mentality but it seems a little sick that the parents never wanted anything more from their children than for them to fall in love and live happily ever after without ever experiencing what else is out there.The writing is also quite mediocre and the trial is not very credible. I'm very sorry to have wasted the time that I spent reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the pact","review":"so unbelievable that a young girl who is molested and frightened shows no signs of it until years later. Even her boyfriend/best friend doesn't notice anything. He then agrees to help her commit suicide? I was very disappointed and will never read another novel by Jodi Picoult."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner","review":"This is a great read for book clubs. There is a lot to analyze about the characters, and the families. The book is well written, but does leave lots of unanswered questions which made for a great discussion in my group.Parts of the book veered toward the sappy, as advertised by the \\"Lifetime Television Movie\\" sticker on the front, but for the most part this was an engrossing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"high school writer?","review":"Though the overall story was entertaining, I was sadly disappointed that this was a \\"final draft.\\" Throughout the entire book, I was continually caught up in the amount of grammatical/conventional errors. About a quarter of the way through, I was tempted to get out a red pen and circle the errors to then send back the book to the editing company. I've never read a book with so many errors. There were countless times \\"an\\" was written instead of \\"a,\\" repeated words (\\"she she said\\") were throughout, and I ran into a couple of spelling errors.If this book had been read over a couple of times by even a high school English teacher, I probably would have enjoyed it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this love?","review":"There have been many reviews of this book that point out the various flaws. My biggest complaint is that the character of Chris is presented as a loving and caring one, but actually his treatment of Emily was cruel. Who dared her to go in the men's restroom when she was nine? Who dared her to go down a ski slope that was too much for her, so she broke her leg? Who kept pushing her to have sex with him at age 15 when she repeatedly said no? And is it really love to let your best friend kill herself without trying to get help for her? With friends like Chris, who needs enemies? Chris comes across as an oppressive, possessive stalker, which might be the reason Em felt trapped. This type of unhealthy attachment is what the two sets of parents should have noticed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"What a huge disappointment! I never expected this writer - who is normally quite good - to produce such a silly and boring piece of work. The entire story is so repetitive, it often felt like she was copypasting whole paragraphs. The characters are unrealistic in the extreme. Knowing Picoult's work, I expected some sort of a twist, a stunning revelation at the end. But this time there was nothing like that. After finishing this endlessly boring novel, all you can feel is a sense of bewilderment is why any one would want to keep spinning this type of drivel for hundreds of pages. Thematically, the main point of the novel is that parents don't always know what their teenage children actually feel. Why Picoult would think that this triviality is worth spend even more time on is incomprehensible. All in all, this is the worst by this author I have read so far. Actually, it might be the worst I have read in the past few years by any author.http://clarissasbox.blogspot.com/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic, disturbing and horrible","review":"Just skip it. It's not worth your time or emotional energy. She's trying to be profound. She's trying to make us think here....I think. But it fails on every single level. There is nothing sympathetic about any of the characters. The date rape boyfriend, the wimpy girlfriend...the stupid parents. Just skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read This Book","review":"I read this book about teenage suicide several years ago and was incensed at the iresponsiblity of the author in romanticising in a sick Romeo and Juliett type of way two obviously disturbed teens contemplating and finally commiting this selfish act!Teenagers have enough to contend with in this day and age with drugs,sex,violence,peer pressure and absent parents.I hope Ms.Picoult's own children never read or take this book seriously or the rest of the children throughout the world.Highly irresponsible writing.This is no \\"love story\\".It is a nightmare."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pact","review":"Loved it. Just discovered Jodi Picoult recently and really enjoy her novels. Looking forward to reading her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't see the appeal","review":"I read this based on the recommendations of friends (moms ages 35-43). I did not like it. I admit I wanted to find out what happened in the end, but I did not enjoy reading it. I was desperate to finish it so I could be \\"done\\" with it. It is not just that the idea of a teen suicide is so painful to read about; it is that no one was terribly likeable in the book. I didn't relate either to the teens or to the moms. Also I found it not credible that the girl had never previously shown signs of depression. Yes, I know that family and close friends can \\"miss signs\\" of suicidal tendencies, and that there can be no signs whatsoever, but it seems there usually are signs of depression. Certainly the teen had reason to be disturbed and depressed, but the laying out of the story seemed neither revelatory nor explanatory. I just don't like it. Maybe it's better for a teen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and shallow","review":"I started reading this book with high expectations since it was recommended to me by a friend who loved it. I am terribly disappointed. The book is filled with shallow, conceited characters and I had a hard time feeling sorry for, or even liking, most of them. The whole plot just doesn't ring true. Chris and Emily were basically pushed into an unnatural relationship by both sets of parents who were trying to live their lives vicariously through their children. They seemed to have no lives or friends outside their rather incestuous little circle. Do people really live this way? I haven't finished the book yet so I don't know what the ending is, but I have no doubt it will be just as implausible as the rest of the story. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"One of my favorite authors. Her books draw me in and keep my attention. I like getting caught up in the lives of the characters and being able to feel their emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I couldn't stop reading this book!

It was a very emotional read; I cried a lot! As another reviewer has already stated, this book will stay with you days after reading it. I have to say, most of Jodi Picoult's books do this for me... She's one of the BEST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"This is the kind of book you just cant leave down, I just wanted to find out what happens at the end. The way Picoult changed from the past to present while telling the story made it seem like two stories in one and made it even more interesting. Your drawn into the story, you want to see the guy workin in the takeaway answer for what he done. Picoult as usual with her books leaves questions unanswered for you to think about when you finish reading the book, What was in that diary? Really enjoyed this book from Picoult."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you Picoult, you'll like this book","review":"I thought this was a decent Picoult book. I usually read her novels as my \\"light\\" reading and this one proved to be exactly what I was looking for. It's not too deep or thought provoking. It has the usual Picoult-esque twist at the end. It was a quick read and generally entertaining. I do think that she could have developed the characters and potential plot devices a little better. I enjoyed it for what it was but I thought Nineteen Minutes was the best book of hers that I've read so far. This book was written quite a while ago and it was fun to see how far she has come as a writer when comparing this book to her more recent books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pact","review":"This is by far the best book that Jodi Picoult has written! It is powerful, uplifting and inspirational. I would recomend this book to anyone and everyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A twisted mess of the heart","review":"This is the first Jodi Picoult book I've read, and it helped me easily fall in love with her writing style. Easy to read, keeps you interested and captured. This is a love story like no other, with twists and turns that will make it difficult to put it down. Highly recommended, however, be warned that the material in this book is difficult to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"A little depressing...everyone was so perfect and so happy and the ending was so very sad. You never know how some people think about their situations and how they consider solving them.All in all I really liked it...it was the second Jodi Picoult book I had read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pact is AMAZING!","review":"I thought the book, The Pact, was a very good book that explores emotions varying from grief to true love. In this book you read about a boy, Chris, and a girl, Emily, that were best friends since birth that as they got older they fell in love. Unfortunately, Emily couldn't handle all the obstacles that life had and was suicidal. It eventually goes into a trial accusing Chris of murder.This book really makes you realize how there can be two completely different views of something that happens, and it also makes you think about your life and really cherish the relationships you have with people because in a moment they could be gone. It will make you think about how you would handle a situation like this, and basically tell you how lucky you are your not in this kind of situation.The Pact is a deep book that will really make you question your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"As usual Jodie Picoult gives us cause to think about what we are reading. Her knowledge of the subject matter is profound and I would recommend her books to anybody. Look forward to the new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read...but not completely make sense","review":"I enjoy reading this book and all the characters, except Emily (there's not much about her to read about, thers's not enought explaination on how she feels, why she wanted to kill herself the only options). Emily is just a weak mushy character that doesn't expand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written story...I enjoyed it over all","review":"Well written story...I enjoyed it over all.Character development on the girl could have been better, more believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read.","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend and avid Jodi Picoult reader. I absolutely loved the book and read it in three days while on vacation. It is gripping, page-turning, and thought provoking writing and i loved every minute of it. Jodi Picoult is truly a very talented writer and her craft is well displayed in \\"The Pact.\\" If you love Jodi Picoult's work or just want a book that has more substance to it than spit on the sidewalk, then this is a great choice. Happy Reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grieg bible","review":"Got hold of a copy of the book at the Edvard Grieg Museum in Norway. The book gives a full introduction to Grieg's life in a chronological as well as a thematical order. It is possible to read for nonmusicians, but with some knowledge of music, the book is simply excellent.

We felt this had been done better before. Can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but not funny","review":"I read this book, and I found it tedious.

I thought it would be very funny, but I found it a bit tiresome after awhile. Everyone spoke the same. The characters didn't really develop, and even though this was supposed to be amusing, I did want to see them and the plot go further. Not bad, but not really involving, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Star is Born","review":"E. E.

The information she gives us is important to know whether or not we self-publish. It gives us an inside look at the publishing business. Written in a down-to-earth, chatty, easy to understand manner. The 50 Quick and Cheap Promotion Ideas and the 79 pages of resouce information, alone, are worth the price of the book. Of the 4 books on selp-publishing that are in my bookcase, Connie Shelton's is the one I reach for when I need to know something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"An amazing portrayal of an honest man caught in the forces of a history driven by less-upright minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Absolutely horrible.

Like the other review mentions, this jacket does have an odd length. It comes down to the hip and fits pretty tightly on the hip. I actually have to zipper it above the hip and then pull it down. It fits normally everywhere else and a medium would be way too big. I was going to return the coat because of the strange fit at the hip, but decided to keep it because it is comfortable and I love the gargoyle grey color. In terms of warmth...I'm actually not that impressed.

I was totally disappointed though as the pen/pad response is awfull even for a toy. You really have to push hard in some cases to get it to react and there really isn't a good free form drawing mode. The pen also isn't even close to being accurate on where you click and frustrated my daughter after a while. She still occassionally plays with it but she had to learn the way to toy wanted to respond to touch and such which isn't anything like putting a crayon to paper. Maybe she got too used to my Wacom but I've had better toys from Leapster with better touch screen response than this one. I can't recomend this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, terrible execution","review":"This toy has many clever features, but many of them are unusable due to poor hardware or software, I'm not sure which. For some of the activities, the images displayed on the TV screen are disjoint and out of sync, resulting in a ghost image shifted to the left.So, for example, when trying to use the drawing tool, the drawn line appears as expected, but a second dimmer line is drawn to the left at the same time. This makes it impossible to make any kind of acceptable drawing.Pity. It seems like it would be a lot of fun if it worked right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small camera, great photos, slow shutter speed","review":"Purchased this camera through Beach Camera. Happy with the company, very happy with the quality of photos from the Olympus FE-250. Colors are vibrant, the camera itself is VERY compact. I would recommend buying a case for it, I scratched it on it's first use, but probably because I was so used to tossing my old dinosaur of a digi-cam around. the only complaint is the shutter speed is quite slower than some other cameras, so if you like to take quick photos, this isn't the best bet. but if you're in the market for an easy to use, compact, nice looking camera that takes nice looking photos, I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Academic diatribe","review":"This is art speak at its best - contains a lot of valuable information if you really search for it. The text reads more like a thesis rather than a book. Lots of bulking to fill the covers and a tendency to give the inconsequential consequence. For the academic there are a lot good references, quotations and examples of pompous phraseology.

It also is the story of Drummage, the virile and handsome slave who rose to become not only ruler of Falconhurst, but master of the selfish, sensual woman who owned it.MASTER OF FALCONHURST is a very raw look at slavery in the old south. At times it is very gritty other times very sensual and infuriating.

I did some research on the web and found that regularly boiling the filter and storing it in the fridge in a plastic zip lock bag between uses will keep it fresh and ready to use. The filter should not be dried between uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"best coffee i've ever had","review":"\\"the sock pot\\", as i call it, is an awesome way to brew 2 cups of amazing coffee. this drip method makes coffee that beats, in my opinion, the Chemex and the french press. i usually use 22 grams of freshly ground coffee for each cup i am brewing, and i fill mine all the way to where the wooden handle begins to get 2 mugs of coffee. the sock should be washed out with hot water when you're done and stored in a bag in the fridge, or i read that you can freeze it. i guess the thing is to not let the flannel dry out. anyway, it works great! better design than the one from yama. my advice is make sure you're buying great beans. this type of brewing isn't really worth the fuss if you're just using average beans. but when you buy a superb bean, there is really no way to make a better cup of coffee, which is a pleasure i get to wake up to every morning! cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee, easy to clean","review":"I bought this to replace a chipped drip pot I'd been using for quite a while.

Highly recommend if you want to make great coffee in small quantities with a bit of style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and simple","review":"Great tasting coffee with this pot. After you taste the coffee made with it, you can finally taste all the extra non-coffee flavors you've been tasting with other drip coffee machines (i.e. steel, plastic, etc.). The wooden piece is purely aesthetic, you could very well take it off and just hold the whole thing with a towel if it's too hot.Not sure about the cloth filter and if it will get moldy in time. I guess time will tell. But it's wonderful right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The War Magician","review":"This documetary about the illusions created by Master Magician Jasper Maskelyne is awesome!

The start of the film, with its pseudo-documentary presentation, is perhaps the film's most thought-provoking aspect... The concrete presentation of the collapse of the French military, and the astonishing internment of its two million (!) soldiers is a story that's seldom told when WWII is examined; it's mind-boggling when you think of it. Renoir cedes the Germans a surprising amount of humanity in this film; a legacy, perhaps of the Cold War-era alliances present when this was made, but also an unusual, nuanced touch. With its comedic \\"Hogan's Heroes\\"-ish undertones, this is perhaps not Renoir's deepest or most moving film, but it's still fascinating and well produced. Worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get The Word Out!!!!!!","review":"This album is Great!! Another P.E.B. Classic!!!!!

Whatever it is, please consider passing it along, because other than the single authentic and melodic track by Patsy Cline (i.e., Back In Baby's Arms, which is available on a zillion other collections including some of her own), this CD doesn't have an ounce of redeeming musical, lyrical or social value in my view. Nada! Zip!Even the Dylan track is junk!

They are both stubborn and set in their ways. They chose not to compromise. Very childish.

But then, the imbalance of power, in whatever setting, inevitably leads to abuse and there are bullies everywhere, refined and not, Victorian era, or Clinton era. This mystery keeps one going most of the way through, and has some suprises. Perry's endings are always tight and abrupt, but she usually ties up all the loose ends, so one adjusts to the sudden end.

In addition, he does not seem to have any knowledge of other Hindu philosophies such as Dvaita and Visishtadvaita. Sri Ramanuja's philosophy is just mentioned in passing. He calls Sri Madhva as 'Madhava', a very fundamental error in getting the name of one of the greatest exponents of Hinduism incorrect.Irrational explanations with flawed concepts, in an informal talk with a child, seems to be a bit over the line. Sometimes even grammatically unsound, the author seems to have only a peripheral knowledge of ancient Hindu scriptures and very little understanding of its interpretations.

I found many problems with it: for example the homophobic \\"prophecy\\" mentioned at one point of the book leads one to believe that Hinduism is as homophobic as Western religions, but that is nonsense. But the major problem is how simplistic the interpretations are. If you want something that has substance and is informative AND accurate read Gavin Flood's Introduction to Hinduism, or better yet, read the sacred texts yourself--the Upanishads, the Vedas, and the Mahabharata.

I have found it difficult to find good books that give a decent overview of Hinduism and its practises. This book does an excellent job of attempting to explain the Hindu faith to non-Hindus.

He was not the insider he claimed to be. He got in a jam with the law and cut a deal -- effectively pulling the wool over the law's eyes. He testified and initially put people behind bars, but later trials -- most importantly the one against Meyer Lansky -- revealed him to be a liar.

And it is pretty much impossible to put back into the light. It's bright, but not nearly what I expected. I since purchased a Surefire G3, which is brighter and more compact, with no switch issues.

If I was not an engineer with great tools and skills, I would have sent it back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initial Assembly Difficult","review":"Mount assembly is well documented and should be easy to accomplish. However, two of the allen head set screws that had to be loosened were tightened so much at the factory that the retaining nuts were deformed. Attempting to remove the allen head screws resulted in stripping both of the screws. I had to drill out the screws and use an easy-out tool to remove them. On the positive side, the kit comes with a wide assortment of hardware, including extra allen head screws and retaining nuts.Directions were well written and once I got through the issue of the overtorqued screws, assembly and leveling was easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"This worked great for my Mitsubishi HC3 projector. It does involve using an alan wrench to make adjustments and/or remove the projector from the ceiling, but it's not too bad.One thing to be aware of though is that it does not come with hardware to mount the bracket to the ceiling, so I had to go out and buy some screws for that. Otherwise, it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A GREAT UNIT- I have rarely found a better projector mount","review":"From reading other reviews I thought these would be ok, but not great and most likly requiring parts.But to my suprise, these unit came with every imaginable nut, bolt, screw, etc.The assembally process is easy and streight forward, and they are rock solid once you tighten the top locking bolt.I run an A/V rental house and I have rarely found a better projector mount for todays small light weigth DLP projectors.Great mount for the dollar, still a good option at twice the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used for EPSON 8350","review":"This is a solid mount that comes with small, medium and long arms and all the hardware you should need to secure the mount and to attach a projector.

It comes with extra arms of different sizes to ensure you can mount your projector and I actually HAD to use the smaller arms it came with.

I have tried everything to unfuse them, but no luck. It appears that there is not enough clearance between the cylinder of the bracket and the ceiling mount and the coating has fused. On a few units I was able to twist the ceiling mount around about 50 times causing the coating to peel off and then it finally released. Very frustrating because now we will have to take the whole bracket and ceiling plate down to perform maintenance on the ceiling projectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epson 6020","review":"This product will work on the Epson 6020 but it is very tight, you have to add the extenders (supplied) well built and sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of parts and good finish, not as solid as I would wish","review":"I used this with a Panasonic PT-AR100U. It fit fine with the various spacers provided and additional long arms to create the five arms needed for for this projector. It is hard to tighten the pan and tilt bolts as there is little space between the ceiling and the projector. Even when tightened it is still a bit less solid than I would like. I think it stems from the small diameter vertical pipe locking assembly.All in all a good but not great mount. Lots of screws and spacers and extra arms with various lengths should work with a wide range of projectors. Instructions are OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"goes well with Epson 8350, but use some paint!","review":"Amazon somehow magically presented this as a buy option when I bought an Epson 8350. Installation was smooth and painless after a lot of planning as typically required for proper projection system in a home theater. The only unique thing I did was to paint the mount to match the black color of the ceiling using flat spray paint. Yes, my ceiling and the screen surrounding areas are flat black with dark olive curtains and beige/gold stripes. This had the effect of the mount blending in with the ceiling to take away the bulky look of both the projector and the mount together. However, if you have a builder-grade white paint on the ceiling, then keep it the way it is since the colors already blend nicely.I was tempted to spray paint the 8350, but refrained myself in case I ever needed warranty service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal?","review":"So I purchased this mount for my new Epson 8350, the arms do not reach the screws and I had to attach them where they would reach... low and behold the projector is now lop sided as is the viewing area."},{"rating":"1","title":"may you invest some","review":"the whole part is solid except the screws, shame when a screw breaks inside the connecting plastic side of the projector, it ruins everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit pricey, but did the job","review":"This is a solid mount.

Good buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, the age you first saw it helps a lot ....","review":"I will admit that, objectively, this is not a great film. It's weak performance at the box office effectively put an end to the Conan series and meant that Brigitte Nielsen was not going to be a star (like there was ever much chance of that!). Still, if you were young enough when you first saw it, it does retain a certain appeal. Richard Fleischer could always direct a reasonably good movie and the action is decent, although the dialog is -- admittedly -- pretty bad a lot of the time. And, of course, you get to look at Brigitte and Sandhal Bergman -- who I always thought was insanely hot.Definitely a guilty pleasure, but given how cheap the DVD is, what have you got to lose?"},{"rating":"2","title":"part 3 of 4 in a series","review":"This story wasnt meant to be another Conan, Red Sonya <as REH originally wrote the name> was set in a medieval world, but it was changed after his death. Its a good B movie, and we all need a B movine once in a while. OF note on the funnier stuff is when they climb the tower, and their hair falls to rest on the wall of the tower. This was also an early part for Ernie Reys JR, from older tv series \\"side kicks\\" and such movies as \\"TMNT 2\\" <pizza boy/spy into foot clan> and surf ninjas. the other 3 movies are both Conan's, and the recent movie \\"Kull the conqueror\\" each being based of Robert E Howards manuscripts from the 1920~30's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"The supporting role from good 'ol Ah-nold is enough to watch Red Sonja, a film made after the equally lame Conan the Destroyer (that film and this are were both directed by Richard Fleischer), and the real kicker here folks: even though Red Sonja takes place in the world of pulp author Robert E. Howard, Arnold doesn't play the warrior king that made him famous. If you can get past that, there actually are a few redeeming qualities, such as the casting of Brigitte Nielsen as Sonja, who physically is perfect for the role. She faces off against an evil empress (Sandahl Bergman, from Conan the Barbarian) seeking revenge with help from good 'ol Ah-nold. Even though this was made in 1985 and the excellent Conan the Barbarian was made in 1982, it's amazing how Conan has aged gracefully and this hasn't aged well at all. Red Sonja was lame then, and it's still lame now, so if you've never seen it, you're not missing much, and are better off sticking with your Conan the Barbarian DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"All 3 Conam Movies","review":"You have to have this one in order to complete your collection of the 3 Conan movies.

Not remembering, I purchased this after getting back into the \\"Conan\\" series; what a mistake! This was so lame I didn't even make it through the finish, turned it off. The production level is that of \\"Ulyses\\"(sp?), back in the 50's, and the acting level is below rating.

Avoid this film at all costs.The story follows the adventures of Red Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), the female version of Conan invented by the same writer, Robert E. Howard. To reclaim her fortunes, Sojna is accompanied by a barbarian warrior played by Arnold Schwarzenegger (Not Conan) and other characters.This is just another one of those bad Conan follow-ups that just had no grace or substance. A terrible screenplay with horrible dialogue. The action scenes are ridiclous and the sets horribly fake. Trust me, you won't miss a thing by not seeing this stupid film. The only good thing about this film is Ennio Morricone's (The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly; A Fist Full of Dollars, etc.) majestic score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Sonja","review":"Yet another Robert E.

However I found the picture quality to be one of the poorest I have seen on DVD. It resembled that of an old VHS. There were white creases in the print; not distracting but noticable, and the picture was grainy throughout, sound had a slight muffled quality to it, not crisp.I own about 500 DVD's and counting, don't write reviews because there are many of you out there that write really good ones. But what I will do from now on is share with the rest of you when I come across poor transfers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conan III ... well not really","review":"Apparently the producers originally were going to have Arnold portray Conan again but decided against it as they thought people would get the impression that he would be the main character and be disappointed with the film. Boy were they wrong! Even changing his name to Kalidor couldn't save the audiences from being disappointed. The producers first major fault was hiring director Richard Fleischer to direct as he graced us with the ultimatly disappointing Conan the Destroyer. He actually manages to make a worse movie with Red Sonja. The second major fault was hiring actress Brigitte Nielsen. Yes she had the build for a warrior women, but she was, and is, a terrible actress. I still enjoyed some of the picture in a B-movie way, but overall this was sorely disappointing even compared to Conan the Destroyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"By his own admission, Arnold's worst film","review":"In fairness, it is only Schwarzenegger's presence which lifts this movie out of the 1-star category. There are some fairly good fight scenes, a few nifty sets, and some nice location filming. Other than that, however, it is a waste of time. There are numerous technical errors and other indications of slipshod production values. Nielsen's acting, if you are so generous as to call it that, is embarassingly bad. Sandahl Bergman, normally pretty competent, overcooks it completely as the evil queen. If you like this type of heroine, it would be preferable to spend your time watching Xena, which though far from high art, is much better than \\"Red Sonja.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly dreadful","review":"This is the worst fantasy movie made in recent history second only to \\"She\\". Rather than allowing Sonja to build muscle and skill the \\"Magic Sword-Wielding Fairy\\" comes down to grant Sonja some strength. As the story develops, the only highlight is Arnold, who we already perceive as a barbarian so it doesn't take much work. Brigitte is a very poor actress and her dialog is wooden and forced. It is amazing that Sandahl Bergman who was excellent in Conan becomes such a campy moronic queen in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fantasy Film","review":"If you like ancient world action flicks (ex. Conan) you'll love Red Sonja.Red Sonja is one of the best fantasy films. Red Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen) is beautiful. You gotta love Schwarzenegger.This film had excellent sword fighting (It just wants to make you take fencing lessons). The background settings and art are very interesting such as the skeleton bridge. The little bratty prince and his servant are pretty funny. I never get tired of watching this flick.

And you have an afternoon of fun and revenge.Seems there is the talisman (some glowy plastic thing) that only women can touch. If it gets too much light it will destroy the world. It is captured by a dark queen with great ambition.

First, Ernie Reyes Jr. when he was a little kid in a Schwarzenegger movie. It's painful. Brigitte Nielsen can't act and she's not even THAT good looking. Sub-par plot (An evil queen wants a jewel) And even the fight scenes were drug out. Nielsen is so frail that everyone is pulling their punches, sword blows, etc. So, it really slows down the action. Maybe if she didn't have a bigger sword than Arnold she could fight a little better.And the evil queen? She was in the first Conan movie! I thought she was WAY hotter than Red Sonja!If you want to know why they didn't make a Conan 3, watch this movie. Bad all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"A woman in her beauty is not enough","review":"I only rate this film 2 stars for the following: - films about fantasy ages are rare - Red Sonja is a knockout of a woman (hail Brigitte)This film has a very poor music score, bery bad conducted artists and poorly explored script. They tryed to make another Conan and ended up with a low level movie. Its entertaining sure, the landscapes are beautifull and the image is very good, but this film is poor. Arnold and Brigitte, you can do much better, you've done it already. I only advise this film to fantasy film fanatics like me, but only a child can't see the poor quality of this movie. Anyway I will sure buy it when I have a DVD because as I've said before, I like this type of movies and this one leaves me with that feeling that if the director had put more attention into it this could be a classic.

Now I know that is saying alot. Arnold is in it as a character who is really SUPPOSED to be Conan and Brigitte Nielson in the title role. Sandahl Bergman (Valeria in CTB) is an evil queen in pursuit of a deadly orb of power and wiping out anyone in her path."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sonja needs no help from any man---except maybe an acting teacher","review":"This film is campy and awful that it rates up there with Showgirls for camp value.

We NEED this music. And Jim Heath delivers.\\"Liquor in the Front\\" features 13 tracks produced by industrial king, Al Jourgensen. He of Ministry & Revolting Cocks fame.

That said, at the time I read this, I had read many of her other books, and it was very, very different. It was much cuter.Cute may not have been what Ms. McDermid was going for, but that does not make the story bad, not by a long shot. Indeed, while it may not contain the creepy elements that get under one's skin as in later McDermid novels, I found main character Lindsay's class consciousness to be quite intriguing.This novel is not for everyone. It is only for those whose preconceptions' about homosexuals won't get in the way of their ability to digest the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"ponderous","review":"Far too much musing about this and that....could barely finish the book.

And allowing said journalist to question staff and pupils, particularly the pupils without a suitable adult present - sorry but too unbelievable for me.For those concerned about the lesbian aspects don't be to worried there are no detailed descriptions of bedroom antics.Had I read this book before any others I would have steered clear of Val MacDermid but really this is so different from her later books, too tame for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Print Studio ???","review":"Software not very user friendly.

My daughter has no objections to putting it on. The only drawback and reason they got 4 stars instead of 5, was that I wish it was a bit longer. The bib stops just above her belly which leaves it vulnerable to mess. Often when I take the bibbity off, she is clean except for the stripe between her bibbity and the high chair seat tray.

I did find that if you leave the tea out in the air, the taste and smell dissipates, but keeping it for any length of time in a closed container causes the turpentine taste/smell to return.

The author obviously did not get in touch at all with the Irish culture and how she herself was being treated. There is a long tradition in Ireland of making fools of 'outsiders' - Irish literature is full of such pranks. The author obviously fell into the trap. This is not a good description of how Irish women live or feel. I actually laughed out loud at some of the dour parts - the author did not get the satire or the tricks behind some of the women she interviewed. One needs to be very subtle to talk to the Irish - talking everything at face value is a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"Read this book!

These have got to be some of the most prisitine instrumentalists and vocalists around. Just listen to the melodies. Every song is great. Sort of an early funkish feel comparable to Tommy Bolin and Rory Gallagher, although Troiano was older at this point. Roy Kenner and Domenic Troiano have worked together in four different bands in their lifetime. (Mandala, Bush, James Gang, & Troiano) This is an amazing CD to buy, you will not be disappointed! UPDATE; Jan 29, 2010 - Finally this CD has dropped in price (on Amazon Marketplace) to $13. Pick it up while the price is low. You will not be disappointed. According to the liner notes, Bush apparently opened for Iron Butterfly...what a shame as they were 10x better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hidden gem..........","review":"When I first heard this track a few months ago I said to myself.....that's pretty cool.

It is so incredibly frustrating to play 30+ hours and re-start the whole game, just because the guidebook did not provide clear concise instructions on how to recruit this guy, when gamefaqs.com shows that you can recruit him earlier. And worse, there are NO maps, what the **? It is a waste of money.

There's typos throughout, mislabeling of characters/towns, and some of the information is inaccurate! What information they do have is frequently vague, making the guide not particularily helpful if you're looking for an elusive chest or if you take a wrong turn in a dungeon. There is also not a single map in the entire thing. Seriously, did anyone edit this book before they published it? And do they know what a strategy guide is for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating experience","review":"If you value your time and money simply refrain from buying this book. It doesn't contain a single map and the most important part - recruiting all 108 characters - is inaccurate and sometimes even wrong. If you were hoping to find detailed locations of all treasure chests and the shortest way through the various dungeons, you better draw your own map instead of relying on this useless waste of paper. Compairing this guide with other sources - even amateur walkthroughs on the net - I came to realise, that this book is not worth the paper that it has been printed on.Following this guide step by step will eventually lead to completion of the game, but you will miss out on recruiting more than ten characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't bother","review":"Got a handful of problems with this semi-helpful guide.It doesn't give you the full info on status changes. For example, when you get out of the baths your status screen has a gold ball next to each character. What does that mean? I DON'T KNOW!

The reviews on this film, however, almost seem to me to be talking about a different film. This film is poorly paced, acted, lit, cast . . . There are certainly some beautiful images but they aren't shot particularly well. I had a lot of hope for this one as a film exhibiting the passionate (non-sexual) male bonding mentioned by reviewers here on Amazon and found none of it.

Brian's Hunt has maggot filled, dead human bodies, and human dismemberment. And a moral to the story which was, the bear had gone to far, it was not right. Brian would find him and kill him because it was personal. So if someone does you wrong and it's personal we should kill them? Is that what we want our children to learn. How does a wild bear go to far when you're in his back yard? Our children cannot see movies with this kind of violence in it under the age of 13.

I was appalled at the ending which I found horrible.The idea of the book was good, he's in the wilderness, he finds a dog... Great, now he has to come upon two mauled humans? Come on.

It wasn't a happy book, the adventure wasn't as great as some I've read, but it was realistic about what happens in the wilderness and with wildlife.It is time slowly spent in the wilderness that makes the wilderness what it is. This book shows that. Brian takes his time hunting, making camp, even hiking. When he does have an encounter with wildlife, it isn't in a \\"Bambi\\" way, it is in a natural way. From hunting rabbits for food to hunting a bear, it is done in a realistic way.

The sander appears to be a well made and heavy (for a bench top tool) machine, however, the packaging falls far short. The sander, when it arrived, had the base damaged. There is sufficient styrofoam packing around the sides of the machine, but the top and bottom have about 1/2\\" thickness of foam protection. In shipment, the box had been dropped and the base is deformed to the extent it does not sit flat.The sander will be returned and I will not risk delivery of another Jet sander.As an aside, if anyone considers the purchase of this tool, be advised that with the height of the basic machine, if your bench is, say 30 inches from the floor, then the cast iron table of the sander will be about 52\\" from the floor! You may need to make a special base cabinet to get the table at a more workable height."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best addition to my shop!","review":"This is my first bench top sander and I was really undecided as to whether to go with this one or step up to a floor/base model. My shop is somewhat limited in space which was the deciding factor for me. However I'm more than satisfied with this sander. Makes finishing so much easier and quicker. Once I got the hang of it, it reduced my finishing time in half, if not more. The tilt table is a great feature as well. I make custom made wine racks and the 1 1/2 inch spindle is perfect for finishing the cutout for the bottle neck.

However, this album is also immediately likeable. From the very first listen, you're immediately drawn into the music. There isn't a bad track or boring second of time on this album.

The author himself admits this. This is because 1 Nf3 can transpose into an English, and this is beyond the scope of the book, which is essentially a book on the Reti.It can be kind of frustrating to learn all the concepts in the book, and the various black defenses, only to face an uncooperative opponent, who plays a defense not covered in the book! I've had that happen a lot. Of course it will happen no matter which opening you decide to play!All in all, I think playing 1 Nf3 makes sense. It's a strong move, even played by Grandmasters, and does tend to limit Black's choice of response (as commpared to 1 e4 or 1 d4 or even 1 c4).

Therefore, this predominately anecdotal book serves more as a photo-journal of the author and her own rabbit, than a comprehensive, authoratative, and objective training guide about rabbits in general.Stick with the superior House Rabbit Handbook, by Marinell Harriman, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent for a magazine article, bad for a book","review":"I think the information in this book would have been better presented in a magazine article. It was more of a cute story of Life With Woodstock, rather than a guide to training. As a new owner of two bunnies, and no experience, I looked forward to learning how I could train my bunnies. Instead of tried and true methods used in many circumstances for many bunnies this book is just one person's experience with one bunny.

Sweet, but not Wonderful","review":"The problem with this slim journal is that not enough research went into it. Many of her statements do not seem to be substantiated by research, but seem to be her personal opinion. For instance she states that rabbits do not need company and sites dependence on humans as one of the reasons for keeping only one rabbit. Rabbits are highly social animals that do everything together. A spayed/neutered pair not only keep each other company, increase each other's likelihood of surviving illness/trauma, but also form a special bond with their human (provided the human has taken the time to form one). Another problem with the book is that Woodstock's cage is a bit small for a rabbit of his size. It doesn't seem like he can do much hoping in that cage.However, not to say everything in the book is bad. The pictures are good. It's a fine introductory book provided you do more research.

Pellets should not be the staple diet, wire bottom cages are not good for them, cords CAN kill rabbits (I lost one rabbit this way, from electrocution), and the handling just does not fit all rabbits. Scruffing a larger rabbit is a horrible idea. Also, untrained rabbits are not dumb, they are locked up and terrified.

Therefore, I was lured into purchasing this fan when it arrived in my \\"Gold Box\\" as a special purchase. However -- as the saying goes -- all that glitters is not gold. My Vornado fan arrived broken: The front protective grill is made out of cheap plastic, and due to one of the plastic clips being broken, the front grill will not stay in place. It literally falls off.Despite that, I still tried to use the fan. The fan produces a \\"stream\\" (tunnel) of air into one location, and does not cool a wide area.If you want a fan that will only direct air into one spot, this fan might be fine.

If you like the songs they've realeaed, you are likely to enjoy the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting album","review":"This is an interesting concept for a live album. The title tells it as it is, isn't a typical live album, more a sonic diary of the band on tour. What you get are \\"selected highlights\\" of songs, full songs, and pieces of conversation of the band members interacting with the audience, and with each other. The mixture is an interesting blend, though in places it is a bit frustrating, in particular the Medley on disc 1 leaves me wanting to hear the full songs as the pieces fade in and out.Overall, the band is fantastic, each member is given an equal share of the spotlight, and the level of musicianship is amazing. By the end of the CDs, I really wish there was more. Lots more.Just a technical note, the music was recorded on a 2 track tape machine in mono (to my ears) and it is not a fantastic sounding multi-track recording. Even so, you get a really good sound for the band, but Mayall's singing is a bit buried in the mix. But it still sounds good; the CDs really have a unique sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is mainly Mick Taylor's record","review":"One of the best from the early John Mayall's Bluesbreakers live discs.In my view, this is due to an outstanding guitar solos by Mick Taylor and a first-class backing by Dick Heckstall-Smith on tenor and soprano. John's vocals are great, too. The rest of the group: Keith Tillman on bass, Keef Hartley on drums, Chris Mercer on tenor and baritone. The first song on this album was recorded with Paul Williams on bass.Original tapes were made by John Mayall, at a 3 and three quarters ips, which is the reason for less than stellar sound quality, even after digital remastering. But the album is a true documentary from the life of the band on the road. It sounds very authentic and pure without the use of an engineer/production crew.If you are Mayall's fan, this recording is a must-have. The material contained here far outweighs poor sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polaroid Nudes","review":"Why would a photo artist choose a large format for Polariod-sized pictures?

With approximately 60% of the pages what you get is two polariod-sized pictures side by side-- quarter-inch white borders and the rest is black background. I get so tired trying to see what the picture is about, that I literally get fatigued looking at this book.Many of the pictures seem interesting. However, with much of the magic of the human form obscured by small format photos lost in a sea of black, there are too few rewards to justify the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temerous erudition = persnickitously gauche anachronisms","review":"This book is jam packed with amazing stories. Unfortuantely Gill's inability to organize information by chronology or theme, and his insistence on using as many big words as possible, as well as paragraphs that never seem to end or make a point, make it really hard to follow. I frequently found myself skipping back several pages to try to figure out who he was talking about and why, and was generally unable to do anything but completely lose track of the loose thread of narative that appears occasionaly throughout chapters with names that seemingly have little to do with their contents. Too bad, because apparently a lot of people died and fought and drank and screwed.

Most of the time, Trent Reznor relies upon himself and a few close collaborators to work on remixing NIN's music. The results are always fascinating, and often become equally valid versions of the song in their own right - that's why Trent Reznor always refers to them as \\"versions\\" NOT remixes. Here, though, Reznor has got a variety of people together to work on The Perfect Drug, and the results are not worthy of a NIN release. Trent Reznor's own remix (track 3) is excellent, and the only redeeming feature of the disc - it's very exciting and powerful, exploring the driving rhythms of the original, now infected with drums and bass. But the other remixes do not compare - they're interesting enough, but for most of the time they have almost no connection to the original song, which defeats the point of the exercise. Buy it for Reznor's version, but don't expect the same excellence from the other tracks....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the original","review":"Don't get me wrong, I think \\"Perfect Drug\\" is one of the best songs to ever come from Trent Reznor's Nine Inch Nails outfit, but this CD single is for die hard NIN fans only who don't already own the original song featured on the Lost Highway soundtrack. There are five tracks of remixes, one of which done by Reznor which is the only track that comes close to resembling the original song. The other four tracks are loaded with remixed industrial loops and blips that borderline on annoying and is kind of boring. These remixes really don't hold a candle to the original, and your better off getting the Lost Highway soundtrack considering this single doesn't even include the original song.

My point of all this is that: If any is one, I am a Nine Inch nails expert when it come to their music. I have heard every single song NIN ever made plus remixes or unrealsed orginal version of a lot, live versions, and unrealsed instrumentls that Trent did whith a few.

The singles and remixes are no exception, and in fact they are even more geared towards hardcore fans.

Sub-par at best, this release was a great disappointment, and while the remixes were not all bad, they did completely wreck an otherwise beautiful song, and that is unforgiveable.

It consists of Trent and 4 bands making strange, otherworldly mixes that are almost, but not entirely, completely unlike \\"The Perfect Drug\\". If you like interminable incoherent mixes à la Meat Beat Manifesto, you might enjoy this CD, but don't expect it to sound like NIN -- even the Reznor/Hillebrant mix sounds very little like Nine Inch Nails. If this CD included the original, unadulterated version of the song, it would be worht buying, but as it is, it offers very little to the NIN fan. (unless you're one of those nuts who absolutely *must* own every halo)It also loses a star for having an ugly, purplish CD. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"This cd is another dissapointment, just like Fixed.I am a really big fan of NIN and they let me down 2 times now!

This is the only release that I sold used after I bought it. In my opinion the only good remixes are by Trent Reznor and The Orb.

A better intro to his life is Tribute to Woody Guthrie on Warner Brothers, at a good price at Amazon. Professional actors and top folk singers mix readings and songs to make the story come alive. If you want to hear the man himself, get the Asch Recordings, starting with Volume 1, This Land Is Your Land."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressive debut","review":"Infectious synthpop from a talented duo on the A Different Drum label. Each and every song on Native Anger impresses me. Beats and hooks on this album often border on aggressive and at times even EBM-esque. Not much fluff here! Most tracks follow the formula of building up slowly to a climatic chorus. Stand-out tracks include \\"Balance of Minds\\" and the somber \\"Midnight Son.\\"If I had to choose some other bands to compare The Nine to, I'd have difficulties. They are one of the more unique synthpop acts today, vocals- and music-wise, even on this debut.

Why a professor at Smith College would have it on his reading list might seem to be some sort of endorsement, but surely not.The book is full of errors, and badly edited. Everything from (obviously) a false ratio of men to women in Cuba, a reference to Central America as a country (!) to Herodotus's descriptions of Alexander the Great's incursions into Persia a hundred years before Alexander was even born. And where does she get a Cuban economy of $2.5 billion in 1999, when it was somewhere around ten times that amount.It's written in the sort of style one might encounter in a regional newspaper's week-end edition, hardly the stuff of serious study and research.

The philosophy is simple - positive thoughts are better than negative. Yes, thinking positively about something can only help to lead you to it since it becomes a goal, but to imply that the universe will magically make it happen is hogwash. The author sites examples in his life that support his theory, but I say it's coincidence. If you drank a glass of water before each time you drove your car and you never had an accident, you could conclude that drinking water makes you a better driver or protects you while you drive.

Perhaps because of that, I was hoping for a little more ''meat'' out of this CD - but with a 35 minute lecture, there's only so much ground you can cover.As a basic starting point for the Law of Attraction and how our thoughts influence our world, this is a wonderful program. Its lesson is simple and straightforward, easy for anyone to grasp as they begin to move from unconscious thinking to Conscious Creation. Mr. Dooley also shares some of his own background and experiences, and as always, he entertains and amuses as only an exceptionally skilled speaker/author can.If you are looking for a more thorough discourse on this subject, I would strongly recommend moving on to Dooley's \\"Infinite Possibilities\\" program.

Not a big fan of Pork Soda or the Brown album however. This is def. one of Primus's underrated and underappreciated albums.and the album Tales from the Punchbowl refers to the LSD-spiked punch that was frequently served at Barrington social events. Claypool later recorded a song called \\"Barrington Hall\\" with his band Frog Brigadewith that in mind and the history of that maybe you may have a different look on the thought process or extra curicular activity that went into producing this album. Which is extremely abstract, avant-garde all over it. Every song is has its own orginality and uniquess.I especially like the ending of Professor Nutbutter's House Of Treats song, this song takes a lot of heat but I can't understand why, I think those people need to listen to this song again."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR OPEN EARS ONLY","review":"use extreme care in listing to this album. not for the faint of heart. if playing in automobile, don't panic, light up a nice fat one and enjoy the sounds...... p.s. korn can't hold a candle to Primus' splendor"},{"rating":"1","title":"The armpit of Primus","review":"This album is 95% crap.I love Primus and own Frizle Fry and Seas of Cheese but this thing sounds about as good as screeching chaulk. It needs way more singing in most of the songs and almost none of them have choruses (which I find anoyying) Del Davis Tree Farm was one of the poorest excuses for a song I've heard and most of them weren't much better. The CD as a whole pretty much lacked the heavy bass beat from their older CDs. However Mrs. Blaileen and Southbound Pachyderm were OK and if you have unwanted guests at your home just pop in this CD and watch them run away! Works like a charm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta love Primus.","review":"Even though I'm a big punk fan, I cannot get enough of Primus. Tales From The Punchbowl is a pretty good album. I have to say, my favorite song on it is Hellbound 17 1/2, but no one agrees with me. Professer Nutbutter's House Of Treats is a great starting song, for 7 minutes of awesome bass lines. Wynona's Big Brown Beaver comes in with a slightly funk/rock feel, and makes you want to sing along. The Year Of The Parrot blew my mind when I first heard it... I dunno, you just don't hear 12/8 time in punk very often. Hellbound is just so catchy, I had to listen to it 6 times over when I first heard the CD. The album finishes strong with Over The Electric Grapevine. Overall, the album is good to listen to, but Pork Soda is still my favorite. Primus is great, so buy this CD if you are interested in songs that people are afraid to play on the radio. Maybe you'll like Hellbound 17 1/2 as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I enjoy some of Primus's music. Les Claypool's bass skills are funky and appealing.

I had no idea who or what it was. I read the song titles and was scared to death about what in the world it could be. Then I read the lyrics and was even more afraid. At first listening I thought it was 20 minute guitar solos and practically no lyrics. but I figured since I own the thing I should get to like it. Then it started getting to me. I now love the cd for it's unique style, the weirdness and for De Anze jig alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS LES CLAYPOOL'S BRAIN ON CRACK","review":"This is the worst Primus album, easily. Herb left the band right after the completion of this atrocity which says a lot about the state of the band. Tales is completely inaccessible(which is good in a way) but only because the music is incomprehensible. Claypool still manages to cram a nice amount of sick bass riffs in here, but the playing is uneven. Some of the tracks meander on for upwards of seven minutes and the lyrics are trademark ridiculous as always. Ler's guitar playing is scattered but brilliant in spots. This is definitely the low point of the Primus catalog. Thank God for Antipop, this is for hardcore Primus completists only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cd, but has some pitfalls...","review":"Well, by some, I mean 2.I find the opening two songs just sub-par for Primus to release on a cd, let alone be the openers.\\"Professor Nutbutter's House Of Treats\\" I never really liked this song no matter how many times I listened to it. Sub-par song, boring, and un-inspired\\"Mrs. Blaileen\\" is the other downpoint of the cd, convieniently placed right after Nutbutter. The song itself is very repetitve, and not very fun to listen to. Also pretty boring.Overall, the album is pretty solid.

The opening of the CD is especially like that. Les narrates the tales of classic characters that inspire fear, hate, pity, and love(sometimes all at once) such as the children of \\"Mrs. Blaileen\\", the seemingly perverted? Proffessor Nutbutter, good old Del Davis(who insures that 'There will be a bit more joy this holiday'with his tree farm), the characters of \\"De Anza Jig\\", Barrest Jefferies the tweeker and many others. I can relate to the characters in many ways good and bad and chances are you will too. The music is very dark, but it is still fun.

Both the book and Ferrara's review are poor, to say the least. The volumes of scientific research and accompanying data that are ignored or openly ridiculed is astounding not to mention disturbing for an academic. As an academic myself I have always been taught that honest research should take one wherever the evidence leads. Obviously, in the case of evolutionary science, that is not the situation. Instead, as evidenced by this text, if the evidence leads in another direction, the tact is to ridicule and present half or completely false evidence and write it up as authoritative.My advice, avoid purchasing this book.

I attempted to download songs to the card several different times and as soon as the last song would finish it would erase all other songs on the card an duplicate the last song numerous times! Then, when the card was removed from the player the player didn't recognize the internal memory! I contacted Intel and they came back and stated that they have had reports of this happening with SanDisk 64 cards since March. They had reports of every detail of the problem I experienced. I sent the card back and ordered a card from a different manufacturer that has no reported problems. Not impressed with SanDisk! In my opinion this card should not even be offered for sale until SanDisk sort out the issue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good times with Rap-Rock","review":"Injected is an album that you can't take seriously, and that's a good thing. My personal favorite is \`Me \`n Yer Girl.' I roll around laughing every time I hear the song. It reminds of my frat boy college antics. The rest of the tracks continue with the all out house party theme. Although the Phunk Junkeez don't get as much air time as the 90s Rap-Rock bands as 311 or Rage Against the Machine, the Junkeez are just as polished and talented. If you like this style of music, you will like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"I absolutely love this book. I work with parrots on a full time basis in an all-bird store. This book is right on target for beginnner bird owners. What I like about it is that it is comprehensive. It breaks down the different types of birds and discusses their personality traits, size, life span, talking ability (not a definite in any bird, but always a plus, and every bird is different), whether a bird is ok for an apartment or a house, and of course, everything from health and grooming to training. I have not found a book yet that does as much comparing between the species and makes it easy for beginner birders.

Jane Seymour is definitely one of the more under-researched and written about queens of King Henry the VIII and this book was very well researched in my opinion. I loved how the author integrated the facts with some fiction to give the information more body and context. This book talks more about Jane's childhood and how she came to be King Henry's third queen. I do wish that the author would have talked a little bit more about the end of Jane's life, her death, and the time leading up to it. That part of the book just seemed a little rushed to me.

But it's also the greatest garage-rock album of the '90s, and would have fit right alongside the Gories on the Crypt Records roster of the decade. For a 60+-year-old man, Andre's mind is strictly in the juvenile gutter, but at least he's a talented exhibitionist. References to sex (all types) abound, albeit with comparitively little obscenity. Two cuts especially, the obvious \\"Let Me Put It In\\" and the jealously apocalyptic \\"Everybody Knew,\\" make him sound like he's in physical pain.

I am a huge fan of Judith McNaught, Lisa Kleypas, Gaelen Foley...and Kinsale's books (I have now tried to read 3) are just a completely different style--unfortunately, not to my liking.

There are the obviously dated themes of the stepmother and sisters (notice how apparently a big nose and brown eyes make someone instantly ugly?) and the getting married after a few dances. But in addition to that, which I could have overlooked, is the fact that the book is simply poorly written. The illustrations are taken directly from the movie and are beautiful.

It will tell that there is a bus from Accra to Cape Coast but doesn't say where to get it, how much it costs, a time estimate, or even give the name of more than one bus company (and the one they listed is far from the best one in Ghana).

It is definatly the worse book that I have ever had to buy. First, it was mighty expensive for the quality of the writing/material. Second, the material within the book could have covered in a much better way. It was very difficult to understand because it travelled much to far into SNMP/RMON. I found it almost useless as a reference, because it did not cover anything in a way that was pertinant to actually using SNMP/RMON on a network. It lacked real world examples and uses.

Learn about SNMP basics, 2. Learn about MIB and some advanced concepts of SNMP like interaction of the SNMP manager with the agent. 3. Learn programming techniques of SNMP. 4. See how MIB,agent,device,NMS all interact together.I feel that this book has not satisfied the above 4 points. In fact this book is not for beginners. If you are new to Network management and want to learn about SNMP the defacto standard of network management, then this book is not advisable. This books talks pretty much at a higher level about concepts rather than talking about the SNMP basics and then guiding u thro higher concepts.If u r looking for good SNMP material, the net is the good reference. Goto (...) and search for MIB,SNMP etc and then u r certain to hit very good pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat Lee","review":"This is a wonderful product.

Alot of the songs sound the same with their guitar rhythms, and choruses. Many of the songs remind me of late 80's to early 90's hair band rip-offs. This album was downright boring, and could not keep my interest.Definitely not their most creative album to date. Disciple needs to start being more diverse with their music, and style. Sounds like they are starting to run out of musical ideas by sticking with their current style."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should be ashamed!","review":"As I write this review, I'm listening to track 15 on Disciple's By God CD. If you are familiar with the song, you will understand my review title. With their latest product they seem to have forgotten the words Jesus or God. Are they now ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus? They said they would preach his name for the love, not the fame. What a dissapointing turn around in their mission. Now they are just another band. I hope they see the error of their ways and return to their original message, method and boldness."},{"rating":"1","title":"All good things...","review":"When i listened to this album online, I did not like the songs enough to buy the album, but I tried to convince myself that Disciple was making a natural progression and this album wasn't all that much different than the previous ones. Then I put \\"By God\\" into my CD player and realized there's no denying it... there's a fire and intensity on By God, and on the other albums, that is not present in this new album that reeks of a recording studio and circling record execs. Sure, some of the songs are catchy and pretty, but Disciple did not garner a following by being catchy or pretty.I am sorry to see a band that never caved in to record execs finally do so. All good things must come to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"UMMM...YEAH THIS CD ROCKS!!!","review":"This cd is a must have in your collection.

I must admit that at first I wasn't sure if I liked it, or if it lived up to my expectations after Disciple's brilliant last release \\"Back Again\\", but now I just can't stop listening to it. Well done Disciple. God is clearly blessing your ministry in music more and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better Christian releases in a long time","review":"I think this was a very good CD. Classic Disciple fans be warned there different. They used to be metal and sounded like Demon Hunter, Killswitch Engage, and Blood Has Been Shed, now there just hard rock like Shinedown, Audioslave, and Skillet. Personally I enjoy the change. They were just a above average metal band but there a great Hard Rock band. I think this was a very good CD but theres still room for improvement, but I'll give em' a break since its there first CD of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed disciple fan","review":"i have been a disciple fan for years i have the preivous 4 cd,s and ep so i think i can give a honest assement of this cd.I totally agree with the reviewer below what has happened to disciple i don,t want to be negative but disciple just sound like a lot of other christian bands such as pillar etc.I just love the previous cd,s back again and by god where the music was awesome and the lyrics bold,and were not afraid to mention the word jesus in the songs instead of you.I know they want to reach out to a larger audience but at the price of sounding like other bands.Let,s hope they get back the heavier sound on the next cd a disappointed fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed Disciple Fan","review":"I have to say that I am disapointed in this album and do not plan to buy it. Not only is it an extreme departure from their earlier sound but I am also disapointed in the lyrics. On their previous cd's you knew that they were singing about Jesus Christ our Lord. With what I have heard of this I am concerned that the band is only trying to catch onto the radio friendly craze and I am disapointed that they have lost faith in their message from the earlier cd's sound. I applauded their previous sound because it took real guts to make the honest stand that they were."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best hard rock CD I've heard in a long time","review":"I'm a regular purchaser of new rock and hard rock CDs by both Christian and not-so-Christian bands. This CD by Disciple is a stand-out, a notch above most other rock CDs released in recent years.Compared with their previous efforts, this CD is noticeably more melodic, and that's a good thing -- because as it turns out, they're GOOD at it! Even though this may be the first CD many people hear from Disciple (due to a wider distribution deal), it obvious that Disciple has been doing this a long time (10 years!), and knows how to do it right. This is no debut CD by some copycat band who hasn't found their niche yet.If you are a fan of Hard Rock with loud guitars, gritty rock vocals, fast and furious songs with catchy, stuck-in-your head hooks and melodies, this CD is right up your alley. This CD reveals Disciple at the top of their game. Not many bands do it better than them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disciple will Rise Up","review":"This CD is Amazing Disciple has captured a fresh new sound that combindes the elements of Rock.Metal and Grunge this CD Reminds Me allot of Pillar's Where Do We From Here and Skillet's Collide CD's but without sounding like a total Rip Off of either this CD takes Disciple to the next Level and also it's on a new LabelA (SRE Recordings) both for the band and the public and with this Label suport and backing it take Disciple to a new Audience of Christian Music Fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"I found \\"The Everything Magic Book: Everything You Need To Amaze, Baffle and Entertain Your Friends (Everything Series)\\" to be a very informative book.

I had always heard great things about this book, that anyone interested in learning profound truths about what makes a good novel and how a novel works needs to read this. I must say that I found the text challenging and had a difficult time grasping the points E.M. Forster was making. I got the parts about the story and the plot fairly well. However, the sections on fantasy, prophecy, pattern and rhythm were somewhat more difficult to digest. Perhaps one needs to read a few more novels, or read them with more attention, to fully comprehend all of Forster's points - the traditional once-over of high school and college literature gruel will not do. I will probably re-read this after reading some of the works Forster uses as examples to get more out of this book, which has been hailed as a classic on the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"<yawn>","review":"I've tried for the fourth time to read this book.

In the story, an amateur sleuth (Christine Bennett, an ex-nun) solves the disappearance of a beloved priest by delving into past secrets. She is helped by the moral support of her husband and friends from her former convent, all wholesome types with no character defects.In keeping with the tone of the plot, the ex-nun's unworldly point of view is projected onto other characters, who cannot bring themselves to speak of certain happenings. They impede the investigation until they finally speak up, and the mystery is solved.While this book will appeal to some readers, I only gave it one star for its writing style.

I'm a die-hard fan of Michael Jackson. this is a movie where you cheer, shed tears, clap along to the beat, get your grove on, and scream your lungs out. We are not allowed to do any of that in a theater are we? but trust me once this movie starts you cant get enough of his music. all your childhood dreams flows right in to you mind with his moves. you feel like get on your feet and dance along.I'm getting a copy of this because \\"this is it, this is really it, this is the final curtain call...\\"Love you Michael Jackson, you will always be in our hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it","review":"This is EXCELENT and could only be from Michael Jackson the number one icon that will live forever in our hearts.

I loved the way he guided the dancers, the band and the singers into believing and feeling the way he did about his songs. And the way he kindly gets on us about the way we are ruining the earth. Wish I could see a clearer picture of his face, I know he's older, but I'd have love to see his face clearer. Michael usually always ended his concerts with Man In the Mirror and every time the movie gets to that part I start crying, because it is a confirmation that he is not here, physically, on earth with us.

Wow did he still have it. He danced and sang as if he was a much younger Michael. What I really enjoyed was to see how nice he was to everyone. There were times you could see he could get frustrated, but never once did he take it out on the crew. It was just great. Brillant man he was when it came to music and what people wanted to see. This concert would have been insane. It's sad it never got to happen. Oh yeah.... The dancers in this DVD are excellant as well. Great job. They seemed like kids in a candy store dancing and watching Michael."},{"rating":"2","title":"L.O.V.E. this movie","review":"I loved this movie/documentary.

The amount of attention Michael devotes to detail, color, moves, music, dance, story telling plus the bonus that this whole production was an out growth of his wanting to leave a legacy to his 3 children on his tour capabilities, will leave you absolutely breathless. He was indeed a ONE of a kind legend in his own time. There's lots of bonus materials on the life, hits, music videos and achievements of Michael Jackson including those that were not a part of the original 2009 movie theater performance on the BD format. Also last but not least, the 5.1 surround sound will give your entertainment center a real workout and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I sat down last night and watched this montage of Michael Jackson. I was glued to the tv.All I could think was what a talented man this was and what a waste that he is dead. He should be entertaining people for many more years.This film did show that he was in shape, dancing with people half his age and most certainly keeping up with them if not surpassing them.Not much more to say than it was good, gave insight into his creative genuis and made us realize how much he will be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is It","review":"What can I say?

This video showed the tremendous Talent Jackson & his team had in putting together a great show. I hadn't realized what all the 'hoopla' was about by Jackson Fans, but now I see he was a very talented performer. \\"This is it!\\" is an excellent video not only demonstrating his Talent, but also his very caring nature.

She and her family have really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Surprise","review":"I own a couple of M.J's early solo recordings, and of course who didn't love The Jackson 5. I was recommended this DVD and got to borrow it from the Library. I enjoyed it as I had never seen MJ in concert. He was a charismatic performer in the league of Mick Jagger and James Brown.I watched the DVD with the subtitles on because even though I knew MJ was a fantastic singer, I could never understand his lyrics. Oh My God they have got to be some of the worst lyrics I've ever heard! Not GENIUS material. He did allot of repeating a certain phrase over and over. \\"Dance in the Round\\" \\"Annie Annie Annie\\" . I never listened to him after he got way crazy with the plastic surgeries and other exploits. He was such a good looking guy. He really did not want to look like Papa Joe.Rest In Peace Michael, if you are really dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Jackson's \\"This Is It\\" DVD","review":"I was heartbroken that the \\"This Is It\\" Tour actually was it for M.J. I think he looked good, he looked like M. Jackson would at that point in his life. We grew use to seeing his physical changes, and there were those of us who enjoyed his musical changes. This Is It is a must have for Michael's fans for it showed us where he was going with his future had he been allowed to have one. Blessed Be Michael, you will be remembered always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Jackon is the Greatest Performer of All Time!!!","review":"This was so hard to watch because you just know what a truly awesome concert it would have been.

The Jackson family cares about money and not Michael."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure hype...nothing else.","review":"It was a 'behind the scenes' of what could've been. Michael Jackson was entertaining to watch. His songs were hits. That's it. People claiming Michael Jackson was a life-changing force must consider looking at themselves first. It doesn't help that people are so quick jump on the band wagon and deify him.Michael Jackson was just a guy doing what he enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Know it's Bad, Shamon, Really, Really Bad","review":"Another sad example of selling even the dead, a rehearsal sold as a great show. He was an above average dancer and singer (not a great voice compared, lets say to Marvin Gay or Stevie Wonder), with a rather limited production of true hits, the Beatles for example wrote, produced and hatched 20 albums from 1964 to 1969. NOBODY WROTE FOR THEM. Save your money. These are old songs rehashed and not as cool as the old videos - maybe the \\"producers\\" should concentrate on a true remastered compilation of those on true HD picture and audio. Don't get me wrong he did a few good songs, but the amount was truly scanty compared to others in the same amount of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as seeing him live.","review":"I've seen him live and this was just ok. Not worth the money and not worth supporting his legal trust!Try to find a free boot leg of a concert some where and you'll get a better \\"tear\\" jerking experience.I only cried when i heard how much it cost.(got it as a present.) And ended up selling it for more than that. :-) (BONUS!)Don't waste you're money, rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Congratulations!","review":"Everyone that paid to see this movie is a winner of the coveted \\"Help Michael's greedy friends and all of the rich folks capitalize off of his death/possible murder\\" Award!!! In showing your financial support of this vile situation, you've helped support the people who helped to mold him into a the freak that he became. There's nothing wrong with wanting to see the movie, but giving people that cruel and greedy your hard-earned cash is a crime in and of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is it","review":"it was great, very good footage of the future concert that would have been.

As a fan of MJ for most of my life, it would have been a tragedy if I didn't watch this movie. I went to see it in the movie theater, then went home and bought the Soundtrack CD right after I got home and ordered the DVD the same night. Got my DVD 2 weeks ago and watched it again today. This is It would have been the greatest concert of all time. It's just too bad that MJ wasn't able to do even one night of this concert. I was actually hoping after the first 50 concerts in UK, that he would decide to a few here in the US. I am truly glad that they did this movie.

Like the recording his doctor made of Michael that they played in court, Michael could not make sense talking and he sure could not sing close to the end.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was a very objective documentary about the preparations for the concert and it really displayed an artist's dedication to getting things done well and right. It also showed some sides of Michael Jackson that I don't think much of the public is aware of these days. He was creative, a perfectionist, and but stern at times.

One really interesting aspect was the black and white of Rita Hayworth and the gangster three-D of him sliding down the stairs. How was that going to happen? He was the \\"Smooth Criminal\\" :-). He knew when to make songs \\"simmer\\" and to make his dancing \\"sizzle\\" to slow things down to make the crowd go wild.

The noise reduction is quite good.But still there's some downsides as well, as said in the review from websites. The live view is useful.(Like when you've to put the camera over your head or very low, etc)But there's a quite long delay when its doing the focusing job.And the people who wears glasses may find it quite hard to see in the viewfinder, may need to buy ME-1.Anyway..since there's a lots of opinions, I won't comment too much.but I would say its a great camera, and I'm loving it! =D(Sorry for the poor English.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the old SLR days","review":"I bought this camera after using a Olympus SP 500UZ which I liked very much.

Two things that are minor is the function button which is right there where you grab the camera and it gets pushed by accident.

You can set this camera to be as \\"manual\\" as you like, but the auto settings are very good. Even better, I can make adjustments to settings without my reading glasses on - they are large enough and intuitive enough to be able to do that. One word of advice: the camera did not come with storage media so make sure you order that when you order the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympus Evolt E510","review":"This is my first DSLR and its satisfies all my needs. ...so far. Ive read a lot of reviews, compared specifications and decided to buy this camera because it got pretty good features for a very reasonable price and the most important - the image quality, is just stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympus E-510","review":"This is an excillent camera(so underrated) and I also use a Nikon D-80, Fuji s100fs.The lenses are the only ones I am aware of that get updates by themselves over the internet with Olympus software. Features that are too numerous to list but the pictures are pristine. Any talk of lower dynamic range just do not show from my wildlife pictures and I have taken a lot for years. Started with an E-300 loved so much > E-500 loved even more and the bargain of all time the E-510. Build perfect quality and you know when holding. The lenses are not cheap but the 18-180mm may be the last lens you ever buy! Just a beautiful camera for almost \\"point and shoot\\" cash. Go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best choice for the price","review":"I switched from film SLR to digital and E-510 was my choice. I'm using it for 6 months and so far I don't regret it. The 14-42 kit lens had front focusing issues but Olympus repair service fixed it. The other kit lens (40-150) performs excellent.I'd like to see better dynamic range, but this is more film vs. digital issue than E-510 itself. I noticed increased noise at ISO400 and more. This is problem with most 4/3 cameras caused by smaller sensor size.I use it mostly in full manual mode, as this is the way I used my old film SLR camera.I upgraded to Zuiko 14-54 and 70-300, and with this combination I couldn't ask for more.In conclusion, E-510 is not perfect at all, but probably the best choice for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Satisfied With First SLR","review":"This is my first SLR camera and I have had it about a month now.

I just got the camera yesterday and I'm going pro again tomorrow. The IS really does work. I've been shooting everything around the house just to practice, and I finally have sharp photos again. I was once a pro and gave up due to a hand tremor. This camera is the answer to my prayers. I hate the fact that it is plastic, but for the price and features. I can live with it until Canon or Nikon adopt similar or better technology. The Canon and the Nikon are staying on the shelf as they have for many years now, or maybe going on ebay:) BTW customer support is by engish speaking people with great knowledge of the product even though it just came out.Kudos to Olympus for putting out a great product at an affordable price, must be why it is plastic:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this camera!","review":"I'm still learning how this camera works [just so much to do on it!] but i using it everyday. love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is upto my expectations, but settings is not that easy","review":"As a beginner in SLR cameras with so many variables, the E510 is not easy to set and get the shots right the first time.

The camera is well designed to hold, and the menus are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera - value for money","review":"The live-view and image stabilization features are really helpful.

Both lenses work really well and the images are super sharp. I haven't really used all the settings yet but the auto function works pretty well. The live view can sometimes give you a blurry result but i'd rather use the view finder.

Otherwise it's a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine Olympus product","review":"Camera specs are excellent for the price, I have an older very good E10, and Olympus has improved many things with this model, much lighter too. I was looking for a camera with image stabilization in the body of the camera, the sonic wave filter (like the E10) and one that had interchangable lenses. I like the larger CF memory (so I can't lose it as easily), plus they are available with more capacity than SD cards. I was hoping to re-use my FL40 flash but now I have to save for the newer FL50 to work with the 510. I also was a little dissapointed in the small veiwfinder, but the LCD screen is now much larger.

It's still a pain to comb through all of the hair strand by strand, but this comb does seem to grab the nits.

Much better than using the nasty chemicals on your children's head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"Wow!! This comb is worth its weight in gold! I have a teen daughter with incredibly thick, curly hair. She got head lice and we were overwhelmed. The comb that comes with the lice shampoo is a joke! After days of trying everything I could I finally decided that she would have to live with the nits until they grew out - I could not figure out how I could ever get all the nits out of her hair. As my last ditch effort I ordered this comb. When it arrived it took only 1 hour and I had removed hundreds of nits from her hair. It did not hurt her and it took a fraction of the time I thought it would. It grabs the nits and pulls them right out. Why do they not carry these in every drugstore??? If you have lice do not wait another minute to order this awesome comb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanity Saver","review":"I battled these pesky little buggers for three months. Both my kids had them and nothing was working. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this comb. Whithin a week we were lice free. I think I read every review on here before buying. It has saved my sanity!!! I used a lice shampoo on my kids and started combing. Be very methodical. I clipped their hair into sections. After every stroke with the comb, wipe it on a clean piece of tissue. Do every day for 10 days and then retreat with shampoo. My kids are two and five. They watched youtube while I combed. They actually were asking to do this every night so it was great to have cooperative kids. Also...shine a flashlight in the hair to become familiar with what the eggs look like. They vary in colour from white to dark brown so this way you can become familiar with what you are combing out. Good luck.

The biggest difference is this one did not hurt my daughter's head or pull out all of her hair; no tears :) It combed nicely, and appeared to get almost everything. The metal combs you buy at the store have too wide of gaps between the teeth; this one's are not too wide apart they are nice and close together. Cleaning the comb was a bit difficult at times, but overall not bad considering it WORKED! I boiled the comb after use, it was not destroyed so I will have it if I ever need it again. Overall a good deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not electronic, but extracts lice!","review":"I was initially annoyed, because of the packaging, which plays on the rumors of an electronic louse comb. This one is NOT electronic. But it is the best comb for removing lice and eggs from a head of hair. It'll still take you an hour or five, depending on the amount of hair. I'm more likely to just shave heads, and be certain that the lice problem is taken care of, but for those myriad who find that anathema, this is the best comb out there. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not remove nits","review":"This product did not work for my family. I really hoped it would. I used it on a section of my daughter's hair were I saw a couple nits. After several passes the comb pulled out a few hairs, but no nits.

In the end, using my eyes and fingernails is still the best way to remove the pesky nits."},{"rating":"1","title":"more damage than good","review":"I got the Rid kit and this comb. I saw a nit on my daughters hair (this is the white egg on the hair itself) and ran the comb through it and the nit was still there. Did this several times and the nit was still there. This comb did NOT remove nits. It was able to get the dead bugs out but so did the Rid comb, but maybe this got out more. I think the Rid comb that comes with the kit is less harmful on the hair itself. Is the damage to the hair worth the extra dead bugs? I'm not sure. The Rid comb was getting the dead bugs out too and not harming the hair nearly as much. Not sure what the other reviewers are raving about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Not as described, does not work waste of time money energy.

I work in a residential setting with children that sometimes get lice. I decided to buy my own comb because the ones they provide (SO many different types) are just annoying to use.Best features: GRIP. The grip is so nice. This thing won't fly out of your hand or break. Solidly constructed.With that said, there is nothing magical about this comb! You need a lot of elbow grease just like with any other. I don't think it kills the lice or \\"terminates\\" them. I don't think the jagged teeth destroy the nits like the product claims. You just have to comb them OUT with conditioner and then drown them in a bowl of water."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the others...","review":"well i like the fact that the tines on the comb are rubbery so the little buggers stick to it. What I didnt like was the silver color, you have to hold up to the light everytime to see what you've got or if its just drops of water (works best with very wet hari).

I had to read a lot on the internet and came upon a recommendation for this comb. The Amazon reviews were pretty good; so I bought it w/ overnight shipping because we were running out of our patience.And we combed their hair ONLY once -- using this method: [...] That was it. And their hair had tons of nits and live ones. I have never seen any product work this good in my life.

However, there was rust on the back side of the Terminator comb, in the tiny holes on the handle.Given my situation, I didn't have time to send it back so I have used it, anyways, but I hope that the seller reads this and sends me a new one! For $10, it should not arrive with rust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Get Nits Out of Fine Hair","review":"We were excited to try this comb, but found that it pulled out much more hair than the other nit combs we have. We could have handled that if it actually worked, but with my daughters' fine hair, the nits just stuck tight and slid right between the tines of the comb as we tried to get them out. We have yet to find a nit comb that can hold on to the nits and actually drag them off the hair shaft. This comb works fine for parting small sections of hair to look for the nits (just like any other comb), but is completely ineffective for removing nits if you are dealing with fine hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective, easy to use, durable","review":"Highly recommended, much better than the kind that comes within the lice shampoo boxes.

This and tea tree oil and olive oil worked.We also used the electric nit comb that zaps the bugs. But this comb was really what we needed in the first place. The spaces are so tiny it actually grabs every egg in the hair. I don't really understand why the shampoo kits don't include this comb or even sell this comb in a retail store. This comb was even better than the metal comb we bought at Sally's beauty supply store.... I highly recommend it. After weeks of checking for lice and reapplying shampoo and cream.

Works best after conditioner and with wet hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Product has been a lifesaver!!!","review":"[...], I have tried a few Lice Combs in the past on my girls.

The authors seem uniquely suited to their subject-matter and obviously know their stuff. But, while they try to cite passages from the books as much as possible, most of the material just doesn't apply. JK Rowling seems to have skimmed a volume like this, then put it into a blender and extracted her own take on it all. It's liable to make purists a tad angry. It's all very interesting in its own right, though.

Familiar with most of the mythological references introduced by Ms. Rowlings already (and often amused at her interpretations), I decided to track down this book for someone else's perspective on all the items that go into making up the fantastical Harry Potter world.The book offers the backgrounds behind many of the creatures, spells, and magical items of Hogwarts and beyond, from the mundane ghost to the esoterics of latin spells. Though I personally found the text to be a bit shallow in its treatment, for someone a bit younger the book is a perfect introduction to the basis for the magic of Harry Potter. For those who are unaware of the real mythological identity of creatures like basilisks or the working of hexes, this book is informative and fun--just don't expect to use it as a serious reference tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for research papers on Harry Potter","review":"I purchased this book to write a research paper for a class- it was excellent and clearly had all the information that i needed for the paper- plus it is very interesting to see all the backround history, mythology etc that has gone into the harry potter series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Breif Encyclopedia","review":"I do like the book, very interesting indeed.Although I am still waiting for a book that talks especifically about Harry Potter's characters and sites.

My minor issue is repeated by other reviews. I bought it in spite of these previously mentioned \\"pic lovers\\".

I carefully followed the directions on several recipes in different sections of the book, and did not like the results. The prepared foods from this book did not have much flavor from the listed ingredients.I made the Sesame Nothing cookies and tossed them because they tasted flat from the listed ingredients and not worth eating. The meatloaf potato kugel wasn't anything special. The stir fried beef and broccoli was lacking in flavor before I added additional ingredients to make it more tasty. The only recipe that was okay was the Hummus and even that had to be spiced up with some extras that I added. The tips for using food processor which are noted in the book can be found in an owner's manual of most food processors. in short, skip this book and buy a good cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - This is a Kosher cookbook - not for everyone.","review":"I give this one star only to bring the deceptive write-up to your attention. If you are looking for great sausage, pork loin, rib recipes or anything involving non-Kosher foods, you will be sorely disappointed. Even though this is called a \\"Bible\\", it is really only for this ethnic orientation. I bought this without realizing its bias. It is better to buy a book that has everything and then not make items that you do not wish to eat than have the author pre-determine your food choices based on their personal religious predilection. The write-up here on Amazon does not disclose this severe shortcoming. To that end, I suggest this other link. This is a far superior book. Thanks, and enjoy your food processor to its fullest.650 Best Food Processor Recipes"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Food Processor Bible","review":"This is an OK book. I liked the simple recipe for potato pancakes; it worked perfectly and it is a type of food (a wet batter that blends potatos and onions) that can only be made effectively in a food processor. However, like the other food processor books I own, it focuses too much on sweets, from muffins to cakes--stuff that (1) you should never feed to children, unless you want to contribute to an addiction to sugar and to the national child obesity problem, and (2) you should never feed to adults over 40, given their propensity for adult health problems like high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels, not to mention fat arms, wide bottoms, and huge bellies. Counting only the recipe chapters in this book, about 40 percent of the text is devoted to sugary junk food. Just look at the people around you. A parade of fatties, tubbos, and heifers. Then ask youself: Do I really want to make Ms. Gilletz's \\"Dreamy Creamy Chocolate Cheesecake\\" tonight?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good start up book","review":"I am able to follow the recipes fairly easily.

I got this book for Christmas and so far it has been excellent. I really like how the recipes are unique and not just the same old but with food processor directions. My favorites so far are the minestrone and the spinach souffle. The one thing I wish it had was photos. All recipe books can gain from having photos of some kind. When it comes to food processing, it's nice to have a visual representation of the different consistencies and textures.Overall, great book but it'd be nice if there were images."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising...","review":"This book really should have been called \\"The Kosher Food Processor Bible.\\" Some of the recipes look pretty good (to be honest, I haven't tried any yet) but I was really put off by the fact that entire categories of food I enjoy (shellfish, for example) were missing. And calling for margarine instead of butter may be appropriate for kosher diets, but it's not good nutritionally or in the culinary sense.

The best thing I like about ordering books through Amazon is that they come in perfect condition. At book stores, people look through them and they look used.

When he's not pursuing rich married women, he's \\"borrowing\\" from the Housekeeper he has promised to marry.One of the \\"cousins\\" is Mae Busch in an early role. Known better as \\"Mrs. Hardy\\" or L & H's nemesis in many Laurel and Hardy films, it's fun to watch her strut her stuff: the character is similiar to the one from \\"Chickens Come Home\\", from about 10 years later.Great sets, costumes; interesting camera angles; tintype effect.

As I watched the rich black and white images, it seemed as if I were looking at an album of old photographs which came to life.I'm buying a copy of this movie because I'm intrigued by the furniture, the use of everyday articles of the 1920's, and the formal dress.

When it came in the mail, I immediately plugged it into my iPod. I was surprised how loud the speakers actually were. The only draw back for me is that you can't max out your volume on your Ipod or mp3. If you max out the volume, the speakers won't play. You have to lower your volume just a few notches.

But there is an issue about this, I have an Ipod touch and the output inpendance is 32 Ohm and this speaker is 8 Ohn, which means this will drain too much current from the Ipod and may damage it. I would like to know if someone uses this Sony speakers with the ipod touch and how is doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped....","review":"After looking at the generally positive reviews, I thought that these speakers would be good for me as I'm not demanding on rich bass and hi fidelity. All I wanted was a booster speaker to use at work with my smartphone. I'm a low voltage installer and sometimes have to stand in front of panels and terminate large amounts of wire for hours. All I wanted was a portable speaker that would boost my phone's music player to a more listenable level without chewing through batteries day after day. These are well made with good construction, solid weight, and I love the way the cord stores. They are also the perfect size to slide in with my tools to be convenient. The only problem is that they aren't even as loud as the speaker on my Blackberry! Way too quiet! The sound quality is a little thin, but its fine. I just wish they were louder. After all, aren't you supposed to be able to HEAR speakers?? For me, they were a waste of money and will never be used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"Sound is very clear for the price.

But the primary reason I purchased this was for its portability, lack of clutter (short wire connection), and no need for batteries. For those reasons, it does the job great. It is well constructed, which is no surprise from Sony.If sound (esp. volume) is important, then getting a battery powered speaker is probably a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice simple solution","review":"Kid was using phone speaker to listen to music in different rooms when drawing.

This feels nice and heavy, the one wire is only about a foot long (maybe less). There is no volume control and the volume is only a slight bit louder than the speakers in my ancient laptop.

I couldn't understand the way they were feeling, and sometimes I couldn't understand why they were feeling that way. The book also has no dramatic points in it, the plot was very weak. Some positive things about the book are that it is an easy book to read. The grammer usage is appropriate for the book. Sometimes you have to reread parts of the book to understand it.

Emily (main character) is a young girl at the age of 14 and has a pretty boring life. Ola (grandmother) makes the family move because of deaths in the family and hurt feelings. I think Toning The Sweep was kind of boring but had some good points about young people's lives. Emily has to deal with this death, and in doing so, she learns about the desert. I liked the fact that she is in the desert but I felt this book was missing something. I thought it should have some bigger climax scene.

I think the diana justneed to catch up with her mother, and she wanted her daughter to learn more about her mother and to have her mother and daughter to spend time together.so she colud learn more about her faily histoy, i think that is why she was video tape was for i don't think it was more than a tape for her grandmother buti i help her get to know her grand mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toning the Sweep","review":"Toning the Sweep, by Angela Johnson, in my opinion, was not an exciting book. Itdid not catch my attention. There was no climax in the plot. The only dramaticthing is Ola's pain, which is not too interesting because people go through pain allthe time. David and Martha's character's purposes were not apparent to me.There were many parts I did not understand. I would not recommend this book toanyone I know. I would not have chosen to read this book for pleasure. In the end,when Mama (Diane) and Emily, her daughter, tone the sweep together to sendEmily's grandpapa's spirit to heaven. It seems too late but at least they can finallybe pacified with it. The plot in this book was rather vague."},{"rating":"1","title":"The not so good story of a girl, her mother and grandmother","review":"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I thought that Toning the Sweep was a good quick read if you are able to deal with boring chapters where nothing really ground breaking or important happens. If I had had a choice I would not have read this book at all. I think if I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 5 I would give it a 2 since it wasn't that that good of a book in my opinion. I kept waiting for the book to get good but it never did =(!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"},{"rating":"2","title":"It fixed my microwave","review":"This product worked as advertised and repaired my Whirlpool Gold micro.Just like the original one it replaced.

The art work is varied, fascinating and so appropriate...and just darn beautiful! I can't recommend this enough as a gift for a special young person in your life.

It's a multilayered book, and a thoughtful reader will discover more each time they open its pages. The illustrations and text in \\"Dream\\" have a simple level for younger readers, but teens and adults will see other layers through the symbolism and metaphor that speak to the heart and spirit. Two pages at the rear of the book discuss many of the layers of meaning. This is an amazing book and I highly recommend it as a gift for occasions like a birth, birthday, or grad."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I purchased several of these books as high school graduation gifts based on recommendations.

I mean.. it has maybe 4 good songs... and the rest are sorta \\"fillers\\".. But this is an EP, so it makes sense. Think about this. Other reviewers are saying that this album is a flop. I truely believe that this album set up for what was to follow. He released this album for a reason. Could you imagine \\" Sweet Dreams \\" on Antrichrist Superstar (after) or Potrait Of An American Family\\" (before)? It just wouldn't fit. This is an album for open-minded people. If you only like \\"Sweet Dreams\\" then just get the Live cd or Greatest Hits. I think this album is awesome. Weird sounds... bitchin' moms... you could imagine the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells like Children","review":"This album is worth getting if you liked the song dope hat because it has two remixes. Some of the songs on this album were filler uppers. I didn't listen to the hands of small children more than once. If you understand the skits some of them are pretty funny. Sweet Dreems was worth the money I paid for this c-d alone. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Manson's Best Work!","review":"This album really is quite poor for the multi-talented singer. With the exception of Sweet Dreams (are made of this), Dance of the Dope Hats and Rock & Roll ... there is nothing I can recomend. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Manson fan, it's just that you're better off keeping your money for albums like Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death).All of which are truely worth of being called Marilyn's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERPRICED!","review":"What? This is just a bunch of talking! Sure, the songs are good, but this CD as a whole is only worth half the price.

But on the other hand, there are some must haves that make this album awesome, remake of \\"Sweet Dreams,\\" \\"Rock 'n' Roll Nigger\\" and the acustic remake of \\"Cake and Sodomy\\", \\"White Trash,\\" played by Tony Wiggins (it's very funny, he puts on a southern accent and everything.)I have to admit that I liked this album much better before I got POAMF, (see reasons above) This album also has some very weird stuff on it, like the skit, \\"F*** Frankie\\" which I do not understand the joke behind it, so you'll be as clueless as I.But don't get me wrong, MM is my favorite band ever, and I have all their CDs, but it's not the greatest of the lot. So I guess in conclusion, only get this album if you love MM, if you're just starting out with them, then start with \\"Mechanical Animals\\" you'll totally fall in love after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is like the dark side of a soul.","review":"it appeals to the part of anyone who is fascinated not disgusted by vampires, interested in exploring the darker side of human nature. it creates a feeling of crushing pain and horror, but overlaying it with a sense that darkness can be a lot of wicked fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!!!","review":"This cd is good, but it needs more songs with words in them. A lot of them are just songs without words. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" is awesome so is \\" Rock and Roll Nigger\\"!! They are awesome songs! Trust me, I have every one of Manson's cd's and a few dvd's. The music vidoes are way awesome! They are all worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marilyn Manson's worst album, but it has it's good ones","review":"Don't get me wrong, Marilyn is a very good artist, but what happened with this cd? I have all of Marilyn's cds but once I got this one and popped it in, it made me think, where is the good Marilyn music I bought this for? This cd does have a few good songs on it, but nothing that is not on another one of his cds. I'd recommend downloading what you want off this or previewing it before purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not His Best","review":"This one is not as good as other works. In fact may be the worst album by Manson. \\"I Put A Spell On You,\\" \\"The Hands Of Small Children,\\" and \\"Sweet Dreams\\" are the beauties here, but the rest pale in the realm of Manson music. I would recommend \\"Portrait Of An America Family\\" or any other fine work by this master poet."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't Portrait","review":"POAF is much better than this crap! (I know, not helpful). But cover EPs shouldn't be allowed in sophomore albums. Why? It doesn't show their REAL talent. This is mainly shock value, with one good cover: THe one of \\"Sweet Dreams.\\" But it's real freaky at the end, for anyone who hasn't heard it, but I bet you have.I used to be scared of him because his cover for \\"I Put A Spell on You\\" hurt my ears so bad. Every song here that's not a remix is a cover. Actually, a couple of tracks are funny. But I like some of the remix, but those choppy sounds are just pure irritating!However, a few tracks hold my rating back from a one and have made me think twice.I ONLY RECOMMEND THIS TO MANSON DIEHARD FANS. I like POAF and LTOE. Also, Holy WOod, his latest. But this will not be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a great combo of Black Sabbath and Marilyn!","review":"Even though the first three tracks reek, the other twelvetracks are excellent and Sweet Dreams (are Made of this )\\" aregreat tracks!

All the \\"non-musical\\" sequences (which are the bigger part of the album) create a dark, heavy, dense, almost impenetrable atmosphere of pain, decay and delusion. Not recommendable for the straight-music fans, this album is a must-have for every lover of the musical experimentalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite work from Manson.","review":"This is my least favorite work from Mr. Manson to date, because its made up of filler tracks, Skits, and a few cover songs. If this would have been the first manson CD I ever listend to. I would not be a fan.What earns this disk its star is Mr. Manson's the very good cover of Sweet Dreams. If your new to manson I would suggest you get \\"The Sweet Dreams\\" single or the \\"The Last Tour on Earth\\"(Live)CD.

I agree with Jackson, this is awful, rap is 1000000 times better than this crap. Rappers like Tupac have messages that have actually helped people, Manson is a stupid albino who does nothing but whin about hating god, suicide, drugs, oh my god that's so sad, excuse me whilst I wipe a tear from my eye.

Just hold a Microphone up to his head and you will hear one those songs. Then the rest is some crappy covers that are all crap. Don't buy this album.

This one focuses on Sinbad and the Duke, two stray cats in New York City who are suspicious of but intrigued by the the \\"civilized\\" members of the Cat Club. Each cat in the series is given a distinct personality and, although the books were written some time ago, the stories are not at all dated. We first introduced our daughter to them when she was in kindergarten, and she still enjoys them as a 10-year-old tween. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"Long lasting and cleanable, a filter can't be much more efficient than that.

It improves the sound of the engine from about 4,000 rpm and up, it makes the engine a little smoother accelerating in low gears, but it doesn't add any noticeable power. It improves fuel economy noticeably, and just for that and that I don't have to pay for new filters, it is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective replacement for stock filter","review":"I bought this filter for my 2006 Honda Civic Si. There's no difference in power, although it does sound slightly louder. It's a perfect fit in the existing airbox, and the installation takes about 2 minutes.The only tricky part about the installation is the windshield cowl that sticks over the engine bay, but no fault to K&N; for Honda cramming everything into a tiny engine bay.The filter is washable, which means you won't have to buy a new filter ever again.I also noticed a slight (1-2mpg) increase after installing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Filter Changes!","review":"Every time I get an oil change, the mechanic will go over the maintenance they recommend and I love hearing them say, no air filter because of the K&N.....

But Li Yu-ning and colleagues give us Chinese women explaining their own history and their sources of inspiration. The various essays explore traditions starting in the age before warlords, made by village matrons, wise women, and rebel leaders. They present a women's counterculture that has always been there, and is growing stronger. I was especially fascinated to read the account of Chang Mo-chün, a leader in the anti-footbinding movement. She was inspired as a girl by a local statue of the goddess Guanyin (Kuan Yin), who had unbound feet, and was the female savior of the universe.--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization"},{"rating":"2","title":"Friendly & interesting book","review":"Outrageous Questions is a handy book for any parent, educator, historian or student.

If you have an older Dodge pickup, and the cables haven't failed...they are probably about to. Mine did.After wasting a trip to the junkyard to find replacements I ordered these. I wish I'd done that first and saved all the diesel. These things are really well made and seem to be better quality than the junk that failed. Price is right also.P.S.

Each of the forty chapters in this compact book leads the reader into a specific theme by way of brief prayers and readings. While a chapter might only take 5 minutes to read, it could also be used as an introduction into quiet meditation or a facilitated reflection with a small group. McGill suggests how the book might guide the reader through 40 nights of retreat. However, each chapter can stand on its own. I have found this book to be a wonderful resource when planning prayers for small gatherings."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Sugar Content","review":"Blue October shine on their debut with shadows of Erasure looming large. They score big on \\"When You Leave,\\" \\"Believe,\\" and \\"Incoming,\\" which are all sublime examples of what synth-pop should be>>>songs that are catchy, melodic, full of smooth refrains and choruses. Also with the mix a couple of warm ballads to touch the heart in \\"Safe\\" and \\"Slowburn\\" complimented by a nice Flamenco style guitar riff. A couple instrumentals and mediocre moments slow things down a tad, but overall a good CD, containing all the filter sweeps and exotic bleeps fans of this genre of music love.

The book is poorly written, and does not convey its message in a clear and concise manner. I have had to re-read several passages, and still can't make sense of them. I have also found that when trying to solve the problems at the end of the chapter, I have not had great success in finding the assistance I need to solve them by going back to the reading. The examples are not very well written, which makes it that much more difficult to solve the problems. This may be a good text book to supplement a live lecture, but it is not a good book for online classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feedback","review":"An uplifting and beautiful DVD.

Call me disappointed.","review":"I purchased this item based on positive reviews, but sadly am pretty disappointed. The individual rings keep popping open, spilling belts all over the closet floor. The rings don't seem to be sturdy enough to handle more than a few lightweight belts per ring. The description says it can hold up to 40 belts?? Unfortunately, not the case for me.I was excited to try this new belt holder, but think I will be going back to the large single ring style (had to dig it out of the Goodwill box). Old style is inconvenient, but it actually holds the belts without coming apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evriholder round belt holder","review":"Great organizer for hanging belts. Lets you colorize and separate while spreading the weight across hanger bar.

Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Belt Holder - VERY Practical and Attractive","review":"I am very pleased with this item...you can group your belts by size or style and have easier fast access to them unlike having a single ring when you have to take off all the belts to get to one...you only have to take off a couple and the rings are strong and secure. This is a great buy and I highly recommend this product. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bised and obsolete","review":"This volume, an update of an earlier work by the late Peter Bebblewaite, is little more than an obsolete exercise in wishful thinking by the Catholic radical left. For the book to be at all relevant, it needs to be updated again, to reflect the changes in the College of Cardinals (fairly significant in the last few years). Even such an update would do little to further recommend it, as there are other, more recent and less biased works on the same subject.Give this one a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile reading","review":"The most interesting part of the book for me was the first half where past conclaves in history are discussed. Some of the history is really fascinating. Although the tone of the book optimistically predicts a less severe papacy next time around, there is little evidence presented to back this up. The criticisms of John Paul II, while quite accurate, do little to help us understand who we might expect as the next pope. It is a well written book and very readable, but as time continues to go by and the current pope continues to live, the latter section on potential popes becomes less and less relevant due to the age restriction and deaths. Still, there is enough here to recommend a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I love how McNaught's books are long enough for a few twists and turns. This book had everything I want in a novel. They meet, have a clandestine affair, then scandal, then they don't see each other for awhile, then they meet again, after a struggle they fall in love, then they're torn apart with another scandal, then they find love again. Halfway through the book they were in love and other writers would have just slapped \\"the end\\" on it, but McNaught let us enjoy the same engaging couple for another couple hundred pages with a nail biting twist. There were a few times I laughed out loud too. Very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This book is electric. Everything you want in a romance novel and more. I can't tell you how good it is... because you have to read it to understand. Brilliant. Bullseye. You will read this book until the wee hours of the morning and than reread about two more times before you can let go of this memorable story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST of hers","review":"I read this book because of two reasons: First because JM is one of my fav. authors and secondly because all the reviews upon it. Unfortunately, I totally disaggre with them. I really disappointed and I barely READ the end of this story. The lady that she potrait in this story it doesn't fit with all the ladies'character that JM always put in her novels. Elizabeth is too weak, surrender herself to fast when it comes to Ian and her character totally out of my expectation. TWO THUMBS DOWN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars????","review":"I highly doubt it. This story was just so lame and predictable and cliched that I actually found it very tedious trying to finish reading it. It got 5 stars for what? I thought Elizabeth was so dense that I was actually almost annoyed with Ian for falling for her like a rock in the first place. She doesn't have the spirit of the other heroines in McNaught's other novels. I found a lot more scenes that confirmed her beef-headedness than her supposed sense and wit, and I'm surprised that Ian didn't see past her beautiful green eyes, blond hair, and \\"scholarly handwriting\\" to realize that he indeed married a ninny. Not to mention that she couldn't prepare liquid coffee to save her soul. As a whole, the plot and characters were just terrible! I don't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"remember when","review":"i am fond of judith mc naught novel,since i read her novel i always keep to secure some money to buy some of her novel.she is very inteliigent when it come to detailed the event of the places she gave the character justice,she is everything the author could be .................."},{"rating":"2","title":"I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time!

I SCOFFED AT ROMANCE NOVELS THINKING THEM FRIVOLOUS. A FRIEND GAVE ME \\"ALMOST HEAVEN\\" AND I LET IT SIT FOR A FEW WEEKS. BUT THAT ONE BOOK HAS CHANGED MY OPINION OF ROMANCES AND MY READING CHOICES FOREVER. JUDITH MCNAUGHT HAS THE ABILITY TO TRANSPORT YOU INTO THE STORY. THE CHARACTERS BECOME FRIENDS(OR ENEMIES)AND YOU FIND YOUR SELF TOUCHED TO THE CORE WITH EMOTIONS. ALMOST HEAVEN WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH, CRY, AND CHEER----AND MAKE YOU WISH THAT IT WOULD NEVER END. I EVEN WROTE TO JM LETTING HER KNOW HOW DEEPLY THIS BOOK TOUCHED ME. AND SUBSEQUENTLY, ALL OF HER BOOKS HAVE HAD THE SAME RESULTS."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in Heaven! One of the Best Historical Romances Ever!","review":"500+ pages just wizzed by. I could not put this book down. McNaught is a truly talented story teller. You'll laugh, cry, get angry and sigh numerous times in this book. This book and McNaughts Kingdom of Dreams are definitely the best historical romances I've ever read. McNaught takes you on a journey of the heart and soul. The ending is absolutely beautiful and touching.This is by no means fluff romance. Anyone who enjoys an intelligent romance will love this one. Get Julie Garwoods Ransom too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This is the first JM book that I have ever read, and I must say it was special. Some of the other romance authors play out a predictable story where the hero and heroine hate eachother all throughout the book and then love each other at the end. It's like, \\"Okay, that formula is getting old...\\" This book had it all. Instead, JM has her characters like eachother from the start. It was full of ups and downs, and JM writes it with class. Her characters seem real and you identify with what they are thinking and feeling. That is difficult for an author to pull off.If you have never read a McNaught book, and you are wondering if she is good, just try one! Like I said, this was the first book I've read, but I am sure to read all the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Just Doesn't Get Any Better Than This","review":"I delayed reading the epilogue for a full day because I just didn't want this story to end. It took me as long to read 2 chapters as it did 30. It is one of those stories, so perfect, that one is left with a sense of loss, of melancholy, when finished. Sheer perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Romantic Classic","review":"When I read this book for the first time I found it to be different from all other books I had read upto that point. The plot was more invoved and the characters more detailed. At the time I was around 15 years old and had been reading romances for a couple years (I am now 17). I re-read it and my opinion has changed not at all. The plot is more emotionally involved than the usual story. I fell in love with the characters all over again and I look for that feeling on other books now. The only fault I found was that it was rather long but if you enjoy it as I did the time hurries by.

This book has been one of my favorites for years. Have probably read it 3 or 4 times. Since there are so many reviews, I won't go into detail other than to say:There is a moment in most of her books when the man realizes he was a dumb jerk. Ian's light bulb moment was really spectacular and touching. The first time I read it, I cried. Not many books can do that to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely wonderful","review":"I thought this book was absolutely breathtaking. It felt as if you actually knew the characters. Not only did the book capture my attention from the very beginning but it held it all the way through and I found myself actually breathless in the last few chapters. I could not put the book down. I would definetely recommend this book to anyone who would love a great romance and since this is the first novel I've read from Judith McNaught, I can tell you it won't be the last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Written","review":"I first read this book about a year ago. Last week I pulled it off of the book shelf and read it again. It was just as good the second time around. It is a \\"wonderful\\" book! The characters are so real. Ian is the kind of man every women dreams about and Elizabeth is the perfect woman. Judith McNaught's writing keeps you riveted to each word, sentence, paragraph and chapter. When I got to the end of the book, I wanted more. I've put it away again and when I bring it down to read next year, it will be just as \\"wonderful.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed Till I Cried!","review":"Kingdom of Dreams made me cry. Almost Heaven made me do both. When Elizabeth cooked breakfast for Ian, I laughed so hard, tears came to my eyes. This is an excellent story with strong characters.

I found it delightful up until exactly page 425, when suddenly the man who was a \\"genius\\" couldn't put two and two together, (wife's brother is missing could appear at any time, wife runs off with mysterious stranger--get a clue!) and the woman who was so in love threw over every ounce of good sense, facts, and loyalty, to follow a worthless brother in a totally cruel and harebrained scheme. I lost all respect for either one of the characters, but especially her. I can forgive many things in a heroine, but disloyalty and stupidity aren't among them. And the ending is totally contrived--the simple characters and incredible plot are definitely more forgiving of our lovely and faithless heroine than I am. If this is what makes Ms. McNaught's works so glowingly wonderful, I will happily read not another one of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Squeeze your heart and make you laugh","review":"I fell in love with Ian and Elizabeth.

JM really puts this hero in a real light - he is charming, yet doesn't totally ignore his feelings for Elizabeth once he realizes how much she means to him. And Elizabeth is so strong - she fights for Ian until he realizes he can't live without her. She doesn't hide and wait for him to decide. I loved this book and hated to turn the last page - it is definitely a keeeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Mrs. McNaught's best","review":"I know alot of people may disagree with me, but I was quite disappointed with Mrs. McNaught's Almost Heaven. I found the story be a bit unbelievable, the characters somewhat uniform, and the whole love plot to be stagnet. I didn't enjoy the approach Judith took with her previous characters: The Duke and Duchess of Hawthrone were former shadows of their orginal personalities. I also found her new heroine and hero to be shallow and undescript. There really was no depth with their relationship. I must convey that it was indeed sad for me to write this review since Judith McNaught has always been one my favorite writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will it ever end???","review":"This book just seems to go on and on forever. Ive read other books by this author and had no problem with them but this one just dragged on and on. The heroine was a unappealing teenager who was too naive and too innocent and whose only redeeming quality was that she could shoot well, could tend a garden and could turn heads (male of course). The hero wasn't well developed and came across as bland. There wasn't much chemistry between the two and, aside from their physical passion, they had very few qualities between them to make a solid relationship.I'm not quite sure why I finished the book. I guess I hate not reading to the end. But it took me a while. Definitely not like others that I inhale in a day! Definitely not her best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Disappointed","review":"whenever I read a Judith Mcnaught novel, it simply has all the element ones needs to enjoy the book.One can easily go from laughing out loudly, to sadness, to frustration, to joy and finally happily ever after.It's these feelings that make it so real and worthwhile.Her writing is so maturely written that one can always be assured of getting their money's worth.Since the synopsis of the novel as been adequately written by other reviewers, there isn't any need for me to repeat it here.This book is definitely a page turner as with all of her other historical novels I have had the upmost honour to read.The book is certainly worth so much more than 5 stars.Awesome Read!!!!!

Ian Thorton has no peers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Judith MacNaught is absolutely wonderful!","review":"Believe it or not, I've read all of her published novels and short stories at least 8 times. I've been reading them since I was 11. They're absolutely dreamy and wonderful. Everytime I finish one, I get a warm fuzzy feeling that doesn't really go away for about a week. I like Nora Roberts and Amanda Quick and Julie Carwood too, but she's the best. I want to thank her for many hours of happy readings. Hope she comes up with a new book soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judith McNaughts best romance ever!","review":"I loved this book. The first time I read was when I was in college. I needed something to read while I was home on my Christmas break. Needless to say I spent most of my holiday break searching for all of Ms. McNaught's books. She is without a doubt the best romance writer I have ever read! Her books make you laugh, cry and fall in love with the characters. You almost hate for the book to end because you'll miss the characters so much!

Not being a great poetry fan. The reason for only 4 stars is that he seems to be fonder of dialect than I am. Many of the verses provoked deep emotion. & the price was right $0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite up to par","review":"We ordered this footrest along with the Brummi Kettrike. The quality of the cycle is fantastic and we expected the same from the footrest. However, the footrest does not stay in place which causes the wheels to \\"lock up\\" while we are pushing, which lurches the bike and my child forward. I e-mailed the folks at Kettler and they had no real suggestions as to how to resolve the problem. Unless this item works better on different Kettrikes, I would not spend the money for this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"We agree with Wendy - don't waste your money. The method used to attach the footrest to the Ketrike is a belt that goes around the main bar of the trike. After buckling the belt and tightening, it'll work until the child puts any amount of pressure on the footrest. The belt easily loosens and the footrest digs into the wheel/pedals, causing the trike to stop abruptly - which is a pain for both the child riding and the parent pushing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work properly","review":"We've had the same problem with the footrest locking up the trike and lurching our child forward. We took the trike to the toystore where we purchased it and the sales associate is going to contact Kettler to see if they can resolve the issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea but doesn't work with the Alana Kettrike","review":"This item seems like a great idea, but it should be noted that it does not work with the Alana Kettrikes, the ones that come in pink and white. I assumed that all the Kettrikes had the same steering system, but this is not true. I wish I had known that prior to buying both the trike and the footrest, but I am still a fan of the bike overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in Theory","review":"We purchased the Kettler Lil-Toote Kettrest to use with our daughter's Radio Flyer tricycle after reading that it would be compatible....however when we received it,we damaged it just trying to install it. Good idea to make a footrest for little ones, but Radio Flyer needs to make one for their own tricycles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounded like a good idea but not needed.","review":"The footrest sounded like a good idea to keep our 14 month old's feet off the ground, but she quickly figured out how to keep them up and now on the pedals. The footrest does a good job of transforming the trike into a stroller, but we use the trike to learn and have fun, hence the footrest went on once and came off after the first trip, and will not be used in the future. I'd skip the footrest, unless you need it for some reason. A horn, bell, and basket are all great add ons for the Trike though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need better descriptions.","review":"I gave this product two stars because I never actually got to use it, but love the concept. The footrest only works with certain Kettler bikes that have the free wheel system, which the bike I ordered doesn't have. It would have been useful if that was mentioned in the description of the product as I wouldn't have had to go through the return process. Am very happy with all of Amazon's sevices."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Young Gods - \\"L'Eau Rouge","review":"The Young Gods are Swiss experimental-rockers who formed in Geneva during 1985. The Young Gods use classical sampling, noise rhythms, guitar riffs, and drum machines to manufacture an indelible listening experience. An experimental sound influenced by classical compositions and visceral power-punk. Overdriven guitar chords are heavily sampled in \\"Rue Des Tempétes\\" with vocalist Franz Treichler providing the lyrical content. Listen for the Parisian beauty of \\"Charlotte\\" and \\"La Fille De La Mort\\". \\"L'Eau Rouge\\" is a critical album with abrasive and assaultive sound structures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This is a great read for anyone who is going on a vacation or just needs a break from their day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love Love this book!","review":"Yep I am hooked on this author so much that I even became her friend on facebook! This book was my first foray into the wit and wonder that is Dot Frank. I must say that her novels grab you, make you laugh and keep you hooked until you can't put them down. Somebody make a movie out of these books. They are such gems! You don't just get a story about people. You get the sounds, smells, and tastes of places. I will read every book written by her. She is quickly becoming my absolute favorite author. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing, at best","review":"I stopped reading it at the halfway point. It was just too, like one reviewer said, contrived. I gave it a two instead of a one, as the author really nailed some of New York City's unique eccentricity. That was good for some laughs. The description of the Southern town was authentic, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mango Sunsets","review":"First time Dorothea Benton Frank reader. I loved this book.

I really feel as if I know these folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding happiness on Sullivan's Island","review":"I Love everything that Dorthea Benton Frank writes! After reading one of her Beach books, I feel like I've been on a vacation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dorothea Benton Frank Book to date!","review":"The Land of Mango Sunsets is Ms. Frank's best novel to date. There is drama, heartache, aging parents, love, parenthood, relationship troubles, grandparenting, infidelity, snobbery, and above all else - humor! I am especially touched by the character's fight against cancer, as my sister has been dealing with that now for 2 years. Ms. Frank captures the emotions that we all feel when going through something like this. Ms. Frank's latest novel is superb. I'm recommending it to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job, Dottie!","review":"I love all of Dorothea Benton Frank's books and this is no exception. What I learned from this book: Save me from New York Society!! It's fun to watch the main character, Miriam, morph her way into Mellie, her reinvented Sullivan's Island self, not unlike her mother did. The supporting cast is enjoyable, including her talking bird. Her writing style is fun too, for example: \\"It was late on a warm sunny day in the middle of the week. Liz had gone fishing with Mother and Harrison, and I was home alone, lying in the hammock, reading Proust in French. Okay, that was a lie to see if you're paying attention.\\" How can you read that and not smile?

I have read them all and it is apparent that DBF may have run out of interesting characters or storylines to write about.The story is very bland, predictable and silly.Read reviews from national book critics for this one and you will see it's actually not the \\"greatest book\\" written as some of the readers on Amazon have claimed.I'm sorry Dorothy!

There are great questions, and I learned a few things that I had no idea happend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I missed something..","review":"After reading the other reviews I feel like I might have missed something, because I did not care for this game. I played it with 9 friends who also agreed with me. We felt the play of the game was tedious and in many cases some teams just 'free jumped' their way into a big lead. We also felt that at least half of the questions, especially in the movies and tv categories were totally obscure. Anyway, just my opinion maybe you'll feel different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fun Fun","review":"This game is a great time and me and my best friend who are 29 and 30 years old play this every weekend.

This game has a lot of cool questions and we have not had any repeats yet. The questions are challenging, but fair. A few of my favorite 80's nuggets are - a young Alfonse Ribeiro appears in a Pepsi commercial with Michael Jackson (1984)...Kellogg's first makes C3PO's breakfast cereal (1983)...Newcleus hits Billboard chart with the song \\"Jam On It\\"...Activision releases Pitfall for Atari (1982)...\\"Baby Jessica\\" is resuced from the well in Texas (1987 - and then the news footage appears in Michael Jackson's \\"Man in the Mirror\\" video!) Anyway, it's a good game."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally, a good gift...","review":"While attempting to find the perfect gift for my 25 year old brother, I stumbled upon the 80s game. I gave the 80s game to him as a gift for Christmas, and that night, my family sat down and played. Not only did we have fun playing and laughing the whole time, I think it is the first gift that I have gotten my brother in twenty years that he actually likes and will probably enjoy again. Thanks 80s game..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as fun as the reviews make it sound...","review":"I added this item to my wishlist (and received it as a gift) after reading all the positive reviews. But after playing the game with three others, I didn't get a lot out of it. The others who played with me didn't enjoy it, either.Part of the problem is that I grew up in the 80's, but was probably too young to remember some of the things that happened. (I graduated high school in 1997.) But I also felt that the questions were phrased funny and were hard to read and although the game shouldn't be completely simple, some of the questions were really obscure.So, if you were teenage or above in the 1980's, go for it. You'll probably enjoy it. But for today's early to mid-twenties crowd, I would recommend that you pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for people 27 to 38","review":"The age range is just an estimate, but I think it's a pretty close guess (I'm 29, my boyfriend is 35). I tried playing the 90's Game with my little brother's friends and didn't do as well. My friends and I love this game and have hours of fun with it. We usually play in teams of two or three people, and we all agree it's more entertaining that way (less pressure on the individual). I would recommend an agreed upon time limit (like 1 or 2 minutes) to answer questions, otherwise the game gets a bit long. Also, the sports questions are very specific, which puts you at a disadvantage if you don't know anything about sports (but gives you an edge if you're a sports buff). In summary, the 80's Game is a totally tubular experience for people who came of age in the 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the average cook or foodie","review":"I was first introduced to Kylie Kwong through her cooking show on the Discover Home channel. On her show, she's always cooking these warm, savory soup dishes with lots of veggies, fish and seafood. Her cooking seems very simple, but this cookbook is anything but.The recipes it contains are complex and filled with exotic ingredients that i doubt I could even find at my local Whole Foods. There wasn't even a simple seafood soup recipe listed. I flipped through the entire book, and made my final decision after flipping to the one of the last recipes in the book, octopus something-or-other. I'm out.Kylie Kwong seems very nice, and she has a great cooking show, but this book is a complete departure from the food we see her prepare on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"love kylie books","review":"i am hooked on kylie's cookbook.i wish she got her own dvds too.i am sure all her fans will really like it.the ingredients she uses in her books are so easy stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated!!!!","review":"I am a darn good home cook and have lived and cooked around the world.

DBS) as Mobile Estates (especially Re. Citizen King). Compare and contrast:* The breakthrough hit that's really easy to identify because it's completely unlike everything else they ever did.* The general \\"life isn't the greatest, but we're making the most of it\\" mentality (a dependable alt-rock staple).* Lots of seemingly thrown together lyrics that kinda make more sense after repeated listenings.* A consistently vibrant but still fairly mellow beat; the tracks almost blend into each other.Add it all up and...well, if you're a fan of alt-rock, you'll like it. Plain and simple.(P.S.

Unfortunately, I thought the rest of the album would be like 'Breakfast at Tiffany's,' but not a single song sounded like it.

All songs were good, but there was almost no variety, they were basically all the same. Kind of mediocre. But I liked \\"Halo\\" and \\"Home\\" despite this, other than that they were alll good, but nothing spectacular.

The only bad track is Born To Rock and Roll, and in these days of make-your-own-playlists, I replace it with McGuinn's My New Woman off his first solo LP, recorded about the same time with the whole Byrds line-up. I also like to change the running order - Side 2 was always a bit too Neil Young-heavy for me.But the real problem is the sound quality. There have been at least four reissues of this over the years and the latest one from Rhino sounds no better. They all seem to have been sourced from the same over-used tape. Why can't a proper remastering job be done? And no bonus tracks? I find that hard to believe, what with The Byrds' reputation for not including a lot of their best stuff (usually due to band politics).Come on, guys - this is as great an album as any of the 60s ones and it deserves being brought back into the canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really the Byrds","review":"Short and sweet, this album just never worked for my ears. I fell in love with The Byrds with the first album and hung with them through the changes in line-up and styles (yeah, I even liked Byrdmaniax) but this one just fell flat. Only a couple oftunes even sound Byrd-like and the rest just sort of lay there and make you wonder what was going on in the groups head when they listened to the playbacks. If you're a Byrd fan then thiseffort will more than likely disappoint you in a big way. If youare just getting into the group, this album will make you wonderwhat all the hub-bub was about.

Tomasello offers an alternative account based on an eclectic mix of \\"usage-based\\" approaches to language, including Construction Grammar and various strains of cognitive and functional linguistics.Tomasello's ideas deserve to be taken very seriously within linguistics. His background in experimental psychology and his research experience with chimpanzees inform his ideas on language acquisition and keep them grounded in psychological and biological reality. On the other hand, his nemesis Steven Pinker is very compelling in his own right (and the best writer in the field). I have to admit I can't decide who's right, Pinker or Tomasello, but I relish their battle of ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Poster Bible Study Guide and Art Work Display","review":"Testamonials: \\" I purchased the Bible Poster for my husband as a birthday present and he was so impressed with it.

Not only does it skim the surface of the concept of Buddha-Nature, it contains all kinds of pseudo-Christian and other theistic references, such as Mother Goddess, chakras, Yahweh, Jesus, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.

A lot of psychologists say the theory is flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"SF fans, enjoy. Literature fans, keep looking.","review":"Admittedly, Asimov is not often compared to Nabokov or Melville or Bronte, but if you've found yourself wondering why not, this book should clear up the matter in your mind. If you're a lit fan and want to sample the best of the SF genre, you'll do yourself a favor to look elsewhere (like maybe Dune or The Martian Chronicles). According to the forward, Asimov's inspiration for the novel was essentially a self-imposed dare. He inflated it from a short story to convince himself he could still write a novel after not having written one for 10 years and it shows. Characterizations and a story that barely would have sufficed for a short story have been spread to complete transparency over 8th grade prose. The whole thing feels very forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Can't Write","review":"I have to admit that the Foundation Trilogy completely blew me away. Not only was it entertaining, but I loved the idea behind the books, whether or not they are realistic. But I still say he cannot write. He is not Hemingway, Shakespeare, or Austen.This book is the quintessential example of those oh-so-many SF authors who have mediocre-to-great ideas but just can't seem to convey them effectively and beautifully. The prose borders on the quality of high school essays and \\"The Gods Themselves\\" was certainly not an exception. His ideas were marginally interesting, but the book was written so incredibly badly that I barely got through half of it before I threw it down in disgust. Don't waste your time with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"I picked this up at the library since I didn't recall reading it. What a horrible borefest. It drags on and on and on. Even the first few chapters are completely repetetive. In short, he had a poor three-part short story that he turned into a dreadful three part novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Day Ragglemorph: Snow White Falls on Black Beauty and We Call the Impact a Scandal","review":"This book substantiates the unpopular reality that Mr. Asimov is bluster and hype. I have yet to encounter anything of his pen that warrants a positive adjective. Clearly, the factory has consumed the wayward crickets & dumbfounded sparrows; consequently, the gentleman's legend enters a room 10 yards previous to his apparition. The phantasm should not be mocked--the man has his legions and he is entitled to the throngs--but a scrutinous qualification of what denotes & defines interesting literature should be taken under wing. This book, like his other books, never yields a jolt and I asseverate that it was not worth the nickel that was extracted from my lint-infested pocket to pay its way into my library. BOREDOM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Asimov's Sci-Fi, one of his best novels","review":"The good doctor was not the best of writers when it came to character development. Many of his books have excellent plots, but weak, cartoonish characters that could be found in any pulp novel. But \\"The Gods Themselves\\" really breaks out of Asimov's usual mold. It's bold; alien characters with three sexes (and a description of how they do it) and an exciting parallel story that merges in surprising ways. While not my favorite of Asimov's books, I respect this novel for its creative delights. A good tale, interesting concepts, some of the best sci-fi Asimov wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks like I'll never get tired of Asimov.","review":"Asimov is great because he combines science and stories in a perfect mix. His characters are memorable and human. His science, right.The three parts of the book are really enjoyable. The second part was my favorite, set in another universe with a different kind of intelligent life. The first and the last were full of human nature.This book reminded me a little about Asimov's \\"Nemesis\\", because of character development. Something I like in both these books is that there is not really an evil one: There are people, with weaknesses and strengths, and so the scenarios looks very pausible.That's what makes Asimov a SF master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had Me Thinking","review":"This work is simple on the surface -- three parts, three interpretations -- but it is rich with ideas about how man sees himself and how he views his place in the universe. I've been thinking of this long after finishing it, and it remains one of the best pieces of science fiction that I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic SciFi","review":"Very interesting novel. The science was a bit over my head and apparently fairly accurate (in the sense of theories and accuracy). This book- written over thirty years ago- still has some resonance in our times. The theories are just as fair as any we have for our existence. I enjoyed the \\"para\\" world and its inhabitants- in fact this was my favorite part of the book.The book is not without its flaws, but for a fan of science fiction it was pretty good. As this is my first Asimov novel I can't compare it- but it does make me want to read more of his stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"For diehard s-f and Asimov fans only","review":"The Gods Themselves is an archetype of a certain brand of s-f writing: dull prose, cardboard characters, wooden dialogue, lots of pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo, and even an alien three-sexed species. For diehard s-f fans, it's heaven as Asimov explores the ramifications of energy transferral between parallel universes. For anyone else, it's very tough and unrewarding sledding."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 Words or Less","review":"During the first part of this novel, I realized just how much science Asimov was cramming into his science-fiction. The characters and plot took the time to detail the scientific basis of their world. That doesn't happen much anymore, and I was really intrigued.Then I hit the 2nd part. The novel suddenly becomes bogged down in alien social networking and a seemingly endless string of dialogues about conforming to expectations. This new mode went on and on and on.I finally had to stop reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I learned an important life lesson from this book","review":"any value this book has is near completely ruined by the main character. A tour guide on the moon her never ending, never ceasing incessant ranting on her xenophobic viewpoints is laced liberally all over the book. The main character is so unlovable that I would be forced to commit an act of violence against her if stuck with her for more then a few minutes. Anything too stop the jingoist propaganda that her mouth vomits outward at one and all. The sheer volume of her ranting is enough to make one question her sanity.I would say the book did have one important thing to say:the most unattractive quality anyone can ever have is xenophobia and snobbishness.

All parts of the book are great (as always) and the second is especially amazing. To describe alien life ao different from human life is genious in itself.

The mono audio track is a bit 'hissy' but it's more than passable for such an incredibly rare film.

Many people think that since vitamins are good for you, they can't hurt you. That is not true if they are taken TOO MANY at a time and in TOO MUCH of a quantity. These vitamins are made by DRUCKER LABS and are most likely SYNTHETICALLY created, which are the worst kind of vitamins. Save yourself some money and buy a good quality WHOLE FOOD vitamin instead. The benefits will be much greater."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only supplement you'll need","review":"With my busy lifestyle I can't plan every meal, so a supplement is the only way to really get what I need. I started taking this one because it was the only one, at the time, I could find that was organic. After taking it for quite a while I became skeptical, however what really sold me was when I stopped taking this product.I used an entire bottle, and saw little improvement. So I stopped. I have not used this product for an entire month, and I can't stand it any longer. Since that time I have seen weight gain, my digestive system is not up to par, and have seen my skin and hair turn dry and desperate for nutrients.So in conclusion, it is not a true panacea, and results may not be as drastic as you may be hoping for, but it gives you the nutrients you need at a very good price. I have yet to find another product with all this one offers, for such a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This was a good read.

The Ottoman Turkish gendarmes did not even cross the border but turned them over to the Arabs or Kurds once the Armenians were out of the Empire's soil. Real-life stories we get from surviving kids (todays grandmas, grandpas) tell us that the Ottoman (turkish) gendarmas were mostly the good guys. As for dying from cholera, typoid, and the like, this was not a plan of genocide rather a consequence of time, and place.

With all due respect, his/her negative review of this book is highly suspect. I do not see how a person with an email address like \\"Turkgucu\\", which translates into \\"Turkish Power\\", can be unbiased and objective.

The book, though heavy reading is light on supporting material. Fails to integrate the Ottoman archives which are the single key source for events of the time. And instead relies on a series of documents which can be classified as war-propoganda documents against the Ottoman by various groups. Alleges that the Ottoman government for no reason at all massacred thousands of civilians but fails to go in depth on the Armenian revolutionary movements or the Rusian Czarist expansionist manuevers.Overall it is not worth reading if you have read any other books on the subject and if you havent it really is not the one to start up on.

The journalistic approach gives the reader the chance to understand the history surrounding the events. The book reviews the part that Germany played in its support of Turkey and also Britain and France in their betrayal of Armenia in the post-First World War period. This is no revisionist history, it clearly places the blame on Turkey (tho' not all Turks or any nationality for that matter) for the centrally organized attempt to eliminate an ethnic group.

Certainly, it is known that Microsoft is noteworthy for its support of accessibility features in Windows operating systems, but the author provides many discussions specific to the MS Windows environment, .Net and so forth. This is not a problem as there is much generic material to absorb. It is noteworthy that the title reflects upon the 508 legal code and once one progresses beyond the system programming examples in the early chapters of the book, the section on Web Accessibility promises more openness.

The bad ones seemed unpolished, amateurish. Should have been workshopped a good deal, or maybe a good editor was needed. The formatting was strange on my Kindle: one story would end and another begin on the same page, with no warning, often not even a title. I'd start reading a new story, without being aware that it was a new story, the last one had ended. Confusing. Especially since the endings often didn't bring a sense of closure. They just seemed to stop, without having made a point.

Zooming around for a couple of hours at 400 knots and then going back to the ship for hot showers, hot food, and cold booze in your air conditioned room sitting on your mattress does not constitute combat in any traditional sense of the word. \\"Look at me, I'm a pilot\\".

Furthermore, Empire Earth boasts about its several units in different ages and many buildings. But, the units and buildings are the same almost. It gets boring from time to time. Empire Earth is NOT flexible. You can't change the color of your civ in a single player game, you can only play random games, civs are weird-if you pick the French, they have a british accent(all civ have this accent). Building styles are the same for all; it doesn't change. Tech Support doesn't help. And, don't bother to go visit the Empire Earth Website because they don't update it.

This amounts to a game where you build your civ for a while, then the computer troops come in and wipe you out before you've even had a chance to accomplish anything. No fun.I decided to try the online play since playing vs. the computer was so unenjoyable. I found snotty ultra-skilled players that wiped me out in under five minutes - again no fun. These people were not even nice - I asked them for tips on how to play and they just sent back nasty messages.So - this game is a total bust.

So, about the time I get a wonder built or a couple started the AI kicks in and stomps the bejeezus out of me. I've had the game for a year - even bought the strategy guide - and I've yet to play complete a scenario succesfully, and this is while playing on the easiest setting. Perhaps I'm more used to simulation/city-building games than RTS games, but it seems to me that for the game to be enjoyable the average use ought to have at least a reasonable chance at success.Technically, graphically, it's a great game.

In addition to numerous military pieces, each also had several variables. And remember, that military piece will be antiqued in just a few minutes then you have to learn new ones! Also, trying to keep track of which type of warrior could beat whom is frustrating. It's far worse than the simple scissors, paper, rock. Did you notice the price drop from $49.99 to $19.99? And this game just came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too difficult for the average player","review":"Empire Earth has been heralded as the true successor to Age of Empires, and perhaps it could have been. The game fails on two levels.The first failure is the combat system. The military units represent quite literally an enhanced game of rock, paper and scissors. In this case, shock weapons trump pierce, pierce weapons trump ranged, ranged weapons trump shock... rock - paper - scissors. This is pretty silly.The second failure is the difficulty level. There is no novice or beginer level from which to learn this game. It begins slamming you from the outset with pretty advanced computer AI that individually manages the combat units on the rock-paper-scissors scale while you manage by unit groups and the AI builds up its civilization far faster than the beginning player could hope to.In short, this game is a stunning disappointment for the average gamer.

Also I am not lying when I say this I told one of my cybers to attack an enemy unit but it took 5 minutes for it to respond. For those of you who want a game similiar to empire earth I'd go with Total Annihilation. It's an old one for Windows 95 but I personally think that it's better.

It is classified in the horror/fantasy genre, but can not be limited solely into one genre. Do not misunderstand me -- The Lost Village is the horror story of all horror stories, and easily competes with novels written by the most well known and respected horror authors. This novel, however, possesses something greater. The only word that I can use to describe what I am trying to explain is deep. The Lost Village is filled with fascinating story lines with riveting twists, turns, and climaxes. Throughout this novel you will feel as though you know the characters -- feel their pleasures and pains, and journey with them through their trials and tribulations. The story is very well plotted, and remains unpredictable throughout. If you enjoy wild rides, this is the novel for you. The Lost Village is that good. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Village blew me away","review":"I simply loved The Lost Village. I thought it was immensely overwhelming, magnificent and ingenious.

We all find it to be very simplisitic on whole, pretty boring, and terribly written. I am a teenager and can write better than this. I work very hard for what little money I make and I need spend my dollars wisely, which is what I thought I was doing with this book. Unfortunately, I made a huge mistake here.

I didn't know what to expect going in, but I was pleasantly surprised. I couldn't put it down. The Lost village is a great horror story with great characters.

Simple, fluid, storytelling about the two Bostons: WASPY and conservative Beacon Hill versus working class Southie. Prepare to cry ... love triumphs but it is short-lived. Imagine Jack and Rose in Titanic getting together only for Rose to die of consumptions in New York.

However, I was very disappointed with the novel when I was finished.I think Oliver and Jenny are just too underdeveloped to be taken seriously. I didn't feel any real love between the two characters, and it felt like everything that happened was very abrubt and was dealt with in very few pages (i.e. Jenny and Oliver getting together, Oliver graduating from law school, meeting the parents, getting married... basically everything that happened!). At the end of the story I was actually surprised that it was over. It wasn't as breathtaking as some people have described it, and it just wasn't that great of a love story overall.If you want to read a REAL love story, I recommend The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger. That book breaks my heart every time I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a love story","review":"I must say I was so disappointed.

I thought it would be a genuine love story--a tear jerker that made you think about love and life in general. Because the 2 main characters were so undeveloped, it was hard to be engrossed by them. Also, their personalities really turned me off. It bugged the hell out of me and was annoying whenever Jenny called Oliver \\"preppie.\\" I thought that was pretty unromantic. Both Jen and Oliver have sarcastic personalities which was not appealing to me. It was an actual turn off. I would have liked more detail, like more description of their love for each other. I didn't like this book too much. I'm glad it was short--I would not have been able to take anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Find the importance of Love and Time","review":"This book teaches manay things. Not only about love but also about death and time, and that every meeting had parting. Being afraid of parting, I was afraid to love someone as once I could but this book changed me. I decided to live with this book - because I did not want to 'say sorry'. However as I had mentioned, I had to experience 'parting' also. It was not the death - but it was inevitable. Someone I loved had to go back to his country. Having read this book before, I could tell that we should cherish each moment we have. It is not only between us. I think I can say this in terms of any relationship. We have no idea when one of us will die. No one can predict it - so we have got to cherish and live our time. It allows you not to 'say sorry' even if that relationship would break up. You can keep it as a part of good memory.This book is a good text book for life forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasty and Sentimental","review":"I read this book when it came out and I didn't then and don't now understand all the hype. The story is told hastily, almost as if the author is rushing through the plot -- almost as if what he had in mind was a screenplay, and wrote a book instead. The characters aren't well-developed. The story is predictable. And, it is mawkish: sentimental in a feeble way. Feeble because the characters seem two-dimensional and the ending is not satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such an amazing book!","review":"This book was brought to my attention in a class I was taking - a few pages were given to us on a print-out.

The teacher presents a revew of the Buddha's life and refers it immediatly to our present preocupations. The words of the text are far from being sweet, but salty and spicy, with a lot of irony and spiteful sense of humor. Super awakening (at least for a short moment!). Of course most of all, the text is about the core buddhist philosophy, like seeing all phenomena as impermanent, understanding that there is no emotion that does not originate from pain/confusion/suffering, observing the world as dream-like/illusionary, and believing that nirvana can not be defined through/by our conceptual mind. Overall, the book carries a very strong message. I foud it very inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outside view","review":"A small but valuable and articulate series of essays on 9/11 and subsequent events and issues written from the vantage point of a British author living on the West Coast of the US.

Unfortunately for the Wildcats, Anderson went down early in the season with an ACL tear, leaving Mercer to shoulder the load the entire season. At the Final Four, Utah utilized a very physical style of play in trying to eke out a win against the Wildcats, who had beaten them in the NCAA tourny in 1996 (and would do so again in 1998). This physical game left Mercer drained for the championship, giving Arizona the break they needed to take the 1997 NCAA Championship. As viewers, we were robbed of an outstanding matchup in seeing Derrick Anderson (The man Michael Jordan said he hates to have guarding him) defending against Miles Simon, who had a career game that day.

The closure velcro (that holds each side to the other when rolled) un-sticks and allows half of the roll to flip open when picked up by shoulder strap without handle velcro secured, had to remove the acrylic strap & d-ring and re-position to keep the bag from whipping open when picked up.Other than that, decent for the cost. Obviously doesn't hold things much thicker than a couple knife handles as it doesn't have solid panels, doesn't have bells & whistles, comes as pictured.

While Heima is colorful, rich, spacious, and seems to take you on a journey, Inni is quite the opposite. The grainy, mostly black and white picture doesn't highlight the Icelandic landscape at all. Rather, it allows the viewer to highlight on the band itself. Many shots are so close that you can see Jonsi's sweat, the individual finger movements between frets...and often times simple images are shown to allow you to purely focus on the music at hand.There were many times where I had to remind myself that what I was watching was actually a concert, and that they were not playing in my living room. I have never seen a live concert in this fashion, and glad I have it along with Heima to make the combined an unmatched live collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Edition","review":"I already knew this was a good book, and I knew Michael Hague was a good illustrator.

White Hotel is one of the most amazing novels I've ever read. It is a wonderful story, at times erotic, often surreal, unfortunately tragic, always captivating. When you start this novel, you are introduced to a slightly off-balanced Jewish opera singer and her strange and unexplainable neuroses. She chats with her therapist, a very amusing and true-to-life fictional Sigmund Freud. Time goes on, her life goes on, joys come and go, and the War starts in Germany...

I do not understand the need to shock a reader by using the most hideous language you can find. I would have been more interested in this book if it had not started so badly. I found the case study more interesting to laugh at the Freudian interpretation. And to not have to skip over the cursing! I didn't even want this book in my house after I had finished reading it in case someone ever picked it up to have a look!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hoax","review":"The White Hotel is a great book. Unfortunately, after its release, researchers found that D.M. Thomas lifted passages from the work of other writers. His career never recovered. Can we forgive this if the book is still superb? As a writer, I emphatically say no. Plagerism is the great sin of writers. The idea that there is no such thing as plagerism, a notion put forth by the now dated \\"theorists,\\" must be dismissed. If you make use of another writer's work, you must give that writer credit. Otherwise, don't use it.Richard Cummings"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great OEM replacement.","review":"Great fit and firm ride. You only get one though. Unlike the shocks that came as a pair.

It is obvious that the author is more interested in spreading his biased point of view than he is in providing any subjective information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spreading our Empathy","review":"Masson is doing important work here. Those that accuse him of sentimentalism or anthropomorphism don't understand the project. All Masson is trying to do is generate a little consistancy between our feeling towards the animals in homes and the one on our plates. Perhaps some people will read this book and decide we should start eating dogs and cats. However, Masson rightly expects that most people would sooner pull all animals off the menu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author has no clue","review":"We live with farm animals and know that they have complex emotional lives, so I had high hopes, but I was very disappointed, the author doesn't really know animals and their emotions; he just has a warm fuzzy feeling about them and wants us to be nice to them. I don't disagree entirely, I'm totally against factory farms, but this book is supposed to be about their emotional lives, no? \\"Fast food nation\\" and \\"the omnivores dilemma\\" do a MUCH better job of addressing that issue. The stated title of this book is completely inaccurate, in my opinion, after living day to day with goats, sheep, chickens and a few other odds and ends for five years. If you want a book that actually talks about farm animal emotions, \\"Animals in Translation\\" really does this in a way that resonates with my experience.I couldn't even finish reading this book, it was so far off the mark, I hate to even give it one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely stories, though not well documented","review":"The author seems a lovely soul who likes animals and tells good stories.

It will open your eyes to the suffering of animals to your health and to our environment. I recommend \\"The Face on your Plate\\" by: Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson as another good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think of them as Animals not Meat","review":"I love Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson. He's brave enough to challenge our notions of animals without overlooking all evidence as 'anthromorphizing.'I feel that Masson when he says we should take things at face value. If it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck... in other words if animals appear to act as if they are expressing a certain emotion, then they probably are. He explores the emotional complexity of each animal we use for food including: pigs, cows, chickens, goats, ducks, and geese. He uses mainly anecdotes as well as behavioral studies, which are very compelling.I definitely reccomend this book for two reasons: 1) you will think twice about the animals you eat and 2) you will be alerted to the horrible abuses of animals on factory farms. Also read When Elephants Weep by the Masson. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why couldn't THIS have been the finale?","review":"In the finale, we see the characters four years later visiting Michael's grave.

Perhaps it was a nice way to explain a few things; however, I felt a separation from the regular episodes and this feature film. The acting was ok and it felt more like a reunion show. I think it is still worth seeing (who can't live without those 3 seconds predictable twists?).

If you thought the series went downhill in Seasons 3 and 4, you might want to see this anyway, but you might want to rent it rather than buy it.The story is as contrived as the rest of the series, but with everything pressed into 90 minutes of action, it goes by so fast you can't really enjoy it. Season 1 might have been this bad if it had been only 90 minutes long.The story opens with the wedding of Michael and Sarah. Two minutes later, at the wedding party, Sarah is arrested for murder.

While free is a very compelling insentive, there are drawbacks. Constantly not being able to join games that you are making, constant lines to make games, and above all, the hacks. the hacks make the game unbalanced and irrating in fighting.I HAVE PLAYED FOR AT LEAST A YEAR AND HACKS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PRESENT, MANY OD THE SAME HACKS.

The RPG focuses more on skills and perks than it does your usual strenght dex, ect like other games. The Druid, to me, is a very fun character to play and more interesting than the necromancer or the other magic users. Shapeshift/summon is a good combo, be what follows you. The warewolf is a bit weak at the start, however. I have only briefly tried the Assasin and cannot review her in the game. Elemental magic sometimes does not work and should only be used if you like to gamble with your(character's) life.

The Assassin and the Druid are (hopefully) going to be whole new experiences with all their cool new skills. And whats a sequel without an extention of the story? There is now an Act 5 in diablo 2: Lord of Destruction. Can't wait to kill Baal. There is also a more interactive world to explore with gun towers and other stuff (dont know much about it as of yet).

I believe this to be a flaw in Diablo 2 , and I'm dissapointed Blizzard aren't doing anything to correct it.

Sure, it adds a new act and 2 new classes. But how long is that going to keep you entertained? Once you beat act 5 a few times, it becomes boring.The bottom line is: the only thing that keeps you playing this like a zombie is the items. That's it. Nothing more. For me, I find seeking unique items that very boring. I know many D2 zombies, er, I mean D2 players will find this good entertainment.So unless you get a kick out of mindlessly searching for items, then Lord of Destruction is not going to keep you entertained very long.

But the music, scenery, special effects, ambience, and the character development parts of the game are totally cool -- and that's what this expansion does. It gives you more character types to play with, more/different items, and so on.

The amazon is by far the most powerful of all. She shoots arrows like a machine-gun, and can change her attacks to cold and fire arrows by only expending a few skill points. The zon is best if equiped with a mana/life stealing bow (putting a perfect skull in your bow is best).To enjoy the game more I simply would not go to the Hell difficulty at all. It is insanely difficult for even the most experienced players. There are monsters which are immune to every form of attack (physical, cold, fire, lightning, poison), so you cannot get very far with say, a barbarian with no elemental attacks or a sorc who specializes in only one school.On the multi player games, watch out for PK's (player killers).

I have had a lot of fun building up my ally's character, and she has saved my careless behind a few times. I have played as the Druid, and, although I haven't reached the end yet,I am really enjoying kicking demon butt as a werebear. I still hate the detestable save system that was introduced with D2,but, with the ally fighting along side you, the chances of being killed are lessened considerably. One more thing: the new optional graphic setting is awesome.I hadn't realized how cool it was until switched over to the \\"old\\" setting.

In my opinion its the best computer game out there. The original Diablo 2 was great and the expansion makes the game MUCH better. I had several hours after hours of fun only on single player but in multiplayer the fun never ends. The new things about the Expansion are all the new items(for example the new weapons on this game are unimaginable compared to the first game) there are several new unique items and now the items are basically endless.There is the new act which is great and several new monsters in the act. the stash is twice as big and the new druid and assassin are awesome.

Perhaps like not so many here, I had a miserable time getting LOD to run. The box says that the game is playable in XP, but I cannot get the characters to run smoothly, and it's not the hardware (1ghz Ath.; geForce2 GTS; 256K RAM). D2 seems to run fine in XP, but both the cinematics and the game for LOD don't work. Blizzard's technical support on this issue is underwhelming. For the five seconds that the game worked before it froze, though, it looked like it might have had some potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same. Really.","review":"You get ONE more level, as opposed to the four without the expansion, and two new character classes. Unless you like playing new characters in 80% of the same old, 20% new, arenas, it's really just a little more of the same stuff. I'm sure they could have added this expansion onto Diablo II with no problem, but then they wouldn't have gotten the extra $. You really have to be into this game to think the expansion is worth it.

The battling is somewhat uneventfull, as in, if you're not using magic it's just chop chop chop, then the guy jumps in the air and dies. 2. After a while this game gets eXtremely boring, continuously chopping and hacking away at random things, running out of stanama reguarly, nothing much happens, not including the videos.

The remix for Hurt was perfect.

I recommend every single song. Plus, as this is incredibly hard to find, you really should buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love NIN, but this is trash!!!!","review":"I *love* NIN, so don't get me wrong, but this album is a terrible bunch of remixes of Trent Reznor's music by people who are not Reznor. There is maybe one track that he actually worked on. Overall, this is mostly a remix album of some of the weaker songs on \\"The Downward Spiral\\". I mean, it does have a remix of \\"hurt\\" and \\"tds\\", but honestly, does anbody consider \\"piggy\\" and \\"mr. self destruct\\" to be at the level of \\"closer,\\" \\"march of the pigs,\\" and \\"heresy\\"? A sorry attempt to cash in on a great alum, and I can't believe Reznor allowed his name to be put on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal","review":"The thing I like the most about NIN is their raw anger and crashing about.

The rest were nothing to get excited about. Maybe it's too much to expect the same level of artistic attainment that Trent Reznor reached in \\"Pretty Hate Maching\\" and \\"Down the Spiral.\\" Most of the tracks in this effort do nothing for industrial music. \\"Further Down the Spiral\\" is for grannies! Maybe it should be released under the name \\"Three Inch Rubber Weenies\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought \\"Fixed\\" sucked at first, but.............","review":"This one bit the dust even more.

Well, I'll have to say this is, like Fixed, a great follow up.Piggy is a excellent mix to start out the cd, and could possibly be the best song on there. Nice acoustic/metal collerabration on this track.The Art of Self Desctruction parts 1 and 2 are next, and both are pretty good, and different.This disc also contains 3 versions of Eraser, the only good one being Denail;Realization. The other two are too boring and plain.We also get a not-so-different version of Hurt. The only thing different about this version is that it's a bit more clear then TDS version. We also have two songs by Aphex Twin on this, both of which are ok, yet kind of boring, relaxing if anything.So, I recomend the much better import version of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh. . . Noise?","review":"Now, don't get me wrong here, I like Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor about as much as everyone else, but this remix album was hardly even recognizable. Downward Spiral was fantastic, but Further down the spiral just took some excellent songs and tweaked them out so much that they just became hard to listen too. I tried and tried with this one, but it just wouldn't grow on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-white noise","review":"There is at times, a fine line between noise and music. NIN not only crossed that line in this cd, but stomped on it a few times in the process. Not even close to the calibre of WITH TEETH, this cd is a waste of time and an insult to the talent that resides within this group of musicians.Songs that go from semi-music to irritating noise and last four times as long as one can abide, while \\"playing\\" the same thing over and over and ...well, you get my drift.If great music is your thing, pass this one up. Or write me a note and tell me why on earth such a great group would release such an abomination."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty cool","review":"This album was a great follow up of \\"the downward spiral\\" I don't see why people didn't like the remixes of Mr. self destruct, the only one I didn't like was SelfDestruction, Final because it didn't have the guitars that the 2nd version did. This album is very good, I listen to it 15 hours a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuation","review":"contiuation of the downward spiral. new versions of alot of songs basically. not essential.. but still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice EP of remixes","review":"This 11 track Ep features remixes of songs from Nine Inch Nails' breakthrough 1994 album \\"The Downward Spiral\\". The \\"Nothing Can Stop Me Now\\" remix of \\"Piggy\\" features Dave Navarro (Jane's Addiction) on guitar and is produced by Rick Rubin. That song alone is reason enough to own this EP and is nearly as great as the original song it is remixed from. We also get three remixes of \\"Mr. Self Destruct\\"; \\"Art of Self Destruction, Part One\\", \\"Self Destruction, Part Two\\", and \\"Self Destruction, Final\\", all of which are half decent at best but can't beat the original. The \\"Quiet\\" remix of \\"Hurt\\" sounds nearly identical to the original version minus a few scratches here and there, plus we also get a few good remixes of \\"Eraser\\" as well. All in all, this EP is a good pick up for any NIN fan, but it is worth noting that the import version is far superior and is a must have for any fan of Nine Inch Nails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great at 1st","review":"I wanted to wait a few months befor I reviewed this product and its a good thing I did.

The lyrics are mean and Alice sounds great. Blood and Mayhem and all the other great humorous stuff, in continuing with Alice's traditions, continue here in another episode. Got hooked onto his music, many moons ago, right when I heard \\"Killer\\". Can there be a more artistically articulate artist who keeps on painting vivid realistic dark images ( Big brother watching you ?? ) into his songs and as the lamb to slaughter, all you can ask yourself is, is he the eternal candy man painting a violet blood encrusted sunset a lighter shade of blue with his sardonic dark humor ? For the artistically struggling many, a.k.a. Marilyn Manson, the Mad Cap still laughes.

Violence, hatred, cruelty, madness - Alice is warning us this is where we're headed - and we don't want to go there. The album is a bit heavy for my tastes, but I do like about 7 of 11 songs. As a Christian, I was hoping for something along the lines of Last Temptation, and while this CD isn't as blatantly Christian, it is obvious to me that Alice is trying to warn us what walking away from God has caused to befall upon our society. Standout tracks, in my opinion: the first 4, Gimme, Take It Like A Woman, and Cold Machines. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"whoa! dude!

As the son of a Protestant minister, Alice reminds us that this world in which we live is quite sinful. The title track highlights some of the evil for which man has been known, to include the Holocaust and the crucifixion of Christ. \\"Gimme\\" picks up on a theme first developed on The Last Temptation where the Devil entices the unrepentant with the riches and powers of this world - but for a price. \\"Pick Up the Bones\\" talks of the horrors of the genocide in Kosovo. \\"Wicked Young Man\\" places the blame for events like Columbine right where it belongs - on evil and not guns or rock music. Musically, this is some serious headbanging material. And it sounds great live! As my 6 year old says, \\"Alice rocks.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair Warning","review":"Brutal Planet is a 'Must Have' for metal/theatre enthusiasts. Alice (the real man), son of a minister, gives us something to seriously consider with this masterpiece. Yes, it's dark, but Alice has always excelled at portraying 'the shadow' figure and giving us something to laugh about at the same time. Aren't we all trying to reconcile the 'yin yang thang' which is our human existance? I admire Coop's ability to toss us a spiritual mickey without compromising his style. He is honest. He plays brilliantly from past material, that the 'faithful' will understand, but I'm not so certain that the disillusioned will catch the deeper meaning. It's my hope that they'll really listen and 'get it'. Gotta love him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I read Mein Kempf daily just to keep my hatred fed...","review":"Awesome! This album rocks real hard.

Some listeners, some even decidedly devoted Cooper fans have dismissed BP as Alice simply trying to sound \\"mainstream,\\" the same criticisms that plagued the deliberately melodic \\"TRASH\\" album. Not true! Brutal Planet serves up the best Cooper concoctions in years. Not since he welcomed us to his nightmare has he invited us so meacingly to share in his dark dreamworld, with the gore mixed with a healthy smattering of the old Alice wit....buy this album, and see the show!

It was hard waiting for the CD to come out this month! What an amazing talent Alice STILL has. I have been a loyal fan since 1972, and have enjoyed growing old with him. His work has become more thought-provoking in the last few years, more than I can say for most of his copy-cats. Not only is there great music, but an equally great message in his recordings. I encourage my teen-age children to listen to him because his music makes you think. Not something I'd recommend for many of the other \\"artists\\" out there. \\"Brutal Planet\\"...is it about the future, or is the future now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Print title here","review":"In the years waiting for this album, I thought all hope had been lost for music.

The other two tracks on the album are a remix by Trent Reznor, (which is the only thing keeping this CD above the 1 rating) and a stupid twelve minute long mish-mash of noises and weird voices, which I have listened to once. Compare this single with the single for \\"Lunchbox\\". \\"Lunchbox\\" had \\"Down In The Park\\" a cover version of the Gary Numen song, which is one of my favourite Manson songs. So to sum things up, I feel that this single extremely cons the fans, and I really wouldn't care if a car ran over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Album I've Ever Heard!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Don't even buy this album!!! It's such a rip off. Misery Machine and Get your Gunn are okay songs, but the #9 song and Mother Got Her Gunn(Sorry I'm not good with the titles from this album, I don't own it) are bad! To sum this up, the album is BAD(And I don't mean that in a good way)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four books in one","review":"This, along with vols II and III, is a remarkable and admirable work of scholarship. Hegel delivered his then unique course on the Philosophy of Religion on four occasions between 1821 and 1831. These three volumes essentially present all four lecture series. Although similarities run throughout, it is the development in his thought and change in emphasis (depending upon who was attacking him at the moment) that add to the fascination of this work. The footnotes are thorough. Comparatively easy to follow. Uniquely Hegelian mind stretching thought. Permeated with Hegel's own encyclopedic knowledge of everything (our Aristotle). Complements the Phenomenology and Logic.

Perhaps it will grow on me with repeated listenings as has happened recently with 'All This Useless Beauty'. That said, 'My Flame Burns Blue' has proved a challenging listen early on.Some of my problem with 'Flame' is simply song preference. There are several selections that are among my least favorite Costello songs: 'Clubland', 'Almost Blue' and '...Forbidden Playthings' among them. YECCHH!The good stuff.....The energized version of 'That's How You Got Killed Before' is a revelation, but nothing else quite approaches that level. 'God Give Me Strength' is pretty faithful to the studio version on 'Painted From Memory' and is sturdy if not spectacular. 'Favourite Hour', 'Almost Ideal Eyes' and 'Episode of Blonde' come off solidly. The version of 'Watching the Detectives' here will likely either amuse or repulse.Declan is nothing if not experimental. He's certainly that on 'Flame'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Gifted","review":"I've been an Elvis fan from the beginning. His many changes have enriched my life more than I can say.

The cardboard cut salsa montuno of 'Clubland' sounds as classy and natural as a plastic flamingo and the wonderful Ska sound of 'Watching the Detectives' is lost in a jazz arrangement that doesn't offer much to the melody.Elvis' voice is not suited the long sustained notes of 'Almost Blue' and most of the songs. It worked well on his 'Juliet Letters' album because the Brodsky Quartet played for his style but with the clean and crisp sound of the Metropole Orkest it is just painful.For me,'Hora Decubitus' is the only song worth listening from this musical jumble."},{"rating":"1","title":"very short, no depth to it","review":"This article, printed, is maybe 1 page long.

I NEVER EVER get any coffee grinds and I use regular Maxwell House coffee. I liked the French press coffee so much I got aBodum Chambord Coffee Pressbut after a week I WENT BACK to the Jetboil press and titanium cup just because its so much easier to clean.

It is inferior, in almost every way, to the press (i.e. Bodum screen + rod) I took from my normal home french press (which fits in and works perfectly with the jetboil).I normally like jetboil stuff, but this item sucks. Somewhere, the engineer that designed this thing sits alone and ashamed.If you're shopping for this press you probably already have one at home that will work BETTER in your jetboil than this thing.

The action is good but again very predictable. And what really brought down my rating is that I HATE to have to read subtitles when they talk in a foreign language such as Chinese in this case. You have to read more than half of this movie in order to know what they are talking about (unless you understand Chinese, then good for you, but obviously I don't). In my opinion, when you need to read this much, you miss all the face's expressions, some action and the sense of the movie because you hurry to read in order not to miss anything visual in the action. The movie is not that great either. Try to borrow this movie if you can. Not worth the money spent in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steven Seagal's acting sucks","review":"I couldn't take it for more than 1/2 hour or so. Steven Seagal calls himself an actor?

I was compelled to read it to see if I was missing a potentially rich source of mindless escape. It's shockingly awful. I suppose it has a plot that moves along, but I could not get past the clumsy writing. Does this mad woman not allow a copyeditor into her world? I mean it is what it is.

It brings to mind an image of letting the dog cut your hair with his teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not enjoy reading this book.","review":"The main character, India was a completely boring and uninteresting person. Her best friend, Gail, was much more colorful and I would rather have read more about her. This was a difficult and tedious story to read mainly because India deliberated over her situation for nearly 3/4 of the book. Why did this take so long to develop? If the story had moved along quickly and continued on once they did,I probably would have liked this book more. It ended too soon after she got her act together! I would really have enjoyed reading about her experiences while traveling on photographic assignments rather than her endless vacillating over her domestic crisis. I have read many novels by Ms. Steel, and I generally have enjoyed reading them. Unfortunately this was not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Bittersweet ' was a big disappointment","review":"I am a die-hard Danielle Steel fan.

Her portrayal of India presented a very annoying character. By the book's conclusion, I couldn't stand her - how can she be written as such a wonderful mother, yet she was ready to end her life via the car accident when Paul broke off their relationship.Danielle Steel needs to concentrate more on the quality of her books instead of the quantity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bittersweet should have been a short story!","review":"To my great disappointment, this one just didn't cut it for me. Steel stretched this premise way too far without enough action to keep it interesting. She kept going over and over the same \\"un-fulfilled, mis-understood, unloved\\" theme until I almost went nuts. When was India going to snap out of it,see her husband for the louse he was and get on with her life? Not for at least 150 pages! Her long-suffering type of martyr personality (even with her new love)left me unsympathetic. It took real effort to finish the story, and when I did it was disappointing. A quickie, manufactured wrap up to a story too long in the telling and not nearly enough emotion to draw me in the way Steel usually does!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback---not her best!!!","review":"Two of us in the office rushed to buy this new book.....and came to the same conclusion....we think she wrote this one in her sleep! One of her worst efforts, cardboard characters, really slow, utterly predictable throughout, and she tends to repeat herself quite a bit, especially regarding how the characters feel...enough already, we get it!

Now she wants more, a chance to have a career and a family too. Unfortunately it takes 3/4 of the book to get to the point where the character decides she has the right to make a decision for her own happiness. The realization that she could choose herself first, was painfully slow. The new man in her life was also less than enthralling. Older, reeling from his recent loss, he mistakenly pushes her away.

I was astounded that India's husband, Doug, is painted with such a wicked brush. There is no way he could have been so insensitive all those years and she's only just starting to realize it? For a charcter who's supposed to have such insight with her camera, she's certainly blind without the lens in front of her face. I found myself getting annoyed the poor guy got this type of treatment from his creator and waited for the moment when the guy would display any sort of humanity.Having said that, I'll confess I did appreciate Steel's imagery. The sailboat is a bit over the top...but hey, it's a fantasy, right?In conclusion, I guess you could say one thing about this book: black and white (characters) and read all over (by her legions of fans)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent and poorly written","review":"I haven't read Danielle Steel in years, and though she's advanced beyond 20-something lovers facing Perils of Pauline strife, Bittersweet definitely left a bitter taste in my mouth. Anyone who reads or watches popular media will be familiar w/her recent romance/marriage/pending divorce from a wealthy yachtsman and will have People Magazine and Entertainment Tonight snippets in their head as they read this book. As a result, this book comes off as self-indulgent and made me wonder if her next book will feature a romance between a thin, beautiful, and wealthy woman and a tanned former-movie-star turned bon vivant (Steel is now dating George Hamilton). My advice? Steer clear of this one.TTFN, Laurie Likes Books All About Romance ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Ugh!","review":"I just don't get it. Why are there so many raves about this author? This was horrible. India was an idiot of a woman. The minute your husband tells you he doesn't love you anymore, there should be an instinct that kicks in saying, Time to drop him. I don't care how many years you've been together. You don't stay with somebody who treats you like that. Time and time again I wanted to yell, Stand up for yourself, woman!

Her husband, was narrow and difficult and could not see her personal struggle. In fact, he was totally against her starting up the career again.

This was just a bad seed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The romantic ending was well worth the boring reading.","review":"I liked Bittersweet; the middle'age housewife syndrome, I think, hits most of us at one time or another. At times, the story got boring and oh too predictable (as many of hers do ). The romantic ending, coming through a ''hurricane'' to India ---- was well worth reading to the end for -- It caused me to go in the family room and ask my husband , \\"\\" Would you go through a hurricane for me?\\"\\" Thank you, Danielle Steel; now I am patiently waiting for Granny Dan to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book very boring.","review":"Certainly not up to her \\"Jewels\\" status.

We have the insensitive husband who views his wife as nothing more than a babsitter and maid. We have the talented wife who has given up her career to raise a family. We have the zillionaire Wall Street type with superstar wife who is a tiger in his business dealings but somehow comes across as just a \\"little bit wimpy\\" as a man. This is formula stuff for DS. We've seen all these characters before in other DS novels. They're very hard to sympathize with. I found myself hoping they'd all drown on the zillionaire's gigantic sail boat.

They seemed perfect for what I was wanting, according to the description and published specs. But, they saw very little service because of the difficulty finding the target, keeping it steady, and focusing. Focusing was extremely hard. We could not use them at all and we both tried. A more expensive and higher quality binocular may have worked. Even an inexpensive 7X50 would have been okay for what I wanted. Bushnell makes good stuff, but this 10X32 binocular did not work for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice toy for a child","review":"I had a similar-design pair of decent binoculars years ago (Nikons, I think), which were, of course, more expensive. I was expecting these to be as small as those were. These are smallish but definitely not pocketable in a shirt. I was hoping to give them to a friend as an improvement on opera glasses but they are way too big and only marginally better optically.The optical quality is about what you'd expect for $20 or so. The eyepoint is awkward, there's a bright ring of light around the image, and there just isn't any sharpness except in the very middle of the image. Flare characteristics are terrible. But if I were 10 years old I'd think they were pretty cool. They look reasonably tough, as long as you keep them dry.If you want something small to really look at things try to get something at the lower end of the price scale of the name brands (Nikon Canon Vortex Olympus Pentax)I'm going to keep these in my car's trunk, just in case I'm desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok set of binoculars","review":"I wasn't expecting much for the price of these binoculars but something basic for hunting where I could make out deer at about 200 yards at dusk and dawn when shooting light wasn't abundant. I was in a field facing NW in the afternoon as the sun was setting and behind the field was a tree line. Once the sun went behind the tree line, maybe the angle we were facing or the conditions that day but the glare on the binoculars were horrible it made them pretty much useless and nothing more than paper weight.Also, the string that comes attached to these binoculars aren't interchangeable with after market parts and poorly designed so you have to move them before using the binoculars as they tend to cover the eye pieces.Hopefully, these will come in handy in a different location but don't expect too much from these. There are reasons why some binoculars with the same power and design go up to $2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"These are very handy.

There are unmistakable artifacts of scanning, as if the entire book was photocopied, page by page.Unfortunately, this makes the diagrams quite difficult to decipher at times, and makes for an uncomfortable reading experience. Items supposed to be discerned by shade are difficult to interpret, details are difficult to make out, and text quality is generally unacceptable.It is worth noting that mine is a \\"second\\" edition - I have to wonder if perhaps Addison Wesley lost the master and then had to scan them for reprint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book(Farrah Hassan P.1)","review":"When I choose to read this book I thought it was going to be boring, because the cover seemed so dull to me.

After finally rediscovering it and rereading it, it's every bit as good as I remember-- better, even, since I had expected the writing to be aimed at children, but found it to be strong and mature. Once or twice I did find it transparently preachy, but the excellent plot makes up for that. This is a story about a boy finding out that he is capable of more than he ever thought possible, and does it in such an interesting way that it really stands out from the crowd.

This movie is terribly boring. Dull. Uninteresting. Etc. Lots and Lots of talking, standing around, doing nothing. Even the action can hardly be called action. Worse, the characters do so many stupid things, I was starting to cheer on the villain...whoever/whatever that may be. Example? They bring cotton balls to block out a sound they suspect drives people mad. Cotton balls. Then there are all the unanswered questions. Do not watch this movie if you want closure at the end of a film. You won't get it. In short, this is almost unwatchable. I had to constantly stop the film, do something else that was more interesting...like laundry, and come back to it. It was a chore to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"All of It","review":"This had all the ingredients to be a great story. Very interesting back story, a slow build, and a capable cast. The problem is that the slow build stays slow, even when things start happening. The movie felt much longer than 1 hr 40 min. Possibly with better direction and a stronger cast it could have peaked nicely. This is not a slasher movie, so don't go into it thinking that otherwise you will really be disappointed. The beginning of the movie felt very Blair Witch to me. The creepy legend, trying to interview people, getting lost in the woods, people breaking down, etc. It is not done in the found footage style though. I thought the ending was terrible and not very satisfying. If you have nothing to do and this is a free stream on Netflix or such, maybe give it a try.

It was an hour and a half of 'People go missing, they hear music, then go crazy.' Just like the last group. I understand the end and it's metaphor, but the entirety of it all was comprised of nothingness and unsatisfactory drama. Its mostly talking and screaming. Some of the parts were hard to watch, not that they were disturbing in any way, but that they were presented in a manner that was more vexing than entertaining. The methods used to make the movie were sub part to Marylin Manson's methods to demonstrate 'Horror' in his movies with subliminal flashes. I wish I had my life back.

Read the other reviews for the nitty gritty details. Very cool premise and build up, but when you do that you have to pay off in equal amounts - this doesn't, not even close. It's extremely disappointing they could not have come up with a better end (to the Yellow Broke Road...). I understand not answering all the questions and wanting to leave an ending with some deep creepy questions, but they dont' pull it off here. It is much more of WTF type of ending.

The writing-directing team of Andy Mitton and Jesse Holland set the action in a backwoods forest and follow a group of contemporary trail mappers who set out along the same route to get to the bottom of the mystery.

The only thing I don't like is if I take them for more than a few months my hair stagnates and grows even slower than normal.

All the tunes are just so bland; they plod along in a very conventional, new-agey kind of way with the occasional tabla, flute or monastic chant thrown in to lend a vague exotic feel, but you just sit there wondering when the real musical journey is going to start. It never does.For those looking to explore the wide range of excellent ethno-electronica out there, Buddha Bar is not your starting point. Instead, check out some of the big names of the genre: Loop Guru, Shpongle, Banco De Gaia, Bill Laswell and Makyo are all in a league far beyond this meagre compilation.

I've bought this album like 7 years ago and when I first listened to it I almost threw it into the basket. Camel is a unique band, they can make fabulous things like no one on earth and follow that song with senseless tracks. After listening instead of hearing it, Rain Dances is now my favourite Camel album. It is one of the best rythm bases I've ever heard Sinclair and Ward were a marvelous team. First Light, Unevensong, One of these days..., Skylines and Rain Dances are excellent songs. Andy Ward's work on Unevensong its simply amazing, it makes me believe this guy was born in a cymbal store, incredible. He deserves 10 stars. Mel Collins too. However, as Camel use to be, the rest of the songs are only to fill in the space or to register some filthy track for more possible royalties.

Unfortunately, it is not much of an improvement on 84's Stationary Traveler. As with S.T. production spoils this outing. The drums and keyboards in particular sound dated. The drums are too loud in the mix and are further spoiled with a too liberal use of echo. The keyboards rely too much on a tacky sounding electric piano. Latimer also fails to play with his usual brilliant flair. The songs are not particularly interesting and Susan Hoover's lyrics (which are typically quite good) give way to overused cliche (\\"we need you so\\"?). It's a shame as Latimer and company are capable of much better. Things improved some (but not dramatically) with 1997's Harbour of Tears.

Being in graduate school and broke, I tend to buy clay-based litter because it's cheaper. The grocery store in my neighborhood had this product on sale, so I figured I'd give it a whirl. NEVER AGAIN. The litter does not clump as well as other litters, if at all. It clumps into tiny balls making it almost impossible to remove from the clean litter. Also, the STENCH coming from the litter box is repulsive. I have to hold my breath when I clean it. Granted, litter boxes typically aren't something I want to sit next to, but the entire first floor of my house smells disgusting thanks to this litter.

Swheat Scoop is less dusty than World's GreatestNow for the bad part:1. I am very allergic to the dust Swheat Scoop causes2. The clumping sticks like glue to the bottom of the box, no matter how deep I filled it.3. The instructions on how to use it were in the bottom of the bag, which didn't halp until I'd already used most of it.4. The litter tracks much worse than World's Greatest, since the clumps are harder, they stick between paws easier, and are transported to all areas of the house.5.

This to the extent that you might need to remove the bottom bins from the shelf and hold them in your hand in order to nestle the to-be-added bin onto the top of the stack. As for hanging on pegboard, they hang with their base at about a 20 degree angle (from horizontal) on 1/8\\" pegboard and about a 40 degree angle on 1/4\\" pegboard. Then, as you add more and more weight, they begin to level out somewhat. I didn't like the look (with each bin at a different angle, depending on weight) and chose to remove the pegboard tabs and, in their place, drill holes on the back side, suitable for hanging the bins on conventional pegboard hooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS SHOWN","review":"I ordered these bins because they are shown and described as being able to mount on a peg board. When I received the bins, the ones they sent did not have this capability.

I love Lindsey and I picked this one up hoping the more romance, intrigue and drama that I've come to expect. Wrong! The plot is so convoluted and filled with references to the other novels that it's like wading through the mud trying to figure out what's going on. The characters have zero spark and there's no reason to even hope they get together. My attitude throughout the entire book is \\"I wish this would just end already.\\" It didn't do so fast enough so I just gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike Lindsey","review":"I was very disappointed when I read this book. It's nothing like all the other, what I consider GOOD, books by Johanna Lindsey I have read. The plot made no sense at all to me and I was constantly putting it down and going off to do something more intresting. I suppose Ms. Lindsey is trying a new theme for her romances but I think that she is really best at sticking to historical settings and historical characters. In the mean time, I suppose I will have to make do with my supply of old Lindseys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's hope this is Johanna's low point","review":"Johanna Lindsey is my favorite romance novelist. Sadly, Heart of a Warrior didn't live up to my expectations. Sorry, but Dalden the warrior/alien/barbarian didn't do much for me-- warning, folks--this book contains an attempt at science fiction. But Lindsey, a romance novelist, doesn't quite know how to go about it. Stick to romance, dear.The romance in this book is the only thing that is saving it. At least I could believe their love for each other.I can understand that someone who writes as many books as Lindsey does will have a book or two that doesn't live up to the quality of the rest of her books. Sadly, this is one of those few."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too bad, considering... but not good","review":"First a word of warning, this book requires that you read the other 2 first, about Dalden's sister and mother, or it'd be really confusing.Actually, even if you read the others, this book is not up to par. Science fiction, imo, doesn't mix well with fantasy, especially if it tries to cross with reality. The practicality, or rather unpracticality, doesn't seem to cross her mind, and is shrugged off nonchalantly. Also, Britanny, supposedly a modern woman, capitulates way too easily to the way of the barbarians. It doesn't fit, as time-travels don't fit.Otherwise, I think this book is more or less the same as all the recent Lindsey books, not bad exactly, but definitely not as good as her older books (the Mallorys)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect alien story with a Cinderella touch","review":"Oh, come on, what woman worth her weight in salt wouldn't want a 7ft golden male god persuing and fighting for her. Why do earth women have to be so stubborn. After Star Trek and New Generation, I would give anything for a man like Dalden to take my breath and heart away. The story was all the better because I hadn't read the first two before hand. Course now I want to, and can't find them. This story was laid out exactly as I thought it should be, and I didn't care that there were no real surprises, other than the offworldly kind. It was perfect for my earthly mind to dream of what may come some day. A golden god to sweep me away from an antiquated, polluted plant."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I was very disappointed. I never got past the second chapter.

Little did I realize this was /not/ a stand alone book. After the first promising chapter staring a 30 yr old virgin (hmmmm), we progressed on to the SF portion of the book with the hero named Dalden.Soon, I was overwhelmed with sci-fi jargon and long interludes featuring characters from other books. This would be fine if kept to a minimum. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Since I have never read the other books I have no clue who Challen or his lifemate are...And didn't particularly care, I quickly lost interest. This seemed more like a 'reunion' book than a romance.Perhaps this book might be good for those who've read the others in the series and want to find out what 'happened' to the other characters. For someone new to the series, I just couldn't grasp it, and this quickly became a wall-banger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart of a Warrior","review":"No her best work in fact compared to the first two books in the series this one is pretty bad.

This book starts off very slowly, and then it becomes confusing. I could not figure out within the first chapter what was the plot about.

Try again Johanna, do what Stella did, GET YOUR GROOVE BACK. I skipped over so many pages just to get to the ending and even then it was not worth my time or effort, which, means not worth buying.Sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart of a Computer","review":"This book should have been called \\"Heart of a Computer\\" since it was really about the vast capabilities of the Mock II. Martha did everything, went everywhere, and fixed most of the problems. Why was Dalden so passive? He was not raised that way. Why was Britanny so pathetic? American women are famous for their ability to embrace new frontiers. This book was filled with boring monologue from the omnipresent Martha about why the cultures of the two of them were so different. Why didn't Ms. Lindsay write scenes in which these differences become exposed and create conflict, humor or love as she did in the other two books about the Ly San Ters. Then we could discover the differences for ourselves and enjoy reading about the solutions she writes for her characters. Maybe she's just gotten lazy and she decided to let Martha handle that too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Romance?","review":"Romance? Where? I must have missed that page. Off-world traveler Dalden meets earthling Brittany; two lust-hazed days later, he completes his mission and returns to his home planet with new \\"lifemate\\" Brittany in tow. Will they live happily ever after? WHO CARES?!?!Most of the book is Brittany arguing with the ship's computer (a truly obnoxious presence named Martha) or with Dalden about whether he is really from another planet or if someone (from the X-Files perhaps) is playing an elaborate hoax. She's afraid that if she admits Dalden is from another planet, someone will leap out, shout \\"Ha, we win, game over\\" and she'll never see Dalden again.This is the first Lindsey book I've read, and it is probably the last.

I usually thoroughly enjoy her stories, but this one was different. The female character in this story chose to \\" not believe\\" in the story herself. I don't want to ruin the plot... just in case someone decides to purchase the book. But I am very disappointed with this particular story. I have never struggled to finish one of her books.

It is perhaps interesting to Science Fiction funs, but there is pracically no romance in it. The relationships are empty and I am sure the author could have done more. She did not put any heart in it so I do not think I will ever buy a book from her.I should have read and listened more to the others writing about it. I do not agree the Sensualility rating about the book either, as the emotion is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart of a Warrior","review":"Heart of a Warrior is the third book in a series that began with Warrior's Woman. Though Martha's (the super computer)comments were funny in the previous romances, I felt that Johanna Lindsey went overboard with her this time. Martha's character dominates in this novel, often times spouting psychobabble or redundant information. Both Dalden and Brittany spend more time talking to her than to each other. The two of them seemed to have no reason to love each other besides the fact that they were both tall. I didn't appreciate the age difference. Alien or not, he was only 21 and she was almost 30. Brittany spent the majority of the novel not believing that she's left earth despite overwhelming evidence. Her refusal oversteps \\"stubborn.\\" It soon becomes just plain stupid. This novel only served to make me miss Warrior's Woman--a far superior novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better stick to your historical stories and romances....","review":"I love your historical stories better...Futuristic stories lack your 'usual' charm and I agree with some of the readers who have written their comments about this book and the other futuristic-books-you-have-written.I did not finish this book... after a few hours, I got bored and uninterested."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even close!","review":"of course we wanted dalden to have his story - but this was pretty bad.

The punishment scene was frustrating after such a build up and then nothing happens. I was glad that Dalden finally got his own story and revisiting Challen and Tedra (Warriors Woman)was good. I would have to say don't waste the money, wait for this book to come to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhmm....Lindsey wrote this?","review":"Before you purchase this book please be advised the reviews on this page are better reading. I can only assume someone forced Ms. Lindsey to write this third book because it certainly does not reflect any love of storyline or characters. By the way anyone notice that Warriors Woman took place 2139... let's take a quick look at how our world has changed in 100yrs...think it may look a bit different 2160?

Now I wish that it still had not. Brittany is great on earth, but is a major wimp in Daldens world. She refuses to believe that she is not on some major sound stage. Get real! There is no sizzling passion between Dalen and Brittany, I am not sure why he wanted her. If you want great stories read the 1st 2. I loved Tedra and Shallens stories, they were literally out of this world. This one has more dynamic between Tedra's computer Martha and Brittany than Dalden and Brittany. Wait for paperback, used bookstore or paperback!! Too bad, I was really looking forward to it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I am an avid Johanna Lindsey reader, own all of the books that she's ever written, but with this one - even I could not wait to put the book down.Ms. Lindsey has probably lost sight of what she does best - writing romances. Heart of A Warrior is basically a \\"flashback book\\". There were more flashbacks ( descriptions of the characters in previous books, how they met, how they fell in love etc) than an actual plot to the latest in the Ly-san-ter romances.I don't need to know how Tedra came to end up with Challon, or why Falon was chasing Shanelle half way around the galaxy. THAT was already part of a previous book. Ms. Lindsey should have just concentrated on this book, and left the rest alone.On a positive note, however, if you do decide to buy this book, then you will not need to buy the other two previous Ly-san-Ter series books. This book would have flashed back to the other two books as well, and it would be a waste of your time and money to have all three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words: Soooo bad.","review":"I can usually expect a decent read from Johanna Lindsey.

Just keep simple Johanna, the way you used to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I own and love several Johanna Lindsey novels. This is one of the worse by far. Daldan is boring; Brittney is rather stupid and purely self-aware only. HOW can she decide that all of these people, animals, and [in her mind] special effects are only to mind-screw her. Seriously?? I could only skim this book, it's too bad otherwise. The very sad part is that the two previous books in this series were great and I loved them...but this is a major waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not JL best work...","review":"I agree with many of the reviewers regarding this novel. When I first check this book out from the library I didn't know that it was part of a series. So the flashbacks didn't bother me. However, what did bother me was the total lack of chemistry between Dalden and Brittany! There was no romance, no passion and I don't know where that 8 sensuality rating came. The only thing they had in commom was their height which was the first thing that attracted Brittany to Dalden when she first saw him. He had his mission and she was basically his guide. Where was the romance in that? There was way too much Martha. She never shut up. Brittany was about as bright as a piece of wood. Her refusal to accept that Dalden was from another planet despite the constant proof namely Martha, his spaceship, his planet, the huge house cat ect... was so annoying.

Had I even guessed from the back cover that it was a continuation of the outer space series I would have walked on by. Its confusing and disjointed, jumping from one thought to the next. Throughout the book I wondered what was in the heroine's head. She spends most of the book believing the hero was a nutcase pulling a very elaborate hoax on her. And this is who she loves??? I also spent a good portion of my reading time wondering what to make for dinner, what to wear for work the next day, what kind of cake to serve for my daughter's birthday. In other words, this story definitely does not bring the reader into the storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh how I looked forward to this book.","review":"Oh how I looked forward to this book and what a major disappointment it is. One word describes it: boring. The major characters have no appeal and there's so little plot. And, quite frankly, I was hoping in vain for good sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I have read several books by Johanna Lindsey and enjoyed them all. However, this book was terrible. It was boring, slow and the heroine was extremely annoying. She spent most of the book thinking that it was all an elaborate hoax and kept coming up with the most ridiculous explanations for the things she was seeing. I normally reread books several times but this one has been relegated to the attic and I dont expect it will be coming down again anytime soon. Dont bother with this book its not worth the money nor the time and effort it takes to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"I can't believe I am about to say this about a Johanna Lindsey novel. I did not enjoy this book at all. I admit I had taken a bit of a break from her books as I have been reading Diana Gabaldon so I was unaware of the two previous books in the series but UGH! Dalden did nothing for me with his warrior's \\"control\\", Brittany's disbelief gets old real fast, and there seemed to be no plot whatsoever. All in all, quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?!?!?","review":"I am a huge Johanna Lindsey fan and after reading WARRIOR'S WOMAN and KEEPER OF THE HEART, I couldn't wait to read the third installment. What a disappointment! The whole book is based on the heroine, Brittany, talking to the computer, Martha. There was barely anything going on between Brittany and Dalden. It wasn't even Dalden who got to save Brittany when she was attacked by some animal on his planet. by the time he shows up, she is already brand new again. The book seems to be more about the friendship between Brittany and Martha then about any romance between Dalden and Brittany. The first two books in this series were excellent and worth repeat reads. This one, though, is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sure This Qualifies For Even ONE Star!","review":"Wow--was I ever disappointed! I haven't read Lindsey in quite a while, so when I purchased this book and started reading it, I kept having to double-check the cover to make sure this was \\"The\\" Johanna Lindsey writing this book. It was awful! The computer (Martha) drove me nuts with her continual remarks and interruptions in a plot that was hard enough to believe to begin with!!! Where, oh where, did Johanna Lindsey go??? If you love Johanna Lindsey's historical romances, you will be so disappointed in this! P.S. \\"The Pursuit\\" was another disappontment. Although it is considered historical romance, it severely lacked \\"romance\\" and a believeable story. I found myself opening up her old books a re-reading them--they're, by far, better than what she's been doing lately."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Waste of Time","review":"I started to read Johanna Lindsey to see why she's a bestselling author. Frankly I'm still trying to figure it out. The whole book was incredibly silly, and there were plot holes you could drive a truck through. I guess once you're a name like Lindsy you don't have to try any more (I understand some of her earlier books are quite good). I guess it could also be that futuristic fantasy type stuff doesn't work for me, but even the romance portion was pretty dull stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. What happened to Lindsey?!","review":"Johanna Lindsey used to be one of my favorite authors but over the last several years, her work has gone steadily downhill (for me).The first, almost 1/4 of the book is a vague and muddled history of Dalden's mother and sister's lives. (I didn't read those books), so it was very confusing. Lindsey used to be able to intermingle characters from her other stories seemlessly, but not here.Brittany's character who is supposed to be intelligent, independent and self-sufficient, allows a strange, 7-foot \\"foreigner\\" to sleep over as soon as she meets him. How naive and unreal.Martha's presence is annoying and detrimental to the couple's development, though it doesn't matter here, as there's no real development. Nothing interesting anyway.Big pass, and I will be more leary of buying any of Johanna Lindsey's works in future, until she gets her stories back in shape.Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very disappointing!","review":"I couldn't believe this was a Johanna Lindsey! I was sceptical when I read about the storyline, but hey this was Dalden, brother of Shanelle and son of Tedra, so I had to buy it. Big disappointment. Dalden never came to live, and apart from fysical attraction between Brittany and Dalden I couldn't see why they would get together.The most annoying part was Brittany's unrelenting disbelieve that anything she saw was real. I kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't.The only interresting 'character' was Martha, Tedra's Mock II computer, with her wicked sense of humor.So safe your money, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"Johanna Lindsay authored \\"Angel\\", one of my all-time favorite romances. So, I was sorely disappointed when I bought \\"Heart of a Warrior\\" and started reading. I kept waiting for it to get better. Instead it steadily went downhill. There was absolutely no chemistry between the hero and heroine. Ms. Lindsay is so talented, I hope she will return to writing the kinds of stories she does best."},{"rating":"2","title":"heart of a warrior","review":"My review may be a bit bias based on the fact that I am a collector of Johanna Lindsey's novels. But I wiil say that there are some that makes them more interesting and enjoyable. Heart of a Warrior was one, as it was different in the style of writing that she chose to use for her setting, in that it was removed from the traditional setting normally adapted to in these novels. This however did not detract from the story line as it serves to highens plot making the reader having to think about the things written. Now the major coup of the book was the character, they were humorous, down to earth saying what they think people not hiding all their emotions to the bitter end. This made them lovable and real. This book is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me?????","review":"I read a few of the other reviews first, just to see if I was the only one. I have been a BIG fan of JL for over 20 years, so I can't help but doubt that \\"Heart of a Warrior\\" was even written by her. I'd hate to think she has ghost writers, but it took me over two weeks to get through this newest novel, and it usually only takes me a few days. Way TOO much technical and background information, and the supercomputer, Martha, had more of a major role than Dalden and Brittany did. I also have been upset the last few years that her books come out in hardback first and won't go to paperback for a year. If the rest of you JL fans are getting tired of this and would like to read great stories with great passion and flow, check out a Teresa Medieres novel. I fear she will become my new favorite romance novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"Save your dollars. Check this one out at the library. I give Lindsey one more chance after that she's off the instant buy list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - Not nearly a Lindsey best","review":"The book was mediocre, but I was disappointed because the novel didn't stay in the appropriate time line. The first book of the series took place in the future {the 2100's}. In this one, they were clearly on present day earth.

If you have to read it, wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Like many other reviewers I have read everything that Johanna Lindsey has written. When I first read what the plot of this book was I cringed. I was not thrilled with the other futuristic novel but it's a Lindsey so I had to read it. I was so disappointed, more than anything by the lack of billed-up in the book. Not to mention the inconsistancy. I mean, how could the heroin leave the planet and her family not even be mentioned. I wont stop reading her books because I do love all the others, but don't read this one as your fist Lindsey novel, try any one of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Heart of a Warrior","review":"I have read all of Ms. Lindsey's books.

She was shallow and I would have been quite happy if Tedra had thumped her once or twice.From now on, I'll just re read my favourite Lindsey novels and let the new ones alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooring","review":"I love Ms. Lindsey and eagerly wait for her new book to come out.

I'm left feeling she is just not as interested in writing with the same quality and attention getting detail, drama, and romance that true fans have come to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not paying for a hard back again","review":"I had high hopes as I enjoyed the first two books of this series, but they were dashed. I broke a rule of mine to not pay for a hard back of Lindsey's again because they haven't had the fun, sex and romance that got me hooked years ago. But Dalden's story had to be good right? More like Martha's story-I've had enough of her \\"Babe\\". I just hope that Jeremy Malory's long awaited story will have that same old magic. My advice-wait for the paperback and even then at the used book store. You know I'm really not bitter just a disappointed long term fan. Who body snatched one of my favorite authors?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Johanna Lindsey at Her Best","review":"As soon as I heard there would be another \\"Warrior\\" book, I planned to buy it the day it was available. I'm glad I did. Ms. Lindsey has once again delivered characters you feel you know intimately, and fun, fun, fun! This is the most enjoyable book I have read in months. Bravo Johanna!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it no stars, I would","review":"Yuk, Yuk and Yuk. Lindsey loves to bring old characters from previous novels into more recent novels. I think this is an excuse she uses not to have to develop new characters. This book took the cake on revisting previous characters. In fact the book was more re-introducing you to them then it was a new story.Her conversations were too frequent and boring. I did not like the Brittany or Dalen. They had no chemistry as far as I am concerned. I could not even finish this one, what a waste of cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.....","review":"I have been a fan of Johanna Lindsey since I started to read romance books some 15 years ago. I was anticipating reading the follow up to Warrior's Woman and Keeper of My Heart. I should have kept waiting. Keeping in mind of the poor reviews this book recieved, I had borrowed this book to find out first hand if the book would live up to my expectations of a Johanna Lindsey novel. I am really sorry to say it did not. The book dragged on with Brittany not believing what she was seeing. It had the potential of being a great book if the characters would just have some form of spark between them.The book kept going over what had happened in the 2 previous books, which was a disappointment since I have read both books, repeatedly.This does not prevent me from buying future books, however, I will be hard pressed to buy one just because Johanna Lindsey wrote it, which is what I used to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm Milqetoast Offering","review":"If you expect to see the father in the son - you'll be sorely disappointed. Dalden is NOT his father's son. This one in the series suffers from a lack of romance, good plot and is outrightly shallow. The fascinating world of Sha'Kaan is barely delved into and for this reader, Ms. Lindsay has done us fans an injustice. The heroine is hard to like or empathise with. She spends the last two thirds of the book in complete denial - if Ms. Lindsay is to believed - three months of being unable to accept Dalden for who he says he is despite both his and the brassy computer's repeated attempts. Oh, good grief!!I had a hard time finishing the book and I wondered why I ever bothered to in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor third installment...","review":"If you loved \\"Warrior's Woman\\" and \\"Keeper of the Heart,\\" then like me, you were anxiously waiting for Dalden's story. In a word, the book was \\"pathetic.\\" There was just too much story, and absolutely no chemistry between the characters. Who really cared about the whole conflict of the inter-worlds? And Dalden's punishment was a joke! It is official now, after many disappointing new books, Johanna Lindsey has lost her touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book? Not Lindsey","review":"I understand that it is a standard practice for romance writers who are successful to get a break and let someone else write using their name. However when will Johanna wake up and smell the coffee. As with the past 4 books. This book does not measure up. The problem here is that we have to pay more for hard backs and we should get more for our money, not less. I used to purchase ALL her books. Now I just borrow them or go to the library. Her books USED to make me want to read them over and over again. Now I struggle reading the book once. I don't know who is editing these books, but they should have their head examined. This book could not have been written by the same person who wrote the first two books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"It was like wading through a science text book. I love her historical romance, but this had me desperately trying to find some spark with the characters. There is so much background information before we ever even get into the action, so much telling instead of showing, which breaks all the basic rules of novel writing, that I wonder she ever thought that all the details about the heroins roommate and the heroes entire family, sister, brother in law etc, was even remotely important compared to the essential aspect of romance: the hero and heroine are shown to fall in love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the heat, the sexual tension, the excitement?","review":"Yikes, what a disappointment. Too much time is spent with Martha the Computer and not enough with the warrior. Brittany's not believing what they tell her gets boring pretty quickly.There were some missed opportunities for developing the story. For example, Dalden goes off to talk with his father about his lifemate. He comes back and they go on a \\"honeymoon\\" of sorts. Why not write a chapter about this visit with dad. The characters of Challen, Tedra, Shanelle, etc. are barely around.This was a lazily written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as dishwater","review":"Heart of a Warrior is a lesson I will not soon forget. (Referring to unabridged audio book version) Dalden sounds great, too bad he chose Brittany as his life-mate because she slept in his arms so comfortably. Boy, was he robbed. Brittany's skepticism became so nauseating I started to hope one of the Sha-Ka'an creatures would take her out. I dearly love all Johanna Lindsey novels with this big exception. Save your money and buy older Lindsey novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book!","review":"I was so excited when I saw this book at the bookstore. I loved Ms. Lindsey's first futuristic novel, \\"Warrior's Woman\\". I think this book should have been entitled \\"Martha's Revenge\\" It is really about that annoying computer. There is no depth to any of the characters. I thought this would be a romance, but no, there was absolutely no romance in this book. It was BOORRING!! If you want an exciting romance with a lot of sexual tension go back to Ms. Lindsey's first books. The last 5 books she has written have gotten progressively worse. I wish I could write her for my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS AN AWFUL BOOK!!","review":"Let me begin by saying that I have been reading sci-fi for over 30 years and love the genre, but this supposed sci-fi/romance is just plain awful!! The science fiction part of the story is extremely derivative of old Star Trek shows (\\"phazers\\" for ST's phasers, etc.), the plot is threadbare, and the romance is totally unbelieveable. The talkative computer, a plot device used to explain things to the dense heroine, is extremely annoying (why does she keep calling Brittany \\"doll\\"?). And doesn't William Morrow (the publisher) have any editors working for them? The book is very choppily written, especially the first few chapters setting up the aliens' back story. Johanna, please give up the sci-fi pretense and go back to what you know best, writing historical romances!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I have read all of Johanna Lindsey's book and have loved each and every one of them, except this book. I hated it. I kept trying to pick it up and I found myself rereading lines because much of it made no sense and I did not care about these characters. Save your money and buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"spit, spit, spit","review":"No juicy scenes, no steamy debates, no humor. NOTHING!The annoying computer needed to be unplugged. Brittany was dim. I can't compare this to anything else JL has written. I kept thinking -- is some kinda joke!?! Who wrote this crap?Lindsey was my favorite. If this were my 1st by her, I'd be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"You got to be kidding Lindsey!!","review":"I don't know what is wrong with her imagination lately but it seems \\"the well is running dry\\". I was gritting my teeth dying to finish this novel. I didn't care for any of the characters. The only one I remembered was Tedra and I don't remember her being so high-stronged from the other novel. Either Lindsey writes with more interesting plots, change the sceneries or just stop writing for awhile and hopefully from the absence she'll get inspired again and tell great stories. Sorry but this book is lack-luster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Without Heart","review":"Without mentioning the rape and explicitly violent books written by the author, this is her very worst. An interesting read at from the begining to the middle, but after that-dead in the water. Anyone ever notice the enormous amount of twins found in JL's books? Also, unless it is a sequal, there is a suprising lack of a maternal parent in virtually all of her stories. Although the character had a mother in this one, she is suprisingly(or rather unsuprisingly) absent. Not once does this girl think about all the wory her mother is going to experience as a result of her disappearence. Furthermore, I'd like to meet an American woman who would put up with being PUNISHED! But then again I'd like to meet an American woman over 25 who is still a virgin. A little realism in my fantasy please. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Really, this is disappointing! I wonder if this is a romance novel or a fantasy narration. Brittany and Dalden barely interact enough to fall in love. In fact, there are more ink of Brittany interacting with the computer Martha than with Dalden. There is virtually no sex scene, which makes this book unbearingly dull. Brittany is not an impressive lead character, rather stupid and stubborn. How could she keep convincing herself that she is in some fantasy programme?! This romance just doesn't hold water."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"I have to agree with all the readers blasting away at JL. I've enjoyed many of her books before but this was absolute garbage. Too much Martha, too little interaction between B. and D. Plus could Brittnay be more stupid?!!? She's on a spaceship for 3 months and she still thinks its an experiment. Give me a break. I've come to expect much more from JL, and am sad that I'll now think twice about reading one of her books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indifferent at best","review":"This is certainly not one of Johanna Lindsey's best works. My disappointment stems from the fact that this is the third in a series of spine-tinglingly great books and it just doesn't measure up at all. The storyline is very weak and doesn't contain Lindsey's normal twists and turns. I'd recommend reading this only if you are dying to find out what happens to Tedra's son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timaeus a unique dialogue","review":"this book is an important work to read if you are interested in or studying the Timaeus dialogue. The book contains a translation with a running comentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hokey Pokey","review":"This is a very charming book--takes a person back to their childhood. The illustrations are outstanding, full of expression with an innocent style."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book!","review":"hey if you need help getting gold on all missions like i do, or help with the story mode, get this book! plus it has pictures of all the characters except super sonic, and all the race tracks that you do in story mode, free race, time attack, and world grand prix, and pictures from the survival mode and extra stages, and from mission mode! read it if you are stuck on getting gold on missions or story mode, or just for the pictures! i'm getting it for all those reasons to get all gold on all missions, to help me with story mode, and for the pictures! i also wanna thank sega, and sonic team for making such a great sonic game ever! and ever since the first sonic games they've kept making them and i love them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for introducing children to classical music and composers","review":"This book and CD was recommended to me by a friend. It is a wonderful way to introduce children to classical music and the composers. I am using it to teach a class that includes ages 4 through 10. The CD contains short sections of well known classical music and words have been added that includes information about who wrote the music and something about them. The kids really enjoy marching or dancing to the music and the words help them retain the information that they need to know for the class. The book is sectioned into the different musical periods and includes short biographies about the composers, along with key dates and vocabulary. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the musical quality isn't as good as you would get on a traditional classical CD with full orchestra. Regardless, it's a wonderful resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last....a way to remember who wrote what!","review":"After listening to this CD for just three weeks (usually in the car on the way to school), my three and four-year-old sons were able to recognize and name at least 30 composers and the pieces they wrote. I highly recommend this book and CD for anyone who wants a fun and easy way to remember classical themes. It works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid Friendly, Mother Approved","review":"Themes to Remember, Volume 1 is a kid friendly system for teaching the appreciation of classical music. I wish this book and CD had been available when I was young, I might not have thought classical music was such a bore. I'd recommend this to any parent who wants to widen their child's musical horizons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Magic!","review":"Themes to Remember, Volume 1, is a great book to anyone that doesn't know that much about classical music, especially kids. The book has a great system of introducing terms, new composers, and music. It is illustrated with very cute characters that will interest kids and keep them learning about all that classical music has to offer. It's a great book - well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"book review","review":"Great book for a candy maker.

Not only were alot of the recipes not \\"common\\" or even appitizing, but the printing was very bad. In the middle of the book, they duplicated about 20 prior pages and then left out about 30 additional pages. I was so upset, I contacted the supplier. They did give me my money back, but I was very disappointed. there are a million other books to get if you're looking for a candy making book. don't buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent study of Central Asia","review":"An exellent book (if a little hard to find) covering the history of Central Asia (Turkisan) roughly from the Arab conquest up to the Mongol invasion and settlement.The book goes into detail the political relations between the rulers of Turkistan with its Arab and Persian neighbours including every detail, money used, social and political relations etc.The book also goes into detail about the Mongol conquest starting with the initial reasons for the invasion down to the Mongol settlement and colonisation of Central Asia.An exellent book well worth a read for anyone with an interest in Islamic history and culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Ship's Log Book is a totally captivating reading experienc","review":"From the moment Captain Farrar takes you aboard on his first assignment, until he swallows the anchor (retires), this book will keep you spell bound.

His powerful and inspirational works have been described as rags to riches stories, illustrating how down-and-outs, poor or broke men and women, even kids, can achieve the American Dream of wealth and success through hard work, courage, determination, enterprise and concern for others.2010 is the best year for Alger! Rediscover him today! One of his best books, read it and pass it on - it will only help the economy! :)Each of his many wonderful and captivating stories involves Alger's main character achieving extreme wealth and the eventual elimination of their \\"old ghosts\\" or enemies. While Alger is noted as a significant figure in the history of American cultural and social ideals is message still needs to be heard more today, in our present economic situation.Truly great story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought 3 of these as gifts--All had problems","review":"For $200 bucks/set you would think they could have tested them.

Romola Garai, the stunning beauty of Daniel Deronda, looks more natural here, smeared with muck and dressed in rags. Her character is a bit hard to believe (she'll do anything to survive, and pulls off amazing feats) and I wasn't always rooting for her. But better her than the horrible English officers. They were either uptight prudes who could severely whip a woman or ambitious snobs who could watch as prisoners get brutally raped. Some of the escape scenes were extremely tense, and the production values were good. I recommend this for those with strong stomachs and a love of historical drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant","review":"This movie was excellent.

I'm feelin this more than the Vast Aire joint. neva again is classic with a wu vibe to it and from then on he can pretty much keep up with that level. Production is pretty deep as well, this is more than the standard repeating loops. Only complaint I'd have is that the overall sound could be fatter.. but that has nothing to with vordul. He delivers, consistent flows like we know from the cold vein album. Pretty much the same subject matter and style. If you didn't like el-p's production you might like this.only track I don't like is Blade. It's a wack beat and vordul doesn't match it. Lame attempt at a club track. Stay Up and Struggles are beautifull.Too bad Nature Sounds has already released 3 of these tracks on a compilation so I already played them to death. Still 1 skip out of 13 tracks is exceptional. Just get it.. and support an honest and original mc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vordul Megallah","review":"Vordul finally hits us with his long anticipated solo effort and i have to say it was well worth the wait. He did a great job picking out beats here, theres even a couple of joints that wouldn't have sounded out of place on the Cold Vein album. Suprisingly the only unworthy track was the joint Vast appears on. Unless your down with the typical bouncy club joints you'll probably be skipping that track when listening to this CD. My only other complaint with Yung Havoks is you won't hear Vordul spit about much of anything except struggling in the ghetto, and tough times, he does it well, but 13 tracks on the same subject can tend to be a little redundant. Don't let that steer you away from buying this though, if you loved Cold Vein you'll probably dig this joint. Vordul's solo is miles ahead of Vast's album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"The only reason I gave this album 4 stars is cause it got to the end before I was ready. All the songs are great, but one that really stands out to me is Meagallah.

It would have been great if it just moved. Also, all three of my cats are scared of it and very rarely go near it.

After hearing countless positive reviews about this movie I decided to see for myself what all the hype was about. In a world of countless bad romantic dramady's I was expecting Say Anything to be a moving unsentimetal view of a new relationship. This is little more than your standard chick flick. Not to say that this is Katherine Heigle chick flick bad, but its also not a very original depiction of a new budding romance. Thier were scenes in this movie that made me cringe because of its cornyness. This would all be fine if I were a 17 year old girl but I happen to be a 30 year old man, and when a movie gets this much acclaim it should speak to all demographics.

Especially back when he was young and quirky. He plays Lloyd, a real goofball, that worships and loves (albeit from afar) Diane, \\"miss perfect and untouchable\\". She has the grades, looks, manners, in other words; \\"the whole package\\". They're getting ready to graduate from high-school and if he's going to make his move he'd better hurry or he might never have the chance again. This is a sweet, lighthearted movie that has a good \\"moral to the story\\" kinda undertone. By the end of the movie you're going to cheer for John Cusak's and Ione Sky's \\"it's odd but somehow it works\\" relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip Hip Hooray for Cameron Crowe","review":"\\"Say Anything\\" is one of the best films around on growing up. John Cusack and Ione Skye, under the direction of Cameron Crowe, give outstanding performances and never misstep as two teenagers who fall in love. John Mahoney is also good in a supporting role. I watched this movie about a month ago after not having seen it in a while and, again, was struck by how real and moving the dialogue was. In our age of dumb-downed teenage flicks, that's no easy feat."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of John Cusack's best","review":"This is definatley one of the \\"must have\\" John Cusack films! A wonderful movie, one of the best endings to a movie ever! I was kind of dissapointed in the DVD, however. The deleted scenes section could've been longer, and I guess I was expecting a little more bonus material.It is still a great movie though, and worth purchasing for any John Cusack fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aweome buy","review":"Great price for a classic movie.

Youthful desire fully realized in a timeless tale of blind love rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cinema!!","review":"This is great cinema! Say Anything is romantic, and quite funny at times. It is well acted, and the casting was perfect,. Everyone in the movie did a good. It has a wonderful plot, and the writer knows how to tell a good story. If I were you, I get off the computer and find this INCREDIBLE film and BUY IT!! Or better yet, just buy it here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Cusack is Sharp\\"","review":"Not only is his famous coat and army pants a symbol of the ever-funny and always unpredictable Cusack, but he rates right up there in this movie with the best. A untypical teenager who is not fretting over life choices he has to make after he graduates high school, Cusack decides to put his hard work and energy into a relationship with Ione Skye. This movie is great for 2 reasons: 1. John Cusack is in it! 2. Peter Gabriel's song \\"In Your Eyes\\" is featured during a romantic interlude!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guilty Pleasure","review":"This is one of those movies that isn't just a date film. Guys will secretly watch it when they're alone.Crowe knows how to mirror the range of emotions both sexes go through in the ups and downs of a relationship. It's this kind of emotional realism that attracts both sexes to his films. The men aren't plastic Fabios, idealized and unreal, meant to appeal to the escapist side in a female audience. The women aren't congenial Barbies, serving without demanding, meant to appeal to the escapist side in a male audience.Instead, the guys and the gals go through Hell, and it's the Hell so many of us have been through ourselves. Every guy has been Lloyd, sitting with his stupid friends as they try to console him with macho cliches... And it's this everyman touch, this commonality of experience between Crowe's characters and his audience that gets a guy to watch a \\"chick film\\" like this without a chick at his side."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen\\"","review":"Every time I watch Say Anything I love it a little bit more. I don't know what it is. The loner guy who aims a bit too high in hoping that the class valedictorian will be the one for him. The perfect girl who can only reveal her insecurities around the guy who no one can imagine her with. The daddy's girl who learns her father isn't as perfect as she always believed. All of which are elements of teen film that have been done to death, but there's something about Say Anything, maybe that it came before all those other played-out teen films that tried so hard to be like it. Maybe John Cusack and Ione Skye's innocent portrayals of young love. Whatever it is, this is a movie that only gets better with time. Even if you've already seen this movie, I'd highly suggest watching it again. Like a fine wine, this film only gets better with age."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like John Cusack, you will love this movie","review":"This is one of the most down to earth romantic movies I have ever seen. Who would not love to be the object of Lloyd Dobbler's affection. I can see this movie over and over again and never tire of it. John is an incredible actor and is so real, it stings at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's genre","review":"This movie is a goodie too. For fans of John Cusack like myself, it's a touching story of a a father who doesn't really give his daughter much time to socialise. John Cusack's character is in love with her and wants to get to know her better, but her father has other ideas. Great music and even Eric Stolz makes a cameo in it too. Watch out for him in a scene wearing a bird suit. It's a soft version of the teenage angst, but still delightful to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Teen Romance!","review":"This is a Wonderful, honest and knowing teen romance. John Cusack is great as the charismatic kickboxer Lloyd, and so are Ione Skye and John Mahoney. Great film that stands way above the average teenage drama-romance, they don't make them like this anymore. Great acting, great script, rings true to many viewers, see this movie. If you like John Cusack I recommend 'The Grifters'. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie an 8!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and waay overrated.","review":"Dull attempt at a romantic film.

The scene where he holds up the radio still gives me goosebumps. That scene alone is worth the entire price of the movie. I bought this video for a girl that I really like that's going away to school in Maryland for a year and thinks Cusack is really cute. I hope when she sees him holding up that radio, she sees me."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I gave her my heart, and she gave me a pen!\\"","review":"I saw this movie because there was nothing else on and I ended up watching the whole thing. I was so surprised to see Joan Cusack (one of my favorites) in it. It was such an 80's movie and I love it for that! Now my list goes \\"Breakfast Club\\", \\"Pretty In Pink\\", \\"Say Anything...\\" There are so many memorable parts. If you like 80's movies like the ones mentioned above then you'll like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiny, Charming, Perfect","review":"Among my most cherished memories are those of each of my daughters sitting on their daddy's lap as he read this to them, with special voices for each character, the girls shaking their tiny fists at Stinky Stuart.

It's what happens when video making becomes democratic. She lingers on a rat, yes a rat, in Venice. We watch her wash her cloths.

If you have a calm pet and this was for a car or RV or whatever, I'm sure it would be fine. But if it's for a pet like mine, then this is definitely NOT a non-spill water bowl....I'm either going to try adding velcro on the bottom of the bowl or find something heavy to put this in so she can't flip it over.

I have a raised platform in the back of the Element where the back seats used to be and its' got carpet on it. .. which kind of sucks because I'm worried about mold forming if it ever gets wet.Anyway..

I can test my setup and make sure I got everything where I want it without disturbing the patrons and whatever crappy song they have on the jukebox. I generally don't have a use for them during the gig itself, but if you play softer stuff, I'm sure they would work great.Just a note though, once the first rod breaks, the rest of them follow suit pretty quick.

The pace was slow, the mood dreamy and the characters interesting.The theme is contemporary -- a 41-year old successful female architect, unmarried and pregnant by choice, visits her home town of Spokane Washington to come to terms with her past. Her childhood has been broken by her mother's desertion when she was 9 years old, and her memories of her childhood with her father and brother haunt her. Little by little, the reader is drawn into the story of her family and the final resolution brings completion to her questions about the past.The story is small but the writing is good, and I was drawn into the character's thought processes and memories.

To find out if he (the boy) stays with friends and car you have to read the book.I thought it was amazing, spontaneous, and packed with surprises like when the boy wakes up to find the man peaking through the plastic sheet that is keeping the rain out and says something along the lines of, \\"Can I join you in there, out of the rain?\\" I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure, cars, or any of Gary Paulsen's other books. You should and can buy it or get it at your local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Car","review":"This book is about a kid named Terry. His mom and dad don't care about him and abandon him later on by accident. Meanwhile Terry comes across his dad's car kit and builds it back up. Later he meets some people that become his friends and go on an adventure. I think this book was amazing. There's alot of adventure, it's surprising, and makes you want to read more after the first chapter. I recommend this book to people that love muscle cars and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!","review":"Maybe I'm prejudiced. I love to work on cars. One of my favorite childhood books was The Red Car, with the MG TF and Frenchy. So maybe I'm prejudiced in favor of red cars that look like MG TF's and adult kids (like me) who are \\"car crazy.\\"Doesn't matter -- I loved this book. Done my truckin too, in my \\"Truckula\\", whom I have taken apart and put back together many times. Met some great people, saw some beautiful scenery outside -- and in my heart soul and my mind -- while truckin/travelin.This is a great book of adventure and special buddies, wisdom and philosophy, the kind you find while travelin' thru the wide open spaces to the small towns.Oh... PS -- How soon we forget history -- It's \\"Stirling\\" Moss."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"Before reading this novel, I listed Dorothy Sayers as one of my favorite authors and Lord Peter Wimsey as one of my favorite fictional characters. However, other than a short story, of which I remember only one line, this was my introduction to Harriet Vane. I just did not find her appealing. I will go back and read the novel that introduces her, but I must say that this novel would be improved with more Peter and less Harriet. It was also difficult to keep the dons straight. They all seemed rather homogeneous and uninteresting. Lord Peter remains one of my favorite fictional characters, but I would not recommend this novel to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get \\"Absolutely The Best\\" instead.","review":"I was so disappointed at Liquid 8 Records for the careless job they did with this 10-song collection. First off, they misspelled some of the song titles. (What's \\"Jungle Jangle\\"? What's \\"Easy Girl\\"?) Also, the track listing doesn't match what's on the disc itself.The quality is good but it's engineered so the songs fade-out too soon. Also, in spite of using Pro Tools for the mastering, they couldn't get out those tape bumps at the start of \\"Bang-Shang-A-Lang\\" or \\"Who's Your Baby\\" that are deftly silenced on \\"Absolutely The Best of The Archies\\" and \\"The Archies\\" (On RKO Records). So pass on this one and get \\"Absolutely The Best of The Archies\\" instead. The quality is superb and they have 16 songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is by far the best recipe guide available...","review":"I've bartended for 7 years and I've gotta say that this book has the most current and creative recipes in the market today.

I purchased it in Salamanca a few days later and have enjoyed it since then, but be warned, it is neither easy listening nor for faint of heart.

The whole 2nd side is gorgeous, especially \\"Sasquatch\\" & \\"A Heart's Desire/End Peace,\\" \\"Manic\\" is an Xtremely angry-sounding tale of schizophrenia, & \\"Camelogue\\" & \\"Today's Goodbye\\" R at least pleasant & intresting. The 1st side's more of a problem: \\"No Easy Answer\\" is OK, & \\"Heroes\\" is nice ... but the rest IS a significant drop-off in quality from previous albums. So play the 2nd side, Njoy the guest work by Peter Bardens & Anthony Phillips, & take it 4 what it is -- perhaps not as \\"progressive\\" as the band's hard-core fans would like, but still real nice. I think Latimer held-up pretty well under the commercial pressure from his record company. This is as good as the earlier BREATHLESS and I CAN SEE YOUR HOUSE FROM HERE, if not as solid as SNOW GOOSE or NUDE...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A moment of transition and confusion","review":"This was a strange time for Camel--the only real illusion this album has to being a Camel album is that Andrew Latimer is on every track. The one highlight is Sasquatch. Peter Bardens comes back to the fold to play some nice keyboards, supported by Anthony Phillips' (Genesis) twelve-string and Simon Phillips'(Jon Anderson's Animation, The Who, Mike Rutherford, etc.) amazing drum playing. I got this album mostly because Anthony and Simon were on it, and thought there would be more great moments. The official Camel web site talks about how fun this album was to make, and that energy does come through. I just wish some more good music would have come out of it. Camel is a great band, with their first 5 albums being extreme classics. This album is mostly for someone wanting the entire Camel catalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A commercial compromise","review":"Sadly this excellent band had to make some concessions to the powers-that-be of the record industry. Because of that this album and the following -and better- Stationary Traveller were released.Particularly this one was named The Single Factor ironically honouring the whim the record company had to achieve that single FM-hit song which could raise some money.Just forget this poor work.

What it does NOT do is explain how to use technical indicators in conjuction with each other to reach real decision-making success. Frankly, I have yet to find a book that does this.

This book still leaves out few things the ways it is organized. It could have been split into two sections 1. Stock Indicators 2. Market Indicators. It also leaves out some of the calculation details and some calculations are ambiguous. Overall, it is good reference book on technical indicators. I will recommend to anyone who is interested in technical analysis and would like to have quick-reference book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect as a beginner's guide as well as a desktop reference","review":"This book serves well as a one-shot reference to the vast array of technical indicators, and perhaps this is the only single book that can claim to have achieved this. The mathematical level is kept simple and accessible to all, even though I would have preferred to see more formulas of the complicated indicators that got skipped (like Swing Index). Surprisingly, the formula for the highly popular Relative Strength Index is not amplified on. Nevertheless, this is *the* starting book for the beginner as well as a means of introduction into more complex indices. The book introduces the reader to all fundamental market concepts and \\"forces\\" with amazing simplicity and lucidity without sacrificing accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow reference","review":"The book provides limited descriptions of most techncial indicators used in trading.

The Swing Index and the Accumulation Swing Index require opening prices.Step-by-step instructions on calculating the Swing Index are provided in Wilder's book, New Concepts In Technical Trading Systems.\\".As the book is available for free at Metastock's web site and as most of the indicators are covered much better for free around the web, its not really worth buying the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dictionary with concise commentary and examples","review":"Extremely pleased with the purchase and reading experience.

The cinematography was terrible as if the person holding the camera was clueless. At least if it was shot beautifully then I could at least have a relaxing time watching it.There seemed to be no point to this documentary, and there was nothing to be learned. The short interviews with the nuns were superficial in content, and this is the only Buddhist documentary I have seen that made Buddhism seem stupid.

I put both CD's in my player. The Audio Fidelity remaster sounds fine. But so does the 1994 Atlantic remaster. The difference is not that great. I think the strings in the Audio Fidelity remaster sound a bit richer and overall the album sounds, shall I say, brighter, more strident, if you will. And as I've noticed in a lot of remasters, the bass is amped up. But not the volume, thankfully. Many remasters are way louder, perhaps because of an improved signal-to-noise ratio.I'm not disappointed in the Audio Fidelity effort, but you can probably find the Atlantic remaster of 1994 at half the price of the AF, and the difference is almost indistinguishable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"I think I spent about two months of my life listening to nothing else except CS&N.

Your best bet is to play skirmish mishions or against a frined over the network.

I admire Jani Lane for trying to seek for new sounds and try to match with the 90's garbage music. But this was horrible! It's so sad that this was the last Warrant record of original material with Jani. I just hate this sound, hate the lyrics, hate the songs.

I loved every single page. It's a difficult book to describe, except to say that the title is spot on. If you are a new believer or if you have been a believer for decades, this book is for you.

The transition from live to studio improvisations resulted in more structured songs, but the mind-blowing quality of Arachnoid's chasm of earth-shattering, scary, exploratory psychedelia fortunatelly remained in that release. The dual assault of the droney, menacing, feedback-drenched acid guitars, combined with the powerfull rhytm section, is outstanding, especially on tracks like \\"Square Wheels\\", \\"Good Grief\\" and \\"Stereo Saturation\\".

If you really want to read something written by a pro, and with much better techniques (and results) I'd suggest you buy Building Kitchen Cabinets by Udo Schmidt.

It provides very scant information about making doors.I would not use a 5/8\\" melamine PCB (as recommended in the book)to make the sides and bottom of drawers, which increases the weight, decreases its effectual height and storage capacity.

He has one piece of information he feels is very important (and I agree), use a 5/8\\" melamine backer board. However, he harps on this idea in several chapters. Once would have been enough. He also prefers to purchase cabinet doors rather than make them.

And NOT in super-cool space ships? (Ships that, as I recall, were only seen in footage canibalized from the original show?)I have only vague memories of this show, but what I clearly remember was being a very peeved ten-year-old. Irritated because they'd turned my beloved Battlestar Galactica into a crappy CHiPs knock-off.But perhaps the fog of time has obscured my memory of it. Perhaps it's really the Citizen Kane of television shows and I'm maligning it unfairly.But I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1 episode is worth it","review":"I remember these shows, and in a single word they sucked. I did not enjoy the recycling of footage from the 1970s episodes.Stay away from this box set.With that out of the way, only 1 episode was worth watching, and is the only redeeming value to this series (I am talking about the 1980 series not the rest), and yes you guess it Starbuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!!!!","review":"Ranks up there with the \\"Star Wars Holiday Special\\" as some of the worst Sci-Fi ever put on TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battlestar Bad-actica","review":"Never was a classic show so trashed as with this follow up piece of you know what!I had hoped to forget it ever existed.... too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Added to library.","review":"I remember watching this TV series when I was younger and this is just one of many series which I am collecting. So far, so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad, and actually pretty good!","review":"I've read many poor reviews of Galactica 1980 over the years, so I was expecting a pretty cruddy show. To my surprise, I actually enjoyed it! Sure, it's more like \\"Galactica on Earth\\" than a space show, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed it any less.It's great to see Adama and Boomer again, and the last episode is really good too. Also, the pilot episode was excellent, as well. Are there some campy moments? Sure. But the original BSG had them too. I found many BSG episodes slow and hard to get through, surprisingly, I got through G:1980 rather quickly.I say pick it up and add it to your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"When this came out I decided to watch it. Having gotten into the new Battlestar Galactica Series that ended last year on Sci-Fi, I figured I ought to watch the original series and this. 1980 is long, drawn out, and boring. It's storyline did not flow well and it is painfully obvious that this series was just slapped together. The only good episode is the last one of the series. I believe it's called The Return of Starbuck. Don't waste your money or time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did NBC Bother with Galactica 1980????","review":"I remember this show when it was on TV. I agree with the reviewer that said the return of Starbuck episode was best. Forget the rest. Being in a 7PM time slot, the producers had to make something educational. I don't get it. All the aspects that made the show exciting to watch were removed. What happened? Did the producers say lets forget what we did before? I don't know what producer Glen Larsen was thinking when he put this show on the air. There was a series of novels written by Larsen that continue the Galactica story; had they made it to season two. They are far better than what ended up on TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Starbuck\\" episode","review":"I only saw Galactica 80 one time, very long time ago. I was twelve or something, I remember it was certainly not in the same league as the original.There was 1 episode however which was great, the last \\"starbuck\\" episode! For me, this episode is worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"No where near what I remembered","review":"If you were a teen like me when this came out, Battlestar was still a big deal. I guess when you grow up, though, sometimes your younger brain remembers things differently. I forgot how cheezy the acting was. Sure, the effects were state of the art at the time, but still, acting is acting. It was still fun seeing the Galactica finally reach Earth, but beyond that, it was a let down.I should have stuck with my own memories. They were better than reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get it out of your system","review":"Galactica 1980 is terrible. Besides the constant reuse of the same cut scenes over and over for special effect, and the seemingly every shortening cast & changeout throughout, the storyline itself is also poor. Conceptually, this series had the potential to be successful, but based on the actual execution of the plot, this is by far the most excruciating 10 hours of film you could subject yourself to. If you are a BSG fan, get this out of your system and wait for the upcoming season on SCI-FI."},{"rating":"1","title":"It depends on your point of view","review":"I have two seperate ratings for this particular show. First, when compared with the original series it gets maybe a half of a star on a good day when I'm in a somewhat decent mood. The writing sucked and the acting was even worse. I think it could be described as a live action Saturday morning cartoon. It's like the main characters of the show were kids and they seemed to be the only ones on the show who knew what they were doing and or talking about. Adama is reduced to some kind of bumbling bafoon and the fleet is entrusted to somekind of a child super genious.However, second, when compared to the crap that is passing off as Battlestar Galactica today on the Sci-Fi Channel (or as it should be known as, \\"Death To A Classic\\"), Galactica 1980 gets about 563.2 stars on a bad day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I remember back in 1979-early 1980, hearing the commericals for a new show, \\"Tenspeed and Brownshoe\\" and the announcer saying \\"right after Galactica.\\" Did I hear right? When I heard the commercial next, and heard that end phrase, I went wild. My favorite show of all time is coming back! And I was going to premiere around my birthday. What a nice present from Universal. Then I saw the first episodes...Folks, save your money. The only good episode is \\"The Return of Starbuck.\\" And if that was not a fake beard Lorne Greene was wearing, somebody shoot the barber!In Galactica fandom, we even ignore this $#&$^^#. Please save your money and buy the reimagined episodes instead.I would love to give this no stars, but I can't. I grudgingly give it one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Perfect, but better than the modern BSG!","review":"I must have seen every episode of this series when it came out as a seven year old boy back in St. Louis and I LOVED it! Sure it has some campy moments, but so did the original, and maybe it played up to kids a little too much, but hey I WAS a kid. I saw this entire series awhile back on the Sci-fi channel and loved every episode. There was so much potential! It should have lasted longer! This DVD collection is a must buy for me.P.S. The \\"Return of StarBuck\\" episode is great, but the Holloween 2-parter is a much more fun episode and is where HUMAN Cylons appear for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont know","review":"It wasn't the movie I thought it was. I have only watch a little bit of it so I don't know what I think of it at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthy Only If You're a Fan","review":"If you love all things Battlestar Galactica then this is a must own, but I doubt many people will be watching any episodes twice, with the exception of the Starbuck guest star episode which might get a second glance. This series was guilty of so many sins of television (so many there's no point in going through all of them) that it couldn't help to be awful.Worth your time only if you're a BSG completist (hence the two stars) but otherwise follow the course of many BSG fans and consider this not in continuity with the original series and stay clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly the bottom of the barrel","review":"One star for the show at this price- but not worth it still.Essentially fans of the old BSG will add this after finishing the BSG DVDs, and probably regret it.This was an unbelievable letdown, and as a twelve-year old BSG fan in 1980 I was outraged, so if you're over twelve you may be even less content with this travesty. The quality of the other reviews here are good, yes the Starbuck episode is good, so for 20 bucks you can have that and \\"complete the collection.\\" The comparison to the Star Wars Holiday Special was particularly apt. If you can't get enough of teh \\"classic\\" BSG, then maybe this is teh cure. Heh. YMMV.How can this be out on DVD and still no Six Million Dollar Man? (yeah, I know the legal issues, I'm talking consumer priorities here)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Not much of a sci-fi show.Hooray, they made it to earth, a 1980's earth, and leave a contingent of BSGians while BSG leaves so the Psylons won't follow them there.The BSGian kids can jump 20 ft in the air with a wonderful \\"boing\\" sound effect. All BSGians apparently learned advanced Quantum physics in grade school and can solve any problem just by looking at it on paper.I'm a huge reenvisioned BSG fan, and this \\"1980\\" show is a joke in comparison to it or the original BSG.I made it through 3 epsiodes before giving up...RENT ONLY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good","review":"I got this DVD, but it locks up all the time. One show I can't see period of the 8 shows on the two disks, because I can't get it past the blockage where it stopped. The others are fine. The others are perfect, and I would still get this set with all the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low budget & campy, but worth seeing.","review":"I agree with most of the former reviewers. This is a sad, after thought to the most ground-breaking sci-fi TV series EVER: Battlestar Galactica, the Epic Series (1978).The amazing music, the Cyclons, the cast, the writing and the incredible miniatures created by John Dykstra - the genius behind the spaceships in Star Wars - brought an epic, cinematic approach to television never before seen.I recommend this only as a \\"completion\\" to your original BSG collection, and for the handful of cool episodes mentioned in the other reviews.As far as the \\"new\\" Battlestar Galactica, I can only say one thing: CHEESE. The CGI is the WORST. The acting is third rate, and the writing is a FAR cry from the original series. I suffered through three episodes on the Sci-Fi channel and refused to watch it again. It may even be worse than 1980. It just cannot recreate the magic and genius of Glen Larson's original. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is only one real BSG!","review":"There is only one real Battlestar Galactica and this is not it! Do not confuse this with the original cast or series which is far superior. The original BSG was canceled and when ABC realized they screwed up they scrambled to come up with a second season. However, most of the actors had gone one to other projects. This horrible series was hacked together and tried to capitalize on the Galactica name.I gave this 2 stars because it has the Return of Starbuck. They real Starbuck. You know, the MAN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Just painful.","review":"This is so painful to watch. Simply awful. I'm not sure which is worse, this or the Star Wars Holiday Special."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STARS is what I'd like to give it.","review":"Galactica 1980 has to be the worst sci-fi ever produced for television. Yes, even worse than Buck Rogers or Planet of the Apes (the series). I wouldn't go back & rewatch this show even if you paid me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Galactica was always a joke","review":"the 1978 series had tons of effects and no plot. This series had no plot, few effects, and bad acting. The new show is nothing but porn, but so many worship it like it was a new relgion or something. All in all a show for losers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battlestar Galactica 1980","review":"The only reason I bought this was to complete what I have on the series for Battlestar Galactica. I can see why this show was cancelled after a few episodes. I got tired of watching them chasing after that one guy who kept going to the past and watching scene after scene about the children. It was just too boring to watch them on Earth after being in outer space for so long. Only a die hard fan would want this and I guess that's why I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last episode is definitely the best","review":"Someone else commented on how lame this series was, except for the final episode. I totally agree. For the die hard Battlestar Galactica fan, it's worth having in a collection. It's also a fantastic contrast to the re-imagined series."},{"rating":"2","title":"battlestar galactica 1980","review":"a nice way to conmplete the story of the series. very enjoyable to watch over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first season but still fun to watch.","review":"Not as good as the first season but still fun to watch. I love the flying TURBO BIKES. The first season was one of my favorite shows. This one is still fun. Good price too. Arrived very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dream's a dream, whatever they say","review":"This album is probably the best thing Deep Purple has done since reforming in the Eighties. I don't know whether that's because of (then) new guitarist Steve Morse or not--he's terrific here, but so are Lord, Glover, Paicey and especially Ian Gillan, who hasn't sounded this cheerful and relaxed in awhile. \\"Ted the Mechanic\\" and \\"Rosa's Cantina\\" are typically nuts DP overkill; the real surprise is \\"The Aviator,\\" a folky change of pace that shows off Morse' mandolin and Gillan's way with words (he's one of the most underrated songwriters ever, perhaps because he's in a band where the riffs tend to dominate the songs). Maybe the band finally was able to chill with Ritchie Blackmore out the door for good, but whatever the reason, PURPENDICULAR is a great one. Crank it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"miss purpendicular at your own risk","review":"if you got here because you are interested in checking out post-Blackmore DP, wait no further and get Perpendicular - this CD is fantastic. For details please check out what other enthusiastic reviewers said (there is no value in reiterating the same ideas) but rest assured that this one absolutely rocks, and is better than Abandon (somewhat darker and heavier) and Bananas (very good but a touch lighter). You can tell that the guys had fun recording this. Steve Morse, at his first album with DP, gives it all and is up there with S.Lukather as far as taste is concerned-his blistering chromatisms fit just perfectly with DP's blues-tinted rock.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Purple with mandolin?","review":"That's no bull--in the song \\"Aviator\\", whose intonation and phrasing would make it possible for it to be done by a country act anyway. Not surprising when you think of it--this is the same outfit that did a pretty faithful cover of a Neil Diamond number (\\"Kentucky Woman\\") early on in their career. DP's draft of Steve Morse to replace Ritchie Blackmore worked out better than maybe they even foresaw. I'm not going to argue Morse's technical prowess over Blackmore--that's largely a question of taste. But Morse's mandolin in \\"Aviator\\" means he's got Blackmore beat all hollow on versatility. Only time will tell how that will work in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard","review":"\\"Purpendicular\\" just isn't that good of an album in my opinion. If ever there was an album that merited an \\"all right\\", this would be it. The material isn't very strong, Gillan sounds a bit tired, and the whole affair just doesn't quite cut it. The album's sole saving grace is Steve Morse. He plays with a vengeance, recalling more the Bolin glory days than Blackmore, but placing his indelible stamp on everything. A breath of fresh air that Purple sorely needed, but sadly the band doesn't have the songs this time out to warrant his effort. One of the weaker Deep Purple albums but still worth hearing if only for Steve's wicked riffing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes you just get lucky.","review":"I think I played it about 20 times in a row immediately after. Everything - but EVERYTHING - works perfectly here, with a special nod to Ian Paice and Steve Morse (nobody can produce a tone quite so squeaky clean). If you like just plain good rock and roll, with great lyrics, played well, and recorded well, by a band that's quite obviously having a great time, then BUY THIS CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Beyond Belief","review":"I have been a Deep Purple fan since listening to Perfect Strangers (1984). Since Ritchie Blackmore left, the songs are totally different. The guitar playing, by Morse, and the overall arrangements are sub-par. When Blackmore was there, his compositions were beautifully written and arranged, with phenomenal guitar rhythms and solos. Purpendicular sounds a little like \\"thrash\\" in some parts with cheesy lyrics. Simply put, IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED! Perfect Strangers, The House of Blue Light or The Battle Rages On... are all highly recommended. Blackmore should return."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is a huge dissapointment","review":"I'm a huge Deep Purple and an even bigger Steve Morse fan. I tried to like this album, and after listening to it four times, I gave up. The music has no spontaniety or punch. There is no excitement or catchy rhythmn. I really hope Steve Morse goes back to his progressive jazz and bluegrass roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of the SOUTH TEXAS JAM","review":"I recently saw DP in concert in Texas, man, oh, man, was I knocked out! The guys sounded great! So after the show, I thought I would bulk up my DP collection on CD, starting with the Morse era, so I ordered PURPENDICULAR, Well, I've heard it 4 times already! I like all the tracks! A solid effort! I can't believe I've waited so long to buy it! Better late than never! sidenote: Imho, DP sound better now in 2001 than they did back in '85 when I first saw them in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jame Joyce would be proud, but the rest of us will be bored.","review":"As a \\"stream of consiousness\\" novel (ala James Joyce's Portrait of an Arist as a Young Man), this book is rather good. However, for the casual sci-fi reader, this book comes across as confusing, disappointing and sadly, rather boring. The author shows great skill when delving into thoughts, emotions and matters of the human mind, but his lack of (or inattention to) plot dooms this work to the realms of banality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Concept; Wrong Author","review":"The concept behind the book is a good one, but it was rather poorly executed.

He was reading by the age of 2 and was absorbing knowledge like a sponge. When he reached age 4, he was reading at a first grade to almost second grade level and starting to do math. I was not sure how the keep him challenged and he was getting super bored with school. This book had many great pointers for both gifted and average kids. I am of the belief that all children have the advanced capacity to learn and that all children have learning \\"growth spurts\\" and stagnation in learning. This book points out getting passed the lull in learning. This book really lays out what the child might be feeling because is written from a person who is gifted and understands that from the child perspective. It also really is a good source for dealing with gifted children when they reach their teens. I definitely keep the book handy for when my son reachs that age.

Based on the ingredients and nutritional value, I think it's a pretty healthy choice. Unfortunately, it tastes awful. The bar itself is very dry and dense (like dry fruitcake) and with all the \\"greens\\" they've packed into this bar, it literally tastes like grass.

There are times when the writing is deep and emotional, times when it is laid back and thoughtful and times when the story is only that; a story told to those who are listening. It is all very modern-creative type writing with a deeper meaning settled somewhere within, but it is all so beautifully done that you might just find yourself revisiting the book again and again.

One I highly recommend is written by Brian Lovett who edited this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks useful information","review":"This is one of the most disappointing books on turkey hunting that I own and I own quite a few. The author spends a great deal of time writing about Brad Harris and Mark Drury's hunting experiences but without conveying any significant amount of useful information. There is too much narrative and not enough wisdom. I would also steer clear of Turkey Huntings (sic) Finer Points by Daniel A. Dia Paul. I would recommend the following books which I have read: Hunting Pressured Turkeys by Brian Lovett; Practical Turkey Hunting Strategies by Ray Eye; Advanced Turkey Hunting by Michael Hanback; Successful Turkey Hunting by M.D. Johnson; In the Turkey Woods by Jerome B. Robinson; The Complete Book of Wild Turkey Hunting by John Trout, Jr.; and, Turkey Hunting Tactics of the Pros by Richard Coombs.

And if not that, then it will certainly make you long for those nostalgic days back in India during the monsoon.There is also a pleasant cameo by Zakir Hussein's late father Ustad Allah Rakha; the sheer magnitude of rhythmic magic created by these two necessitates that these piece be in your musical collection. It is a Masterpiece, and nothing less.-Pratik"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange but beautiful album","review":"This album is one of those few of which I can say, every time I hear it, I get something different. The songs are melodic and ethereal, laden with guitars and keyboards that swoop and warble but never become incoherent.At first I didn't know what to make of all this. So many groups claim inspiration from this band, that I expected a format chained to the leaden beats of today. Surprise!

Single Pigeon is my favorite song on here,well it is today anyway.Loup is fun and the medley is pure Mccartney magic.As now they are adding bonus songs to the cd's great since i spent so much on the singles looking for these back in the early 70's.Great cd one of my favorites along with McCartney, Ram,Band on the Run,Venus and Mars.What i like best is that paul along with the other beatles never bothered to compete with the stuff they did as Beatles.They just did their thing and made some great music.Lucky for us.Peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Rose Rock Way","review":"An eclectic mix as usual with Paul. The album is extremely well mixed, and in 5.1, or on a ear-bud of high quality, tracks, such as Big Barn Bed stand out with some extremely excellent bass playing. Of course the stand out track is MY LOVE , its without a doubt the best, and most overwhelmingly so,track of the album.GENERAL COMMENTS:Get on the Right thing: Very RockyI Lie around: a bonus track that has some memorable, for me, Guitar work.One More Kiss: a good catchy song, Great riftLoup: Kinda myserious, and very atmospheric in the nicest way.Medley: Nice Concept. Works superbly.Little Dragonfly: an Ambient, Great mood, and in my feeling is the most Beatlesque of all the songs.For an album so close to the Beatle period, he has well and truly created his own persona by thistime, and like so many artists in the full sense, he experiments in all that he does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macca's Best Album","review":"I have to say, I am quite shocked by some of the reviews of \\"Red Rose Speedway.\\" This is by far, McCartney's best CD. I can understand an argument for \\"Ram,\\" which is a very, very close second. In regards to the production, it was a big step up from \\"Ram\\" and \\"McCartney.\\" The medley alone puts this CD at the top of my list, and shows the brilliance of Paul's songwriting, including his ability to create timeless melodies (let alone melodies that overlap each other!) If you want more of the Beatles, get \\"Red Rose Speedway.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen as an album not songs","review":"Yes, this album is somewhat weird...as Mr. Parkes said above. But weird in positive meaning, I think. Paul's solo career is filled up with too much 'commercial' stinks. Mostly regarded his best album is Band on the Run. I know BOTR surely has aged well for nearly 30 years. But after listening repeatedly, I can not help accepting it's a very polished 'commercial' album. With this stand of view, Red Rose Speedway steps aside, felt weird, even sounds experimental so sometimes it seems like someone else's album but Paul. Every song in this album may be inferior to songs in Band on the Run at least, but as a whole, the former beats the latter. Listen from first through last without intermittence.

Only Paul could get away with a ludicrous hit single such as \\"My Love.\\" However, the CD bonus tracks - \\"Hi Hi Hi,\\" \\"The Mess,\\" \\"I Lie Around\\" and the reggae-flavored \\"C Moon\\" - are consistently strong. McCartney really needs a box set to showcase these hidden gems."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just not quite there...","review":"Ya know... I've just now listened to this album for the first time in over twenty years. I have always wanted to like it and I almost do. The musicianship is top-notch, the arrangements are bold and daring, and the production is absolutely first-rate. The problem is the LYRICS. Paul has taken really really strong arrangements and has chosen to sing the most inane and weak lyrics on top of them. Whereas \\"Band on the Run\\" has great-sounding lyrics, there is just no redeeming lyrical value to this album. That is the difference. Great songs with weak lyrics that really detract from the total package.Sleeping on a big barn bed, lazy dyanamite, my love does it good, power cut (which must mean a loss of electrical power...Baby I love you sobe I love you soBaby I love you soBaby I love you sobe I love you sobe I love you so ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCartney's Best Work","review":"Red Rose Speedway is clearly Paul's most Beatlesque solo recording. Although perhaps less consistent than Band On The Run, Speedway is even more satisfying for lovers of Paul's more pop-oriented material. If you were to cross Meet the Beatles with Abbey Road, this album is what you would get. Immensely enjoyable and sentimental. And it contains Paul's most beautiful and carefully crafted song ever, Little Lamb Dragonfly. A five-star pop masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun listen","review":"Come on, other reviewers ... lighten up! No, this isn't Abbey Road, but I think people have come to expect a little too much perfection of McCartney. Must everything he do be on some high plane? Can't an album just be simply enjoyable and fun to listen to? Personally, I find this album very enjoyable -- always have. Brings back some great memories. Makes me feel good to listen to the songs. And isn't that really what music is all about? \\"Get on the Right Thing\\" is a fun, \\"feel good\\" song ... so is \\"When the Night\\" and the ending \\"Medley.\\" \\"Little Lamb Dragonfly\\" is a lovely, poignant song that I'm very fond of. I also think \\"One More Kiss\\" and \\"Single Pigeon\\" are quite nice. \\"My Love\\" goes without saying. I do admit I'm not that excited about \\"Big Barn Bed\\" or \\"Loup\\". But I say to you critics: where's the romance in your soul? Love songs don't have to be deadly serious to be good. If you're a true McCartney fan, you'll enjoy this album. If not, well ... to each his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Ballads","review":"RedRose Speedway brings a return of Paul's immense talent for ballads and simple love songs. The three songs Single Pigeon, One More Kiss and Little Lamb Dragonfly, are worth the price of admisson for this production.

Bien producido, muestra una banda con solvencia y, lo que es mejor, buenas caniones. Paul aparece muy sensible con la espectacular \\"My Love\\", un clásico por donde se lo mire. Además, está una pieza que creo que es la que más me gusta: Little Lamb Dragonfly, una balada hermosa, suave y con una melodía que se queda en la memoria.El medley del (original)lado B es sencillamente espectacular. Paul logró hacer de un compilado de canciones regulares una obra maestra, con dinámica y buenas combinaciones entre ellas.Quizás, lo que bajonea un poco el album sean los temas \\"Loup\\" y \\"Single Pigeon\\". Ahí se pierde la continuidad del disco. Eso es lo que diferencia uno bueno de uno grande."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Speedway Is Clogged","review":"Not his best, to be sure.

While no one would expect it to match up to that, you expect more than what is offered. \\"Loup (1st Indian On the Moon)\\", \\"When The Night\\" & \\"Single Pigeon\\" are among the worst songs of his career.

But then again, i'm not Paul McCartney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgrace","review":"When I first heard this album when it was initially released, I knew that my illusion was over, that the Beatles could do high quality work on their own on a consistent basis. I had suspected before this album that it might not be possible, but this fiasco clinched it in my mind. How could the guy who turned out classic song after classic song in each year from 1964 to 1969 put together such an uninspired, boring collection only a few years later? I am still amazed as I think about it today. This album stands as a monument to the decline of rock quality in the last three decades of the century."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad","review":"Poor old sausage!

The medley at the end has four solid songs and is a lot of fun. The rest of the CD is very playful and was probably a blast to make but it feels like it was written and recorded in a week. This can work for some artists but not for Paul.

Well, here 'tis!","review":"I agree 100% with the reviewer from Macondo: this is Paulie's worst album ever. Back in '73, I was still thinking it couldn't get any worse than Wild Life, but boy was I wrong. The first track, Big Barn Bed is kinda ok, but it's all downhill from there, and boy the hill is steep and the valley is low. The closing medley is so depressing, I have to lie down in my bed motionless for three days every time I hear it, just to recover. This first expanded edition of Wings was no good, the only good thing they did was disbanding shortly after this disastrous effort. It's funny how in 1973 Ringo, yes Ringo, was the only ex-Beatle to come up with a more or less decent album (check it out!). John delivered Mind Games, one of his least satisfying efforts, and George came up with Living in the Material World, which was only good because it inspired Madonna to sing Material Girl twelve years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars?

Is their anything on this album to rival Macca's top tunes? No. Few tracks would have made it on to any Beatles album, not even the worst bits of 'The White Album'. Give me 'Rocky Racoon' anyday! The inclusion of some halfway decent bonus tracks improves things, but 5 stars? His best solo work might make three and a half, ('Flaming Pie', 'Ram', 'Band On The Run'), but red Rose Spedway remains near the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Mess\\" is right","review":"I bought this album back in '73 based on the power of the flip side of the \\"My Love\\" single. \\"The Mess\\" was easily the coolest McCartney song I'd ever heard since the Beatles broke up (although Hi Hi Hi was close) and figured, well, even though it's not on the album (a mistake corrected by this CD release), SURELY most of the album rocks this hard.WRONG.Stupid Lyrics abound on this album. There's a reason \\"My Love\\" was the hit; like it or not, it's the best song on the record. \\"Get on the Right Thing\\" is a close second, but the rest of the album just sits there, astonishing you with its pretentiously bad lyrics.\\"Loup\\" is nice, only because there's no lyrics. The Medley on the end of this album consists of three or four partial songs that Paul coudn't fill out to a full tune.Perhaps he kept \\"The Mess\\" off this album because he knew that if he didn't critics would use it to describe the album.

They were always in the way of the controls and the LCD on the camer. They also impaired holding the camera -- I was fighting the dongles all the time. It was a relief to get this thing off the camera. It's OK as a secondary strap for a large lens or a medium camera case, where is is not on the camera itself.The detachable memory card carrier is a throw-away; there are better places to stow a card, where you don't have to rip your way through a rat nest of Velcro to get to it.

If your camera uses SD cards, you would probably like this strap more."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it","review":"this Lowepro Transporter Camera Strap is strong and versatile enough to help me in my photograghy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strap Review","review":"I have enjoyed the strap but my only complaint is that the fabric used around the neck area is not as comfortable as I thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Design Problem, Be Aware!!!","review":"This camera strap has a major design problem: there's no security lock for the side release buckles. The side release buckles are designed to allow quick interchangeability with other camera using the same strap. However, the two buckles are too easily releasable and there's no security lock to keep the strap and the camera from seperation. I have used the strap for a week, and one of the buckle got released by itself twice. I had only one camera. Luckily, I didn't drop my camera but I would never use this strap again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redesign would help","review":"While I am a big fan of LowePro quality, I was rather disappointed when I learned that the \\"quick release\\" clasps give way with the smallest amount of pressure. The strap is great but I currently have yarn connecting the two pieces of the quick release buckle so that it doesn't accidentally open and drop thousands of dollars worth of equipment. A different quick release (maybe like Kata's bullclip style) would be much more secure for regular use and still just as interchangeable. I don't recommend purchasing this product unless you have a plan for working around the quick release buckle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good replacement for OEM","review":"The reason I bought this strap is because of the quick release snaps that lets you take most of the strap off the camera. When you remove the strap, what remains is 2 or 3 inches of strap along with the snap/buckle on each side of the camera.I give this product 5 stars because overall it does a good job. My only nit is that when I use my camera on a tripod with the strap \\"clicked off\\", the remaining several inches do get in the way of making camera settings,etc. So now I leave the strap connected even when the camera is on the tripod. This keeps the short ends of the strap out of the way.I've had no problem or concern about the buckles coming loose at the wrong time. So far....it has worked fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera strap","review":"Comfortable strap with a good length. I like the hooks used to attach to the camera because it seems much less likely to fall off than attachments I've seen on most cameras. However, one of the key rings that was used to attach it to the camera actually broke in half when we tried to attach the camera. Easy to add a regular key ring to fix it, but frustrating that the first time we tried to use it, it broke. Otherwise, works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ring broke after 2 months usage","review":"I am disappointed with the product. I use it on Canon 40D for 1 month, around 3-4 times a week and one of the ring broke (the one that connected to the camera).The straps has little pockets that store 2 extra Compact Flash cards,when I am in shooting in portrait orientation, this container often annoy me by blocking my view.The shoulder strap is fine and better than Canon strap that I get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjustment Buckles Get In The Way","review":"Take a look at the photo of this strap. See the adjustment \\"buckles\\" at each end of the strap?These guys really get in your way. They don't allow the strap to twist and thus they bind when you're moving the camera for a vertical shot.Very annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect strap!","review":"This is a great strap! It's very comfortable once it's adjusted. My only problem with it is that since I don't like to have my camera hanging down that low, I can't adjust it so that the strap is short enough and the pad is directly behind my neck...now, it's a little off to the side. I still like the strap, though because it so sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"original down to the bone group","review":"Without any prejudice whatsoever, the original group who made the CD \\"From Manhattan to Staten\\" was a far better group in terms of a better rendition, because they were more natural with the African illulations and the drum beats along with organs, trumpets, saxaphones,tom tom,vocals, etc. My humble suggestion is that the original group should be regrouped taking a lead from the the first three(3) CD'S which were made, including \\"FROM MANHATTAN TO STATEN\\".If this is done I can assure you by GOD'S will that the CD'S will be a sellout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for jazz lovers.","review":"I have been following the group for some time and when I found this compilation immediately went to buy it.

It has grown to be a favorite, but it made me want more. Ms. Pierce should definetely go back and answer all of the questions she left us with.

It was fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book, but I was expecting more","review":"The Realms of the Gods is a pretty good book, with many of the elements that made me read her whole Immortals series. I guess I was expecting an incredible, character-changing ending to the series. That's not what you'll find here. The plot, with Daine and Numair wandering around the Divine Realms most of the time, doesn't seem quite as focused as in her other novels, and the ending made me want to throw the book against the wall and scream,\\"That's it?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is everything","review":"In the book The Realms of the Gods, there is everything. There are battles, monsters, gods and goddesses, budding romance and everything else you could hope for in a novel for teens and adults. It is wonderfully written and and a story that will keep you reading till you are done. One book that you won't put down. I do however advise you read the three books that come before this one in the series, The Immortals. Once you read this one you will want to read the rest of the books that Tamora Pierce has written. I recommend this book to everyone! Its wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"::::Sigh:::: another overrate Pierce Novel","review":"The author is losing her touch.

Numair has the exact same problems"},{"rating":"1","title":"Realm of the Gods","review":"This went over the top in a confusing and disjointed way. I felt like Tamora had just been to see \\"Alien\\" or some such and said, \\"Cool, I'll throw some of that in my book.\\" There were all sorts of amazing and horrible things that were about to consume the world, and then they just went away with a little godly interference or the right spell that someone happened to know. It seemed that Tamora was trying to get the visuals as fantastic as possible without worrying too much about weaving a good, tight story. The first three books were worth reading, but this was a let down. I felt the Alanna series was much better overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"second review","review":"I earlier wrote a review saying this book was 40% junk. I have changed my mind. I believe that this book rates 100% junk now. It is simplistic, disgusting, rather boring except for Leaf, predictable and a clear sign that Tamora Pierce is running out of creative ideas. Predictable, predictable. We are introduced to so many new things added to spice up the plot that it numbs the mind. Instead, most turn to the \\"blossoming romance\\" between Denominatior and Numerator. ALL YOU TAMORA PIERCE WORSHIPPERS GET REAL!! LIFE IS NOT HAPPILY EVER AFTER!!! Read the Toguh guide to fantasyland, and Terry Brooks reviews andyou will know what I think of romance worship."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!","review":"My reaction to this book is not rash. I read it at least 6 times and it gets better and better. However, I feel that the book ended rather abrutly and that Ms. Pierce should most definetly write another series involving Tortall. Her latest books (involving 4 misfits with magic) is a real let-down. I am still recovering from the shock. Besides, Ms. Pierce simply must tell what happens to Daine and Numair. She certainly wrote enough about Alanna's romances. I must state that, in conclusion, this book is a must-read and that the \\"reader from Indiana\\" is SOOO wrong in saying that this series was written hastily. READ IT AGAIN!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the best book!","review":"This book had action,humor,adventure,and romance. There was something for everyone!Numair is only 30! He sounds wonderful to me and I think Daine is old enough to make her own decisions. I know plenty of people who are married and have large age differences and they're all quite happy. I personally think that their romance added a new twist to an old story line. Their attraction was evident in the first book anyway,so if you didn't like it, you should have stopped reading the books right away. Besides,the age difference makes the story more romantic and captivating. Not the same \\"teen\\" romance books that are all nearly identical. Please,read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This was probably my favorite of the Immortals series. It was so good, that when I first started it, I couldn't put it down. And for those of you that didn't see the \\"thing\\" between Daine and Numair from the beginning, thinking it was more father/daughter, well, DUHHHHHH!!!0 I saw it since they first talked about hair. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um... think Mary K. Laterno","review":"I thought that this book was unncessary, as it answered the questions that we already knew the answer to. All that it accomplished was to get Numair and Daine together, a couple I didn't agree with anyway. Imagine how YOU would feel if your author married you to an uncle-figure. Think Mary K. Laterno. In my opinion, she should have married someone ELSE (ANYONE else). Evan or Kaddar are examples of more eligible bachelors. No plot. No character development. Meeting Weirin was a sort of let down, since nothing really happened. Characters were rather static throughout the book, especially compared to her other books. I did, however, really enjoy the dragons. As far as I'm concerned, this book was unncessary. It could have ended more satifactorily with Emperor Mage. No hate-mail, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Written!","review":"My favorite type of stories are fantasy and I think Tamora Pierce has done a great job writing them. She is my favorite author (of course) and this book is my favorite book of all times.To summarize it, Daine and Numair are trying to escape being killed when Daine's parents (who are now both gods) rescues both of them and bring them to the realm of the gods. There they learn about the war between the Great Gods and Uusoae (I'm not sure if that's spelled correctly or not), the goddess of Chaos. They embark on a journey to Dragonland to ask the dragons to help Tortall win the war against the Copper Isles, Carthaki rebels, and the Yamanis.On the way there, they are accompanied by the badger god and the duckmole god. Both have to leave them for different reasons, though, so Daine and Numair travel only with each other. Daine gets trapped in a spidren web, and Numair rescues her..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the best book I have ever read","review":"Usualy I don't make a fuss when I am done with books, but in this book I was very fascinated with the story of the girl named Daine. I think that there should be another book to this series. Tamora Pierce really knows how to express the feelings of characters and how to describe something so that the book would not get boring in one place. You just want to keep on reading it and you end up \\"gulping\\" it down all in one day. I really hope that Tamora Pierce will continue writing about the country of Tortall and the people in it. I really liked that she included the heroine from her other books in this one. Alanna was Daine's friend. So I say that Tamara Pierce is a brilliant writer."},{"rating":"2","title":":)i love this series:)","review":"this is the best book series i've ever read(thats a lot).they are long so it takes me awhile to read it.i think anyone who doesnt like this/these books must have a pretty exciting life to not like a book like this.my parents are sick of it because i keep talking about them.my only cimplaint is that i was hoping after i read the first one that the series would last longer.but i suppose it is for the best that good stories don't last.this was the first book series that interested me for so long and that the sequels were good.i worship the author of this wonderful book.if you don't like them you have problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is a wonderful book filled with adveture and excitment. You won't want to put it down!!! The Realms of the Gods take you on a journy you won't soon forget. It's a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it (is more detail needed. . .)","review":"I loved this book, even the 50th time, and it rather irks me that people seem to be paying little attention to the details they are slamming. Yes, I know everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but Numair is 30, not 60, and it is very common for people in stressful situations (such as being attacked by immortals on a regular basis) to have some white hair. Heck, my brother hasn't had any such stressful situations as far as I know and he has some white hair. The whole plot was, to say the least, origonal. It was nice to find an author that did not use the same ideas as every other author with books in print. I'm looking forward to finding out what happens to Daine and Numair in the new Tortall series."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"Ok, so I REALLY REALLY REALLY liked this book... I liked the plots better in the other three books in the Immortals series but I REALLY liked the romance between Daine and Numair... Although, it would have been interesting if she and Kaddar...Nah... Anyway, I really liked the darkings but I DID NOT like it when stupid ole Ozorne... Well, if you read the book you know what he did but I will not spoil it for other readers...All in all this was either my least favorite or most favorite in the quartet (I can't decide because you have to balance out the plot and the romance:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This was a REALLY REALLY great book. I always knew Daine and Numair had a chemistry between them. I think Tamora Pierce did an excellent job in writing the love parts in this book. I wish she would of made Numair a little younger though, or Daine a little older. Numair is 30 and Daine is 16, that's just a large age difference. In this book Daine is being stalked by an old enemy. She goes to the realms of the gods and sees her mother and father who she finds out are Gods. She falls in love with Numair, and has to make the difficult decision between imortality and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamora is the author I've been looking for!","review":"I was taken away by the first Pierce book I read (The Lioness Quartet) and I thought that I could never find a book that could top it. Boy was I wrong. The Immortals series brings you into the book and into the story. It has that kind of magic that makes you feel every emotion that they feel. You get to know the characters like if you yourself knew them personaly. This is true for all of Tamora's books. I hope you take my advice and at least read The Immortals series and I promise you that you like, if not love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The veil between Plot and Chaos has dissolved!","review":"I enjoyed the other books in this series, but I don't think I can finish this one. I'm not finding any coherent narrative at all. So far, the idea of this book is that random Horrible Things are popping out of the Otherworld, various crazy Gods are doing weird things, and Daine is having a cozy visit with her dead Ma. Plotwise, it's not going anywhere.To my mind, the author had something good going with Daine's bond with animals. She should have stuck with that. In general, the more you involve 'Gods' in a plot, the less 'believable' it is. And therefore, you just don't care!I wish Pierce had wrapped it all up with the last book. That one had a good strong storyline, great animal characters, and a whompin' great climax about to happen... and voila, it's like the editors told her not to kill the bad guys but stretch it all out for another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"This is one of the best books ever written. With its romance, mystery and action this is defiantly a good book to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"kindle edition NEEDS EDITING!","review":"I have no beefs with Tamora Pierce's writing. I have read all of her books, and loved every one. But the kindle editions of her Immortals series are so full of typos that they are hard to read. This one is no different. This is an insult to a great author. Tamora Pierce needs to demand that these be re-edited. Heck, all of her fans should demand it. If we all contacted Amazon and demanded these books be edited properly, they would have no choice. Hit your keyboards, people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book EVER!!","review":"This is my guilty pleasure read. If I have nothing else to read this is one of the first books that comes to my mind. It never gets old after reading it multiple times. FYI read the first three books before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple book, Don't read at school","review":"Not as filled with action or adventure, but a pretty welll written ending to Daine's story and life. I fully enjoyed her conversations with the famous Alanna and king richard much. But I would not recommend this as a book to read in school, it is too simple and not one a teacher would prefer you to read. This is not a thoroughly challenging novel, no interesting sub-plot and all, but this book is truely one for your free time, not for academics."},{"rating":"2","title":"you were doing so good....","review":"This series started off wonderful. The plots were good and there was very litte R rated stuff. Then, in the middle of this book it explodes in your face. Sure you can tell that Daine and Numair like each other but you would think that a highly educated 30 year old man and a 16 year old could fall in love without having to talk about sex (they even italicized it).Tamora Pierce sets a bad example to teenagers. Every series the man gets older and th girl looses her virginity earlier. Please stop the insanity! Read the books(they're pretty good)but skip over the R rated stuff if yore under thirteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"An uncreative ending to a good series","review":"I loved the immortal series! Daine was so wonderful to read about! I always knew Daine was going to marry him, it was so easy to see in the other books!

I love da Immortal series, and I also love BroadFoot. I LUV platap-er duckmoles. If you have not read the book then you are uneducated and idiotic. I liked the romanced between Numair and Daine,but dude, will they get married?? I mean Daine could like marry Numair and then cheat on him with Kaddar (I know, I'm phyco!)so someone should HINT to Tamora to write a 5th and 6th and 7th and- maximum of 1,000 words?!?! How in Mithros am I to explain this in 1,000 words? I need a million.Oh well. Come Badger, were meeting Daine and Numair for Breakfast."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read, go on you know you want to","review":"I knew it! I saw that Daine and Numair would get together. Duhh! But seriously, I think that the talent the Pierce displayed in the rest of the series means nothing now that the last book came out. Daine did a number of things that I hoped were going to happen in this book that I had to wait a entire 3 months to get. I must have read the other three books about 15 times before I read this. Just listen, if you haven't read this hey you're here, just press the little button and buy it. I definatly reccommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Also enjoyable to adult readers","review":"I'm 30, and have read 7 of the 8 books available by this author, and enjoyed them immensely! These books are a MUST for fans of the Narnia books, written with the same style, but with more wit and humour. Alanna and Daine are simply enjoyable characters, and their adventures appealing, even to an adult mind. These are indeed fairy-tales for a modern time, well-written, excellent plotting, wonderful characters, and altogether entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few words to viewers............","review":"First of all I just wanted to say that this book and all of her others were great. At the moment, I am waiting for the second book of her third series, Circle of Magic. To fans of Tamora Pierce- I think Tamora Pierce made a different series of books because she might have thought that if she wrote more about Numair and Daine the books would get a little boring or stupid or something. I wouldn't really know why she made a different series of books, but that's just my suggestion or thought of why she did so. You never know, she might talk about them in another book, but right now, I surely wouldn't know. I just wanted to get my little point out. I'm only 11 years old and I already have a favorite author and I was able to read one and a half series of that author's books in a matter of three days. Um......well, I'm sorry for taking up so much space on the page, but I needed to say something. See ya!!

It doesn't live up to the other books by Tamora Pierce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't ask for a better book!","review":"The best book I could ever wish for! I love the darkings but I was so sad when they died. Oh, and about Daine and Numair, it's not like I have a problem with the age thing, and I thought they were perfect for each other, but marriage? For those people who hope they do, read the reasons why they might not. I mean it's sort of like Alanna and Jon, they would make a terrible marriage. This was the best book I have ever read, I read it in a day! I love just reading my favorite parts over and over again and getting lost in day dreams.Tamora, if your out there please write more about Daine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is incredable!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I Love this book!!! And I'd just like to say that anyone who couldn't see that Daine and Numair were in love from the FIRST BOOK!!!! needs to get their eyes checked because they obviously can't see well enough to actualy read! WHO CARES IF THERE'S 14 YEAR AGE DIFRENCE!!!!!! and who cares if he has a few white hairs either! It's called stress! It has nothing to do with his age!

Coming from me, that's probably a lot since i've read my share of dumb books, but this! It's a work of art, i tell u. Daine rocks! But...um...Does anyone know how you pronounce her name? I'm not sure....Oh well. Anyway, i'm just crossing my fingers that Ms. Pierce would write just one more book about Daine and her friends. I would love to find out if Daine and Numair got married and all that."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best in the series","review":"this book is definetly the best in \\"the Immortals\\" series. you can't put it down. and tamora pierce is a wonderful author. i only wish i could write as well as her. well Daine is back with Numair of course. teaching her as always. only this time they end up in the realm of the gods (interesting how that title hooks in) and the best part is when you finally find out that Numair and Daine fall in love. i must say i was hoping for this in all of the books. i'm a hopeless romantic so thats prolly why i like this book the best. but it is a must read. (but if you have never read a tamora pierce book start with the alanna series) but if you haven't read it please do (with the other 3 books prior of course) you won't regret reading this if you LOVE fantasy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love is in the air.","review":"I am a huge fan of Tamora Pierce, and i must say this is one of her best. for me its the romance between Daine and Numair. there are hints here and there, like Numair's voice and his eyes which make my heart melt. Stuck in the gods home, when there is a war in the mortal realms, there is love in the air when Daine never dies, Numair comes to save her. even with this love they can't stop until they get back to the mortal realms. after bloodshed, changing shapes and a goddess getting punished Numair and Daine have survived and come together at last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all ages","review":"I am a 23 year old who just read this entire series because I found them at the library suddenly.

I was so ensnared I read the first three in one go together. they're romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolultly loved this book!!!!!!!!","review":"I think this book was the best of the Immortals quartet.I especially love the end when Daine and Numair are back together. I think it is a great combination of love and adventure . I hope Tamora Pierce writes another book after this! I love her books!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!","review":"I read this whole series in ,like, three days and this book was definitely the best. To everyone who says Daine and Numair's relationship was \\"unappropriate\\", you are SO wrong!!! Do you have something against romance? It was obvious from the very first book! And if you didn't pick it up from Emperor Mage, than I must say, you are blind. The clues were slapping you in the face(or someone else's). They make aperfect couple. Anyway, this book was wonderfully romantic, funny, and action packed. Read it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly good!","review":"Easily the best book ever written-pretty high praise coming from a conniseur such as myself. As is common with Pierce's books, I became very involved with the charecters. I cried when Daine was sad, and prepared for battle when the universe depended on it. An exceptional story coming from an exceptiaonal author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book really wansn't as good as the rest of the series.","review":"In this last book Daine and Numair are taken to the realms of the gods. But they felt that they had to go home to fight a war going on in their own realm, so they set out for the land of the dragons. It seemed like they had no trouble getting there and everything worked out perfectly. Also Daine and Numair fell in love which really discusted me. Through out all of the other books they had a father daughter relationship. The author tried to turn it into a love story and it didn't work. I am a very big fan of the rest of Tamora Pierce's books but this one wasn't what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my kids","review":"As a lover of fantasy, I found a lot to enjoy about this book. As a parent, I was troubled that a book clearly marketed to kids has its 16-year-old heroine falling in love with, kissing, and discussing both sex and marriage with a 30-year-old man. How many parents of teen girls want our daughters' imaginations caught up in this kind of scenario? There are a lot of other great fantasy books to choose from. This one doesn't belong in our home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Realms of the Gods,","review":"This is the most recent in the Immortals Series.

It had all of the material for a great book in it. I loved the dragons and the darkings. I wish that Jelly and Leaf weren't killed. You get to meet Daine's parents. I wish my parents were that cool! Making chairs out of walls! Anyway, then Daine and Numair got together, which I REALLY REALLY liked. All of the action and stuff were great, but I personally think that the little love scenes were cute.All in all, I think this book is exellent, and that anyone would like it, but read the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd books first.Unfortunately, the reason that I only gave this 4 stars insead of 5 was because the series ended too soon, and was kinda cut off. I'm going to sit here and wait for the next series with Daine in it comes out. Hopefully with more little love scenes in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"All about the praise","review":"When I finished reading the 1st Alana book, I was instantly hooked. Throught out the whole series, i thought that last book, (Realm of the gods) was the ultimate best. In my opinion, it has all the elements required to be a good book. It has suspense, romance, and imagination. I have read and re-read all of the Alanna and Daine books over and over. I can practically recite a few chapters. The romance between Numeir and Daine is kinda of expected. Through all of her books, she hits alittle about this happening. (ex. 3rd book- at the end where he hugs her tight and call her sweet) The only thing i would have to complain about this book, is the ending. Tamora Pierce just cuts it off, but I understand that she has a limited amount of pages that she can work with. I just hope that in the future, she writes more books involving alanna, george, Daine, Numeir, Kit, and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the kids that reviewed this after I did.","review":"To Athens, you've gotta be kidding me when you talk about her abandoning her 'special moments between characters'. You have to be, 'cause there's at least one, maybe more. To Tessa Lee, I *almost* cried during the book. I just cried today when I was reading it, during that unexpected, bizarre part.PS What I mean by the bizarre part is where there's a serious lack of them understanding each other. Y'know, the part where he's yelling at her."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just keeps getting better...","review":"Amazing--like the first three, each book gets better and better! The adventures are a perfect blend of love, hate, spells, and battles. I managed to lose track of time when I dove between the covers of this magical book, staying up until 3am just so I didn't have to keep myself in suspense wondering what happened. This book manages to grab your attention in the first few pages and lock it in place for the remainder of the story. I would definately recommend it to any and all fantasy book fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did it have to end!!!!!! Five stars arent enough!!!!!!!!","review":"Why are thou cruel fate? I can't believe how good these books were!!! I couldn't put them down and this last one has to be the best, I mean I knew that Daine liked Numair, and Numair liked Daine it just took them a while and Daine almost DYING for them to realize it mainly him though, sigh... I never used to read much but thanks to Tamora Pierce I have read more than I can believe!!! You must get this book-along with the others so you know what happing-it will makes you wish that your life was Daine. Dragons, magic, love and a whole bunch of amazing things that will make you awe and gasp with amazement, and don't worry when you finish it. There are other books that have the couple, read \\"Protector of the Small\\" set and the Tricksters Choice\\" to read a little more about the couple and the Books are good tooooo!!!!! Trust me when I say this, you will enjoy them all, but for now read \\"The Immortals\\" you will fall in love with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy","review":"Only a few tracks on this cd are worth listening to, and even they don't break any new ground.

However, if you buy this cd, you will be forced into referring this cd to others. This cd is jam-packed with soaring vocals, great melodies, soul-ful beats.

Its held well and durable to take knocks of teenagers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Student Grade...","review":"This was the first shoulder rest I had. No matter the amount of adjusting, I couldn't get that \\"perfect fit.\\" It never fell off while playing, but would frequently wiggle off when the violin wasn't to my shoulder. The width of the padding was a little narrow for my liking and on occasion would dig into my shoulder. Overall though, it wasn't a bad shoulder rest and was generally comfortable. If you have the money, I'd suggest going for the Wolf Forte Primo 3/4 - 4/4 Violin Shoulder Rest instead. However, if the Kun rest has fallen into your hands, fear not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!!!","review":"I love Kun's Shoulder Rest! I used to owned a small, padded one that looked more like a small pillow but it didn't do anything for me. The moment I used Kun's Shoulder Rest, I felt my posture itself straighten out instantly. Not only that, but because my posture had straighten, there was less stiffeness when playing.Thank you, Kun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bummer never feceived","review":"We purchased this item and and additinal item an extra set of violin strings, the strings were reecived but we have never received the shoulder pad, because of the small dollar amount paid we have not bothered to complain, We however have stopped shopping on this site and returned to EBAY for our shopping. we have been very pleased with our expierence with EBay and overstock and would recommend those sites for shopping never having had a bad expierence."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dog loves them","review":"My dog loves them.

Get's you through the basics. To bad they didn't let VersusBooks do this one. Their treatment of Baldur's Gate II & the Expansion was perfect (except for the printing errors, which they graciously correctly and provide a replacement at no charge for those of us with an early edition) All the really good stuff you buy a guide for is completely left out (What the loot is where to get it) and although you don't always want to use them. The inclusion of the cheats codes is a nice bonus VersusBooks gives us for BG:II but prima LEAVES OUT for ID:II. But since this is all there is I guess you have to buy it.

If you are looking for true reggaeton artist, try looking Wisin & Yandel, Master Joe & OG Black, Don Omar, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fun book","review":"I really like this book--it's better than Tangled Sheets, Tangled Lies by far, I think. It's witty, well-written, with likeable characters, and the internal character dialogue was very skilled, and it was the best part of the book. I've read it several times to learn about writing romances for my own writing projects. I wish Julie Hogan would write more books. This one is one of the best Silhouette Desire books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This is not Can full cooked, but the stew has all the ingredients. Soundtracks are the groove pirates before Damo.The music here has good vocals, though not the devil magic the Sazuki wizard would soon bring to give Can an eternally indelible place on the map. You also get all the drones, long improvisations and Africa on speed drumming that Can would soon flesh out on albums likeTago Mago. This music is also--slightly-more dated. Listen to how out front the phased guitar is here. Can continued to use these for a long time after they went out of vogue, but wound them into a much richer mix.And low and behold a surprise \\"She Brings The Rain\\" is like psychedelic Wes Montgomery, nothing like they did after this. You can tell the band is still finding its way, but listening to Can stumble in the dark is still ten times better than hearing most bands having fully arrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy-making!","review":"This book drives me crazy! The buttons will not stay untangled. No matter how many times I try to untangle them, the minute my son opens this book the ribbons get knotted into an intricate rope of ribbons and buttons! If I do not untagle them, the book is rendered useless. Given hindsight I would not re-purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mess","review":"The ribbons for this book are constantly tangled. My independent 2 year-old cannot untangle them and gets frustrated, then disinterested. And it seemed like such a good idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless Aggravation","review":"Although a cute idea for a book, this concept is completely destroyed by the mechanism for holding the buttons, which is 10 one-foot-long ribbons connected to the book at the top of the spine. These ribbons immediately become tangled the minute the book is lifted due to the weight of the buttons, which cause them to twirl around each other in a psychotic braid that is time consuming to untangle and which will only occur again the next time you lift up the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mom with two toddlers","review":"I bought this book for my 16 month old and my 3 year old to play with together. It looked like it would be just right for this age group because the book is sturdy and very colorful and the buttons are big enough for little fingers to hold on to easily. However, even though they both like to read the book and put the buttons on the pages, it becomes frustrating for everyone because the ribbons become tangled so easily. I even followed the recommendation from the publisher about braiding and tying the strings together and that did not work very well either. It takes me approximately15 to 20 minutes to untangle the ribbons before my daughters can read through this book once. I would not recommend this book--there are too many other great books out there that don't cause the frustration that this one does!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but frustrating","review":"Yup, tangly ribbons. ALL. THE. TIME. :( It's frustrating. I untangle them, and then, as I take buttons out of one page to use on another page, they get tangled again!The other thing is that, my buttons at least, don't want to stay in the cut-outs. My toddler WANTS them to go in and stay in! and he gets frustrated that no amount of pushing by him or I will get them to stay in some of the holes. :(All in all, I would not buy again and would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't Recomend this Book","review":"I've tryed to give this book a try since it was a gift but I just can't stand it. Ok, the ribbons tangle but that's not a big deal. It could add to the activity of the book. My problem with the book is the \\"buttons\\" do NOT easily fit into the \\"button holes\\". I press the buttons into the hole (no easy task) and my daughter pulls them out (also no easy task). Once I jam them in, which you have to do to get them to stay, she can barely pull them out. She doesn't have the attention span to wait 5 minutes for me to put the buttons in nor the patience to pull them out.And I must add that the pictures are creepy. The buttons are heads and eyes which you are putting in and pulling out, isn't that creepy to anyone but me?!I don't like anything about this book and I wish I could return it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely maddening. Terrible execution!","review":"I have to add my voice to the chorus of DON'T buy this book. If you can avoid it, don't have it given to you as a gift, either. The ribbons tangle in about five seconds flat, often making them too short for the buttons to reach the page, and the buttons don't stay in the holes, either.The illustrations are cute enough, although not particularly creative or interesting, but the language is simple to the point of mindlessness.There are lots better books and activities for kids out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangles, Schmangles...","review":"Sure the ribbons tangle on this book. But kids dont mind, and it sort of \\"adds\\" another activity for them (untangle the ribbons!). Plus, they untangle quite easily, so I dont see that as a reason to give this book any less than the 5 stars it deserves. This is not really a good \\"car\\" book, because it is big and heavy, but my nearly 2 yrs. old son never grows tired of this gem. I plan to get several copies to give as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A trial, but worth it for my toddler's joy","review":"It's true, as other reviewers have mentioned, that the buttons tangle easily and thoroughly. On the other hand, my baby doesn't seem to mind this.On the plus side, my 12-month-old son loves this book so much, it's the first thing he looks for when he wakes up. He spots it across the room, no matter where we've put it, and starts pointing and calling out for it. He can spend 15 minutes easily playing with the book, mouthing the buttons, putting his fingers through the holes on the cover, and clanking the buttons to make a pleasant sound. To see his eyes light up the way they do for this book, I'd put up with a lot more than tangled ribbons. I recommend this book very highly to any parent with a modicum of patiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"the tangle book","review":"This book looks so appealing for kids who like manipulating little things and strings. I was definitely drawn in by the strings and colors. This book quickly becomes a book connected to a big tangle of strings and buttons. I actually kind of enjoy untangling them occassionally while I watch TV, but I do this maybe twice a year. The rest of the time the tangle of strings and buttons is a handle for my 15 month old twins to haul the book around by. There are many better activity books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tangled Mess Cured","review":"My 3 year daughter would play with the book until the ribons got tangled. After a while I ended up cutting the ribons off the book and buttons and now it is a lot less restricting. I don't recommend this cure for any children under 3. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you like untangling strings and have a lot of time to spend doing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be.","review":"This purifier worked well for about a week. After that, it's ability to clean the air deteriorated. Cleaning the unit per the instructions did not remedy the situation. The odor put off by the device changed as well.

In every video that you see of them, they show more of their heart and soul, which attracts thousands of fans to see their shows all around the world.

While this may appeal to many Dokken fans, I was totally disappointed. No rockin' guitars, no intensity, no power, none of the things that made Dokken so good. This DVD is very mellow & except for the few token electric guitar solos that are thrown in, this is pretty much an acoustic version of Dokken. I watched it once & will never watch it again, I just hope I can sell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do It!","review":"If you are looking at this DVD because you are looking to rekindle the memory of the jammin', eighty-riffic, rocking Dokken, this DVD is not what you are looking for!All of the songs are re-arranged into what basically sounds like Dokken lounge music. For guitar players, what little you see and hear of George Lynch is awesome, but there is not enough to satisfy. Also, the other guys singing the material reminded me of Bill Murray singing the theme from Star Wars. Overall the sound quality is great, the interviews are pointless and boring, and the performance is lackluster. Thumbs Down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One LAME Night","review":"You can't blame Dokken for jumping on the \\"Unplugged\\" fad of the mid-nineties. Business is business and anything beats getting a real job. The problem with this CD though is they sound completely bored and Don Dokken still talks to the audience as if they are still in junior high. I am not a fan of live albums anyway, so if you are a Dokken fanatic, maybe you'll agree with the other reviews here. Personally, I don't think they have done anything worth buying since \\"Back for the Attack\\". After that George Lynch ran out of steam. An ex-girlfriend gave me this disc for Christmas. (That's why she's my ex!) Seriously folks, this low-budget disc just doesn't deliver the goods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Awesome!!","review":"When the unplugged thing began to gain popularity Dokken was already broken up and I remember thinking to myself \\"man wouldn't it be awesome if they got back together and did an unplugged show\\". Well a few years later my wish came true. When I first heard this c.d. 6 years ago, I was in awe. The band truly shines. Even to this day I still get chills listening to George Lynch's solo's on \\"Unchain the night\\" Whether or not you are a die hard Dokken fan or just an occasional listener, I would definitely suggest buying this c.d. The only thing I was disappointed in was that the band did not add more songs on it from their set that night. I would have probably been satisfied with 20 songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid 4! Dokkens best","review":"I love this cd. the atmosphere is great and the Acoustic/Electric combo is really cool. These songs are stripped down, yet sound better. Especially \\"Just Got Luck\\" and \\"The Maze\\" which are great! 80's icons are in career form here. must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Listener Comments","review":"I have never heard a voice quite like Ofra Haza's. She is one of the rare talents on this earth that can get you on the dance floor with a disco beat, or in tears when she sings a ballad.

She started out by singing Yemenite Folk Songs, and that is entirely what this album is - purely and simply - without any foreign influence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jewish singing in arabic... ¡Simply Wonderful!","review":"In this lines I don't wanna say nothing about israeli/palestinian conflict. Simply I wanna say: Hey, men and women of Middle East! Ofra was a jewish woman, bred in Israel, between jews, but she never forgot her arabs roots, yemenites, and sang for arabs and jews with the same beauty and talent of always. Because all we have the same God, and because arabs and jewish are brothers peoples. With \\"Fifty Gates of Wisdom/Yemenite Songs\\" Ofra sing wonderfully in the best album of folk music of the Yemen, with lyrics in arabic, aramaic and hebrew. \\"Galbi Yahib Al Hawa\\" is far the best song, tribal and mystic like few songs. Soon, in my opinion, \\"Im Nin'Alu\\", \\"Ode L'eli\\" and \\"Tzur Menti - Sei Yona - Sapri Tama\\" follow in beauty.A great album, wonderful.

The table of contents reads like a laundry-list of common Exchange configuration and management issues; each chapter takes a moment to explain the pieces of the puzzle, then provides step-by-step instructions for practical tasks.

For that reason, I'm creating a step-by-step guide that includes the instructions I have found useful for successfully getting RPC over HTTP to work properly.\\"Sure enough, the instructions were direct and to-the-point, and the procedure worked flawlessly to do just what I wanted to do.

There is a great deal of 'skimming' subjects without explanation leaving the reader to find out from other sources. For example, in Chapter 1, there are numererous mentions of HTTP/DAV and DAVEx (referring to the davex (DLL that handles communications between the Exchange back-end server and IIS) but there is no explanation as to what it does or how it works.The index (which I consider a must have in any technical book) is small and incidentally does not even mention the aforementioned davex.I found the lack of depth too light and somewhat frustrating.YMMV"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a timeless classic","review":"This book, by Mick Foley, is without doubt a book that will be remebered throughout wrestling history.

Most of the recipes look great, I enjoy the bits of history.... but the author's main character (Carolyn Blue) is so annoying it is jarring to the storyline and takes all the fun out of the books. I would like to be kind and call Carolyn naive, but after reading a couple of books in the series I have to say she's really just plain stupid.

Having visitied New Orleans and having an interest in the culinary world AND being an avid mystery fan, I thought it would be SO good!Using dialect when writing dialogue is one of the first no-nos of writing -- and now I see why. It's irritating and condescending. The thought of the Chief of Police in a city the size of New Orleans actually making an advance on a grieving friend WITH HUSH PUPPIES AND CRAWDADS is just ridiculous. If I lived in NO, I'd be furious!Having read the other reviews, mine is about the same as the other one star reviews, but I felt the need to add it to offset the four and five star reviews -- some of which I suspect may have been written by friends of the author, who is a resident of El Paso."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lady Can Write, perhaps just not mysteries...","review":"This author is a delight.

Avoid this if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to New Orleans and its residents","review":"While the writing in this book is not technically awful I was offended by everything else about it. None of the characters were in the least bit appealing and it portrayed New Orleanians as either extremely rude or backwoods hicks. The horrible attempt at writing the local accent fell extremely flat. And the premise that someone can so easily land a book deal by simply writing one article is ridiculous.

If you want to read about the real New Orleans, try O'Neil De Noux or Tony Dunbar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Crime Brulee reads like a cross between tourist guides and blurbs from restaurant cookbooks. Much in the book seems contrived - from the alleged difficulty of making a roux to the slowly paced plot development of the \\"mystery\\" to sleuth Carolyn's consistently negative impression of everyone but herself and her husband. Maybe Nancy Fairbanks shouldn't have thanked her editor for suggesting that she write a \\"culinary series.\\" I love food mysteries and adore New Orleans and found Crime Brulee a total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Normally I read a book of this type in a day or two. This one took over two weeks because I couldn't get past reading a chapter or two at a time before I had to put it down.Carolyn Blue may be the most stupid, irritating character to hit the cozy scene in a long time. She's pushy, nosy, condescending and flat out stupid. The whole book consisted of her eating and running around talking to people. The plot and the story never moved forward -- she just happened to show up at the murderer's place one time when he decided to let her in and confess.Cross this author off your list, and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Food; Bad Mystery","review":"I really enjoyed the descriptions of some of the sights to see in New Orleans and I enjoyed reading about all of the restaurants and food. However, The mystery was very weak. There were few viable suspects. I am never able to figure out who committed the crime when I read murder mysteries before it is revealed in the story. In this book, I figured out who committed the crime long before the end of the book. The main character is very pleasant, but seems not to be too bright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said the first few pages indicated that this book was a chore rather than a pleasure.

The repetitive self-questioning done by the main character, Carolyn Blue, seems unending. The food part was fun, but the plot was obvious and the end no suprise.

Nancy Fairbanks' Crime Brulee did not fit the bill. The one star is generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up, folks!","review":"To the last couple of reader-reviewers, I can only say -- Lighten up! \\"Crime Brulee\\" is comedy, it's meant to be light-hearted and funny. And to my mind it succeeds. Carolyn Blue is a delight, and her emancipation from the kitchen can only be enjoyed. When I want dark mysteries I'll read Patricia Cornwell or Ian Rankin. When I want to be amused, I'll look for more titles by Nancy Fairchild."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of The Weakest In The JLA Run","review":"Though not as bad as some people have said in reviews it is not a very good read. The story moves at a very sluggish pace and has a horrible villain. Though the showing up of another DC Super team really kept it from completely going downhill. I can not say I recommend this unless you've read the rest of the volumes in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"Chris Claremont should have quit writing comics long ago. His time is past. This storyline served no purpose other than to introduce John Byrne's rebooted new, new, new Doom Patrol, which has already been erased from continuity by 'Infinite Crisis'. It was a mistake anyway in that rebooting the Doom Patrol in this fashion erased Beast Boy/Changeling's origin from continuity. Retconning is garbage and everyone ought to knock it off. Don't buy this volume unless you simply must have a complete set of 'JLA'. Oh, also, having the Justice League fight vampires, of all things, is just dumb. Tedious. The only redeeming quality the book possesses is an absolute knee-slapping, gut-busting sight gag in the last two panels of the story; the belly-laugh is not worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphic SF Reader","review":"This Justice League of America outing looked a little dated to me. It is done in the 1980s John Byrne style, so if you really are a big fan of that and a collector, you will like it. The story with some potential Doom Patrollers and the Justice League crossing over with a circle of vampires just didn't seem to gel, for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"JLA Tenth Circle","review":"Terrible art, what happened to DC on this one. They allowed their greatest group of heroes to be tainted with poor art and terrible story. Disappointing,to say the least. You are better off picking some of the previous JLA collections, this one is a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Being a long time reader of this incarnation of the JLA I was extremely disappointed with this collection of stories. There was no real tie-ins to the DC Universe or for that matter previous JLA stories. The stories seem forced and they didn't seem to flow like other stories. As a collector of the JLA tradebacks I consider this to be the weakest of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supremely disappointing","review":"When I had first heard that the legendary duo that struck gold with Uncanny X-Men way back when would be doing a JLA storyarc, I wondered why DC didn't market it any further. Well, upon reading the Tenth Circle, you'll know why. It's not hard to believe, it's impossible to believe that Chris Claremont and John Byrne, the same team who brought us classics like the Dark Phoenix Saga and Days of Future Past, came up with this drek. The story, what little there is of it, involves a vampire taking control of Superman and launching him against the JLA. Now I know that dialogue has never been Claremont's strong point, but the script is so horrible that, like a previous Amazon reviewer said, it reads like this was an episode of Superfriends. Byrne's art is solid for the most part, but uninspired. There is no saving grace for JLA: The Tenth Circle, and despite the fact that it re-unites Claremont and Byrne, this should be left on the shelf at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened.......?","review":"This will be the question that you will be left with if you are unfortunate enough to have read this book. But please be advised that my review is based on the unbound monthly comics and not the collected TPB. Despite boasting writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne and Jerry Ordway....this story falls flat on its face. The basic premise is that a vampire (Crucifer) has hold on Superman and has launched him against the JLA. Batman delves into the mystery when he is looking for missing children. Anyhow, the story takes a turn for the worse when the Legion of Doom is reintroduced and saves the day...yes, it is that simple. The story is very weak for any story and reads like it's more from an episode of \\"Superfriends\\" than the more complex settings that was started by Grant Morrison. The art is pretty good though...nothing extraordinary but still good. Avoid this book and read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"so lame i was embarassed for them","review":"the story was terrible, the art was second rate, with all the female characters looking like the same people. the dialogue made me feel embarassed to be reading this book. what a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst purchase I ever made.","review":"From the previews, I imagined this would be an isolationism dark ambient type of album, but it is literally 100 short clips of nothing but a very faint hum with crackle.This whole freaking thing sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark & beautiful sub-bass ambience.","review":"Staggeringly beautiful glacial sub-bass sounds.

John Seabrook offers a technically well-constructed commentary on his experiences online, but his defensive tone turned me off. His relationship with technology seems quite religious in nature - simultaneously idolatry and uncomfortable. Not a book I'd recommend for the technologically literate reader, although those who prefer style to substance might enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A superficial tale of learning the internet","review":"The theme is enticing - baby boomer is sucked into the depths of the net. You imagine a psychological thriller such as Polanski's 'Tenant'. What is found , though, is a rather pedestrian tale of one writer's introduction to computers (? mid life crisis). Such unrealized potential. Lots of boring reproductions (filler) of e-mail. Now John, don't get upset and flame me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissism and sloppiness","review":"Seabrook opens his story by describing the login screen to the WELL, an online conferencing system. He quotes it as saying \\"you are your words\\" and, based on this, proceeds to draw a variety of conclusions about the WELL and the online world. Which might be fine, except that the login screen to the WELL reads \\"You own your words.\\" Big difference there. You'd think a writer for the New Yorker could, when recounting a quote that sets the tone for his book, get the quote right. The book heads steadily downhill from there. Seabrook makes it all about himself. That isn't a bad thing per se, but it doesn't work here. Seabrook's personal journey is not interesting, and he has very little original or interesting to say about the medium. I suppose this book could be useful as an object lesson about the dangers of journalistic narcissism, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dated but descriptive","review":"As might be expected, the book is very dated now. I was also on the Internet in 1993 and 1994 and don't regard myself as a pioneer of any sort. I did find Seabrook's description of online life accurate and especially the arc of a long-term presence online .. from euphoria and enthrallment to disillusion and disgust finally arriving at a place of balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"In love with the sound of his own voice.","review":"I had read excerpts of this in The New Yorker, where Seabrook is a staff writer, and was interested in seeing the finished product. Reading it bit by bit over time was one thing; reading it all at once was another. John Seabrook is really infatuated with himself. We do not need to know that he went to boarding school and then Princeton, yet he repeats this information again and again. We do not need to know how smart and wonderful he \\"knows\\" he is -- but since we're in his head, we're stuck with him. If he is indeed so smart and wonderful, why does he need to hire someone to build a homepage for him? He's insufferable, and readers can do better elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovingly done","review":"The book is truly a labor of love, and it's obvious. Schneider is to be commended for having once and for all related the history of \\"Taps,\\" and debunking many myths about its origin. It is fortuitous that the author connected with Jari Villaneuva, an outstanding trumpeter, and the foremost authority on \\"Taps,\\" living or dead. One minor flaw is an erroneous reference to an E-flat trumpet, near the end of the book. The book loses one star in this review because of the awful design, in which the text is interrupted again and again by sidebar stories.

Finally, for anyone who has seen Wilco in concert this year, you know that \\"I'm the Man Who Loves You\\" finds Tweedy whipping out a fab guitar solo, and this live version holds true.\\"War on War\\" did not find any airtime on US radio.

BTW, USPS stands for United States Power Squadrons, a nationwide nonprofit boating organization. I returned the flag and requested the correct replacement, but instead received yet another USPS Yacht Ensign.

And the companion website is a fun place to learn all the newest Disney info.

The details make you feel for the characters. You will find yourself rooting for some of the characters to pull through. You will find you will relate to these characters as though you have know them, or maybe wish you had. (I did enjoy the ghost visits, as I feel our love ones are near, whether we choose to notice or not.) The only objection I have is I do not feel it necessary to go into details with steamy love scenes! It is not that I am a prude, but I don't find this to be necessary to tell a good story. I can't wait to read the next book of hers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner for Nora!!!!","review":"I must say that Nora Roberts is one of the best romantic suspense writers of the times. I simply loved this book!!!! I can hardly wait for Rising Tides. I realize that writing of any kind can be a slow process at best, but I wish that, her books, especially the trilogies, could be published closer together. The dialogue, not only between the brothers, but between Cam and Anna, was at once funny and tender. I can't wait to see our the character of Seth develops through the whole series. I rate this book right up there with the \\"Born In....\\" series. The Concannon are my personal favorites, but the Quinns are not too far behind!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read I look forward to the second book","review":"Roberts never lets us down.

However, I felt that the development of Cam and Anna's relationship is too quick. The attention on the brothers is so strong that the romance is not as emotional as some of her other books. Anyway, I love to read the conversation between the brothers, and I hope that the stories of Ethan and Phillips will come soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another A+ effort from Nora Roberts","review":"I couldn't put this one down! The characters were portrayed with the warmth and humor we are accustomed to from Ms. Roberts. Having to wait so long for the next book in the series will be rough, but well worth it, I'm sure. Ms. Roberts' portrayal of the troubled young Seth is bittersweet. The relationship between Cameron and Seth is a mixture of sweet, sad and funny. This story line alone would have been enough to keep me reading, but then we have the treat of watching Cameron fall for a social worker who keeps him on his toes. We fall for Anna as well. She seems a very real character, tough yet gentle. Her difficult life's experiences have shaped her for the better and her compassion for Seth is heartwarming. On the one to ten scale, I'd rate this book an eleven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea Swept","review":"I thought this a most excellent book.

It's not hard to remember the predictable plot of the characters who lack morals and hop into each other's beds at the wink of an eye. The most interesting sub-plot is the character development between the boy (Seth) and the three older adoptive brothers. The ending was disappointing and the lusty affair which ensues between the main characters annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-so-Swept-Away","review":"Nora Roberts is a terrific romance / mystery writer; however, this novel is not one of her best. I usually have no trouble getting caught up in her stories and characters, but this one left me flat. The characters were dull and what little mystery there was didn't pull me in.

Great on Character, Shaky on Romance","review":"First, let me make it clear that I LOVED this book. I also loved the sequal \\"Rising Tide.\\" I can't wait 'til January to get the last one. The relationships developed between the Quinn brothers and the struggles they have accepting their father's death under questionable cirrcumstances were very compelling. However, I was unconvinced by the love story. I felt as if the romantic elemant had been thrown in for reader appeal, when the book was really about Cameron and his brothers, not about Cameron and Anna. I guess the trouble is that Anna didn't really fit into the back drop of the male world the Quinn brothers inhabit. But what brothers! Read this one for the love between a strong family. From that angle, the book was superb. The love between the leading couple is just sort of along for the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora at the top of her game","review":"This beginning part of the Cheasapeake Trilogy is, so far, my favorite book by Nora Roberts.Racing boat champion Cameron Quinn is called home just as he is about to bed a dazzling model. His adoptive father, Ray Quinn, is in an accident and is dying. Cameron races in time to say good-bye and to face reality along with brothers Philip and Ethan: there is a fourth Quinn boy, Seth, another stray taken in by Ray, who now needs the three very different men to work together.Anna Spinelli is Seth's caseworker, someone who has to make sure that his best interests and needs are met. Although a romance between a caseworker and the boy's brother, Cameron, is a major conflict of interest and a no-no in real life, their relationship is sizzling!This book was a great set up for the next two installments.

Easily Taylor's greatest performance, it is also Richard Burton's finest hour. Finally he is able to harness his propensity to overact and he gives a tour de force performance as the hen-pecked George. Burton utterly dominates the movie, though Taylor has the superior role and wittier lines. The subtlety that Burton brings to the character of George is mesmerizing to watch, he is alternately whipped and dominant, funny and then full of pathos. A magnificent performance!The interplay between George and Martha is exquisite. As a purely dialogue-driven movie, the acting must be superlative or interest will flag. There is no danger of that, not only is the script brilliant but the acting supports the dialogue at every turn.This is a riveting movie from first to last, one of the great American films. The acting, direction by Mike Nichols and understated cinematography add up to a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grotesquely Fascinating","review":"It's like watching a car accident in slow motion- you don't want to see it but you can't tear yourself away. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Masterful contributions from each contributor- actors, cinematograhper, composer, set decorater- integrated into a seamless, perfect whole by Mike Nichols. Taylor and Burton have never been better, and I think Sandy Dennis is the only woman ever to co-star with Taylor and win an Oscar. The music is especially affecting, but in a very subtle way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"A first-order comedy-drama. I am a fan of films that can manage to keep itself in one setting (\\"Rear Window\\"), one continuous time (\\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\"), or both (\\"12 Angry Men\\"). \\"Virginia Woolf\\" takes place in actual time, and is nearly perfect. The whole, entire cast (Burton, Taylor, Dennis, Segal) all deserved Oscars. The acting was incredible. Almost rivaling \\"12 Angry Men\\" as being filled with amazing acting. Engrossing, poignant, hilarious . . . don't miss this movie. Do not do not do not."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films ever made, and one of my all-time favorites.","review":"As the tagline states, \\"You are cordially invited to George and Martha's for a night of fun and games.\\" Fun, indeed! This is one of the best films ever made, in my opinion, and one of the best directorial debuts ever - courtesy of Mike Nichols. Controversial for it's time because of it's refusal to water down any of the adult elements of Edward Albee's play - it is a riveting character study featuring excellent performances from the entire cast. The dialogue is to die for! Both horrifying and hilarious, this should be required viewing for every film buff.Something that may be of interest to fans of the film, is that Warner Brothers released a deluxe, 2 LP set of the entire film's dialogue. It's an awesome set, and perfect for those moments when you just want to hear George and Martha tear each other to shreds. It's rare, but if you can find it, purchase it. I am glad to say that I own one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The party after the party","review":"After the couple Martha and George has come home from a party, few time later another couple, Honey and Nick, arrives, because they were invited to a little party. The fact that they are very drunken leads Martha and George into heavy conflict, in which Honey and Nick get more and more involved until the party ends as a \\"horrortrip\\".The film version \\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" from Mike Nichols is almost a sensation. First the actors are chosen very good, what you can see in being nominated for Oscar. Also the gestures and expressions are fine, so that the viewer gets involved easily and cannot stop watching the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a destaster","review":"it's a destaster that this master class movie, shouldn't be available on DVD anywhere outside the USA.

And most agreeably, I might add - all tilted toward the satisfaction of the customer. I actually felt someone was singularly devoting their time and attention to me, not from a customer relations script but from a real sense of trying to understand and remedy my problem. I run a small business myself, and one thing I impress upon my employess is this - mishaps in production and service explain the customer's problem, they do not justify it. That being said, the customer is deserving of something more and above an explanation; they now deserve satisfaction beyond the purchased item. Well, that is exactly what I received.

This movie has no such redeeming virtue. It is not just bad, it is bad in an arty, pseudo-intellectual phony sort of way. Granted the acting is good, given the circumstances. It goes on and on like a hangover or a bad joke with no humor or punch line. The characters are repulsive and obnoxious. Did I mention boring? You feel the author is admiring his own pointless dialogue and certain audiences may find it profound because they think there is something they ought to be getting. There is not. SPOILER. You find out at the end the couple are fighting about a non-existent child they never had. At the conclusion the child is verbally \\"killed\\" so that the marriage can live.

If you like watching people drink (actors drinking fake drinks) for 24+ hours straight with no other food or other beverages, and stagger around the yard mumbling, then this is the movie for you. If you like having to strain to hear what they're saying, even better. If you love two hours and 15 minutes of unabated misery, in dismal black and white, then this movie is for you!

Would this be appropriate to show to a high school class in a conservative area?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, Bad Version of DVD","review":"This DVD edition was released in 1997, and the image quality is primitive, typical of many early discs. The widescreen side (yup, it's one of those silly things) gives you a floating rectangle with black all around. You'll have to use a \\"stretch\\" feature to make it cross the screen from left to right, and then it will probably be cropped on the ends. And then it's horribly fuzzy. But the worst thing is that it is very contrasty, with the subtle and beautiful greyscale largely wiped out.The 2006 2-disc release looks awesome by comparison.

Here is Elizabeth Taylor at the height of her physical beauty, putting on a firght wig, and getting overweight to play -- no to overplay -- the boozy Martha to perfection. Richard Burton, the godfather of Anthony Hopkins and Russell Crowe, is the perfect foil to Taylor (or is he?) in this hall of mirrors, dark comedy. Ultimately it is a love story, with an oddly happy ending. Albee has shown himself to be our greatest working playright (Arthur Miller is still alive, and hasn't worked much lately). Compare this to Three Tall Women and we see an exploration of how the self can be broken into many people. Compare this to The Goat and we see how many people become incorporated into the self."},{"rating":"1","title":"whose afraid of Virginia Woolf","review":"I thought this was one of the worst movies I had ever had the misfortune to waste money on. It was very boring and all they did is argue throughout the whole part that I watched. I left in the middle of it. It amazes me that it could have won any awards. I can't believe Elizabeth Taylor would play in such a movie. Whoever gave it high acclaim has no taste. I have never watched it in its entirety and I never will. I don't enjoy watching 2 drunks fight, how can anyone else. It had no story line worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, love it and show it to your friends.","review":"This is a quaiity production and I found it to be both powerful and gripping. Elizabeth Taylor deserved the Oscar for her performance. Richard Burton should have received one as well. I've watched this movie twice now and will probably watch it again sometime in the furture. The art of story telling just isn't the same with today's movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"Edward Albee's plays often include long monologues that can either make or break a performance depending on the skills of the actors in question. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf features only four actors, and all four are in fine form as they tear each other apart. The film is too fast-paced to be called minimalist. Claustrophobic is more like it, oscillating wildly between absurd and tragic. Riveting performances by everyone -- the two Oscars, to Liz Taylor and Sandy Dennis, really should have been four. It's especially satisfying to see glam queen Liz Taylor let rip with Albee's earthy, 100% real dialogue. Try it. You'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a short but sweet review on a tough cookie","review":"I'm going to try to break this movie down without getting into long drawn out explanations. Liz and Burton, now married, plays a couple who invites a new younger couple(Sandy Dennis and George Segal) over for a \\"nightcap\\" thinking because she's the daughter of the President, things will look good for them, but that thinking is quickly changed when they walk into a unhappy home with a boozy wife, an unhappy professor who though beaten truly knows how to press Liz' buttons for ammunition and it's a fight to the finish, with the innocents in the fray. Not for the upbeat but if you like dramas of this caliber, here it goes and do enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Virginia Woolf Review","review":"I enjoyed this movie. I like how the directors of the movie move the fear of Virginia to the humbling of Virginia. I like how Burton comes up with his plan to overcome Woolf in the movie. I even wrote a thesis on the movie. My professor loves the article and praises me in her letter that she wrote back to me. The movie shows a side of Taylor that beginning Theatre students are exposed to. All in all, I enjoyed being exposed to an old movie that still has relevance to today.

Everything looks awesome and my favorite scenes are just incredible.The contrast of the film seems to be double. I am not sure if that is more a product of the transfer or the format, but the cloudscapes and cityscapes are unbelievable. I could watch The Grid over and over again.This is the best Blu-Ray disc. Period. If I could give it 10 I would.Thank you Criterion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Waterboy","review":"Don't mistake this CD for the \\"one-man-band\\", World Party.

And what are the things that all human beings ought to do for other human beings? Is the language of human rights (as entitlement) part of the problem as we try to understand what is ethical behaviour?Perry asks, and answers these questions. His writing is lawyerly, but accessible. He explores these questions for himself, taking you along for the ride.

I read this book immediately after reading 'Sacrilege' by Leon Podles, and the France book clearly comes in second place by comparison. This is, after all, written by an editor from Newsweek. You can't expect such a writer to know how to write. All this gay stuff like the Stonewall riot is completely out of place in such a book. As for this being the Catholic church's worst nightmare, may I humbly point out that the church's worst-ever nightmare was the Protestant Reformation? You know, the little matter of the loss of all of northern Europe? The Catholic clergy has always been fond of boys. This has never really been a secret. The idea that we just found out about it a few decades ago is nonsense. Where have you all been, that this took you by surprise?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very positive","review":"This book is a claim to the details that rocked the Boston Catholic Church by a man who has no idea as to what went on at the heart of the matter.

Most salient of all, the author of \\"Our Fathers\\", completely avoids the fact that the problems in the Catholic Church are the result of rampant influx of homosexuals, liberals, humanists, and modernists who continue to be ordained to this day. \\"Know the Truth and the Truth will set you free.

Get these and save your hearing, seriously. Studies have shown that decibel levels can go as high as 130 without a full face shield and up to 109 with a full face shield...these earplugs drop the decibels by 33. So, do the math..anything over 90 will cause deafness...wear a full face shield and use these earplugs...if you don't wear a full face shield, at least you'll be able to hear for a while longer (130db vs 97db)...Don't ride without ear protection..."},{"rating":"2","title":"groovy girls","review":"Girls love groovy girls.

It's probably best to start with an overview such as Copleston's \\"History of Philosophy\\".The one criticism I would offer is that Kant, however brilliantly insightful, clearly was not an artist. His insistence on there being no rules for beauty may seem true for the average non-artist person and create mediation between supersensibles (and give rise to much bad art in the process). But at the very least, there are really big hints as to how we perceive beauty, gestalt psychology being an example.

The instrumentals, ranging from moody to danceable, and the vocals, featuring the superb voice of Karen Matheson, catch the feelings of the Highlands at their best. I find myself drawn back to a family trip of a few years past that took us through the beautiful land of my fore-fathers. This CD is better listened to with the knowledge that it was done more to convey a feeling of a country than a \\"greatest hits\\" of a very talented group of musicians.

Real paint on a real canvas (not a print). Looks great and the price is amazing for something so well done. My only complaint is the shipping.

I have no children of my own and am planning on becoming part of a family with my boyfriend and his 2 children (deceased mother). And after reading the book, i feel like most of the information is common sense... it just seems like my idea of a stepmother is exactly that.... not a mother. another female other than the mother helping to raise the children... right? do most people not feel like that?

The research in the book is contemporary with response from young and old stepmothers defining the important choices, pitfalls, and joys that stepmothers encounter. There is so much good common sense wisdom in the book -- I'd recommend it for all women, even those who might some day in the future consider the possibility of stepmotherhood!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Straightforward and No-Nonsense","review":"This is a book that gets right to the point and doesn't waste my time throwing fakey \\"hugs and support\\" icons my way. It treats me as an independent and highly competent adult. The facts are there, the likelihoods, probabilities and tendencies and indications are all spelled out as well. It was well-written and researched and held my attention.This book may have saved my marriage (time will tell.) The plain-spoken-ness of the text informed me and my husband more concisely than the $250/hr psychologist we had been seeing.If you are or about to become a stepmother, read it now. Let me repeat, read it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Head and shoulders above","review":"I've read many guides and attended a seminar on stepfamilies to help prepare myself before I become the stepmom to two wonderful little girls. So far, that preparation has been so discouraging that I started to doubt the wisdom of going forward! But then I found Enlighted Stepmother. Finally, a positive perspective that acknowledges the courage and integrity of those of us selfless enough to accept and love others' children. Even if we may not feel \\"love\\" for them, we act in a loving way as we help raise those little people. This a truly helpful guide that smashes the stereotype of the stepmother as a second class women. This book will help you realize YOUR personal potential, not try to squeeze you like a square peg into a broken family.My applause and gratitude to the authors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!

My 12 year old son would reside with his father temporarily due to the fact that there wasn't enough room in my fiance's house. Big mistake! I suppose we just thought things would fall into place however we were totally taken aback when his 18 year old daughter blew up and told her father to make me leave. We definitely didn't have enough information going in. If I would have read this book 6-8 months ago, maybe we wouldn't be going through everything we're going through now. Great reading!!!

Also, the history is written in a very (VERY) baised view, with almost NO soical history (35% of the SAT II should be soical history). Lastly, I am not sure if the authors are NRA members or something, but the overall sense I felt after reading the histor review was that anything liberal is bad and President Bush is the greatest president ever.Buy a better book, go for the Kaplan or the Princeton Review.P.S.

With a fresher, more alive 90's sound, Johnny Van Zant picks up where his brother left off. Strong vocals, and the same driving guitars fuel an overall excellent album. Be forewarned- if you were a dedicated fan of the original Skynyrd, then you might have a hard time adjusting to the new vocals. For any rock fan though, this is an album that can be appreciated and listened to."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding Album CD to pay Tribute to the 20th Annversary of the 1977 Lynyrd Skynyrd Plane Crash!!!","review":"This is an outstanding Lynyrd Skynyrd album Cd \\"Twenty\\" to pay tribute to the 20th anniverary of the 1977 plane crash of Lynyrd Skynryd, and to honor those who died in that crash: Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, Cassie Gaines, and Dean Kilpatrick (Road Manager).This cd consists of 12 great songs. Some highlights include: \\"Voodoo Lake\\", \\"Bring it ON\\", \\"We Ain't much Different\\", \\"Travlin'Man\\" (This is outstanding - it has the late Ronnie Van Zant singing along with his brother Johnny - simply \\"awesome\\"), \\"Bernice\\" (the name of Gary Rossington's Mother and his Guitar), and \\"How soon we forget\\".This is a great one, and I recommend it. Thanks and may God Bless!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New material from new members with the old Skynyrd sound.","review":"It was good to hear new material from a band that has been through alot over the years. Even with the change in members they still have managed to keep the Skynyrd sound that fans love. Johnny has the heart and soul of his late brother Ronnie and brother Donnie (38 Special). Looking forward to their new release in late summer/ early fall 1999."},{"rating":"1","title":"All right. but....","review":"This reformed Lynyrd just doesn't have the energy of the original. This album isn't too bad if you don't compare it to the 70's recordings. The guitars sound rather lackluster and the tempos, especially on \\"Voodoo Lake\\" and \\"Home Is Where the Heart Is\\", are plodding in comparison. Watered-down, it reminds me of one of those biographical movies they make about a band or musician where they don't actually use any of the artist's(s') real recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album just isn't that great Skynyrd sound of old","review":"I have tried my best to like this album & the other post-reunion albums from Skynyrd, but I don't. Johnny Van Zant is a little too much \\"rebel yell\\" whereas Ronnie was a great singer songwriter. The guitars all sound the same. There is nothing even remotely as creative as the Gaines crystal clear solo in Sweet Home Alabama from the great 70s live album One More from the Road. They are now down to only 3 originals out of 7 members in the current band, which doesn't help credibility a whole lot, either. I would pick up 2nd Helping or Street Survivors instead. If your looking for some great recent southern blues music from the 90s try Where It All Begins CD from the Allman Bros Band."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss Ronnie so much.","review":"I bought this album just for the copy of Travelin' Man and a chance to here Ronnie's beautiful voice again. He truly is the greatest vocalist of all time. Unfortunatly, Johnnie can't sing half as good as him. That's not to say he's a horrible singer, but when I listen to Skynyrd, I want the sweet, smooth sound of Ronnie's voice, not the harsh, gravely sound of Johnnie's. The only song other than Travelin' Man that I listen to on this CD is Blame it on a Sad Song. It's really good, and it proves that Billy still has it. If you're a fan of the late, great Ronnie Van Zant, you own it to yourself to hear the only studio version of Travelin' Band in existence (even though Ronnie's part was sung live). But if you want to hear Ronnie at his greatest, get The Muscle Shoals Album. No one has ever sang like this since, or ever will again."},{"rating":"1","title":"20 X-tra Tracks (Import) Lynyrd Skynyrd)","review":"I feel that it was a good release, but it needs more Skynyrd style from the earlier years. I feel that Johnny could do as good as his brother if he tried. He needs to take more time into what he wants to re-do and what he wants to release. But all in all it was a fair deal. I would like to hear remakes of \\"All I can do is write about it\\" and \\"Cheatin' Woman\\". Songs like that would bring back memories for alot of fans and would be a welcome edition for the younger generation.

First of all, when I played my copied cds, they had unusual popping noises that were especially apparent during loud sections of music. Not only this, there was also a noticable background hiss. The media burned well, but the after some use, the label and reflective top layer began to peel away in some areas which would create large breaks during playback, and in some cases, prevent the cd from playing at all. Although this occured on Memorex green-gold 700Mb media, the color of the media does not affect playback, and I would expect the same problems to occur on this black media, unless the black media is manufactured differently, which is doubtful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat looking, skips with music","review":"Purchased these CDR's to use in my new Panasonic MP3 Car CD Player, while other disks worked flawlessly, on a drive of more then half an hour, these disks for what ever reason, would skip in places another disk with the same files would play consistently fine. I think it may (but of course this is heinsight) be caused by the colour black, being a colour that attracts heat.

I never had such a fail rate before, and I do a lot of burning. I used to use the Kodak Gold, and I was hoping these Memorex Black disks would replace those old favorites...Still, maybe my spindle was a clinker--also, on a couple of the CDs I sucessfully burned, there were skips and strange sounds when I played back on my stereo--I don't mind the occasional flukey CD, but when burning a lot (I run a CDR label) I need consistency and these lovely looking Black CDRs have me wondering.

In this film he plays a man 'obsessed' with Teresa Russell and there is nothing obsessing in his acting or his emotional delivery that makes us think that.The chronology mish-mash isn't interesting and the so-called suspense element is just too long to be effective. I couldn't help laughing at every cigarette consumed in this movie-trying to copy an art film, Garfinkel looks like a poor example of the Marlboro man he is trying to portray.Who is going to believe that someone like Russell would fall for Art in the first place. If I could have given this movie less then one star I would have. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Bad","review":"This movie is useful in only one sense: It illustrates that all Criterion Collection films are not classics. This is inept at best, laughably bad in spots and sports a misogynistic streak a mile wide. Art Garfunkel is the least convincing romantic lead since Keanu Reeves--only he lacks Reeves' charisma, if you can believe it. From no camera angle is Garfunkel remotely attractive and its ludicrous that Theresa Russell would so much as give him the time of day if she weren't paid. A lot. Russell does a bit better, but the director allows her to indulge her worst acting-class instincts in spots. Keitel is just silly, pseudo German accent and all. To cap it off, in scenes where Russell's character is explored, the song \\"Who Are You?\\" blares over the soundtrack, completely shattering whatever film noir mood had been created.Don't waste two hours of your life on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Timing","review":"I don't know what movie the other reviewers saw, but this is not a good movie.

A police inspector attemps to ascertain what has happened as well.The film contains some graphic sex scenes and is not for the easily offended.The DVD contains some bonus features which are an interview with director Nick Roeg, producer Jeremy Thomas, and actress Theresa Russell, a theatrical trailer, a slide show of production photos and posters of the film and some of Roeg's other films and deleted scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good Roeg period piece","review":"Innovative use of camera and flash-back sequences that might very well have inspired Tarentino distinguish this early 1980s classic, with memorable performances, even from Theresa Russell, and an understated script that reveals more through what is not said. The use of Klimt art work and the overall backdrop of the Vienna of Freud and Wittgenstein underscore the wistfulness of a once-grand intellectual centre in the same slow decay as the relationship depicted between Russell and Garfunkel. Denholm Eliott and Harvey Keitel give brilliantly understated supporting perfomances."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 65 LB Boxer Loves Diamond Naturals Beef and Rice","review":"I was feeding my Boxer pup Nature' Recipe until he was about 10 months.

I first purchase him the Chicken and rice, but he did not eat it very well, and my Boxer is not a picky eater. So, I decided to try the Diamond Naturals Beef and rice the next time. My Boxer, ate it so fast and was looking at me for more. The price at my local store is only $27.95 for a 40 lb. bag.

We are trying to mix in the last of the Iams food with this, but it is to the point where 2 of our 3 dogs have started picking the Iams out of the bowl and dropping it on the floor. It actually makes us feel bad to think we've been feeding them something that they hate for a long time. Either that, or Iams has somehow changed their ingredient blend, which is very possible. I first found out about this food from Dog Food Advisor. It ranks a 4 out 5 on their site, and they seem to break down the reasoning pretty well.If you smell this stuff next to Iams, you'll notice it actually smells like meat, and the Iams smells like a weird grain.

It is safe to say that my dog does not like this food one bit. She will eat my friend's dog food (which is Blue Mountain brand) but will only eat the Diamond Naturals unenthusiastically after what seems like days of letting the food just sit there. I also noticed that her coat lost much of its shine and lustre over the weeks that I was feeding her this food.

There is a reason umbrellas and most sun shades don't curve upwards -- the reason is that you don't want to get hit by the sun or rain when you are facing it!

I've been using it (not gently) for a month now (I don't remove it when I fold up the stroller) and have not seen any damage or frays at all.

The cat who sprayed goes a bit nuts about once a month and frequently attacks his smaller brother aggressively, simulating sexual activity.

Both cats have been checked for physical ailments, found not to have any, no changes in litter, food, etc. My friend is at her wit's end--I just keep a spray water bottle handy for my female cat and am finally to the point that I just have to reach for it and she stalks off in the other direction.

Our cat has FLUTD, a disease that that has no distinct cause (possibly food & stress related), where the cat builds crystals in his stomach that can eventually lead to blockage and death.Feliway was recommended to offset the smells of other cats that would come to visit our house. Neighboring cats visit frequently, looking in windows and sometimes spraying on the exterior causing our cat to become stressed and spray indoors. With the exception of a few occasions, after installing Feliway, our cat has stopped spraying. There have only been a couple of occurrences since we started using the product and that was when the bottles were low.We have also changed his diet completely, but it should be noted that he has no indication of new crystals building up in his intestines.

Tinto Brass probably wanted to make a tease-flick, but this is just a shame. The young lady who can't keep her skirt down flaunts her desire for sex before marriage in such a way as to embarass the viewer - especially shameful is the bar scene where she keeps displaying her crotch to a table of soldiers in order to get her boyfriend jealous. Too bad this went too far.

Lola's cute, but it's still not worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"An erotic masterpiece!","review":"The uncensored version of Frivolous Lola is an absolute erotic delight! Lola shamelessly teases every man in the film, and certainly every man that views the film, for the sole purpose of enticing her fiance to make love to her. Needless to say, she achieves her goal, and yet it is clear that Lola will keep other possibilities open once she is wed. Some of the more humorous moments in the film occur when we see how insanely jealous other women are when they see Lola effortlessly turn on any man that gets near her. I was so pleased that the uncensored version of this movie became available because the censored version I saw on TV teased me more than Lola! This film shows us how the world really works and that there's a little bit of Lola in every woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Movie!","review":"I enjoyed Frivolous Lola immensely.

While there are a few places where frames have been lost, the picture and sound quality are superior.

It starts out with \\"Sei nell' anima\\" a beautiful ballad, so nice and so easy. \\"Le carezze\\" a favourite, a tune with a heavy, groovy touch. \\"IO\\" another favourite, almost a disco-happy-feelings-tune, though the lyrics is oh so heartbreaking. In \\"Treno\\" you can enjoy Giannas close and touching voice, accompanied by a beautiful guitar and strings just so lovely. You'll get some good rocksongs in \\"Possiamo sempre\\" and \\"Mi fai incazzare\\". All the other songs are very good too. Gianna is surrounded by very good musicans all together, and by Will Malone, not the least, as Co-producer. Don't ever belive me! Find out yourself by getting your on cd.

Now it's not like I'm demanding it be a hair metal album. I realize Dokken couldn't stick with the '80's routine. And I actually like the sound of this album a lot. The last song, in particular, sounds great and more than the others is somewhat memorable.But most of the album sort of passes through my head pleasantly enough, leaving no memory at all. And that's kind of sad.Great band. Great players. I don't fault the performances or the sound. But the songs really don't connect, I'm afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dokken goes grunge (Yes, it's as bad as it sounds)","review":"Here Dokken jumps on the grunge/alternacrap bandwagon, with amazingly bad results. A bunch of boring, depressing songs with no real melodies or energy.This is George Lynch's last album with Dokken, but any studio hack could've played guitar on this and we wouldn't have known. Gone is the screaming Mr Scary Lynch style, and in its place is this half baked effort.Listen guys, people that like grunge (why, I don't know) aren't going to buy a Dokken album, and those of us that like good music don't want to hear the much detested \\"Seattle sound\\".Stay away from this if you like earlier Dokken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars Gawd this is AWFUL","review":"This is as bad as faux grunge can be. No harmonies, no guitar solos, no sing along songs or anthems. Just a lame attempt to hop on the grunge bandwagon. George said the purpose here was to kill Dokken...mission accomplished. Ignore the 5 star reviews by idiots saying \\"updated sound\\" or \\"into the 90's\\". Aerosmith, AC/DC, Black Sabbath all survived the 90 and are alive & well without updating their sound. But Dokken is RIP."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hollow Shell of their Former Self","review":"do not go into listening to this cd expecting to hear the Dokken from the glory days...you will hit someone in frustration if you do. This is not Dokken. They should be sued for false advertisement. and before some of you die hard fans start in with your \\"oh they're just starting down a new road\\"...well, the road they're on is the road to hell. This album sucks, and it is reflected with boring lyrics and even more more boring and mundane riffs and solos. If sound clips are available, just listen and hear the proof for your self. I went into this as a blind purchase expecting at least to hear some trace of the Dokken I remember from the Back for the Attack days...nope...nothing even close. To sum it up...pass on this one and just treasure your Breaking the Chains,Tooth & Nail, Under Lock and Key, and Back for the Attack cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 parts grunge + 1 part dokken = just 1 part dokken","review":"The problem with this CD is that the guys are making a very heavy handed attempt to \\"update\\" their sound into what is currently popular. Nothing wrong with maturing, but come on guys! Do you really have to imitate Alice In Chains or STP?? Please!!There are a couple of decent tracks, but when you look back at Dokken's library, there are several releases in which EVERY song is great.Luckily, Erase The Slate shows that they have realized the error of their ways! :) Too bad George is not around, though Reb does good work.Don't buy this unless you are a very diehard fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting. Different and worth getting","review":"It's easy to see why this was a nightmare for your regular fist pumping, beer drinking, truck driving, kicking back to hard rock at the end of a hard day redneck. But apparently there was enough ambition and music in Lynch and Dokken to want to stretch out which continued to some extent till Hell to Pay. And unlike what it sounds like to someone who swears off anything that isn't 80s, this isn't grunge like much; unless you count the discord. I can say I'm not put off by the music here on first listen and it's going to be engaging in the future too. There's melodies here too and I can hear there was much more effort put into this than your average 80s record. That includes Dokken's 80s stuff of which I am not a huge fan. Strange that must seem that such a fan might exist for a 80s hard rock band, but yeah I have to admit to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"When Dysfunctional came out many long time Dokken fans thought this was a new beginning. Not to be. Shadow Life sounds as if it was very quickly written and full of egos. It did sound as if Don may have stepped aside a bit and let the other members do some filler stuff. Bad idea! As much as I love Geroge's guitar playing there are just times on this CD that fills like he's just jamming for the the sake of jamming. And sorry, but I don't think Don should have ever handed the mike over to Mick. I knew after listening to this that it was over. I just had that feeling that something wasn't right. It's an album to be forgotten unless you're interested in hearing what happens to a band as it's falling apart......To bad because I personally felt that Dysfunctional was one of the all time great metal/hard rock albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike the vidoes, this rain is real!","review":"This is a hard album to review; if the Dokken monicker were missing, a good third of this is one deadly post Seattle record, by way of Kings X. But it came out as Dokken so in spite of some forward moving riffs, and spitfire guitar solos (remember these were still out of vougue in '97), this gets weiged down with all of the baggage that this once gleaming star from L.A. has now been reduced to aping a genre that is from Seattle, which might as well be Mars. (and guys, there's nothing wrong with Seattle writing, it's CLOUDY up there 10 montns outta the year, what do you expect their songs to sound like? freaking sunshine?) Third song in and this little experiment pretty much nosedives, picks up again with some head snapping riffery, then back down into that massvie puddle of woe. I'm tellin' ya though, put this out as an unknown breakout act, and it would've been a different take. Don's psychedelic meanderings not withstanding. Paste this review to \\"Dysfunktion'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dokken's weakest effort ever","review":"It is not the worst thing I have ever heard but it is not good either.They try too hard to be something they are not ,attempting to be grunge or something just does not work for these guys.I have just got there latest ( Lightning Strikes again)Lightning Strikes Againfrom 2008 and it is really good even without Lynch.Dokken fans you can pass Shadowlife up ,it is not worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all representative of Dokken's other music","review":"Dokken is, in my opinion, the best hard rock/light metal band - ever. Their classic three albums - Tooth & Nail, Under Lock & Key, & Back for the Attack, remain their best. Of their newer albums, Erase the Slate sounds closest to the classics. Unfortunately, Shadowlife is nothing like their other albums, in style or sound. Not for Dokken fans of the past who want the classic Dokken sound, and not what I would ever recommend to someone interested in hearing the band for the first time. Dokken is about soaring vocals, searing guitars, and a dark-yet-melodic style. Shadowlife is a misguided attempt at the Seattle sound. I would also highly recommend Don Dokken's Up From The Ashes album, which is excellent, and has John Norum on guitar (he has just joined Dokken as Reb Beach's replacement)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is bad!","review":"Quite simply put, this is not only the worst Dokken record ever made, it is one of the worst albums in my pretty large collection...and this is coming from a huge Dokken fan. Not one memorable hook on this CD no matter how many times I play it just to try and get into it. If you want a bright spot maybe the song \\"Sweet Life\\" merits some but on a better album it would still only be mediocre. Huge disappointment after the satisfying reunion album \\"Dysfunctional.\\" As soon as I need more space in my CD racks this one's disappearing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the trademark Dokken sound anymore.","review":"What I really wanted with Dokken is their music. Unfortunately there is no hope in this album. George Lynch technical playing slowed down and worse they tried the grunge sound. Maybe they are capable of playing grunge but this album is a failure. Jeff Pilson sounds much better during his Dio stints than in this album. For Dokken fans who emphasizes their trademark sound SAVE YOUR MONEY! For those followers who wish to know how a band undergoes maturity, perhaps you can try this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Dokken Album in the Catalog","review":"Being the Die Hard Dokken fan that i am and i do mean DIE HARD,i gave Shadowlife a chance even after i read how much Don hated this album and how George Lynch wanted to ruin the name Dokken.Well for starters the logo has changed (only for this Album) which sucks,they are attempting the grunge rock sound which is horrendous to begin with,and the songs arent even close as good to anything in their entire catalog.I mean if i had to pick one id say \\"Puppet on a String\\" is a decent track but other than that this is the ONLY DOKKEN ALBUM i dont listen to or give a near perfect rating to.Get \\"Long Way Home\\" or \\"Lightning Strikes Again\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Rokkin With Dokken","review":"My friend Mike was dead wrong when he told me to buy this.

When I popped in this CD, I had to make sure that an error wasn't made when it was packaged as I could not believe this is Dokken. Of course I have everything prior to this includine Erase the Slate and the other newer stuff, but these songs are absolutly horrible. There's not 1 memorable track that stays with you. This album is depressing as it is disapointing. There is no structure here. I'm all for a band to evolve with the times, but to do a total 180 is simply not that. For this incredibly talented line up to put out such horrible dredge is a slap in the face to a Dokken fan like myself who's followed and supported the band since the beginning.

And thats exactly what it turned out to be..for my collection. I was rather disappointed w/this release... DON should've never let the producer influence the direction of the disc. He tried to hard to get DOKKEN to go the way of Soundgarden, Pearl Jam,and whatever else was happening at that moment. I have only played it a few times because it was a let down. I am very pleased that DON saw the mistakes made and corrected them w/Erase The Slate. Its so good to HEAR the return of some of the best METAL ever...and DOKKEN didn't get enough credit during the 80's which is a damn shame. Hope they continue on w/Reb at guitar"},{"rating":"2","title":"George is back..for one more....","review":".....i can tell by his guitar licks, he isn't what he used to be. i am glad Dokken found a new sound on this effort. i only wish they kept evolving to a newer level.

Glad they re-did there old stuff and gave us the bonus of 2 new songs and a hint of what to expect in the future. I really love the 2 studio tracks. It gave me that feeling of coming home and see there are changes in your house and you actually are very pleased with it. I'm not a musician but a true dedicated follower of Yes and their music and if you could say Darwin's evolution is valid for music than you can say that the 2 new songs are in a logical pattern of the evolution scale of symphonic music. This makes you want more and hope for a follow-up in a style that matches this one but has even gone further in evolution. No doubt that Yes will answer our prayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Live Yes Other Than Yessongs, Decent Studio Tracks","review":"This is a very fine live album from a band known for live albums. Although some of the songs have been on previous live albums (Starship Trooper, Roundabout, etc.), most of them are previously unreleased in the live format (Awaken, Revealing Science, Onward, etc.), and are finally given their due here. All the performances are excellent, the band is very tight and in good form. We are even treated to an excellent reading of Yes's version of Paul Simon's America (which I had actually never heard before), and in the band's expert hands they make it sound like it was a Yes song all along. As for the two new studio tracks, they are both good, but nothing to write home about. That said, That, That Is (despite it's title) has a rare thing for Yes: comprehensible lyrics.Reccommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable!! !!! Amazing !!! !! After 30 years!! !! !","review":"King Crimson? - no way! ELP? Where are they? Genesis? They did the world a favor and finally split up! And there some others but YES remains the ultimate band for this type of music! And I can say that after 30 years they actually sound better than they used to! I watched the DVD that goes with this CD and I must say I was amazed at how good they are- in a \\"live\\" setting they would always make small errors or missed or goofed notes. Not this time-they are perfect. And unlike most \\"Classic\\" rock bands that just slow stuff down and sing in lower keys and generally leave out the hard stuff that made it great in the first place.....................YES does it spot on! Better than ever! This album will make you like them all over again and spend all your money on RHINO reissues. If you get the chance to see them on the 2004 spring tour I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Yes: Once again","review":"When I first purchased this compact disc back in early 1987, I was overwhelmed by the excellence of this recording.

I have since upgraded my opinion of it to almost tolerable, but by no means does it deserve the maudlin praises heaped upon it. The live performances are antiseptic (\\"Siberain Khatru\\", for example, should fly, and instead it plods), and the new tracks sound thrown together. In all fairness, \\"That, That Is\\" has some great moments, but those moments are counterbalanced by sheer cheese. This is Yes's weakest effort since Tormato. Fortunately, Open Your Eyes and the Ladder show Yes back on track and as good as ever. Buy the old stuff; buy the newest stuff, and consign this album to oblivion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last and too short","review":"This overrated grip doesn't last and is too short for any normal sized racquet.

My wife who is not a hard hitter also tore one up after a short amount of play and didn't like it. Overall, I am surprised at how popular this product is and can only assume it's all the paid endorsements.My strong opinion is that this product is obsolete. There are many newer, more advanced synthetic overgrips out there. By far, my favorite (in the same \\"dry\\" style not \\"tacky\\" as the Tourna Grip) is the Gamma Pro Wrap. Usually, it is also cheaper. What really sets the Gamma Pro Wrap apart over others I've tried is that the edges are reinforced whereas the others are just cut strips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total junk","review":"I've used many different type of grips before and I must say this is the worst of them all.

Unfortunately one arrived broken, but Amazon were excellent in replacing the chair very fast. Despite this first hiccup the chairs look fantastic and are a nice addition to the space. The down side is that they are rather narrow, they leach alot of the stain on the deck when they get wet (hosing them down a couple of times stopped that from happening again), and I believe the wood struts would break if you silly enough to stand on the chair.

The only problem I had with it was that it made me want to drink beer. Other than that, outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring not worth it","review":"This book is a complete waste of time. I bought it because I thought it was going to be interesting learning how a 26 year old girl changes her life. Instead, is an ongoing storytelling of how she drinks and smokes at every hour of the day. She spends her nights drunk and her mornings hangover.The most stupid thing of all is that she never learns anything. She never matures or appreciates life and people, and her friends are just as boring as she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that all about?","review":"I completely agree with the other reviewers who gave it 1 star. It is just a complete disaster. Managed to bore me to tears and I'm not usually bored easily. The story goes nowhere for the longest time and then suddenly the main character has a \\"light bulb moment\\"! What the @#%&The author has a nice way of writing the descriptive parts but the story is sorely lacking in depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I thought this book was excellent. I'm a fifth year doctoral student and I felt this book depicted graduate school life very well. The characters are well developed and the plot is good. I'd like to read a sequel to the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your best example of chick lit","review":"I've never written a negative review, and I don't want to be too horrible to this book. There were parts I enjoyed, and I finished the book. But overall, I was disappointed. Partly, I think, because the concept of the story appealed to me. Smart girl in a dead-end job goes to grad school in England. Sounds great, right?Unfortunately, the book never took off. I didn't really click with the characters, the plot wasn't compelling, the love story was half-hearted at best, and what the book mostly seemed about was drinking, getting drunk (very drunk), and recovering from the hangover in time to do it again. I'm no Puritan - I drink, sometimes a little too much - but this was rather appalling.I think that anybody who reads this book and thinks it strikes a chord should probably get themselves to an AA meeting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid.","review":"I don't like the characters. I don't know as there was a plot. I read many genres, and give up on few books, but I won't get my hour back that I spent reading the first half of this book. It was going nowhere fast, and I didn't give a hoot what happened to any of the characters.Decision: Not worth my time. Thank goodness it's a library book and I didn't spend any money on this worthless use of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the problem is just misrepresentation...","review":"As soon as I read the summary of this back, I grabbed it and headed for the checkout. I love books about England, and a book about going to school in England (a dream of mine!)seemed too good to be true. Unfortunately, this book is not about going to school in England, it is about drinking in England. Someone once told me that talking about drinking is the most boring thing in the world, and reading about it is close second. Not only did I find the constant boozing boring, I thought it was sad that a women in her mid-20s could waste an entire year of her life being hungover and experiencing teenage drama. I didn't like any of the characters, and there was no feeling of what studying abroad might be like. I think the problem is that this book presents itself as a student's experiences in a different educational system, but it is just about drinking and smoking--two of the most uninteresting things imaginable."},{"rating":"1","title":"English as a Second Language","review":"I thought the premise of the book sounded cute, but after 3 attempts and a complete inability to get into the book, I can't recommend it based on my experience. My opinion on any book, however, is most probably as personal as it would be on art or perfume. One cannot base an opinion of a book strictly from a review from a stranger. This is one opinion only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiring","review":"I don't know why i bouth this predictable romance book, I thought that set in England it would funny but it is not. I couldn't even finish it... although the cute teacher is described to be out of this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"When it comes to chick lit, I am very easy to please. But this book just didn't cut it for me. It was very difficult to remember that the main character, Alex, is a 26 year old woman. The characters were not only immature, but they were also raging nicotine and alcohol addicts, which got old after the first chapter.It's hard to believe that Toby and Alex end up together at the end of the story after all the dumb fights they had. Suzanne was a waste of time and towards the end around the last 5 chapters or so, I only read the dialog. My favorite part of the book is Sean Douglas. If the author writes more, I'd be willing to read them, but my expectations will be very high.ONLY if you are prepared to be disappointed and you have a lot of patience, then I would suggest reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the hype...","review":"I had read so many great reviews of this book that I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I loved Crane's novel Frenemies, and hoped that this book would be just as good.Unfortunately, I was never able to really get into the story. It wasn't so bad that I stopped reading, but it was nothing more than average. I found the tone a bit too detached, and the character development was definitely lacking. It seemed to be little more than a stringing together of drunken shenanigans (that were definitely not laugh out loud funny)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It keeps me laughing...","review":"I'm not usually much of a reader. I only reason I first picked this book up was because I had to read a book for my english class and it was the first book with bright colors on the front that caught my eye. I however got so caught up in this book that i couldn't put it down. I got caught up in the characters and their dramatic situations. If you are looking for a fun, light-hearted read that will make you laugh out loud this is definitely the one for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I incorrectly assumed this book would be funny, with a unique spin. I was wrong. I found 'English as a Second Language' very lacking in plot, with a few cliches thrown in for good measure. You have a token supposed heroine, unsure about life--so she beings anew! There's the seemingly psychotic girl, a couple of hot men, and a lesson to be learned. I found the ending abrupt, and left me unfulfilled. I think there are several better choices out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drunk Drunk Drunk","review":"This book started out promising, and went down hill the moment the main character landed in England. I've spent enough time there to know that the CONSTANT alcohol consumption is a true representation of the culture. However, it doesn't make for interesting characters or plots. Somewhere in a haze of tequila fumes and cigarette smoke the heroine learns some of life's lessons. However, we know from the get-go what they are going to be. Don't engage with psychotic people. Don't only fall in love with unavailable men.It had it's moments and some great lines. Overall, it was a mediocre entry into the fabulous world of Chick Lit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at Best","review":"See title. Mediocre at best. I went into this book, expecting wittiness and a fresh story, and left wishing it was over with already. For an author with a PhD in English Lit, I was very disappointed with her writing. She walked in circles for over 200 pages. Don't bother even reading the summary."},{"rating":"1","title":"it wasn't that great","review":"I thought this book sounded funny but was I wrong! It could be interesting if the author actually ever got into the story but the whole time I felt like the author was just summarizing every situation which made it completely confusing and boring. Good for a summer read, but nothing beyond that."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh, not quite","review":"Despite being funny in some parts, it was definitely not worth my $12. There wasn't much plot and the conclusion (wait, was there one?) was far from exciting. As another reviewer said, the main character acts more like an undergrad freshman than a 25 year old woman, and it gets boring to read about bars, cigarettes, and petty catfights over and over. Sorry Crane, try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away. Run away fast.","review":"This book was pretty much just awful. It didn't hold my interest, I didn't really care for any of the characters and was not at all motivated to see how it all ended. It was not that well written either. I like \\"chick lit\\" in general and read quite a bit of it... this book is one of the worst I have ever attempted to read from this genre. Don't waste your time. And if you feel compelled to read it, borrow it from a library. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"This was one of the worst 'chick lit' books I've ever read. Here is the plot: drink, drink drink, whine, whine, whine, drink, drink, drink. And in the end, suddenly learn a little something about yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin is King","review":"I cannot say enough about this music. I really liked \\"Children of Paradise\\", it made me feel free, \\"Sometime less is More\\" was a the perfect romantic ballad, BUT..... Justin has not written a better song than \\"Broken Dream\\". The lyrics, he could have written this song for this only widow, \\"open the flood gates and I'm helpless\\" \\"I love you still and I always will\\" and \\"gone are the days when I could bounce right back again\\". The guitar was amaizing, but the best part of the song was Justin's voice whan he sung the words \\"running with open arm to greet me\\". What a voice!! I have been a Moodies fan since 1969. They have always given me pleasure, especially Justin's \\"Broken Dream\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin Hayward outdid himself with this recording.","review":"Every song is a masterpiece. But one song that saddens me is \\"Billy\\". If we look at what's happening in our own country with troubled youth, this song can apply to it all. Sad, really sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christie","review":"Wonderful CD! Love Justin's music. Love the Moody Blues. My alltime favorite band. The words in the songs say it all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Justin Hayward solo album, you get it all with this one","review":"I have all of the Moody Blues albums, and now CD's. I have always liked their ability to write a melody good enough to pull you inside of it and yet keep the solos (guitar or otherwise) somehow within that melody. Justin Hayward also writes some of the best words in popular music; most of his images are positive, a relief from the junk on today's popular music shelves. He also has the voice to bring anyone to the Moody Blues' music.My boy and girl, ages seven and five, ask that I play The View From The Hill CD in the car when we travel. And after we get home they fight over which one of them gets it in their room. I'm going to have to get my own copy soon.The recording sound wise is outstanding, I don't have any better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Justin Hayward - 'View From The Hill' (CMC International)","review":"Looks to be Justin Hayward's most recent of five solo efforts he'd put out.Certainly nothing to write home about.Great for him he's got the Moody Blues to fall back on.Only tunes here I was even somewhat impressed with were \\"Broken Dream\\" and \\"The Way Of The World\\".I'd classify the entire 'View From...' disc as soft rock rather than classic rock,for which I'll assume this CD was aimed to be.For serious Moody Blues fanatics,die-hards and completists ONLY."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic songs - love it more with each frequent play","review":"Owning every Moody Blues album and CD, getting this solo album by their lead singer was a no brainer. What I wasn't prepared for, was to enjoy this CD much more than any MB recording ever made!! Truly wonderful songs that put a smile on my face as I insert the CD into my home, car or motorcycle player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin At His Best!","review":"This is probably the best solo to come from a member of the Moodies. Justin Hayward is superb on this as a solo artist. Some of these songs could have easily been for a Moody Blues album. Despite his age, Justin's voice comes shining through as it did in his younger days. His clear, smooth voice just takes the listener in with such beautiful songs as I Heard It and Billy along with a few others. A definate must for any Moodies or Justin Hayward fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best view from the Hill just you and Justin","review":"I have listened to this CD over and over again. This is some of his best music and I feel like he is singing just to me. He is an amazing musician with an amazing voice. I burned this CD on my computer at work, burned it on a blank one so I could listen to itin the car. It is just the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"old musicain's poor album","review":"Often we happen to meet old musican's poor outing to the his brilliant younger days. That's it.

Great pictures, and thorough, complete guidance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mercedex Benz S420 repair manual","review":"This book was not what one would expect by description. It is complicated and not specific to the S420 as described. This book is geered more for a top mechanic or a automobile builder who would have a vast amount of knowledge about cars. It is not for the average person wanting to know about their car. I got the book and sent it right back with the hour as it was not for me and did not tell me nothing for my S420."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read, moving and informative","review":"This is an excellent book. It shows readers a better alternative to so-called forced busing which got its worse name in the city of Boston. But this book is about a voluntary program that let black kids go to suburbia. The writer really lets the former students talk for themselves and because of that it is a really moving book that feels honest and real. When the writer does comment on things, it is always very graceful and plainly spoken. This book does not try to be overly academic, and so is a welcome treat to read. I wish there were more 'human' books out there about subjects like this, which are usually written in very dull, dry styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Missing?","review":"Why weren't there interviews of suburban kids who shared classrooms with the METCO kids? I doubt it would surprise anyone to learn that the METCO kids were disruptive, stole things, and terrorized and bullied other students. Great for race relations, eh?There was one guy who was so bad, I looked him up a few years later to see if he was in jail yet. Turns out he became a drug dealer and got shot and killed. Of course the Boston Globe blamed it on \\"easy access to guns.\\" Haha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep and Simple","review":"Without a hint of the 'do as I say, not as I do' this is a very brave idea, project and now book. From conception to delivery it is a liberation - I would lend you my copy but know I wouldn't get it back. It dares to 'think small' and celebrates the pleasure - personal or wide reaching - that freeing yourself from your own expectations can so often bring. But there are absolutely no excuses made for excuses and as the book says it is less 'how to' than 'why not'.People have been moved to tell their stories - lots of them. And these are sometimes funny or inspiring and not always perfect. This is a very generous book, in all ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Easy Guide To Living A Great Life","review":"I've never read a book like \\"2Do Before I Die.\\" It's an uncomplicated way to review your life and plan for the future. Peppered throughout the book are thought provoking questions... smartly illustrated... that enhance the reader's experience.It reminds us that life can be exciting and fulfilling. It's a self-help guide to living your life without regrets!For me, it was an interesting look into other people's... dreams... and significant, life changing moments. It's insightful, uplifting, and has inspired me to think about what I want to do in my lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is alright","review":"I gave it to my bf for a vday gift along with some other small gifts. He wanted a book like this to replace the one he lost. I was not to impressed with it. It was interesting to read the begingin of it however, and it did the job.Ok gift for someone who is into these sort of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-mazing shirts and underwear","review":"I've pretty much switched my entire underwear to ExOfficio over the past year b/c of how amazing they perform when I was traveling. I bartend 6 nights a week and these babies stand the test of time and wear. When the shirts came out I figured why not! Just put it on today and it feels amazing! The same magic material for my upper body. Just ordered 3 more shirts. Get some."},{"rating":"2","title":"ExOficio Tees","review":"I have bought two of these tees now to try them out as a means for reducing luggage weight on multi week overseas trips. I have tested the washing by hand and drying overnight and it works as advertised. The tees have a good feel when being worn. If you wash with other items beware that the fabric may \\"pick\\" due to buttons or zippers. Overall I am a fan and have purchased two types of the boxer/undershorts to try and am very happy with those. Actually, they are lightweight and great for warm temperatures or for wear during active periods. A great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"sleeves are way too long and stick out from short sleeved shirt","review":"These were purchased for a trip, and although the fabric dried quickly as expected, we were very disappointed to find that the long length of the sleeves made it impossible to wear them with a short sleeved shirt! This is just plain bad design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great material, odd fit","review":"I purchased a couple of these t shirts for trip but had to return them. I have no doubt the material is excellent (I own some of their boxer briefs) when it comes to wicking moisture, but the fit was really weird. I'm 6' with a slender build and found the sleeves to be really long while the length was way too short. There's no way it would stay tucked in as an undershirt, so I returned them. Perhaps, a large would have been better lengthwise but the sleeves would have fit like a 3/4 sleeve baseball jersey. I like retro but not that much..haha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, could be better","review":"Great fabric: keeps you cool, doesn't smell, dries quickly. But the cut could use some improvement. The collar touches the front of my throat and not the nape (and no, I'm not wearing it backwards...). And it could be cut a bit sportier - just look at IceBreaker for a first-rate cut. Good sleeve length and size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Length Too Short","review":"I have a lot of Ex-Officio products - they make great travel/outdoor pants and shirts. I ordered two of these undershirts in medium and they fall short - literally and figuratively. I am a perfect medium size and 5' 10\\" tall. While the width around the torso is fine, the length is too short - it barely meets my belt line. I should have studied the catalog photo more closely, you can see for yourself, the proportion indicates a shorter length."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an okay product, but I was hoping for more.","review":"I'm not as pleased with these as I was pleased with the boxer briefs of the same brand. These aren't wearing as well, and they don't seem as tough. After purchasing the underwear, I purchased more of them. I will not be purchasing more of the t-shirts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for long trips","review":"I bought a few of these shirts for a 3 week trip to South America. These shirts are really great! They are made of a waffled \\"dri-fit\\"-type of material. They breathe incredibly well and don't stick to you even when sweaty. The material itself is good, but is more snag-prone than other materials imo. Also, since it breaths so well, it does not offer much sun or insect protection. Nevertheless, this shirt is perfect for hot weather trips.As a word of warning, in terms of sizing, these shirts run a bit smaller than the sizing chart would indicate. I have a 40\\" chest and should technically wear a medium, according to the chart. Medium fits like a muscle tee. If you are borderline between sizes, you might want to consider going up a size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collar frays immediately","review":"I love this company's products, but the collar on this shirt frayed immediately. I don't know if it's because of contact with razor stubble or a beaded necklace, but it didn't hold up at all and immediately began fraying. That was a surprise given how wonderful their other products have been. Wouldn't purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like it except...","review":"Great t-shirt except it balls up and has wear issues. The material is great. I could almost overlook the weird wear issues except it's very expensive. I like plain black t-shirts and this one became my favorite for about two weeks. Then it started to look worn out around the waist area, balling up and looking generally unkempt. If it kept it's condition I would buy about 30 of these, one for each day of the month. Maybe there is another black t that will get into 'exclusive black t' territory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, dries fast (but not as fast as it claims).","review":"I bought three tees previously for a long trip, it works great. Dries pretty fast compared to normal cotton and feels comfortable too. Recently, I bought two more. Its an overall practical tee for travelling and even normal wear.But, one thing about this product material is that its kinda weak against abrasion and certain parts became a little fluffy over a time. Not a big deal, but something to take note if you know you are gonna wear it out. Same goes for the briefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced, small sized and not worth it!","review":"I wear a size large and ordered that size. I could barely get the shirt on. I wear a size 42 sport coat, so I'm not a big person, but this was sad. It was also over priced for the quality. Seems like Ex Officio needs to start making quality gear again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Odor Resistant","review":"The product description states, \\"this tee is odor resistant\\". Not true. First time I wore it as an undershirt, I sweat a little bit and I could smell it through my dress shirt. It's very comfortable though but not worth $31."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neck pills after 5 wearings.","review":"I am really disappointed in the Tee from ExOfficio. The boxers are amazing, comfortable and seem to be durable. The Tee shirt pilled around the neck after only 5 wearings. I have purchased 2 and am returning them to Amazon. For the cost, they should be better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel!","review":"This shirt was perfect for packing light to go to Europe! I'd reccomend it to anyone who travels and wants to go with just one carry on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Does what it's supposed to - washes easily, dries quickly. However, shorts and a tee shirt will dampen the bath towel which you use to do the initial drying until its beyond use until it dries, which takes a lot longer than the underwear. Don't use your only towel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most User Friendly","review":"This is a complete book that demonstrates stretching, strengthening and self-massage for sore and painful body parts. Chapters 3-9 are dedicated to separate areas of the body that allow the reader to go right to THEIR OWN specific concerns and immediately begin to understand what to do about them. Superb illustrations and excellent instructions direct the reader on very effective protocols along with what the authors call \\"recipes\\" for maintaining good integrity in the different regions. As a Nationally Certified Personal Trainer, I specialize in Active Isolated Stretching and Strengthening and wholeheartedly recommend this book as a must for all my clients. Together with Aaron Mattes upper and lower body stretching charts and an 8 foot rope anyone can get great results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Korean War production","review":"This film captures the horrors, the brutality and the madness of war, but it also hones in on the love for two brothers and their harrowing experiences as they enter the combat that rages around them. The attention to detail was impressive, the director catches the agony and terror and misery quite well. The combat sequences are authentic and brutal and the storyline is touching and makes one proud and angry at times. The two brothers risk their lives time and again for different reasons and the paths they take are filled with dangers, excitement as they see combat for the true evil beast that it is.I suggest DVD and put it on 'English' and no subtitles to enjoy the drama. Well worth the viewing and will rank among the very best war films in the last twenty odd years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Phenomenal","review":"Never have I witnessed such a divine blend of attributes sum into a two and a half hour masterpiece. It is no by no means a mindless war movie, but rather a multidimensional insight into the dreads of real war. The moral, cultural, and personal implications of Civil War were masterfully composed in this form of cinematic art."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Better War Films","review":"The Brotherhood of war is about two brothers that get caught up in the Korean War. They face the had tasks of defending there country in a war they don't understand. The battle scenes are intense and realistic on par with Saving Private Ryan. But what is best is the character moments, seeing what they go through and how there country was torn apart from both sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"IMHO, better than Saving Private Ryan","review":"What an incredible movie about life during the Korean War. My mom lived through this war, so I have heard some first-hand stories of what life was like back then. But to see the lives of these 2 brothers striving to make a better life for themselves and then get put into situations that most of us couldn't even fathom, it really puts what my mom went through into perspective.The story was very well written and the acting was phenomenal. There were some very gruesome parts, so it's definitely not a movie for young children. As my title suggests, though, I did like this movie more than Saving Private Ryan, though that movie is another gem as well. And I'm not even a big fan of war movies. Go figure...."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great anti war film ruined by a used copy","review":"An amazing film--anti war, humane and totally unexpected from South Korea. Unfortunately I had ordered a used copy of this movie which killed its impact due to scratches and same such on the dvd.

This movie, although sad, is a really good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most authentic portayal of combat on film","review":"Saving Private Ryan must stand aside in the wake of this authentic portrayal of post WW2 combat. The weapons are authentic...plenty of M1 Garand action. The battle scenes are excellent and make SPR look like a war movie from the 1930s. The love Jin-Tae has for his younger brother provides the heart of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"unremarkable and at times slightly absurd","review":"This isn't a review of the entire movie - just the first 45 minutes or so. That was my limit for this (almost) comically earnest tale of brotherly love and heroism. For those who suggest that there's no such thing as overacting in Korea, please.Interested in much better acted (and more intelligent) somewhat recent Korean films? Try Chunhyang (2000), or The Host (2006)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretentious film for suckers.","review":"This is possibly one of the cheapest knockoffs of \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" It copies what Spielberg perfected, but takes it to another level that it becomes completely pretentious and fake. The shaky camera movement during the battle scenes do not feel genuine. Instead, the director enhances it as if to suggest that Spielberg's war was not real or brutal enough. This is possibly one of the worst war films I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAE GUK KI","review":"This movie is beautiful, my sister and me had no problem with the transaction and shipping.

You cannot replace the brush head or the batteries!!! That is absolutely ridiculous, any powered toothbrush I have ever owned (even ones that retail for less than tooth tunes) has a replaceable brush head and batteries.

I could just hear the marvelously distinctive voice of Miss Channing as I read along and at one point, began to believe that I was part of a personal conversation between old friends.Miss Channing writes with remarkable candor and insight gleaned from many years of experiencing life. Her remembrances of her great stage triumphs (Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Hello, Dolly!) are mingled with tales of family life with her extraordinary parents and her later friendships and romances.There is nothing salacious here, just good, fun reading by a totally delightful woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather Choppy- but fun!","review":"Carol Channing's autobiography is a fun read indeed, but is rather choppy. It was previously said that she never really finishes her stories, and that is ture, however, I was never left wanting. Her narrative is very entertaining, and the anecdotes are fun tidbits to tell! There really is one for every occasion!A must for Channing fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you really know Carol at all, you will love this book.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, probably because I have had the pleasure of talking with her recently. What some don't understand, who gave bad reviews, this book is handled as a conversation with the reader. It is what you would have if you sat down with Carol Channing, kicked your shoes off and wanted to hear her talk about the many experiences she has had in her life. It was not put together by some ghost writer who felt you had to have everything in a set sequence, very boring in many autobiographies. There is a lot of information given about other greats on the stage and a lot of technical information about how musicals are put together. Every drama student and teacher should read this as there are gems you will never see in standard textbooks. This is not to say the book is perfect, but once read you will think of Carol Channing as not just an icon of the musical comedy world, but as a personal friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scatterbrained","review":"With all due respect to Ms. Channing....I found this book VERY hard to get through. She changes subjects on a dime, making it hard to follow a thought. It's also written for an industry insider. She drops the names of producers and stage managers as if they're the big stars. I read a lot of entertainer biographies and was really looking forward to this one...but I found my self skimming to get past sections that frankly I found made no sense. The few sections that did seem lucid...were entertaining, especially a part in the back about Ethel Mermann. But unfortunetly I can NOT recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scatter Brained","review":"With all due respect to Ms. Channing, I found this book to be rather scatter brained. She changes subjects in mid-sentence!It's also written for an industry insider. She drops the names of producers, set designers and costumers as if they are the big stars. There was one good bit at the end of the book where she talks about Ethel Mermann...but that's not enough.

They are two of my favorites. So you'd think this would be a home run. But...It is probably the worst autiobiography - no, the worst book - I've read in years. It is so poorly edited - rambling stories - most of the interesting people she mentions, she does so in the third person \\"I hear Judy Garland liked pink too.\\"A complete waste of time - Miss Channing has had a completely unique life - it's too bad she chose not to write about it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Once again, I've wasted my money on a totally unreadable book.

Not interesting at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A STORY ABOUT AN EARTH ANGEL","review":"This is the first autobiography I have read where a person's life has/had no bumps whatsoever. No hurdles, no challenges where everything happened perfectly and all persons she met were also perfect, wonderful, completely talented, and complimented her repeatedly. Oh me, 'twas quite sickening. Carol Channing is a talented, unique individual but an author she is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denial is a River in Egypt","review":"Carol Channing's memoir is not candid at all. This is the story of a lady that spent 40+ years on the road doing tour after tour after tour because she was in a loveless unhappy marriage. Her abusive husband was living high off the hog with his male lover while she was out performing all over America. She had a terrible life until her husband's death...and only recently she met her current husband, a wonderful loving millionnaire whom she dated originally in Junior high. It's a fascinating story which you will not find in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Edition, sold by Amazon LLC, is shoddy!","review":"I wish I'd known that the book I was paying 14.95 for was a poorly reproduced knock-off of the original edition. The cover art is out of focus, and the internal photos all look like they were run through a bad photocopier. Amazon LLC doesn't let you leave \\"feedback for the seller,\\" so I urge buyers to proceed with caution when ordering their products. The options I'm able to find online are a)return the book or b)track the shipment. How about an option like \\"complain that the book isn't worth 14.95, and ask that I be credited ten dollars.\\" Caveat Emptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello Dully!","review":"Now, I understand that as we look back on our lives that we tend to remember the good times rather than the bad, but Carol does so to the point of chronicling a rather dull existence. She leaves out all the stories that made her one of the great survivors in the industry. Case in point, there's no mention of the story when Frank Sinatra beat her to within an inch of death with a pillowcase full of doorknobs. There's no mention of her bloodfeud with Rosemary Clooney and how she once pulled a knife on Clooney and cut off her pinky toe. And of course, the greatest omission of all: Carol has an irational fear of men with mustaches. Could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two bricks short of a load.....","review":"What a waste of money & time!!!!!! The author is obviously in her dotage & cannot complete a sentence or a thought.Where were her editors???? Very disappointing read!!!!

To the Candlemass fan, this album is essential for it has fan favorites as \\"Under the Oak\\", \\"Dark Refelections\\" \\"Somewhere in Nowhere\\" and the title track. This album has the recognizable slow, sorrowful bass and guitar riffs and the operatic voice of Messiah Marcolin, the drum seems to beat slow, doomy, masterful. I think that anyone that is into Doom metal really needs to check Candlemass out, they are unique sounding and atleast for the first 4 albums, have the coolest album covers I have ever seen. Get this album and let the doom flow..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"Have ordered these three times now and find them as good as any I've used.

The kids in the story plan on blowing up their school with a bomb. I'm positive that the author of this book has no bomb making knowledge, because the kids in the book plan on blowing up their school with gunpowder from fireworks. This would be an extremely bad choice for blowing up a school. Getting the stuff inside of fireworks and making a bomb with it is near impossible.Besides this flaw in the scheme the author is lazy with her art and does a very bad job with backgrounds. The backgrounds are often solid white for pages. The characters a chiches and other problems with this book (They'd spoil the story too much so I won't go into them) earn this book 1 star.Don't buy this awful mess of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMGosh THIS IS SO AWESOME","review":"Okay, if you love playing Playstation ... and you can't get ENOUGH of it and want to play it EVERYWHERE like, in a car, in your bed, somewhere OTHER than the T.V. this is what you need.

If you've ever felt bad over a breakup, I recommend to you this CD with no reservations.

The closest words that could possibly be put to describe this album are on the album itself: read the nonsensical title and you have it for yourself.From a musical standpoint, a drunken monkey could have made better music. Out of the 12 songs on this CD, there were two that had a somewhat definite melody, and two that had a definite beat, making three-- yes, only three-- less than mediocre songs. The rest sound like a drunk guitar player and someone else shooting someone with a machine gun.From a lyrical standpoint, I say: what was that again?Looking at the CD alone, I laughed. The first song sounds like something out of a video game, while the titles resemble random phrases of dark sounding words put together. Here's the 13th song on the album: \\"Fiery Death Consumes Miserable Demons\\"All in all, this album has little, if any value whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT [stinks]","review":"1st off, if your into karate/stunt/gangsta/westside movies, this one is for you.

We expected a Menace 2 Society or Boyz in the Hood, and we got a \\"Bruce Lee Visits The South Side\\" joint. There are 2 main sound effects in the entirety of the movie, they are \\"Ka\\" and \\"Pow\\". There are also about 3 words said in this movie that have more than 1 syllable. Not counting the must-have 4 letter words. The whole plot comes down to 2 guys beatin the nuts out of each other in a strange gang/cult's hideout, and of course, the main character, Boo saves the day.

This book has an unexpected ending even though it's not exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gymsuit","review":"The book was a pretty good book. It's about this girl and her name is Marcy. She is chubby and dosen't like her body. She gets a new English teacher,and they start a club called Smedly. They go after school every Monday. They talk to each other to get to know each other. Then Marcy starts to talk more in scholl and shes not so shy. The new English teacher gets fired because well I won't tell you you'll have to read the book yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every girl who's not Ms. Popularity should read this book!","review":"I read this book over fifteen years ago, and remember it as vividly as yesterday.Marcy is a well-rounded protagonist, and not just literally. However, as a teenager, she sees herself -- her self-image -- as one of her biggest problems.There is SO much more to this story than Marcy's grey sweatshirt!She is lucky enough to not only have a supportive (albeit kinda weak-willed) mother, an adoring little brother, good friends, and a teacher who teaches her about SELF-esteem.I came across this title when looking for Paula Danziger and hope to find grown-up books by her. If I *can't* find any, though, I will happily reread all the kids' books again. Absolutely delightful -- I would have done well with a Ms. Finney if I'd been so blessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars","review":"The issues presented in this book (difficulty in school, an abusive parent, feeling like the outsider) are as prevelent today as they were when I read this book over a decade ago. You won't believe how much you will relate to Marcy and get absorbed into her world and her daily struggles. You will literally feel what she is feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but I was expecting more....","review":"I read this book with great excitement, since I'd read there'sa bat in bunk 5, and I'd heard great stories about the book. But a CatAte My Gymsuit didn't live up to the high expectations. I reccommend Edward Bloor By The Way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it a mystery? or a Romance?","review":"Don't get me wrong. I love a good light-hearted mystery and/or a romance with a little suspense thrown in, but not in the same book. About halfway through the mystery got lost and the romance took over. By the end, I really couldn't have cared less about who had done it and why. The characters also seemed too one-dimensional. Angie is sterotypically young, beautiful, and rich. She also has a fabulous career. Paavo was drawn slightly deeper, but still the sterotype of a dark, brooding cop who has a past remained. I have not read the additional books in the series, but from this first one, I probably will not. The premise is intriguing, and heaven knows, any addition to genre is appreciated. I enjoyed it only when I realized it was more of a romance than a mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fast-paced Cozy","review":"Although very predictable (I had it figured out by page 50), this mystery is fun to read and hard to put down.Joanne Pence finds just enough balance between a hard-boiled criminal investigation and sizzling romance to turn this book into a nice, fast-paced cozy that would otherwise be a complete disappointment to cozy mystery fans.However, Angie Amalfi's character needs a little work. Although she wears her emotions on her sleeve and seemingly has a heart of gold, she still comes across as slightly spoiled and oblivious to anything that goes on in the \\"real world\\".I'm looking forward to reading the next mystery in the series to see how things develop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This is the second of Joanne Pence's series that I have read (I'm reading them out of order it seems). It was very good. I just received my order from Amazon of her other books and can't wait to start reading. I hated to put the book down to let go of the wonderful characters (are there really cops like Paavo Smith? It makes you want to get into trouble just to meet them if there are!) I look forward to reading more about Angie and Paavo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, light, but murderous.","review":"Hurrah! The initial books in the Angie Amalfi mystery series are being reprinted. It's great to read how Angie and Paavo meet, and find out about their backgrounds. This book is fun because you don't know until well through it how all the threats and murders and murder attempts are linked. Why is someone trying to kill this nice food columnist, just because she publishes recipes like Liver Pate Waffles and Marshmallow-Sprouts Blintzes? And how can she convince the police detective that she really loves him, for more than his protection?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"The series starts out with an interesting mystery and characters that switch around the usual typecasts- this time the heroine is the rich one (though not self-made- she's more an heiress) and the hunky love interest is the cop with a dark past. [....] Having a somewhat ditzy woman to lighten up a loner guy could work... [...]For this book though, Angie is still tolerable. If you're looking for anything culinary from the series, look somewhere else- its something Angie only dabbles in."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real disappointment","review":"I love mysteries combined with romance, so when a romance started to develop I eagerly read on. However, Pence goes way overboard, laying it on so thick that you think you're reading a Harlequin Romance. Added to that, the heroine--since there's no way you can call her a detective, even an amateur one--continually gets herself and others into hot water through her sheer stupidity. She also has few positive characteristics, not someone I could relate to or see as a role model; she's just a nice, stupid girl without any common sense. This book was just plain irritating. I'm definitely not going to order any more Angie Amalfi mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"American music in its truest form","review":"This roots rock album shuffles, rocks and rips it's way along at an enjoyable pace for anyone who appreciates where rock came from. Have seen Nardella do his thing over the past 20 years and his passion comes through on the CD. If you like anyone from Chuck Berry to early Elvis to the Blues ... this CD won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"Well, what can I say? I have 'tried' these because I don't give my 7 Greyhounds anything I don't taste test first. They really are not too bad, considering. Beef flavor can be identified, but personally I found the 'roll' a bit glue-like. Perfect for my two oldest guys with only a few teeth left, esp. when having to give medicine in pill/capsule form."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCAM!!!","review":"This is NOT twelve individual 7-oz packages of Snausages, but ONE 12-oz package!

This set did nothave a decal or red paint as the picture showed. Thus this was not a red tail. Alsothere was no green paint for the ground vehicle. It took my son 6 hours to put it together.He enjoyed putting it together~this is the only positive thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh my GOD.","review":"Before I say anything about this product, I would like to warn you that it smells. I can't necessarily describe the smell, but go on other websites, read reviews. It really really smells. Which makes it really hard to keep on your face for 5-10 minutes.Other than the traumatizing smell, the product seems to work, although I'm not quite sure. After washing off the medicine, my face was smooth but it felt very dry and unpleasant.I'm a huge Neutrogena fan, but I hate this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wlk Talk","review":"Of the books I've read on elk hunting so far Elk Talk has provided me with the best information on hunting during the rut in September. The section on cow talk has been most helpful. Now I just have to work on my calling techniques. I recommend this book to anyone who is new to elk hunting or even seasoned pros who need a final peice to help improve their success."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Honest Review","review":"1) First off...this thing between that kid and you weird fans needs to end. She barely has talent. Horrible voice and barely co-writes. Thats it.2) I purchased this album for \\"Goodies,\\" which happens to be the only good song.3) She had become a kiddie star. She is a little over a 1-hit-wonder, but thats it.4) Her positions keep on ending. \\"Goodies\\" #1 on urban charts, than she became a white kiddie star...with her singles basically only big on the white charts.5) Her career is falling quicker than ever.6) No wonder she don't pose for King, FHM, & Stuff...not because she is a h*e...because she has a penis."},{"rating":"1","title":"ciara is not janet jackson","review":"ciara has not had 5 # 1 albums, 10 # 1 hit singles, 7 top 5 singles from 1 album, 5 grammys over the course of 22 years now has she?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Much Hype, So Little Everything Else","review":"I would not be surprised if I saw this CD in the 99 cent bin at Sam Goody or F.Y.E. because I didn't hear any other goodies besides \\"Goodies\\" even though that's about to run its course. The debut did nothing to accomplish an identity for Ciara and she really can't sing. I heard the whole album and after the last track, I said to myself \\"Who is she?\\". LaFace needs to be slapped hard and so does Jazze Pha and Ciara needs to go back to singing in subway stations or infront of that mirror. The top 3 are already taken and she's not even 4, 5, 6, or 10! for that matter. Record companies need to get a group of consumers, fans and record label execs in a room to listen to the whole CD before they release any music; they'd probably save more money that way versus trying to sue people who get it off the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good...can't sing : (","review":"It's like this...if Ciara were on American Idol..Simon,Paula and Randy would line up to leave bootprints on Ciara's lovely backside.Sure ,she looks good..and YES...I'd hit it..but I hope she doesn't want to sing to me during our encounter.I'd have to visit the Viagra.Pretty..but talentless.Long fingernails running down a chalkboard.

I dont care if she's making Hip-Hop, R&B, Crunk N' B, whatever you should beable to sing. This girl cannot sing a note. She is horrible. Ciara is overrated weather you agree or not. She had to have some kind of connection because there is no way she got by on talent. What about people like me who can actually sing that are doing any and everything for a record deal. The music industry is so messed up. When I see big artists who cant sing it makes me sick to my stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Ciara.","review":"First, I'd like to point out that I'm not a kid; my browser won't take me to the register page for some reason. Anyways, I don't think Ciara is that great of a singer. She has a limited range..nothing powerful at all. Everytime I hear that \\"you think you're slick\\" part from Goodies, I just cringe. I heard most of the songs on this album. Lyrically, they're not good, just mediocre at best. Especially in Hotline..\\"you're the cutest thing.\\" Sounds like something you'd say to a puppy. And I agree with MissCuteness (a couple of reviews below me), Aaliyah was the first to do this crunk n b.

She sticks to the same range of notes that don't showcase her voice because she doesn't have one. Why exactly do you think she lip sung at the BET awards?(that were terrible may I add) Have you noticed..all of her singles featured other artist: Goodies (Petey Pablo), 1,2 step (Missy), Oh!

There are a couple of Ballads on here that in my opinion just dont suite her too well. All the good songs on this album are up-tempo, dance tracks. Which I think she is very good at! She also seems like a very nice person and not some tricked out gangsta wannabe with no talent.Suggested Tracks:~Goodies~1, 2 Step~Hotline~Oh"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just be yourself/Throw the wig away","review":"I think the album is bad, but I think she has the talent to take her long way in the future.I think she will look much better if she start showing her natural hair and looks.

Ciara isn't a good singer- and she knows it- and that's why she does this whispering thing, like she's singing under her breath or something. If she wants to stick around for awhile, she needs to try to be innovative by coming up with tunes folks can dance to and creating some new dance moves. The girl knows how to dance, that's for sure, and I know a lot of you are only hating on her because she's in good shape. Don't be like that, you know?

Her catchiest song, in my opinion, is Oh with Ludacris, but her hits 1,2 Step and Goodies are obviously good. The song otline is, I'm hoping, her next single after Oh.

The music here is very medicore as someone mentioned. The best songs are definitely the singles relesed besides Goodies because I never cared about that song but the video is great. Ciara is not a singer as mentioned for the 100th time already. She lacks emotion, range, power, etc. She's basically a dancer which is really her only high point. Everything from her vocals to the writing to the music is mostly average. Anyone who can dance can easily come and fill her shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Good\\"ies ain't that Good.","review":"The higlight of the album has to be the slick production on several tracks, that save the record from fizzling completely. ok yeah so it spawned 3 massive hits: \\"Goodies\\" with Petey Pablo (#1 Billboard Hot 100), my favorite - \\"1,2 Step\\" with Missy Elliott (#2) and my second favorite - the highly sexy \\"oh\\" with Ludacris (#2)! But thats about it. Everything else on the album plain sucks. Ciara is a highly limited artist who can barely sing..... they should've included her current hits \\"Lose Control\\" with Missy & Fatman Scoop , and \\"Like You\\" with Bow Wow on a special edition of this CD.

It's just that she needs to find a more original image because she clearly looks, acts, dances, and sings like an Aaliyah/Beyonce' clone. This CD is just \\"good\\" to listen to on the radio, but I would never buy this album for my collection. Fortunately, I borrowed it from a friend before I wasted my money. 2 stars is really being 2 kind, but I gave her 2 because that was one hell of an effort to pull off the most believeable Aaliyah impersonation.

Now those are some good bands, not those terrible hip-hop artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"THIS ALBUM IS CRAP. DONT BUY IT.

EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS SHOULD GET THEIR MONEY BACK."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Oh\\" is possibly the worst hit song ever!!!","review":"\\"Oh\\" is such a terrible song I cannot even tell you. How it made it to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on TRL is beyond me. The song is basically \\"Goodies\\" with the beat slowed down so much that you can't even dance or do anything to do it. The beat is just slow, dreary, and awful, and Ciara's singing leaves much to be desired. This song was only popular because people liked \\"Goodies\\" and \\"1,2 Step\\" and so radio stations automatically played \\"Oh\\" but once they realized it was a vile piece of feces and people stopped requesting it, it soon dropped off the airwaves. The fact that Ciara's record label unleashed this plague of a song as a radio single is enough to rate the entire album 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Do Want The 'Goodies'","review":"This album is just bangin' crazy. Her vocal ability is amazing.

I give credit where it is due. Ciara is pretty and young, she can really dance. The song \\"Goodies\\" saves her life along with the dancing in her video. Not really strong vocal skills. I expect more from someone who has to be in the biz and compete with the likes of Beyonce'. Babygirl might just get knocked down to being nothing more than someones \\"Crunk&B\\" Princess. Like a step above Ashanti with her non-singing self. I gave away my Ciara CD to a girlfriend of mine. She'll bump it in her trunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above average...","review":"I just bought this album for several days but I've already found out several standout tracks like:~ 1,2 Step~ Hotline~ Goodies~ Oh~ Lookin At You~ The Title1,2 Step is the best song on this CD and this must be a huge hit soon. I still haven't digged deep into the slower ones. So maybe there are some missing great songs from the list. Anyway, this is a cool, sexy and easy-listening R&B; album. If you like Beyonce, you should like Ciara. Their style, songs and even their outlook are similar."},{"rating":"1","title":"As impressive as cheese!","review":"D@mn, put a little makeup on him and keep him outta the fat suit and Martin Lawrence makes a fine looking woman!

I even saw one lady say she is the greatest black female singer around today. I'm not going to cuss but that full of s@$#. I listen to \\"And I\\" all the way through and that female did have no soul,no power,no nothing in her voice.So the question is? Are u a radio person or are u an album person.Radio people like everything that comes on the radio. If that's the case, by all means, buy this album!! But album people likes the whole album - well at least 65%. if this is u, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM! She can dance out of this world but you can hear dance moves. Not even beats by lil' jon can save her. She and Omarion - keep making dancing videos and looking good because it is the only reason u are in the business in the first place.Keep doing what u're doing! And if all fails AND STILL THINKS SHE CAN SING, listen to Alicia Keys (any song) then listen to \\"And I\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Almost Perfect Album","review":"Ciara's debut album \\"Goodies\\" is an almost perfect album. It starts off with the radio-friendly title track \\"Goodies\\" and goes straight to another high energy club track \\"1, 2 Step\\". With the exception of \\"Hotline\\", \\"Oh\\", and \\"Lookin' At You\\" the rest of the album is mid-tempo but in no way boring. 2 of the best tracks are \\"Ooh Baby\\" and \\"The Title\\" which both flaunt an old-school sound. (\\"The Title\\" even has some nice horns in the background) The \\"Goodies\\" remix isn't as bangin' as it could have been but since the original track is so hot fans will enjoy it anyway. Ciara's voice isn't amazing but she can definitely hold her own. Lyrically the album seems geared towards a younger crowd but there's no problem with that. Plus, Ciara wrote all but 2 songs on the CD and she is only 18 so it makes sense that her music reflects herself. With such a great debut album you can only anticipate what her future music will sound like 'cause I'm sure Ciara will be around for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"Nowadays, music seems to be taking a turn for the worst. If you compare this album to others of its sort, it's the same damn thing. There's no substance (unless you count drugs) in R&B (if you can call it that anymore) at all, except for sexuality. That's it. The only reason this album isn't 1 star is the beats, which aren't even that good compared to other beats by the producers. So, if you don't have any other \\"R&B\\" albums and buy this one, don't plan on getting it for lyrics. Also, don't buy any others expecting any substance, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt bring the good (ies)!!","review":"Im sorry, but why do people think that just because a person writes their own songs, that makes a person talented..Anybody can write a song, but if your lyrics have meaning, then you might be working with something..Im listening to the samples of this cd and I wouldnt even want a burned version of it..She has an okay voice and from seeing the video, she is a good dancer, but thats really about it..I dont know how people are getting signed these days but its a shame b/c they are throwing contracts at anybody...Good if you want to get signed, but bad for the listeners..Case in point, her single , which grew on me, was hot, but this album is far from that..She needs a lot more work!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When is this \\"breather\\" going to take a breather?","review":"A girl whose singing is little more than breathing and humming at the same time, the mega-successful career of Ciara is another one of these unfortunate examples of why contemporary R&B has been all but flushed down the toilet. The \\"crunk\\" background of the title song is actually hypnotic, but only in a mind-numbing kind of way."},{"rating":"2","title":"B+ worth checking out","review":"1.

While all of these were great club songs they really didn't have substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodies-----By: SBCS","review":"I Think Ciara is a very talented person, the funny thing is... she practically came out of nowhere and is coming out on top! I don't have this CD but I would love to get it, My favorite songs are Goodies(of course) and 1,2 step!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Album Filler.","review":"I was not impressed with Ciara's debut. The only strong songs on the album were the ones she released as singles: \\"Goodies,\\" \\"1,2 Step,\\" and \\"Oh.\\" The rest of the album is bland and sounds like something Aaliyah, Brandy, and Monica wouldn't have even given the time of day to record. It baffles me how some would even compare her to Aaliyah or the legendary, Janet Jackson. She doesn't posses half the creativity and originality the other two had and she CANNOT sing. There is a descent tone to her voice but she has absoulutely no passion or vocal technique to back it up. Atleast Janet and Aaliyah could belt out a tune. The ballad, \\"And I,\\" was her time to prove she could sing more than one note in a song and she couldn't even do that.My advice: Save yourself the money and just download her three singles from Itunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Debut","review":"Although Ciara's voice isn't the strongest of today's singers it has potential and room for growth. See reminds me of how Aaliyah came out and with each album we saw her voice grow, her image become more refined, and she became more comfortable with her stage presence.Although Ciara is 18 she co-wrote majority of the songs on the album. I find myself rocking the cd from the first track to the last track. Overall the album has great production, great lyrics, and catchy hooks. The only thing I would've preferred for the album are more ballads. I still rock this album nonstop and actually prefer it over Destiny's Child \\"Destiny Fulfilled\\" I can't wait to see what Ciara will bring to the table next time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Lady of Crunk & B!!","review":"This is a great start for the new singer Ciara, her vocals are great, even though they weren't shown that much on her 1st single \\"Goodies\\". \\"Goodies\\" was a hot song, I just thought for sure she couldn't sing, until I heard a ballad that is featured on the called \\"And I\\" her vocals are strong and he vocal arrange is very good, it kind of reminds me of a Brandy track, it's real smooth. \\"1, 2 Step\\" is definetly a hit, it's going to be #1 on the charts in no time, this soug is going to be bumpin in every club all around the world. Another track that should definitely be a single is \\"Oh\\" featuring Ludacris, this is another club banger.

Ciara we all know can not sing, I mean she's on the same note the whole entire album & yes I heard the whole ablum which next brings me to the lyrics. I'm not even going to clown on the lyrics but I will say that they are some of the worse I've heard. While Ciara is a great dancer and she's known for her Crunk N B sound that's all basically she has going for her. She springs her ankle, Lil Jon fades away you have no Ciara point blank period.

No. Is it worth your $9.99? Well, maybe $6. Goodies is a mediocre debut with a few upbeat joints, an ode to old school (The Title), and two nicely performed ballads (And I and Next to You). Ms. Ciara starts her journey with Goodies. Goodies is a hot joint. This is why it was #1 on Billboard's Hot 100 for, if I'm correct 6 weeks straight. 1,2 Step is mediocre, yet you are still capable of getting your groove on. Oh, in my opinion, is pure ATL fire. True definition of Crunk & B. And I is a nice love ballad, however, it does fade towards the end. I recommend this cd to the 24 and younger crowd, or people who just like to dance, etc. Burned or bought, this should definitely be added to your cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Customer","review":"This was installed on my 2005 Mazda3 S, Manual Trans. I'm only giving this a 4 star instead of a 5 star because the original version that I purchased, had a weld fail where it mounts to the frame. That was a design flaw since the engine always moves a little on it's mounts when you drive, but the pipe was bolted to the frame which does not. Overtime this weakened the weld and it finally gave and left a gaping hole in the pipe. The new design has the pipe mounted to the engine so it moves with the engine. So far so good. I haven't noticed any leaks or cracks. It does make your car intake sound louder, and makes an audible \\"Whooshing\\" sound when you are accelerating. In terms of improvement in power no one will ever be able to tell the difference. I have it because I like K&N air filters and how easy it is to clean and re-oil.

That wasn't very clear at first, but after a bit of research, I determined they were the same brand and interchangeable.These work great, as did the original ones I bought from Target. I've never had one fail to hold a seal. I make sure that after each use, I rinse them in warm water so the ridges that seal stay soft.

It was originally published about a hundred years ago, and it's like most of the other classical works of the period: clear, straightforward, and wonderfully free of modern tendencies like political correctness, multiculturalism, etc. Of course, this also means that it's short on explanations, so it's probably best used with an instructor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best physio book","review":"I used this book in undergrad and, although the pictorial illustrations in the book were useful, overall I found this book to be more confusing than need be.

May people mention that you hear thing you haven't in the past with other headphones, and they are absolutely right, it is quite amazing.

The material started to look dirty within a few months also and needed constant wiping with a wipe. The top (where all the princesses are) wouldn't always stay straight, mainly would lean forward. And to top that off, the mattress popped about 1 month ago.

It kept leaning in. The construction is very poor also. The sides are attached oddly and not made to last (hard to explain, but it is not one sold piece, each section is seperate). Ours also had a slow leak and would partially deflate by morning causing the castle (which was already leaning) to collapes.I called, e-mailed and wrote the company to get a replacement (I couldn't return it) and they would NEVER respond. You have to leave a voicemail message with the company and I couldn't get a live person. After 3 months I gave up and the junk is sitting in the closet.

Cub played at a free concert and hung out with everybody afterwards. He was one of the greats. But this cd is all over the place and very eccentric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, you haven't heard of Cub Koda?","review":"...There's probably a good reason. Koda is semi-famous for \\"Smokin' in the Boys Room\\" and a fixture in obscure guitar/\\"roots-rock\\" circles. I don't know all of his oeuvre, but this is mostly a county-fair hashing of doo-wop era rock with some notable guitar licks. I got it for \\"Random Drug Testing,\\" an amusing field holler I heard on college radio which, consciously or not, parallels the drug war with slavery. It's also the most original, transcendent piece of the lot. Koda is noted as his own producer, using low-tech equipment, and it sorta sounds it. I fast-forwarded through on first listen. Maybe it will grow on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me a moment.","review":"The cover of the Misfits' tune is astonishing! I discovered this band through reviews for 'Captain Dead..' on this site. Jack Pot! If you have a big heart, it should feel this band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP THIS CD!! Guitar playing sounds terrible!","review":"This CD is very amateurish. CD sounds like a bad 80's band. The lyrics are childish and the guitar playing sounds like someone learning how to play. I am pretty sure that this band lost their recording contract after they released this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEESEY","review":"Seems like every song on this CD is trapped in the past, and almost every song sounds like a Prince reject. Dag's attempt at altering their musical pallet is laughable - the rocky and funky beats are as out of place as a goth kid in Disney Land.Nothing on this cheese packed excuse for a CD can redeem Dag. The only thing it brings into light is their total lack of any vocal and guitar talent, and not to mention song writing ability. If this CD got any cheesier, you'd find in between the Havarti and Chedder in your local Deli. SMELLY."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD SUCKS!!! Guitar licks FLAT, vocals OFF","review":"...very disappointed in the quality of the music. The guitar playing is feeble and the vocals were grating. The overall CD comes off as one of those sleazy hotel lounge acts...Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad - Sad - Sad","review":"I was very disappointed in this album. It's very 80s with drum machines, bad guitar and synthesizers. The sound quality is poor. Definately not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one essential album in my collection","review":"Dag's Apartment #635 got to me in one of those \\"Tower Music listening station ate my head\\" moments where my friends couldn't tear me away from \\"Girl Had it Good\\" to get in line to buy the concert tickets we'd gotten up early for. Ouch. I listen to it all the time now -- and have for a year. This is what funk should be -- not JUST the over-fermented psychotropic jive of people like George Clinton, but this honest simple beat-heavy whispered-background-vocals passionate sound that transcends race and goes straight for the spinal cord. Dag got it good."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAS NO FUNK NOR SOUL","review":"This record just has no soul. It's a series of tracks with no cohesion (other than they fade into each other), and there's no theme to the album except bad-mouthing women.It is not well-made techno, and it has no feeling within the songs. It leaves me feeling cold and wondering what the point of the cd was. With so much good funk and electronic music out there, one would think that DAG would have picked up on what makes the funk so good.DAG is defunk now , and never had much of success, largely because their music [isn't good] and their cheesey slick image."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, which makes it good","review":"I saw this band live once, and they are very good. Although, I'm not sure they still exist, this is album that I thoroughly appreciated because it was something new and different."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like the Funk and a good vibe, you NEED this CD","review":"\\"You Make me Feel\\" (Track #3 on this CD) is playing as I type this review, and I feel bad for anyone who hasn't heard this album. Huge rays of sunshine are blasting through my speakers, and I can hear Prince and Stevie Wonder and Sly & The Family Stone calling out, begging all the world to enjoy the hot funk and jazz vibe of this unrecognized masterpiece.Please, buy this album and share it with someone you love. You'll never forget the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dag comes up with a winner.","review":"Following 1994's effort,\\"Righteous\\", the blue-eyed funk'n'rollers from the Tarhills has sweetened the kitty with a solid sophomore album. It rolls non-stop with a ol' skool flavor like a mix between the Average White Band and Carmichael-produced Commodores. It is funky, so funky that I daresay some of the young hip-hoppers and rapsters ought to take note. Get it before your neighbor does."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK","review":"I can't believe this CD is still in the marketplace. This CD is beyond awful. There should be a law that outlaws terrible music by white boys trying to sound like true FUNK and R&B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This, like Joan Grant's other books, is a fascinating study of the culture she writes of.

I teach a postgraduate course on the subject of Development of communication skills for scientists. I have read a dozen of books on the subject of oral communication in science and this short book is clearly the best written about this subject (at least for those readers whose first language is not English). I strongly recommend the lecture of this book. Practicing the exercises proposed in this book my students and I have greatly enhanced our oral presentation skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrendous book by my former professor....","review":"Upon reading and studying this guide, I wholly expected that it would provide me with knowledge and confidence in presentations.

I cant believe I spent 7 bucks to see it in the theater and I'm upset because I'll never get those two wasted hours of my life back. As soon as I walked out of the theater I forgot the whole movie because there was nothing memorable that happened. No good one liners, nothing. Just a bad plot, bad acting, bad everything. Dont waste your money and especially not your time on this wothless movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad stuff","review":"This movie is bad. I wanted to see an action movie, but instead I get this. This is the worst stallone movie i've seen. What in the world were they thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAR GOD this was bad.","review":"When Sly Stallone is the best actor in a movie, watch out! This movie was so bad, I wasn't sure it wasn't a comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Suspence","review":"The problem with this movie is you can't play Rambo and then try to make a serious movie. There is an attempt at a story but nobody stands a chance against Stallone and that the problem. Every ten minutes or so he just beats up or intimidates another villan. I think Stallone is a good actor but I wish he would stop playing Mr. Invinceable. It would have been a better movie If the villan's were someone you should be afraid of. If this was a action movie you tend to accept one villan getting it every ten minutes. But when you try to make a film with a plot the villans should have more character. It would be nice to see Stallone in a film where he build the suspense. Where you have some doubt on wheter he could pull It off. A movie like The Fugitive; I think would be an interesting character for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carter will help you catch your Z's","review":"I was sooooo bored with this movie. I could not wait for it to be over. This movie had very good intentions of being a good movie but just did not throw everything together the way it should have been. I thought that the plot was good, the movie was kind of hip, but just did'nt do it for me. More action, more action, more action. I mean come on, This is Stallone. Where is the action?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the original ,along with Rocky","review":"I'm glad this movie failed to generate any kind of following,because it shouldn't have been made. Why not take a bad movie in remake it ,instead of trying to cash in on the vision of someone elses for profit. The main problem with this joke of a movie is: You can't turn Jack Carter into a caring good-guy. Carter was a ruthless, menacing,selfish killer, not the likeable character Stallone presented. This was a shameful star vehicle that should of fell flat on its rear end. Shame on Caine for showing up in this joke of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad stuff","review":"this movie is the worst. nothing happened. when i saw this in the theater, i walked out during the middle. i should have saved my money for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZzZz ...*cough* .. oh is it over ?","review":"I didnt expect much from this movie after reading the reviews so i was'nt too upset. The plot was flimsy the action was watered down and the camera work was overly stylised. This was one film that should have been more violent, when i say that i dont mean more \\"action\\" i mean more gritty realistic violence. The poorly staged punchups and car chases detracted from the already lacking atmosphere. This was a typical hollywood crime thriller (rather unthrilling at the end of the day). My advice ? Hire it, its watchable, but dont waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"Ok, this was probably the worst movie ever made. Stallone is an idiot who can't act to save his own miserable life. I saw this DVD 5 months ago and i still havent goten over the lack of plot, terrible acting and the nasty veins on stallone's sholders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Carter","review":"Now usually i don't like remakes but i like this one. I watched the original and the remake back to back and i gotta say that the first one was kinda lame, i couldn't get into it, it was slow, confusing and Michael slept with every woman he looked at. When i looked at the second one then i understood what all the fuss was about and it had more action. I highly recommend :)Oh yeah its kinda ironic how the star of the first movie dies at the end while he costars in the remake and gets killed again...wow"},{"rating":"2","title":"STALLONE IS THIS ONE OF THE BEST","review":"NO OTHER ACTION STAR CAN BE IN THIS KIND OF ROLE AND PULL IT OFF LIKE STALLONE. VAN DAME AND TOM CRUISE ARE TOO SHORT, BRUCE WILLIS NOT BUFF ENOUGH AND ARNOLD CAN'T CAN'T EVEN TALK, OR REALLY MOVE. HE CAME BEFORE ALL THESE GUYS AND AFTER ALL THESE YEARS HE IS THIS BETTER THAN THESE GUYS. THE MOVIE STARTS OF SLOW DOESN'T HAVE THAT MANY ACTION SCENES BUT, OVERALL IT'S CAMERA USE, TWO CAR CHASES, AND STALLONES STYLE MAKE IT A FILM TO WATCH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie!","review":"All i have to say is Stallone is one of the most underrated Actors in the Industry for whatever reason and hes proven time and time again that he is an Amazing Actor with Get Carter being no exception.The Movie is gritty Stallone fits the part perfect,Mickey Rourke is a slimy villian as he and Sly are my 2 fav actors this was a perfect pairing.Rachel Leigh Cook is really good as well.Good story,some gritty violence and a an all around Excellent movie.Get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"First Sly movie that I ever questioned his ability as an actor. Really, the movie was that bad.The big problem was thst it didn't meet either of my action movie preferences,the loud 80s action film of big punches or the fast and slick Bourne Identity action-suspense film.Just blah and slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stallone the tough guy","review":"Not all bad guys are all bad, Stallone proves this in a Blood is thicker than water film."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought the Specialist was Sly's worst..","review":"Get Carter is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.The Revenge plot is terrible...I could not get interested in it even to make fun of it. Yes, it is this bad. And what is with the closeup camera angles while Stallone is driving? MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL. About halfway threw the movie I couldn't even watch it anymore, but I ended up sitting near the TV until the end, just looking at it and laughing at Stallone with a Gotee.Not even worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"This is worse than my eighth birthday party. Some kid brought his pet Teradactyl and let go of the leed. Also, the hired band 'The Caz Dolowicz Experience' didn't show up. Something about a hijacked subway train. They think we're mugs? Anyway, the photography in GC was worse. Everbody too big in the frame and sort of artless and wobbly. How does Rachel Leigh Cook manage to appear in so many disasters? Does she have a homing beacon in her nose? It's a very small nose which just goes to show how amazing technology is today. Stallone looks like he's on Dialysis. I didn't watch the end. It either ends in a friendly game of Jim Rummy or a blowtorch enema. Gosh, I wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done stylish tribute to original","review":"Get Carter with Sly Stallone as Jack Carter succeeds in its purpose to pay tribute to the 1971 Michael Caine classic, and doesn't come off as a rip-off at all. The setting of this one is rainy Seattle and Sly, dressed like \\"Frank Sinatra\\" does a great job with this updated script, which keeps the original plot intact, keeping it a stylish action film with heart and mind. Michael Caine even has a role as one of the many bad guys Sly takes on.The ending is a significant departure from the original, this time being how we WANT it to end. It could be that with \\"Copland\\" and this Sly has found his midlife muse, really the same as he always was: the brooding tough guy with heart and soul.Of course the original is better...what original isn't? But this is the best remake anyone could hope for."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not \\"Payback\\"","review":"\\"Payback\\" was this straightforward story of a ruthless man with one fixed idea: getting the money which was due to him. It was dark and violent and the movie worked because the Mel Gibson's character was not calling out for our sympathy. \\"Get Carter\\", also a remake, is following a similar linear story line and gritty atmosphere but is failing in that the movie producers decided to make the Sylvester Stallone's character likable (being Stallone, I guess). And this is where it slips for the worst. Why did they have to put so much (twisted) morality in this guy? The scene I really hated is when Carter throws the bartender who abused his niece by the window after he tells him \\"what would you think if it was your daughter\\" and \\"you already killed yourself (by abusing his niece and other women)\\". But is it the Carter who in the same movie sleeps with his boss's wife and who beats bad payers to a pulp? Where is the morality here? This just does not make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"To sum it all up, this movie sucks! It was one of the worst films I had ever seen. This was by far Stallone's poorest performance. If I could give a rating lower than one star I would. I recommend you save your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A film where the plot was secondary to the action","review":"\\"Get Carter\\" is a remake of the Micheal Caine \\"Get Carter\\". I think the biggest problem with \\"Get Carter\\" is that it focused on more of the action then the plot.\\"Get Carter\\" is about Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone) returning home to pay his respects to his brother who died. While home, Jack discovers that his brother may not have died due to drunk driving. This triggers a full investigation. (Stallone style)\\"Get Carter\\" has a good plot, but I think because Stallone was the star of the film, there was a need to focus on action and by doing this, the plot was secondary.If you are the kind of person who enjoys a movie that focuses on the action while the plot fades away, you will enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and hard to find","review":"The suspicious side of me wants to believe that HP did a promo with their Deskjet 612C - i.e. they sold the printer cheap or with big rebates as part of a system deal and decided to make up for their loss leader by limiting production and raising the price on the cartridge replacements.
