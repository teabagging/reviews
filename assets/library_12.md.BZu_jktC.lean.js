Once in a while I need to sleep on a heating pad because of back pain. With other heating pads, the heat shuts off after a couple of hours and they need to be restarted; some of them won't turn back on right away. This one never shuts off - in one respect it worries me that I might forget to turn it off before I go to work. That's the thing I love about it, though, so it's a trade-off. I keep it set on low and it never gets too hot, and the cover is nice and soft. BTW, it's not advisable to let a child use a heating pad of any sort, unattended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistant heat and a strange smell","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I found that this heating pad only stays hot for about 3 minutes before the heat automatically turns itself down. The only thing I could do was turn it off and then on again, but I never felt like it got as hot as the first time.Also, it has a really strong plastic-y smell that rubs off on whatever you've been using the pad on - in my case, my wrist/arm.

Maybe these are new offerings, not the older models which actually worked well. Whatever the case, I bought one offline and one in a store--both failed miserably...did not maintain a high heat--think they both had a HIGH heat twice, and that's it. Failed to maintain the heat and most of the time, LOW heat was all you got, even though the heating pad setting was on HIGH.Save you time and energy and just go for a higher priced heating pad like Battle Creek, Thermophore or something else.

It heats up fairly quickly and has a very easy to use controller (low-medium-high) that is workable even if you have poor hand strength. The pad is stiff when cold, but becomes far more malleable when hot so you can easily wrap it around a knee, elbow, etc. Measures about 12 inches by 15 inches.It is not, however, the model listed on the product page. The product page lists model 731-500, which offers moist heat. I received model 756-5, which does not have moist heat.The only difference is that the moist heat model has a pad that you can dampen with water and insert inside the cover. I don't care for moist heat, so I didn't bother returning the pad to Amazon. If, however, moist heat is something you want, you may want to order a different model or get this from someplace other than Amazon.

We've only had it 2 days and have already played it numerous times. Terry Cashman may not be the greatest singer in the world, but he sings with great feeling, enthusiasm and joy. It's very obvious that this is a man who is singing about something he loves and cares about deeply. We found OPENING DAY, GOOD ENOUGH TO DREAM, RAIN DELAY, BALLAD OF HERB SCORE, SONG OF OCTOBER & GIVE US BACK OUR GAME especially poignant. Cashman does a great job on CENTERFIELD & THERE USED TO BE A BALLPARK, songs made famous by others. And THE HONDO HURRICANE & THIRD BASE COACH will make you chuckle.

Other reviewers have been mentioning that this book is creatively written and informative, and I'm not going to deny that.

Despite the fact that the Irish were also oppressed and led the Labor Movement, they only show up as agents of repression; cops, vicious firemen and the like. Its funny Doctorow tried to capture life at the turn of the century and inherenct racism in this country while espousing hiw own bigotry and ignoring the plight and triumph of Irish, catholics and other ethnic groups besides WASPS, Jews and Blacks.

Doctorow's \\"Ragtime\\" is a breezy fast-paced romp weaving together both historical and fictional characters from the very beginning of the 20th century in America. In fact, Doctorow's novel purposely has the same pacing and sectioning as a piece of ragtime music. This is a sprawling work, which is at the same time respectful and critical--respectful of the period and its culture yet critical of the great divide between rich and poor and the disregard for minorities and immigrants. This book is completely engrossing and, through Doctorow's style of treating historical characters as fictional characters, both entertaining and educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you want a better version of this book, try Kevin Baker's Dreamland.

Who cares, it's great!","review":"Give this one a few chapters to hook you, as Doctorow's style here won't suit everyone's tastes. There is very little dialogue, and often he employs repetitive staccato sentences in brief summary descriptions, like: \\"He came in. He sat down. He counted his change. He put it in his pocket and left.\\" Now, the way he does it actually fits each scene perfectly, but occasionally you'll notice it.That small criticism aside, however, RAGTIME is teeming with historical figures and random tidbits while telling a rollicking story. Along the way you'll meet Houdini, Henry Ford, J. P. Morgan, George Washington Carver, Emma Goldman, Evelyn Nesbitt and many more. You'll get lost in another time and never want to come back.And while you're reading, ask yourself two simple questions: First, who is telling this story? And second, how do they know all these things? You'll be glad you paid attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating; brilliantly written\`","review":"When I first read this book, it was assigned for a college course I was taking.

I must admit, but to call it the \\"Great American\\" novel or even to include it on the list of the century's top 100 books gives it far too much credit than it deserves. I felt as if some one told me a story about people I've never met. The characters were very two-dimensional. His description of media sex symbols was way out of context. Why bring up Maryln Monroe? This is a book about a time long before she was born, written in a period before she was born, supposedly. One review mentions that he/she read the book when they were in the sixth grade. That is about where I would place this on a reading list. It is okay for some one in junior high, but I think that perhaps some one looking for a story with substance best look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Fiction or Laborious Diction?","review":"This book was just not very interesting. A snapshot of American life at the turn of the century, the book starts out promising enough (for 40 or so pages I thought that the narrator was the son, or that there was a twist somewhat like that) but disintegrates into a ridiculous tapestry of nonsense. Two stars, one for Coalhouse Walker, the other for the description of the Morgan Library on Madison and 36th (not too many people know about this place).This is considered literature? It seems as if the book was based on the musical, instead of the other way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU ARE THERE","review":"This book takes you inside the hearts and minds of the people who made the world we live in. There are no boring sections. This is a big story full of informative detail that keep you reading on and on to see what's going to happen next.The author was either there in several past-lives, or in this life, carefully researched the era and the shakers and innovators at the beginning of the 20th century. I highly recommend this book for it's educational and entertainment content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, yes. Great, yes.","review":"To dismiss this book as \\"simple\\" is a mistake, because it is the simplicity of the work that makes it so impressive. Doctorow employs the same literary sleight of hand that Hemingway was so skilled at; the unique ability to write a grand, sweeping novel of epic proportions, using simple, easy to understand prose. This is one of those novels that captures the feel of the era in which it was written so well, that it seems as though we are watching the action from a lower east side tenement window.

This book was way too confusing because there was too much going on at once. One minute its talking about one person and all of a sudden its talking about someone else. Also, I couldn't tell where the dialouge was. The dialouge was not as its own paragraph or even in quotation marks. It was as part of the regular paragraphs as a regular sentence.

It seemed to me as if they were there one minute and gone the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautifully-Written Story of the Early 1900's","review":"Ragtime has been made into a motion picture and a Broadway show, but the book surpasses both.

Morgan, Henry Ford, and other notables stalk through the pages, and we are on the sidelines watching the grand scandal of the time, when a millionaire murders a famous architect over ex-chorus girl, Evelyn Nesbitt. The writing is so rich that you can almost hear Scott Joplin's music. It's an exceptional story and a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"See the Musical","review":"There's something satisfying in reading, at the end of the century, a book about its beginning. Doctorow evokes a splendid sense of our world almost 100 years ago and it's a delight to put in perspective celebrities that seem part of our collective memory. The book is a fast, seamless read and I'm a fool for social causes - hence, four stars.However, I found the tone of the book almost childish and the continuous set of \\"contrived\\" encounters too contrived. My recommendation: buy the movie at Amazon.com or, better yet, see the musical!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scattered Look at the early 1900's","review":"Really scattered, connected yet disconnected, overview of life in the early part of the 20th century. Well researched, but did not lead me to care about the characters or what was happening to them.... they don't really grow as people....had to struggle to finish, simply because I was not compelled by the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innocence and Celebrity in Doctorow's Ragtime","review":"Doctorow's great achievement with Ragtime is an authentic feeling of early 20th century America without extended realist passages (ie Grapes of Wrath). Instead, he chooses to appropriate some of the era's iconic figures in an enjoyable, kaliedosopic panorama of a time oft-forgotten in favor of the great wars and depressions of the the past century. The early 1900s saw the beginning of an exponential increase in technological advance while retaining social naivete and ignorance (\\"There were no Negroess...There were no immigrants'). Ragtime leads us through approximately a decade of change, we follow a family as they discover that, yes, there are Negroes and immigrants and the poor. We now stand on a similar precipice looking both backward at the past 100 years and forward to the next 1000 and Doctorow reminds us that just as the ideas and fame of Morgan, Ford, Houdini and the rest still glow, they are but shadows here in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant discussion on the ALH-84001 scientific debate","review":"Apart from offering his great scientific expertise, Andrew Knoll provides a very through view of the evolutionary tracks that life has followed on our planet. However, what in my view what this book deserves praise for is the brief yet highly valuable discussion he provides on the debate of the meteorite ALH-84001. Not taking any of the debates sides he offers the reader an open minded and brilliant exposure of the subject cleaning up the many misconceptions put forth. In addition I truly liked his brief but to the point treatment of the very painful subject of Intelligent Design versus Science. These two chapters of the book are definitely worth reading.-Ihrenes 2006."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science is fun","review":"Life on a Young Planet covers a (very long) period that is pretty much a closed book to most amateur paleontologists. Andrew Knoll does an excellent job of taking us through the aeons while making the story of life as interesting as it is important. While there are facts and figures to satisfy those in the know about early life, Knoll dumbs it down for the rest of us to a point where it can be hard to put the book down. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to expand their knowledge of earth bioscience back beyond the dinosaurs or even the Burgess Shale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cross-section of KC 20s-30s Jazz","review":"Combining cuts from all the key KC players and many obscure groups, this CD is an excellent intro to the KC 20s-30s sound, and the sound quality is great. This is the original music that is celebrated by the awesome soundtrack to Robert Altman's film, \\"Kansas City\\" -- however, this disc stomps and swings more consistently from song-to-song than the soundtrack. Count Basie tears up the piano on a track or two from the mid-30's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous overview of 1930's territory music scene","review":"This CD is by far the best compilation of music from the black territory bands of the southwestern United States during the Depression years.These bands toured on the back roads of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, and Arkansas and played mostly one-night stops at local taverns and dance halls in colored neighborhoods during the 1930's and early 1940's.Many of Kansas City's bands went on to fame and fortune, and Count Basie was probably the most famous of these. Other bandleaders like Ernie Fields found local fame on the Kansas City - Oklahoma City - Dallas circuit, but never made it big nationally.While this CD was conceived by CBS/Sony Entertainment as a companion to Robert Altman's movie \\"Kansas City\\", it can be thoroughly enjoyed by anyone who is looking for a good collection of swing tunes, or who wants to know more about the roots of the Swing Era in the southwestern United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not the 'essential' SLF album","review":"This album advertises itself as the 'essential' SLF album. This is definitely not the case and I speak as one of the band's biggest fans. For one thing it features none of the band's hits (it makes a point of not including any singles). For another only about half the songs here would make any SLF fan's selection of the best album tracks. What is 'Breakout' doing on here? Why have they included songs from the dreadful 'Tinderbox' album? Why so many from 'Now then'? In many cases the album tracks selected are actually the worst on their respective albums (with the exception of the excellent choices from 'Hope Street'). If this is the 'essential' SLF album how come only 4 of these songs ever make it into their live shows? This is not a good introduction to one of the best ever bands. On the plus side it includes good liner notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners and seasoned amateurs","review":"This book is the book you want to read for the best handling of all topics relating to photography.

The first half is more of a history book, detailing earlier, now obselete video modes, which makes it interesting but at the same time feels like a few hundred pages of filler. HOWEVER, any gripes or ill-feelings are instanty made up for and then some when you get to the 3d stuff.

This does not however change the value of the book, the author was addressing the needs of the computer industry for high performance graphics code in the 80's and 90's, but the principles and thought processes passed on in the book are just as valid today as they were then, perhaps more so since computers have become heavily layered in software abstractions that suck performance at every turn.The book is still very relevant to the Embedded community, embedded processors are becoming increasingly capable and are similar in many ways to the early PC's, with simple graphics controllers and other components, and the skills to make high performance use of these can be re-learned from this book.Its a great buy and looks pretty imposing on a bookshelf too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"I would prefer a more traditional text book that introduces the material in a logical and organized manner. Once the material is presented and explained, then worry about the questions and answers.This book dives right into the questions and gives brief background information but it's so disjointed that it's hard to synthesize. And sometimes his explanations are slightly demeaning (see his explanation for question G5C15 on page 132)There is a temptation with this book to memorize and regurgitate on test day.I don't think my 'dream book' exists so plow through this one and you'll pass the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much better than reading the question pool","review":"This book is just a collection of the Element 3 questions. reorganized.

The book being used was the Technician version of this one. The material seemed rather easy so I decided to order this book on my own and independently prepare for two license exams on the same day rather than one. It is an excellent way to prepare for the exams. I easily passed both. The shortcoming is that the author doesn't explain the reasoning behind all of the answers. I brought this up with the Extra class hams that administered the exams. They said they don't understand it all either! When you actually begin to practice the hobby, these explanations will come with interactions with other hams. In the meantime, you must pass the exam to get that \\"hands on\\" chance. This book lists all possible multiple choice questions. Go through the book a few times and then go to QRZ.com to take the sample tests over and over again until you are ready. This method works."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Where's the beef?","review":"Perhaps it is just my learning style but this book left me with more questions than answers. The first 34 pages consists of material, while related to the Amateur world, has little to do with the General test. The rest of the book consists of the questions and answers to the General test with little vague explanations all of which is easily obtainable for free elsewhere. While it is technically not cheating to memorize the questions and answers to a known test, I felt I was cheating myself of the basic knowledge a good ham should have in his arsenal. After a week with this book I put it down and felt forced to buy a second book with a little more substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book--But Can't Stand Alone","review":"Good book for studying for General license, but you need to read the ARRL General License book first. This book is for quickly mastering the answers to the test questions, not mastering the material needed to really understand the questions. Then, going over one of the \\"correct answer only\\" study guides on the web, you'll have no trouble cramming the answers into your head.I like the book more for the tidbits of radio operating practice and theory, material that really should be presented better in the ARRL book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best general class exam book on the market......","review":"Gordon West's books are just the bomb, they make studying for your General Class exam a lot more bearable.

Everytime I am disapointed; so when Mutiny!, Set Your Goals' first full length album, came out I knew they had big shoes to fill with all the positive buzz around them, and truthfully, I had little faith in them. I was wrong. Very wrong.The new album totally exceeded my expectations. Mutiny, the first single of the album of the same name, doesnt do the album justice. All the songs keep that happy hardcore, pop-punk spirit started from their first venture, Reset.This is album is a MUST, for fans of Blink 182, New Found Glory, Lifetime, and CIV. Or anyone who loved Set Your Goals' first EP."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and positive","review":"this is definitely one of the better releases to come out this year. not only is it fun to listen to but the lyrics are positive and the band actually stands for something. there is a fairly poppy sound to this but i would put set your goals more with the likes of lifetime than i would a band like fall out boy. its lasting power remains to be seen, but at the very least it certainly is a very nice breath of fresh air in an independent music scene currently full of negativity and kids more concerned with their swoop haircut than the music. a worthy purchase if you enjoy the amalgamation of pop sensibilities and catchy hardcore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its tearing up my heart...","review":"People are hailing this like a great punk album. Okay, if you don't think this sounds along the lines of Blink-182, Fall Out Boy, Taking Back Sunday, and everything else in the uber-pop realm, you are suffering from severe denial. The only difference is these guys have breakdowns. However, If you like that style, then cool, they do it better that the other mentioned bands.Keep in mind that this MTV friendly Post-Punk pop is what killed Skate Punk, and some of us are not forgiving. Part of the punk rock scene was not giving way to accessible radio-friendly tunes. But for me, if I am going to listen to power-pop, I'm going to go all the way and just jam to someN Sync."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!","review":"I am a major fan of the Jerky Boys. That said, listening to this CD was painful, especially when one is aware just how clever and funny the duo can be.The thought that kept running through my head was \\"Are these the bits that wound up on the editing floor of the first three CDs?\\"Many of the calls are really mean spirited and humorless(especially the Jeapordy bit). Other calls just seem to ramble and go nowhere. This is not vintage Jerky Boys.The one redeeming bit on this album is Sol Rosenberg's phone call in an attempt to banish Howard Stern from the airwaves... only problem is he calls the Food and Drug Administration, thinking they could assist him with such his troubles.I thoroughly enjoyed the first three Jerky Boys releases.

Forget about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jerky Boys 4 (Review)","review":"After hearing the Jerky Boys 3, which was the first Jerky Boys album I listened to, I picked up The Jerky Boys 4, hoping it would be just as funny.

Well, I can say that this is a disgrace to and otherwise classic seris of hilarious CDs.There simply weren't any belly laughs to be found in this CD, only a few giggles here and there. Even classic characters like Sol Rosenberg and Frank Rizzo disappointed me. The only call that actually makes me laugh is \\"Trains\\" with Jocko's \\"flesh tunnel\\". Other than that, you won't find the brilliant humor that was a trademark of the Jerky Boys.

Christensen's excellent book is a classic of strategy literature. The innovator's dilemma is that doing the right things can lead to failure. Sometimes it is wrong to listen to customers, invest in the highest return opportunities and do all of the things that made a successful company succeed. Clearly written, amply documented, provocative and challenging, this book is indispensable for anyone in business. If it has a shortcoming, it is that it focuses more on the dilemma than on resolving it and it does not offer specific remedial prescriptions. However, Christensen has authored or co-authored two other books that attempt to remedy that deficiency. We heartily recommend this book, which remains the leader of the three. It has the potential to change the way managers think about business - any business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not interesting enough.","review":"Well, if you are a horror fan of like Stephen King books you'll most probably LOVE this book.

I don't mind the hours I spent reading this book because at least it made me think about a couple of things I hadn't realized before.But on the other hand... there are really only a few important concepts in this book, and you can see what they are by reading a couple of the longer reviews here (like Coert Visser's or the one from \\"Dr. Professor Hossein Arsham.\\" There's no need to read the whole thing unless you want to hear those same concepts explained over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical dressed-up academic rehash","review":"Does no-one read anymore? Despite all the assembled love notes to Clayton Christen here, it would seem not. Because this book is a typical re-hash of old ideas in dressed-up tech-friendly clothing.F'rinstance, the idea that prior market leaders are often swept away in new waves of market innovations is as old as Schumpeter. Christensen adds some nice historical frisson to the story -- good for trotting out at Friday beer bashes and impressing management -- but nothing more. It has been documented before (and more entertainingly) in books about NeXT, Digital, Apple, IBM, and others. Even Computer Wars, Morris and Ferguson's more recent vintage book hits the same notes -- and you'd don't have to go back more than a decade to find that one.Anyway, nice stories, but this is the kind of opportunistic and wildly over-applicable theorizing that gives rise to too many conferences.

What does this mean? Money management is key since most of their trades are unsuccessful. What makes up MM? No one will say since that's their only REAL edge.

Within a three week time period I was able to go from being in the hole 6% in unrealized gains to being up over 10% in unrealized gains. I have since realized those gains and re-invested them looking to turn some more profit.So I would say this is definitely a worthwile read for those interested in finding out how the big investors/traders became who they are and trying to come up with your own methodology for not falling into some of the pitfalls the market holds for the novice investor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good role model is worth it's weight in gold!","review":"Plenty of role models here.

But that just doesn't translate to an ability to \\"blast\\" a smell across the room, or even a cubicle. It will push a puff of air 6-8 feet, but the most common reaction was, \\"What is that?\\" and after I tell people, \\"Ok, try it again\\" and then they stick their noses up in the air and sniff around: \\"I kinda smell something, but not really.\\"Since it's only value is as a prank device, and it doesn't work very well, I recommend you take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Show, But No Go","review":"This toy looks great and is a really good concept, but it does not deliver.

The author is frustrated with the results our children have become, due to our \\"spoiling\\" of them. However, he is not hostile, he is merely concerned. He states up-front that he is not a \\"professional\\", but that he is a parent, which I feel is more credible anyway! He shares examples of spoiled children and offers solutions, so that our children may become the responsible, moral, and self-sufficient adults that we all want them to be. I am also a parent and have read dozens of parenting type books. This one is realistic and blunt and offers hope to us parents who only want the best for our children.

LOL. Anyways I checked this out of the library and I knew it probably would be bad because it was written like 15 years ago and boy things have changed since then. To go on , I didn't even finish the book because it just harps on all the types of things your kids can be spoiled with and how they act. Well duh, that is common sense. I have an easy solution on how to change spoiled kids , stop buying them stuff! Yes, it may be annoying to hear them scream or cry or whatever but as adults we have the power.

He has one idea, and he repeats it over and over -- you can guess what it is. The book is stuffed with obviously fake examples of the problem he claims to be highlighting, and has now turned into a mini-industry, and the writing is straight out of magazine articles from the 1950s. He has no actual training in what he writes about, nor is he a professional. He really seems to hate children, and this is a constant presence in the book. Reading it will leave you with a little bit of a headache, and the idea that children today are basically evil, materialistic monsters. Particularly irritating are the endless references to how things used to be, when kids were __________ (fill in the blank: more respectful, kinder, less materialistic, more hardworking, whatever). Dumb, obvious, and nasty."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent for review","review":"In this study guide, Hall and Lieberman provide an excellent accompaniment to their brilliant text.

That said, I just couldn't get into his Breckenridge Elkins and other humorous westerns. By far Howard is at his best in his dark work, and that shows in the stories contained in this book. The situations Elkins and others find themselves in are intended to be hilarious but strike me more as ludicrous. Their redundancy doesn't help matters. The strongest quality of these stories is Howard's powerful writing, but that can't overcome their deficiencies--for me anyway. To anyone wanting to read Howard's work, I recommend looking for the other collections in this Bison Books series or the volumes in Del Rey's ongoing reprints of Howard's work as close to his intended vision as possible. This is a volume for the Howard completist only, and even then I'd have a hard time recommending it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alternative title: \\"How to survive behind enemy lines\\"","review":"While the book is short and has a lot of tips that might be useful, it has no story at all, and the author has no writing ability (or charisma, for that matter). It's just one long check list.Beyond that, I can't get over how the author keeps giving me the impression of being an obnoxious and arrogant foot soldier of American imperialism. Despite how highly he praises his linguistic achievements, he seems to have very little genuine respect for the countries he's lived in, and that's very off putting to a language student I would expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning smart, not hard...","review":"I purchased this book a few years back after communicating with the author via email about his experiences at the DLI and as an intel officer. As others have pointed out, Mr. Janich brings together a whole slew of \\"wish I had thought of that\\" ideas and concepts regarding learning a language. I found the information helpful in prepping for college level language exams. All to often when we set out to learn a language, we end up merely memorizing some vocab words and basic grammar rules. I found the tips and tricks Mr. Janich presented in this book very helpful in not just learning the vocabulary, but *thinking* in the target language.

This would make an excellent introductory CD for the Holiday newcomer. You play one track, and you immediately want to hear more: Holiday's voice is so pure, so deceptively simple, and so haunting.

Total bull and a popular error. Go read a map.Next, the phrase \\"Guns germs and steel\\" gets uttered SO frequently that soon it becomes unbearable. My partner and I took to torturing each other by saying it aloud for the next 2 days.This is yet another documentary by a director who feels it necessary to show a man breaking into tears and then deliberately filming him while he's such a mess, he can't enunciate.

It belabors the obvious (guns were more deadly than spears) while leaving huge questions unaddressed (why didn't the Bantus, with their sophistocated, advanced society based upon advantageous geography, domesticated animals, crops, etc. create similarly deadly weapons and colonize Europe?)Instead, it repeats the same statements (I gave up counting the number of times Dr. Diamond said \\"As I wrote in my book Guns, Germs and Steel\\" or \\"It's a journey I began while in Papua New Guinea.\\") The recaps of narrative and visuals (I also gave up counting the pan shots of smallpox victims, or men carefully loading guns) starts to make one feel like we're in an endless loop.At best, there's an hour of material here.

Sadly, I think it does, because if you've read the book, you'll know his theory is full of holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"claptrap","review":"That which is original in this program is biased and untrue.

It gives more information about the entire conflict between the Jedi and Sith. The story revolves around three cousins who are transported to the battleground and proceed to follow their different paths. The story itself is rather bland....having read the Dark Forces novel, I can say it provides more information, but it's not really pertinent to the Star Wars storyline....yet. The ending leaves the possibility that we'll see some more of these characters later on, but for the most part, I wouldn't recommend this story on the basis of the plot. The art was ok. It appeared to be more Manga than other Tales books which I didn't particulary care for, but overall, there are some nice shots. If you are really into the Star Wars storyline, it's a nice addition, but otherwise, stick with the novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of war, hardship and destiny.","review":"I adored this comic, I can now see why it's so damn popular. it's theme is bold, complex and purely Star Wars. It is a heartworming and heartbreaking tale of war and hardship, very bittersweet. It is even somewhat emotionally compelling. The relationship between the main characters Darovit, Zannah and Hardin, is touching. This relationship starts off as unstable, yet as the three move towards their destiny's throughout the story, that all changes. In the end, each cousin risks their life for the other. Don't let the soft and coy art style fool you though, this comic is not for kids. Keep in mind it's theme is war, so expect violence and occasional intense moments. It also contains advanced dialog, so yeah... not for unintelligent little brats. NO, you don't half to be a die hard Star Wars fan to enjoy this comic.

It tells the story of the Battle, and Darth Bane's use of the Thought Bomb, and of Zannah's apprenticing to Bane.Overall, I found this to be a pretty good book. I found the story to be interesting, and the graphic work to quite well done. Some of the characters looked like D&D; characters - including an elf, a harpy, and a satyr - which I found a bit disappointing, but I did not find that it ruined the experience for me.I thought that it was a good book, and I really enjoyed reading it.

Now, given the fact that she's 12 and I'm not....plus the fact that I've read a lot of mysteries and should be able to read between the lines, that is saying a lot. Sammy will keep fans and readers on the edges of their seats, wondering what she will do next and breathlessly hoping that she won't get caught. Her journey, with friend Marissa, to Hollywood in this story is great....I love the detail given about the people who hang around in the bus depots.

Otherwise, a very enjoyable cookbook...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Blander","review":"Having been told I needed to get my cholesterol levels down, and finding little comfort in my favorite, well-worn cookbooks, when I saw this I thought \\"Aha, here it is. Healthful food that tastes good.\\" Wrong. Healthful it may be, but tasty it ain't. We've tried two dishes in a row and both would put your tongue to sleep. I finally turned the second dish into something we could eat by grabbing my wok and stir-frying the pork - in olive oil, mind you - along with some soy sauce and sesame oil. And that gave me inspiration - to put this book on the shelf and grab my for-too-long-unused Chinese cookbooks.

Why? Although the recipes are unique and creative and the pictures look great, the results for almost all of the recipes I've tried are a great disappointment. I believe that healthy, fat free, low sodium cooking doesn't have to be bland, but that's what the majority of these recipes are. And while other readers have found the recipes to be quick, I found them to be quite time-consuming. There are a few recipes in the book that I like and frequently return to, but too few to justify owning the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great collection of bland recipes","review":"The photography is the best part of this book. The pictures make the dishes look extremely appealing, but unfortunately the taste doesn't follow through. For example, none of the recipes include salt in the ingredient list. This allows the nutrion list to look nice in the sodium category, but who cooks with NO salt?I do find the book useful for ideas; for example, there's a recipe for black bean chili over polenta. That's a nice combination which I would never have considered. But I followed the recipe for the chili, and it was tasteless! The addition of some imaginative spicing turned the chili into something which had taste.This book strikes me as the ultimate in health books which make people think that healthy food has to be tasteless and a chore to eat. It's not that way at all! There are many other cookbooks available which describe dishes which are both healthy and delicious."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW I feel rejuvinated...Thanks Suzi","review":"I always was feeling tired and lifeless.

I'm a 55-year old breast cancer survivor who has lost some of her agility. I watched the video first to get an idea of the pace and range of movements involved in the presentation. The pace was easy to manage. The Pilates movements themselves were well-presented. If you are anything like me, watching the screen and doing the exercise at the same time is sometimes difficult. Suzi had obviously thought about how to make the movements understandable at many levels. If you are looking for a Pilates video you can stick with, this is the one. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality!","review":"As a Pilates Instructor, I am skeptical of the videos on the market. When I first saw Body Power, I was blown away.

Suzie Lonergan is a true professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a difference!","review":"I can't begin to tell you how thankful I am for Suzi Lonergan's Bodypower - Pilates. As a college cheerleader I have to stay lean and strong to execute our rigorous routines, not to mention squeezing into my midriff uniform! Suzi's video is perfect for accomplishing these goals. I've even lent the video to my teammates who have never done Pilates before, and they loved it! Since buying this video, I don't have to make time for the gym and I'm not in pain while I'm working out, which is something that I put up with for a number of years. It's such a relief to finally be able to look forward to exercise and actually see the results! Thank you Suzi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Woman is Amazing!","review":"I love this tape.

The hand-held camera technique for intense combat scenes worked in SPR, but now it's getting predictable and just plain annoying. This made-for-TV movie reeks of low production values.

Especially relevant are the scenes depicting the ethnic diversity of the front-line soldiers (NY immigrants meet Midwest farmboys).

(and that includes, Ryan,Platoon,Band of Brothers)Rick Schroder's Performance gets my vote for the BEST portrayal of ANY War role in recent history (and that includes Tom Hanks in Ryan) The emotion and despair in Rick Schroder's eyes and facial expressions is so convincing that it becomes hauntingly scarey!His genuine compassion and human interaction with the men in his battalion are not often(if ever) shown in most hollywood movies.The Battle scences and authentic WWI equipment and weapons were outstanding as well. Another unique aspect to this movie is therealistic portral of the German soilders as young men with the same fears as that of the US soilders they were fighting.This movie stuck in my head for days after viewing it, in most part due to the performance by Rick Schroder, I can't say enough about it. I think it far out pace's ANY other Ive seen and I think he should have won an OSCAR or something for the role!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story","review":"The Lost Battalion is one of those stories you just can not help but think \\"is this real\\"? Most assuredly it is real and compelling viewing. The story once again looks at the American citizen soldier and just what he/she can do when the going gets tough. Told against the horrors of the First World War a battalion of soldiers is cut off from their support in an ill-fated attack in the Argonne in 1918. That they manage to hang on against all the Germans can throw at them for days on end is a tribute to the leadership of their officers and the tenacity of the men.Rick Schroder is outstanding as the lawyer-turned-soldier who leads and inspires his command to hang on in the face of fearful odds. Stick with this one as it shows the futility of war as well has the triumph of the human spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true superstar","review":"I dont care what anybody says about Edge the honest truth is that this guy can wrestle!

The print is a little small, but wasn't a problem and it was worth it to have something small enough to fit in my purse.It leaves out most of the major tourist restaurants, shops, and sights, so it's not a tourist book like it says.

For those who have less than perfect eyesight, this book should come packaged with a magnifying glass.

If you are truly a resident you will understand. Its listing of restaurants is pathetic, not in number, but in the fact that it misses the small places that are truly the best - forget the shopping portion completely. The list of sporting venues is alright, however it fall far short for entertainment venues (Roseland and Hammerstein Ballroom for example). As for a guide to \\"New York City\\", to live here you can't just consider Manhattan the city and all the rest the \\"outer boroughs\\".

Frankly the songs were all just plain good and fun. That is what Hanson is good at; putting out fun music and Snowed In is no exception to that. The music was not only just fun, but it is music that has good arrangements of the songs. If you want a good solid pop rock Christmas album, this is a good one to consider getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas is a great time of year","review":"Everybody used to love Christmas songs until Hanson had to go and ruin our Christmas spirits.

Maybe this year they should ask Santa for their voices to change, they made me ralph up my eggnog the first time I heard this album (believe me, I'm not joking).

Why? Because I take this CD from my shelf, pop it into my CD player, and listen to it once more.Even though the CD is 10 years old, it remains fresh, new, and exciting. Hanson has chosen the perfect Christmas songs that fit their pop/rock style. Their trademark harmonies and musicianship are clearly evident throughout the CD, especially on songs like \\"What Christmas Means To Me,\\" \\"Little Saint Nick,\\" \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\", and Hanson originals \\"At Christmas\\" and \\"Christmas Time.\\"With all the commercially-released Christmas fluff out there, Hanson stands tall above the rest, and have created a truly classic Christmas album that will continue to stand the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best out there","review":"I loved this cd from the first moment I bought it.

This is one CD I play a lot and would like to hear more of on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! A New Christmas Favorite","review":"Move over Chipmunks! I am a huge music fan, and I especially love a good Christmas album. I find it helps to put me in the holiday mood. After I listened to \\"Snowed In\\", I was full of Christmas cheer. With some clever reworkings of old classics such as \\"Merry Christmas Baby\\" and \\"Run Run Rudolph\\", alongside some Hanson originals \\"Everybody Knows The Claus\\" and \\"Christmas Time\\", Hanson has made their mark on the holiday season. Taylor's empassioned vocals alone make this CD worth buying. Don't miss out on this one, folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanson Rock the House.....even if they are Snowed In","review":"For all those who may feel like the Grinch when they don't listen to Christmas music at Christmas STOP and buy this album. Hanson remakes many rock Christmas favorites and adds to them which greatly improves the sound. All three guys compliment each other from the fabulous guitar solo in Run Rudolph Run, Taylor's organ and voice making an improved version of Christmas (Baby Please Come Home, and Zac's beating the drums out while belting out Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree you can see how these guyz landed a record deal and fans. Even though this a one season album it is worth the money especially for people who like to rock for the holidays"},{"rating":"2","title":"Merry Christmas!!","review":"A definitive Christmas compilation! If this album doesn't bring a smile to your face and propel you into the Christmas mood, you're probably dead! The \\"Silent Night\\" Medley is one of the most satisfying versions of these songs I've ever heard. It's May, and I'm STILL listening to it! A GREAT follow-up to their Middle of Nowhere release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Hanson Christmas","review":"This is a good Christmas CD. It's not as good as Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas CD, but it's still good. It's one of the best holiday CD's that I've heard. My favorite song is \\"Little Saint Nick\\". I like the old record-ish sound of \\"White Christmas\\". This CD is recommended for any Hanson fan, or anyone going for a little different and more rock oriented Christmas CD. Recommended to everyone! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ,Awesome , One of the best U have to love it!!!","review":"Snowed In By Hanson is soooooooo great.

You can listen to it all year round. Hanson trully are superb musicians, as well as song-writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"MERRY CHRISTMAS BABY","review":"Snowed In displays the wide range of styles of music Hanson really can pre-form. From the deep, sad songs such as \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" to the catchy, get-up-and-boogie tunes like \\"Run Run Rudolph\\" and \\"The Clause\\" you the teriffic tunes won't die out. The 3 songs they wrote, \\"The Clause\\", \\"Christmas Time\\", and \\"At Christmas\\" not only have great melodies but funny, welcoming lyrics. \\"Silent Night Medley\\" is just, he most. It has everything you need, from the harmony, to Ike's crisp voice, to Tay's raspy one, and to Zac's deep, developed voice. I tell ya, this CD is a peice of artwork! Unique, ear-catching, and over-all amazing!! Snowed In makes you want to have Christmas RIGHT now. Just the sound of it means one thing, Christmas. And no one could have set a better reputation for Christmas. This is the way Christmas music is meant to be. So go out, buy the album, and . . . MERRY CHRISTMAS BABY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this cd","review":"I have had this cd since it first came out! It has become a tradition in my home.

Details that are provided concerning individual accomodations section tend to use the term \\"we.\\" As in: \\"At Schweitzer we invite folks to come up and \\"ski the view.\\"\\" In other words, the detailed descriptions appear to be nothing more than mini-advertisements provided by none other than the recommended resort.

Great songs such as : \\" Hand to hold on to, Play guitar, Serious business, Scarcrow, Rumbleseat and Between a laugh and a tear\\", all have been left off here. Well add these songs as a bonus and Remaster the CD and then it will be THE BEST THAT I CAN DO. This would make the CD a wonderful 20 songs and do us MELLENCAMP FANS justice.Albums such as \\"WHENEVER WE WANTED,BIG DADDY, HUMAN WHEELS and other more recent CD's will just have to be put on HIT'S #2.Which I demand soon, as a GOOD FAN.

The album definently scores a plus with it's representation of Mellencamp's different styles and features some classic singles that are sure to hook anyone onto him for life. To put it lightly, i was *Really* hopeing he would do something like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD full of Great Songs","review":"There is not much to say here. John Mellencamp has made some of the best rock and roll of the 80's and 90's. This is a collection of most of his hits through the Lonesome Jubilee album. You can not go wrong here. Song after song of great hits. This is one of the best \\"Best of\\" CD's you can ever have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can my middle name be \\"Cougar\\" now?","review":"I remember the year or so before this came out, I thought he really needed a \\"hits\\" package. Glad he got one, and thank god it contained the \\"Authority song\\". I enjoy the last track also. Of course it's all opinion as to what's missing. To me it's \\"Play guitar\\" and \\"Rumbleseat\\". To others \\"Rain on the Scarecrow\\". But what is here is all the classic Mellencamp you need to make you feel like you're cruising through the Indiana countryside. It will go perfectly with your \\"Springsteen\\" and \\"Tom Petty\\" Greatest Hits cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I'm only 17, but everyone I know can sing \\"Jack and Diane\\" or \\"Hurts so Good\\" at the drop of a hat, and our senior class loves the song \\"Small Town\\" because it describes us so well. John's music has that timeless, patriotic, fun, and poetic appeal anyone can love. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever - All Classics","review":"This will be the fourth time I am purchasing this CD. My daughters have \\"borrowed\\" every other copy I had. Just the fact that I would buy this 4 times (so far) should tell you something. And you know what? If I lose this copy, I'll buy it AGAIN!!If you love John Cougar Mellencamp, this is a CD you must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mellencamp Rocks as always","review":"Well I have to admit I have had this album for awhile but for some reason never did a review on it but now I am because I just listened to the whole thing and it is awesome!!!!! I mean duh of course it is because it has the great classics. My favs are all on here, except of course the current stuff. I highly recommend this for any John Mellencamp fan, you will not be dissapointed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compilation.","review":"Mellencamp has become almost the same kind of American icon that Willie Nelson is, and if you're unfamiliar with him, buy this immediately and see where it takes you. If you are more like me and just wanted a compilation of great tunes from his other records, it works for that too: as you can see from the playlist, a good pile of the ones you'd expect to see are indeed on here (unlike some other artists who pile on some really obscure stuff). The two bonus tracks are also great tunes, but to be perfectly honest, probably should have been replaced with yet more of his classic work (e.g. give those two the axe, and replace them with \\"Rain on the Scarecrow\\" and \\"Hand to Hold On To\\", and I think it would be perfect. Thus, only 4 stars, but seriously: this compilation ROCKS! (in the USA, no less!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT AN ALBUM!","review":"Being only 19, adult pop/rock has influence my life to be what it should be, being yourself and under stand life. John Cougar Mellencamp's lyrics bring out the good life. One of my favorite song is\\" Authority Song\\". Other favorites include \\" Jack and Diane and Feel So Good\\". I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"If you're a \\"thirtysomething\\" person, you gotta just have this CD. The memories it brings back are great. Mellencamp grasped the entire 80's and took it for a huge and wild ride. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Collection","review":"Like the artist himself, this CD of greatest hits is solid and reliable, and radio friendly. Does this make for bad music? Not always and definitely not in this case. Mellencamp himself doesn't think of himself as a musical genius, and this is part of his charm. He knows his place in the order of the universe and his humility shows on his songs, in a good way. They are simple and straight forward. Most of the tracks on here rock, which is more than a lot of other more pretentious types can account for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this and get better!","review":"Whenever my eczema flared up, my friends would tell me I'm too stressed out. I didn't feel that way, not much more stressed out than usual, so the timing of the flare ups and the stress level at that time was sometimes confusing.After reading this book, however, I recognized it's much more than just the simple stress - more deeply rooted issues I've apparently held for a long time. I had vaguely suspected this may be the case, but didn't know how/where to start. This book gave me the guidance to do that on my own.I agree with 3 other reviewers completely. I no longer feel helpless and scared when I can feel my skin starting to flare up. I am not yet free from eczema, but knowing what may be the underlying cause of it, and how to calm it down, I have much stronger sense of being in control of my skin, body and my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The late Dr. Kelly is one of my all time favorite authors in the field of Church History (_Dictionary of Popes_, _Golden Mouth_, _Jerome_), but this foray into Biblical Studies, is quite disappointing. Dr. Kelly merely retreads tired interpretations of what are three of the most overlooked but most interesting of the New Testament epistles. The inclusion of 1 Peter with 2 Peter & Jude is highly dubious as well. For really interesting writing on Jude & 2 Peter, I would suggest E. Earle Ellis' or Richard Bauckham's work. There are many excellent commentaries on 1 Peter, too many to list. I guess even brilliant authors have their off days."},{"rating":"2","title":"History brought to vibrant life","review":"'Lord of Samarcand' is an excellent collection of some of the best stories ever written by Robert E. Howard, the writer who, in his all too brief career, created such memorable characters as Conan the Barbarian, King Kull and Solomon Kane, to name but a few.Howard's historical stories may be less well known than those about the mighty-thewed barbarian, but show him at the peak of his narrative powers: set in the Orient at the time of the Crusades, these grim, blood-soaked tales bring history to vibrant life as only Howard could. Rewriting history in the guise of fiction was one of the things he loved most, and his suicide in 1936, at the age of 30, robbed the literary world of a very talented writer that had only begun to hit his stride.So enjoy these tales about Godric de Villehard, Cormac FitzGeoffrey and Red Cahal, to name but a few of the grim-faced giants whose bloody exploits are told in this excellent volume of The Works of Robert E. Howard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historically fiction","review":"Do not overlook this collection. Unlike the Conan or Kull stories there are no fantasy elements in these stories. The settings are very historically accurate. Most of the main characters have some deep flaw or weakness from pride, to anger, to alcoholism, to lack of faith in anything. They war in torn and broken lands but somehow REH allows a glimmer of greatness /hope/ good luck to touch them or their world. Alot of times that is not the case. Worth the time to read just for the entries \\"The Lion of Tiberias\\", and \\"the Sowers of Thunder\\". \\"The Road of Azrael\\" stands with \\"Beyond the Black River\\" and \\"By This Ax I Rule\\" as REH at his best. Yes, there are some weaker inclusions aka \\"The Road of the Eagles\\" and \\"Gates of Empire\\". Also unlike the Del Rey editions there is NO ART WORK. All REH and historical fiction fans need to read this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howard is King","review":"Yet another Wonder of Howard's work.

The glossary in the back of the book is very unhelpful because it is only in Italian and only for the vocabulary already defined for each chapter, not for the random and unfamiliar words used in the extra articles and stories which students are also responsible for. The textbook used for Italian 1 and 2 was better suited to LEARNING, not reading in Italian for pleasure, or whatever this book is intended for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, goes together quickly","review":"This was our house Christmas present. It's VERY attractive, and took 20 minutes to open, read directions and assemble. The different sizes let you pick exactly what fits in your space, and we chose the arch to complement the curves of the logs of the adjacent wall, and because we are older and if you stagger dumping wood into it you can grab it. It came with the necessary Allen wrench and an extra screw. 4 stars rather than 5- the screw assembly is flimsier than anticipated, with no real rigidity in something made of thick hammered steel (only one screw per leg or arm). We anticipate augmenting the fastenings and perhaps adding a brace. That will void the warranty:) but then it won't be necessary, because about the only thing that could fail are those short single button screws. I'd still recommend this highly for the design, and the astonishing amount of wood it holds, and the beautiful material nicely finished. It is made in the USA, too, in Washington State."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to reviews.","review":"After reading the other reviews, I was prepared for a heart-warming, coming of age movie. What I got was dark, slow, hard to follow and boring. The movie I bought from Amazon was a prior rental in the U.S., so maybe something was cut out of it that made it such a classic, but from what I saw it was just 90 minutes worth of \\"stuff\\". There was no real \\"coming of age\\" event in the whole movie.

The writing, however, was simply atrocious. Facts are thrown together as random sentences--leaving the reader with a frustratingly incoherent narrative. Overall, the authors present an incredibly pedantic writing style. At times I found myself laughing that anyone could write in such a nonsensical way! Here's an sample of what the reader is in for...\\"The hyperinflation of brand-name therpaies has produced narcissistic fatigue...This might be called the Exaustion Theory of Integration: the cynical but accurate observation that peace among warring schools is the last resort.\\" In my oppinion--it's better to invest in primary resources than to subject students to this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"Sure this book has a pretty cover, and the information is great, but after studying this book for my graduate-level course in \\"Introduction to Psychotherapy,\\" I would highly suggest reading another text.

On top of this, the back cover is misleading - the story is NOT what it says on the cover - quite crazy really.Indicates pathetic editing and publishing values. I was glad I had not paid for the book - only borrowed it.The action is unbelievable - literally. I wish someone else would pick up the idea and write a better book. And I hope the author would take ONE look at the map of Kashmir (I doubt if he could visit Siachen - so the faked description of the glacier and its dubious use in the plot is excused)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once I put it down, I could not pick it up","review":"I bought this book before heading out on an airline flight, and found I could not read more than half of it before skipping to the end.

The situation of the destruction of a Hindu Temple leading to a nuclear strike by Secular India on Islamic Pakistan is unlikely. Hindu's have for centuries watched more than 1500 of their temples being destroyed by Muslim Invadors and have done nothing about it, not because they are cowards but because their religion does not ask them to be bloodthirsty and does not promise them Eternal life in Paradise with Virgins and Fresh Water for killing People of other faiths. The Hindu leaders and politicians know about this and are unlikely to base a nuclear strike based on reaction from their population.

Perhaps the nature of AppleScript is just confusing so I do not want to fault the author.

The Apple documentation, limited as it may be is much more useful. I have found little to no information that was helpful in this book. It gives few commands and fewer syntax rules or examples.I don't dismiss the possiblity that if I had been AppleScripting for years I might not think the same way about this title.

The text dances all around any definitive answers, forcing the reader to intently analyze the information provided so that a practical solution can be formed. Clearly, the editor did not stop the author from continuing down the path of writing a book for those who are already quite familiar with applescript. If you are already an applescript programmer, this book might be of use. If you are attempting to learn by example and concept as I am, look elsewhere for explicit information.

Is it so easy that it doesn't have to be demonstrated? Hardly.I was thrilled when I ordered this book, then furious when it arrived in the mail. If you want something that is understandable, then go elsewhere, because this book does everything but explain how to use AppleScript in a straightforward way.I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. Understand that you are not getting something that easily understood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought it","review":"I have read quite a number of books on US Navy operations in the pacific, and this is by far the worst. It may be the worst book I have every read. In a matter of a few pages I realized that the author has an axe to grind, probably wasnt happy with his Chiefs and Officers while serving in the Navy. As I flipped to the end of the book, I begain to read about the authors conspiracy theories and a 1961 quote from Eisenhower regarding the military-industrial complex. I am tempted to send it to the recycling bin in hopes that in its next life it is something useful. Better to send it back to Amazon and find another book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK - just.","review":"This DVD would have been ok if I'd bought it for $5, but unfortunately, the four artists I bought if for - namely, Leonard Cohen, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and Buffy Sainte Marie - all together hardly made up five minutes of the video. Apart from that - the video starts badly, but picks up as it goes along. There are a few interesting moments, but the balance of time allotted to each artist seems totally askew. There's about 15 minutes devoted to each of the first artists covered, which makes the one minute mini coverage of others an absolute crashing disappointment, and perhaps colours my opinion of the merits of this DVD. I had assumed that Leonard Cohen would be 'the main man' due to the title, which comes from one of Cohen's songs. Just goes to show - never assume. As they say - it makes 'an ass of u and me'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Planless and partially off topic","review":"Whoever threw this collection of albumcovers together, obviously wanted to make a book showing a few albumcovers, but had no clue what new wave was. Neither a classic like Roxy Music belongs in this book, nor all the unimportant american power pop bands a la photos,heaters etc, that nobody listened to and that didnt contribute anything new or of value to the music scene.Even worse, adding idols for 12 year olds, such as Wham, Taco, Men without hats and similar crap to this collection, is an iinsult to the genre. Those we the ones we hated and never wanted t see again, if you had been born then already, you know?"},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"For the price of this book with a cd, it is absolutely not worth it.

A worthwhile album that should be checked out by any metal fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great guitar player but poor music","review":"Of course Yngwie is a great guitar player, but this cd is poor.The kind of Heavy metal of the 80's that has not aged well.Every guitar solo looks like the other, the signer is not great.For myself, I prefer Joe Satriani...he makes better music and better guitar solos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yngwie YAWNsteen","review":"After listening to this Yngwie's latest \\"opus\\", I only have two things to say. First, while the man is a great guitarist, he can't write a song to save his life. Second, this is the reason why I'm so glad the 80's are over. This album is all style and no substance. Time for Yngwie to quit making records, and join the rest of us in the new century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Underrated!","review":"This Album is completely underrated, it may be a little commercial but the songs are tremendous. The cd seems to have energy and passion, it even sounds angry at times. Songs like Facing the animal, Another time, and End of my rope are awsome.

You can even use after pregnancy","review":"I I love this video. I used during both pregnancies and have even shared with my friends. This video is even good to use after pregnancy. It gives you several options and it really helped my belly get back immediately. The nurses at the hospital even remarked about how my stomach and fondus (not sure correct name). Quickly regained its original shape. I know it was from doing this Pilates video because I ate like crazy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you choose this video, have other work outs in addition through the week","review":"I appreciate the way she has modified normal Pilates moves to be safe using your abs during pregnancy and you will get a crazy burn in your hips from the side work out series but that is about all. She does not evenly work out the whole body. She works the abductors (hip muscles) more than any other muscle group, which was really frustrating to me. There is ZERO upper body work done in this video. The music is very boring and not motivating. When I wake up in the morning and think about how I want to work out, this video is the least appealing option. I don't recommend you get this video unless you are looking for a way to work your abs and you are REALLY concerned about your hip muscles and even then I suggest you incorporate many different workouts with this in the week our you will develop strength deficiencies in your body from over working some muscle groups and ignoring many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I just started using this dvd in my 2nd trimester. And I am enjoying it, it has helped me feel better and stronger. Being someone who is familiar with pilates, I thought the minor modifications made to the pilates workouts really help when you are carrying the extra weight on your belly.The only thing I wished they had added on their would be a another section for arms and shoulders.But over all a good workout, without the extra stress that might come with some other kinds."},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout","review":"I found this workout challenging and and set at a good pace. The lighting is not bright enough so you can't always see exactly how to adjust your form and the background music is terrible (a constant \\"wonnnng wong\\")but the workout itself is great. If you can tolerate the music and \\"greyish\\" lighting it's defintely a dvd I would recomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout but third trimester is hard","review":"I liked this video through my first and second trimesters.

Sure wish there were some moves for your arms though"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING!","review":"This is the only prenatal workout I have tried so far that isn't a complete snooze fest. This workout is actually challenging. I was an advanced exerciser prior to pregnancy (now 21 weeks along) but have begun to struggle in my workouts in the past few weeks. Since adding this to my rotation I have noticed added definition in my butt and thighs. It is definitely hard but will not wipe you out. My butt and legs are ON FIRE during the side-lying series (which I LOVE). It does get easier with repeated use. So far this is the only prenatal DVD I've purchased that wasn't a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"this is a little too difficult for an average pregnant woman with no previous Pilates experience, as well as maybe a bit self-congratulatory"},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"i have never written a review of anything in my entire life, but feel it is my duty to warn you that if you are not extremely experienced in pilates , have incredibly strong abdominal muscles during pregancy and have no issues with balance...then do NOT do this workout. I am truly horrified. There are absolutely no instructions or modifications given depending on what trimester you are in. The abdominal workout is downright scary at least for someone in their 3rd trimester. The side leg workout is rigorous but good, however there are stretches shown lying flat on your back..an absolute no no for anyone over 20 wks and there are standing stretches on one leg that are NOT even shown using a chair...very dangerous...and by the way, pre pregnancy i was a 5mile a day runner who was very adept and pilates and yoga...all i can say is in my humble opinion, this workout is nowhere near the vicinity of being safe..buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Detrimental to my pregnancy","review":"I did this Pilates routine three times a week during my pregnancy. I caught a cold in my third trimester and took a break for a week until it was gone. Then I did the routine again and bruised my ribs on the right side. We later found out my baby was in a breech position with his head right under my right ribs. I went into early labor 5 days after bruising my ribs and delivered my baby 6 weeks early by cesarean. Furthermore, I was in shape when I started using this video (running and lifting weights regularly through my first trimester), yet I found it to be an advanced workout. Compared to other pilates DVD's I've found recently, it does not provide ANY beginner level modifications for the exercises.I do not recommend this exercise video for any pregnant woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"This DVD is not my favorite... It has little to no instruction and as my pregnancy has advanced, I am concerned about the amount of time spent on your back in this video and the amount of abdominal work. I have done Pilates pre-pregnancy and will continue post-partum, but this DVD is one that I felt was not worth while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a challenge","review":"I am a very active person who works out 6-7 days a week. I am an elementary PE teacher, Zumba fitness instructor, I do regular strength and weight training, and I do the Insanity DVDs by Beachbody. I do not usually do Pilates but wanted something different to add into my workout rotation during my third trimester. I did the video for the first time when I was 28 weeks. I did not feel challenged at all. I had no trouble breezing through the workout. I agree with some of the other reviews that say she does not take adequate time for stretching. I did this video one time and will never use it again. Instead I ordered the Fusion Pilates pregnancy workout and will give that a shot. It requires some weights and lasts for about an hour which sounds like more of the challenge I am looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one but TWO copies of this DVD were damaged upon receipt.","review":"Amazon must have received a bad batch of this program because both the original copy I purchased and its replacement were so severely scratched that I have now requested a refund. My best advice is to find another Pilates for Pregnancy program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Pregnancy Workout","review":"This workout is great for the legs, especially the thighs and hip flexors. However, there's nothing for your arms. Just be prepared to add some hand weight moves to your routine. If you were doing Pilates before you got pregnant, this workout will be stimulating without totally overdoing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"This dvd provided a good workout. I would recommend it on days when you do not want to do too much, but want to feel good after the workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I've used the Pilates During Pregnancy dvd several times since I purchased, and I love it. It took me a while to find one that I actually wanted to purchase, and I'm very happy that I chose this one. It's great for women in all stages of pregnancy and any level of pilates. I had never done pilates before, but I plan to continue doing it throughout my pregnancy and after. Definitely a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work out","review":"I noticed changes within a short space of time with this dvd ... although now i've discovered the pilates DVD by lizbeth garcia which I almost prefer more but both are great work outs. I found I couldnt do the abdominal section as it was uncomfortable/painful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more","review":"I was excited to try this workout based on other reviews, but I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting more of an overall workout, but I felt shortchanged once I was done. I'm a moderately fit person and have continued to exercise throughout my pregnancy. I definitely felt it in my hips after I completed it, but I wanted more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe not great for pregnancy","review":"I considered myself in good shape before I got pregnant but once I found out I was expecting I stopped my routine until after my first trimester. I thought this was difficult and uncomfortable in my second trimester. I think if you are a pilates teacher or a frequent class goer, this may be perfect but it was not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tougher than I thought","review":"I got this DVD to add a little extra something to my everyday routine. Since I had been practicing pilates, I didn't think that being pregnant would make a big difference. I'm not sure if I overestimated myself or underestimated this workout, but you definately get your money's worth with this purchase. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is that I feel she does the moves too quickly and doesn't allow enough time to fully develope each move. Also, those who have never done pilates may be confused at first since there is little instruction on each move. Otherwise, it's a great investment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't do it","review":"I'm a semi beginner to pilates and in my 2nd trimester. The exercises were too much for me to handle. I love pilates but I was unable to perform the exercises completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout before, during & after pregnancy...","review":"This is a great workout before, during & after pregnancy for toning. There is not a lot of instructions/advice so it helps to be familiar with pilates prior, but the excercises are easy to get. You will definitely notice a difference in your body after this workout. Exercises focus on stomach and inner/outer thighs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful side series","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I found this workout to be lacking in a sufficient warm-up. I am very athletic (long distance runner, advanced pilates, and yoga) yet was in so much pain during the side series that I could barely finish. I didn't feel like the exercises targeted the muscles, but I certainly could feel it in my hip joints. I thought it was just me until I read some of the other reviews. I won't be using this DVD for my next pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect workout while pregnant!","review":"I LOVE this workout, I have severe SI joint problems and it is hard for me to be able to do a lot of leg exercises especially while pregnant and still have a good workout. I also have the perfect pregnancy workout with Karyne Steben and Prenatal yoga by Shiva Rea which are also excellent BUT these other two workouts do not help with my SI joint pain I really am hurting after doing those two, Pilates during pregnancy helps me feel great after a workout and I am pain free afterwards. This is my favorite out of the three! I totally recommend purchasing it! Good luck and congrats to all of you who are pregnant :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for this intermediate","review":"I did Pilates for a few years before I got pregnant but still found this video challenging. Doing both the abs and legs together was too much for me. I also wished there would have been more instruction on proper form, etc. before beginning the exercises (she has all these blankets stacked but doesn't mention how they should be stacked or what she's trying to support). I ended up switching to prenatal yoga but I still do some of the Pilates leg moves that I did in my prior practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great- if you have experience","review":"I recommend this pilates video for those who have done pilates before. Otherwise, there is a good chance you may be doing the exercises wrong (as I did before taking a few classes).Otherwise, it is a great, challenging workout with a teacher who is pregnant- which is a great plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a challenging prenatal workout!","review":"I am 8 weeks pregnant with my second child and I wanted to stay fit from the beginning. I have been doing Pilates for 3 years on and off but have been doing private sessions since December so I am used to a challenging Pilates workout. Niece Pecenka really gives you an excellent Pilates session that modifies the Ab Series very well. I have tried Jennifer Gianni's DVD (it was highly recommended) and it wasn't even a workout for me. The only caveat to this DVD is that you should really have a good amount of Pilates training so that you know how to do the exercises properly. She really gives no instruction at all for beginners. Otherwise, great DVD for expectant moms!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pregnancy Workout!","review":"This DVD has two great workouts one for your \\"abs\\" and the other for the lower half, they are both fantastic and I find myself very relaxed at the end of it. The first section helps me with my back pain, I just feel so good afterwards. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has back pain in pregnancy and has some pilates experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"The leg workout is kind of intense, but after doing it a couple times it is a really good work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"This is a great workout, and not too long. It'll leave you feeling refreshed and aligned! I'm sure there are more difficult videos out there, but this is a good one to have if you are pregnant. It has a great lower body workout with some ab work in the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pregnancy pilates workout video I've found.","review":"I absolutely love this workout. The instructor is not annoying or irritating like most and she explains each move clearly and precisely so it is easy to catch on. I love that there are two segments so if I only have time to do the abs workout then I can save the leg workout for later (and visa versa).I've done this workout through a pregnancy and beyond. It is a great workout even when I'm not pregnant. Eliminating the folded blankets when I'm not pregnant adds even more of a challenge. I would highly recommend this video to anyone who is looking for a great instructor and a simple but challenging workout.The only thing I'd like to know is when are they coming out with a Vol. 2?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"I really, really like this DVD!Before becoming pregnant I was in ok shape, not great shape. I took 4 weeks of pilates mat about 1 1/2 years ago, so I'm not a pilates regular. I would say my level is high beginner since I have the fundamentals but did not have a regular practice.I totally disagree with the review that says this is too hard for a beginner or even intermediate student. I only had to stop once or twice and couldn't do the last couple of reps of the move being played- my legs were burning too much. Otherwise, I did all moves no problem. I did both sessions back to back.The length is perfect!! You feel like you've done something but definitely not like you won't be able to finish or that it's dragging on too long. The pace is good- uptempo but not crazy. The instructor is soothing and does not over-explain anything. She is easy to get the feel of the move from quickly.I would highly recommend this as a great complement to a walking program or some other cardio workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can I rate my purchase of TWO when I can only get ONE?","review":"This is the SECOND time I have been OFFERED this product via e-mail, and the first time I was sent one set, and then later told there would be no more.

Even though I'm married, I wanted to share it with my daughter. While the book does a great job of using examples from the novels to make her points, the modern day examples repeatedly tell of people meeting in bars?! Is this really where folks hope to find the love of their life? Also, the book assumes people sleep around A LOT before settling down. Guess I've been married a little too long...otherwise it was cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Cute!","review":"This book is charming. The author uses Jane Austen's more famous works - Northanger Abbey, Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Persuasion, etc. to demonstrate good/bad relationship behavior. There are 10 tips, each presented in lengthy chapters, that show how to model your relationship behaviors based on the romantic couples in Austen's books. The book was actually quite enlightening - although the 10 dating 'tips' are pretty obvious, the way in which the author uses examples from Austen's works is what makes the book a joy to read. Aside from examples from the books, the chapters also include examples of real-life couples and situations. This is quite an inspiring book, especially because you can see how well educated the author is about her subject matter (Austen, not dating), and it was interesting to see Austen's books critically examined from a romantic standpoint, while still being very fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Jane, you'll get a kick out of this book.","review":"Sure, the works of Jane Austen aren't a manifesto by which to live your life. But that's not really the point of this book, is it? It's a cute, beautifully designed, fun tribute to Jane Austen, her characters, and the people like me who love her! I thought this was great, and it's a good gift for anyone in your life who is a Jane Austen fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and Helpful Read","review":"An enjoyable book that every person dating needs to read. The part of the book that struck me most was only be with people who bring out the best in you. How sad that we have to teach that concept, but I think so many people would be much happier if they followed that one simple concept. You do not have to have read Austen's books to follow the concepts (but really, why haven't you at least read Pride and Prejudice?), the author gives you enough info to follow along, coupled with real life examples of her concepts. Thoughtful, well-written ideas that assist anyone dating or anywhere where you find yourself interacting with people.

Each time I attempt to find something useful in it, the information is scattered over the entire book making it extremely difficult to understand.For example, right now I'm looking up the \\"ref\\" attribute, and according to the index, it appears on 7 different locations throughout the book, each portion shorter than 1 page. Also, I have seen many tables scattered throughout with exact same information, or one or two differing field values, making it very confusing to understand which table is doing what.And at over 500 pages long, there is a large amount of filler information in this book.Is this book \\"definitive\\"? It looks like it is. Is this book usable? Absolutely not.

Just wait until some of the other XML Schema books that are listed as \\"not yet published\\" hit the racks. You'll forget about this book rather quickly.In my opinion, this book serves more as a reference and doesn't really serve-up any good ideas or suggested practices. In addition, one of the most annoying aspects of this book is the SIZE OF THE PRINT. It's so darned big on relatively small pages that when they referred to a figure, I would sometimes have to go backwards or forwards 2 pages.

Walmsley has a nice, clear writing style that only requires one read to grasp her points. Yes, I understand that most (if not all) of this material is living for free on one or more web sites, but I prefer to have it all in one well-written book. This was definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good reference","review":"At first, I found the format a bit cumbersome -- it is not necessarily well-suited to individuals that want only a high-level understanding of XML Schema.

Then I remembered why I bought this album in the first place: I wanted to hear the roots of Rock by a band that was experimenting with American blues (Boom Boom, I Wish You Would, Got to Hurry) and going beyond the blues to form a new sound (For Your Love).This Yardbirds post-Clapton album is a wonderful sample of Music in Transition, and it is definitely worth the money, especially with the extensive bonus tracks such as a sitar version of \\"Heart Full of Soul\\" and \\"Steeled Blues\\" featuring amazing steel guitar work by Jeff Beck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty","review":"Maybe I just don't get it, but this seems like a pointless and uninteresting collection of music.

The novel also employs the motif of the doppelganger in the figures of Christ, the hare-lip girl, and Sahek(sp.?), all of whom exhibit modes of faith and understanding which are incomprehensible to Barabbas. Barrabas cannot believe, essentially because he doubts, but \\"wants to believe\\" in order to justify his own existence. Without this struggle he remains only a name on the lips of the faithful. Barabbas' struggle represents, in parable form, the human need for meaning in a meaningless world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful reflection","review":"Barabbas is one of those books that covers a lot of territory in a small package. Purely a work of fiction, it is a classic \\"what if.\\" The story follows the life of one of history's most famous names, yet a person that we know nothing about. What I found interesting was the honest portrayal of the times. The era was not a clean intellectual period, but rather a dirty, dangerous, largely illiterate time in history when life was typically short and painful. It is also striking what little information the believers of the time had. Where we have multiple Bible translations, study groups, commentaries, etc., they became followers based on the smallest scraps of information, and were unable to articulate their faith in little more than a few abstract sentences. Yet, they were passionate believers. A thoughtful book worthy of investing a couple hours into on a rainy evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a continuation of his previous work...","review":"Harvey has continued his previous work with Fit For Life 2000. If you are not familiar with Fit for life, he does go into much detail reviewing his previous information, and admits that it was probably not complete (hey! we're always learning..) He ties in with previous books the VERY IMPORTANT issue that we are supposed to eat LIVING foods as much as possible. I like Harvey's discriptive way of writing. He really talks right to you, and ever since I picked up Fit For Life II, I know I feel better and have trimmed myself by following his practices.

Like all the productions - yes I mean ALL - at the world's most expensive but most bland Opera House the combination of must-be-Swiss chorus, players and above all audience reduces even the music to occasional jolliness but no thrills and even less magic. The best thing to do with this is to turn it on for the music and don't look. Also don't listen too hard to the Francais Federal. Ugly!

This is a dramatic film, not a comedy. There is some humor, but it's a serious story about desperados and greed in the American Old West, with Bud and Terence being the smarter desperados who come out ahead. This movie is a 1970's Italian spaghetti western, and the only thing that will keep you watching it are Bud's and Terence's performances--if you love these guys you'll find anything they do together enjoyable. There are some good, serious fight scenes, and everybody rides beautiful horses (I personally love great riding and gorgeous steeds.)

And I found the album absolutely delightful and hilarious. The whole production is true to the time period, spirit, and style of the original books. I found myself humming songs like Travel Hopefully, Love's Maze, and It's a Pig while at work for the next couple of weeks. This is a musical comedy, closer in musical style to the original Joseph (concept album also from the early 1970's - long before it went to Broadway) than to the full operatic style of Phantom. The comedy is a combination of the 1930's madcap films and a very British verbal humor. Overall, this is the kind of old-fashioned musical comedy that brings to mind summer evenings and local theater productions. What fun, By Jeeves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A shame it has never been widely produced","review":"I found a copy of this CD in my local library, and was totally captivated; so much so that I went out that afternoon and bought my own copy.

Any musical that has a song 'It's a pig!' has to be worth listening to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SHOW!","review":"I saw this show back in 1996 with the original cast in one of London's West End theatres....It was amazing and has stayed as my favorite stage perforamce up to date...I have seen other shows since but none have topped By Jeeves...its a wonderful, funny play with AMAZING music! Buy the music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another chart topper","review":"This follow up to the #1 hit \\"Believe\\" is also a good disco tune.

I love the fact that the Happy Family sets aren't all pink and purple, and with the exception of the Birthday Party/ playground set they're well-made for the price. This little grocery store is adorable! The shelves are actually big enough to hold all the grocery pieces, plus some others I've found from kitchen sets I've purchased. The only serious flaw is that the apples are all in a big bunch, and you can't just take a couple off the shelves to play with. Even though I bought this for my collection, my daughters begged to play with it, and they've had a ball. They love the little cart for Ryan, and it's held up very well. For the price, this grocery store is loads of fun, sure to keep kids of any age entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"not very durable","review":"this set is lots of fun! the only thing i don't like about it is that the back of the middle shelves falls out constantly! otherwise it is a wonderful set that i have had hours of fun with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic","review":"This faucet looks great in the picture and at \\"only\\" $120.00, it seemed like a good value. Guess what...the handle and the body are cheap plastic. Do you want a cheap P-L-A-S-T-I-C faucet in your kitchen???? I sure don't. I don't care how it works...it's cheap, cheap, cheap and Moen should be ashamed to sell this garbage.Did I say it is cheap? Only reason I gave it 1 star is you can't give it NO STARS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"The pull-out spray doesn't fit well into the base, pulls out too easily (even when cleaning). When you move the faucet from side to side, the spray spout wiggles a bit; not solidly seated. Moen is sending another heavier weight to put on the hose under the sink. Why do they even sell a product that needs an immediate fix. If that doesn't work, I'll return the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last very long.","review":"I realize that nothing lasts forever, but for around $120, it should last a lot longer than a year an a half.

What a joke.It was great while it lasted though, and I love the way it looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad At All","review":"I am always skeptical about books like this. Most of the ones I have come across are usually pretty cheesy or so impractical.

Utterly useless.","review":"I bought this book because I was very impressed with another Thompson book. \\"Beginning C++ game programming.\\". Unfortunately, this tome doesn't live up to that high standard.I almost never use the CDs that come with programming books. As I prefer to type in the lessons myself. However I was forced to pop in the CD on the first chapter of this book when my code would not compile. Imagine my surprise when I opened the solution and saw \\"if( PeekMessage( &msg;, NULL, 0U, 0U, PM_REMOVE ) )\\" where the book had told me to type \\"while (GetMessage(&msg;, wndHandle, 0, 0))\\". Huh?It didn't get any better after that. The text is poorly written. The editing is abyssmal. Maybe it gets better later on, but I'll never know. Because I'm not going to waste any more time on this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The code examples in this book simply do not work. You have to rely on other books and looking up things yourself on the internet to get the examples working. If I wanted to do that, I wouldn't have bought THIS book!! Its thourogh in its coverage of DX9, but so are a lot of other books that have code that actually compiles. Don't waste your money. A programming book with programming examples that don't actually work is like a cookbook without any actual recipes. Useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out Dated an Incomplete.","review":"This book is horrible. The code is outdated and most of the time it doesn't work.

In this entire film, B.B. performs 3 songs. This is a film about the producers trying to do a show at Sing Sing Prison. Although not the greatest, it still held my attention. If you're a B.B. fan, save your money and watch the clips on Youtube. They're all there. Otherwise, this is pretty much your standard early seventies documentary/concert film with Joan Baez getting most of the screen time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Verbose","review":"This author basically spends the entire novel writing to \\"hear\\" himself write. There would be PAGES of babbling that had nothing to do with the plot in the middle of a chapter, which I would simply skip because they bored me so much. After I got about 200 pages into it, I had found that my mind wandered throughout the entire book and I decided to just put it away and not finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable book I have EVER read","review":"I got on the wrong bus. And my journey home took and hour rather than 30 minutes. But when you have a book like this, who cares? People on the bus thought I was mad. I was laughing so hard tear came to my eyes......In parts, this is a very funny read yet there are very sobering moments as well where one holds sympathy for Jasper. The sophisticated use of the English language and a reminder of what Donne's poetry is all about add sufficient class to make this a very special experience. The book is also sprinkled with cullinary knowledge and travel experiences which would make this novel appeal to a very broad audience. In three words, brilliant, funny and intelligent! Why aren't there more books like this????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read If You Like Writing","review":"Quite enjoyed this story. Jasper's world is fully detailed and makes you truly get to know the character. The narrator is truthful and doesn't pull any punches. The supporting cast of characters are memorable and amusing. Loved that the poems he is writing are specifically referenced and play a thematic role in the story.This novel was finely written and uses precise language, so often lacking in more mainstream novels. If you are a fan of well written stories then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"No charm.","review":"The characters in this novel lack both charm and warmth, and it is after all a comedy. Obviously, most readers (14 of 14 reviewers) felt this was a small price to pay for the wit and literary by-play, and occasional funny scenes. For me, the main character, Jasper, was a one-dimensional bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"diabolically satisfying\\"","review":"This is one of the most cleverly written books of the last decade. The jaded reader may disparage this novel as \\"lad lit\\" in all its vainglory. Thankfully, Edward Docx weaves a remarkably funny tale of a rougue, learning his lessons the hard way, with the love sonnets of John Donne. The most brilliant aspect is exposing the modern reader to Donne's humorous and often, odd exposition of Love. It was a pleasure to read Donne again in this context. I couldn't agree more with the Publisher's Weekly review."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Are We Doing Here?","review":"Time was... you would watch a movie and love the sound track and rush down to the CD racks and buy it. I guess that convention doesn't apply to the \\"Wag The Dog\\" soundtrack. What happened to Edgar Winter's \\"Good Old Shoe\\" performed by Pop Staples and Willie Nelson? Being a Blues enthusiast, I couldn't wait to add this to my iPod. Merle Haggard's \\"Courage Mom\\" is also missing. What I'd like to know is where are these treasures locked up? The credits at the end of the movie list all of the songs with full credit to the writers and performers and then says something like Sound track available on CD. We've been robbed! I love Mark Knopfler's music, but this was not a solo effort. What are we doing here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real soundtrack of the film","review":"This CD is very disappointing - we saw the film 'Wag the Dog' and very much enjoyed the songs written especially for the film, such as 'American Dream', 'Courage, Mom' and 'Old Shoe'. We expected to find these songs on the film soundtrack album, and cannot understand why a CD has been released, purporting to be the official Wag the Dog soundtrack, which does not contain the songs used in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As others have noted, this so-called soundtrack includes none of the iconic songs from the movie. While the music here is fine, 29 minutes of instrumental music is not a \\"soundtrack\\" and the publishers should be embarassed to have labeled it as such. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the dog I expected.","review":"I should have read the customer reviews before buying this.

The album is pleasant enough, but only 1 in 1000 would guess that it has any relationship to the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Deceptive\\" to call this a Soundtrack","review":"All the best music from the film is glaringly missing. Willy Nelson's work, plus \\"Good Old Shoe\\", \\"Courage Mom\\", \\"The American Dream\\", (We Are The World\\" spoof), plus \\"God Bless the Men Of The 303\\" all moronically left out. This is not a Soundtrack but just a brief representation of Knopfler's own music from the film. NOT worth the money. All of the best has been gutted out!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The recognizeable songs from the movie are MISSING!","review":"I bought this so called soundtrack for ONLY one song, Merle Haggard's \\"Courage Mom\\". It's not on the CD and neither are Willie Nelson's cuts. Grrrr...there are 24 minutes worth of worthless tracks on this CD. One track with inaudible lyrics and 7 others that sound like elevator music. I would give this ZERO stars, but the default is 1-5. Total rip-off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"These songs in \\"Wag The Dog\\" were excellent. \\"Old Brown Shoe\\", that patriotic song and that tribute to the brave men of the \\"303\\" unit. Are any of these on this soundtrack? NO! And that is criminal at best! Unless you are really into Mark Knopler, stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing much - not a soundtrack","review":"I love the music on this album, but am very upset (like others here) so much of the good and fun music in the movie isn't here. Certainly it wasn't a space consideration. Definitely not a sound track. Definitely a *short* collection of knoffler's work done for the movie. Calling it a soundtrack is most misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the songs? Where's the music from the film?","review":"This isn't a soundtrack. If you were expecting to hear the great songs, you won't find them. I wanted to hear the great songs from the film and they just aren't here. Too bad, because the rest of the music would have received much better reviews if the most memorable music was featured.Not worth even a borrow from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Free Willie!","review":"As the other reviews noted, the Willie Nelson tracks are missing. After watching this movie again, I found myself humming those songs in my head. It's an outrage that they're not here. \\"Good Old Shoe\\" was my favorite. I frankly don't even remember any of the rest of the songs on this disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well balanced text","review":"I have used this text consistently for the past 4 years. Whitney does a good job at situating rather technical information in the context of general themes. Whitney tends to focus on psycholinguistics proper and presents little on how language is used (see Timothy Jay's Psychology of Language text in contrast). Unfortunately the text is getting somewhat out of date, as it has not been revised since the initial 1998 edition (whereas most texts in the field see a 3 to 4 year revision cycle). Still one of the best advanced undergraduate psycholinguistics text out there (see also David Carroll Psychology of Language)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection, Especially For The Cheap Trick Fan","review":"Sony records does something smart, putting together a four-disc box set commemorating the Wisconsin band's 20th anniversary but letting the group actually compile the songs. After one listen I knew that this was a compilation done for the sake of fans of the group, rather than the ubiquitous \\"greatest hits\\" package. And that's a good thing, seeing as how fully half of the music here is unreleased material, including some covers, demos, and even some live sessions featuring bassist Tom Petersson on lead vocals. The liner notes are fabulous, reading like a Cheap Trick history lesson through their first twenty years. I had the good fortune to have a brief conversation with Robin Zander last summer, and it was evident that the band still tours and records because they love to perform for their fans. This \\"box set\\" definitely shows that as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't do this great band justice","review":"The problem with box sets is that they cover the entire spectrum of an artist including their worst material,not to mention a bunch of hit or miss bsides. that is the problem with this box set. disc 4(or is it 5?)consist of all of their mid to late eighties over produced adult top 40 edgeless safe radio friendly stuff.not to mention whoever made the song list forgot \\"downed\\",\\"he's a whore\\"\\"stiff competition\\"\\"california man\\" \\"look out\\" and many more.there were so many songs left off that they could have included instead of that wimpy disc 4!i suggest make your own box set that includes self title,in color,heaven tonight,at budakon and dream police,that is all you need!"},{"rating":"1","title":"otro disco más para los japoneses????????????","review":"primero quiero decir que soy fan de Gilberto Gil.este disco es medio como el de Tokyo, aunque creo que este es peor.el \\"Dia dorium, noite neon\\" es malo pero este es peor.son versiones de temas, pero echos mierda, casi todo es de muy mal gusto.Gilberto pasaba por una muy mala fase,porque este disco no se justifica.seguro que lo obligaron a hacer el disco, y él tuvo que cumplir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the watch and great price!","review":"Got this watch on Amazon on sale for just over $50.

The end of this movie was poorly written and very much against women.

(I know that as a designer, my strong suit is not in fashion sketching like this, never has been- but sometimes you have to.)What this book provides is more of a how to create the bodies you want based off of the 9-head model. For some, this is great- a classroom in the book. For me, who has been working in this field for a long time and I just needed to crank some bodies out without putting in (for me) an excruciating ammount of work, it fell short.Also, the proportions of the bodies are a little strange and the hand placement a bit rough.

There is very little substance to any of the lifestyles of any of the characters.The accounts themselves relate to the famous and not-so-famous, but many of them are questionable as to whether they actually deserve to be in this book as they are may times simple accounts of a person's daily life - chronicling the events that happen to many of us on a daily basis.I summary the stories are too brief and there are other (better) factual books on the real lives and histories behind mathematics and mathematicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"half empty","review":"these cds are meant for a club full of really bad dancers who need the same beat over and over and over again. this double cd is more like one remixed single, with a variety of nice hooks. what is really amazing is that this cd killed drum and bass. i cannot/willnot forgive them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....","review":"I bought this album hearing words like \\"jazzy\\" and \\"innovative\\".

Not one track on the album seems to move anywhere, and very few have any kind of charcter.

Jazz, blues, funk, drum n bass etc are hardly new. I agree with others that it is a little too repetetive and boring at times but hey what isnt these days. Those seeking a bit more jazz and fewer and slower beats might like to check out Bugge Wesseltoft and his equally pompously titled New Conception of Jazz which has real horns, guitars, a wider spread of tempos and is actually rather better than this apart from some iffy treated vocals (but then if it has to be called Drum N Bass to fit your personal lifestyle choice, keep the blinkers on)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a great book!

Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy it quite as much.The author is very cynical and sharply critical of almost EVERYTHING.

I have lost respect for Gerald Posner because of his mission to use the sleight of hand to cast Mr. Perot in the negative. This is not a fair or balanced view of an interesting, complex and heroic man. In a number of cases, where there is a choice to portray an event in either a good or bad light, it appears Mr. Posner always chooses the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"very slanted","review":"This book is very slanted.

This overabundant album version thrives off of the pianist's unique ability to merge his vast playing techniques with the wonderful supporting cast in order to bring us one of his most accessable albums that push more of his piano heavy compositions to the forefront.

With the third track, \\"I Could Not Love You More,\\" the album bogs down into a series of ballads that suggest the Gibb boys are bound for Vegas. Only \\"I Will\\" manages to distinguish itself from the songs that come before and after it. Barry Gibb is using a breathy vocal that ranges from effective to annoying, while Robin's warbling is more pronounced -- and distracting. If the Bee Gees ever manage to produce an entire album free of such vocal affectations, they would probably find themselves back on top of the pop music world -- which is where they belong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flag","review":"This was something my son ordered and I have to say the quality was really good the flag was bright in color.

While the package was neat and shipped from Japan, the flag was folded and contained in an inside plastic wrapper. Unfolding it was another matter-you could tell this is assembly line cutting and sewing-the standard flag pole would only fit one end as the other end was sewn shut and crooked stitching! That top overlay part is read and you can visibly see where the worker cut off the end before proceeding to the next flag - very crooked side, stitching loose and threads hanging. While it was only $4 and free shipping, I would not recommend this flag if you are wanting it for something very special; otherwise, for a lawn flag, it is fine.

It's also great value for money at what is really chump change for everything you get.It's allure is it's broad spectrum covering his phases of art production, but at the same time this also becomes this book's only weakness.

It's good starting point for anyone that would like to get to know his art in detail, and from this book you move on to more specific books that showcase certain areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpected","review":"I ordered this book because I was intrigued by the work I have previously seen by Giger. When I got the book I skimmed through the artwork and some of the reading material. To my dismay, I found quite a few obscene images that are utterly grotesque. Bestiality is a truth of humanity and this is shown in a few of his images. It takes place in the world and I think Giger is the kind of artist that enjoys portraying the evils of our carnal nature. Which I find intriguing in itself. Giger is sick, but don't let the few pages with the hard to accept truths he portrays keep you from purchasing the book. He is still an amazing artist. His pieces are very intriguing and I love his work. There is a lot of beautiful artwork that is not so dirty. Just keep in mind that Giger is a sick puppy and involved in things \\"Christians\\" may not be too fond of. So buy with caution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely obscene.","review":"HR Giger's work is COMPLETELY obscene. Utterly gross imagery that should be screened and labeled as pornographic artistry.

His museum in Gruyere is a scar on the face of Switzerland and a disgrace.

The matches I want to see on here would be the matches he had with Bret since all those matches are classics in my opinion, matches he had with Savage, with Flair in the WWE and WCW. Also if they was going to get people to talk about him they could get Bret and Flair since both of those guys spent more time with Curt then anyone other then Bobby Hennan.

Very little characterization, none of the things I'd expect in a novelization, like getting into their heads to see motivations or feelings. There were a LOT of mistakes with continuity and with editing, even some spelling mistakes! Overall, it was very disappointing.

However, when I heard 3 cuts on the 4 cd \\"Personal Collection\\", I knew it was time to pick up this gem from 1961. Yes, the ballads come off better than the swing numbers (only 4 of the 16 tracks are uptempo). But \\"When My Sugar Walks Down The Street\\" is a terrific number, and anyone who has the Mathis cd \\"Rythmns of Broadway\\"(released 6 months before this album was recorded) knows that John can cook up a storm. Of the ballads, Mr. Riddle was on the money with each one, the standouts include \\"Love Look Away\\", \\"Stairway To The Stars\\" and the gentle \\"Magic Garden\\".

The remake of \\"Alone with you\\" is just lame. No comparison with the original on Bangin'."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outfield review","review":"Big Innings: The Best of the Outfield is an incredible cd. This cd from begining to end is an emotional journey. From carefree songs like \\"My Paradise\\" to more self reflecting songs like \\"Somewhere In America, \\" or just a rock out loud vibe like the classic \\"Your Love\\" take you on a ride. This cd is a great place for someone to start who has just discovered the Outfield. For the fan that has all the Outfield albums except the great hits albums, this compiles all your favorite Outfield songs from begining to end !To all Outfield fans,Keep on Bangin' !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra Innings for the Outfield on This One!","review":"This is truly one of the best albums I have ever listened to! Even the song recorded in mono is a HUGE hit! My favorite '80s band is the Outfield, and this songs has ALL their hits! Great stuff, and a CD I recommend for ANY '80s fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just two good songs...","review":"This band just made the great deal issuing two major hits: \\"Say It Isn't So\\" and \\"Your Love\\".Both songs are included in this album. But beware: Some extra songs and 'new' hits just recorded in Mono. Most of them are just stuffing material... Dissapointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all I thought it would be","review":"I had been on a nostalgic kick listening to my copy of Play Deep I've had since it came out. I was enjoying it so much I thought I'd order this disc to try out some of their tunes.Unfortunately I guess that nostalgia is all the music has that appeals to me, because I can't get into any of their other music. I found the tunes sort of generic. I would recommend to anyone thinking of buying this to try some of the tunes out first or just purchase Play Deep if you're only in it for the memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my needs","review":"I got these to use with my Nook tablet to watch Netflix with, as well as to listen to music on youtube and via Itunes. I love them. They are not super load or anything, but they are neither too quiet. I don't find the boom vibration too powerful or underwhelming either. I plan on listening to meditation music tonight on youtube with it. They are also quite comfortable even though they are a bit big on my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"The cover of the product says \\"hands free phone use\\". But you need a special adapter if you are going to use it with a cordless phone (or most other phone devices). Even then I don't know if it will work because I don't have the special adapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Last Long","review":"It's easy to use and the sound quality is good for its price. However, my ears begin to hurt after 30 minutes because the headsets are uncomfortable.But most importantly, I bought this on July 31st and it stopped functioning properly on October 1st. That means my headset only worked well for the first 2 months!! What's wrong with it? Sound is only coming out of one ear that's the problem. I need to move my wire around and have it at a certain angle just to get sound on both sides of the headset. That's annoying.I don't recommend this product. I recommend you save your money and get one of those expensive $80-100 headsets from brands like Steelseries, Razer, or Logitech. It' well worth it those things last years not months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"one side of the headsets gives broken sound effect. I might received defective piece but It may be the product itself. I am not satisfied with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best head phones ever","review":"My father got these for me years ago and they are by far the best I have ever worn. Even better than my $100 Razr headphones. This is my second time getting this due to a dog who is more like a goat than a dog decided to eat it. But well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"This headset is very nice. The sound quality is great and the headset is perfect for music. I only found one flaw. The headphones are mono not stereo. Meaning the same sound comes out of both speakers. This becomes frustrating when playing a game because you do not know if a sound is coming from left or right. I recommend this headset to anyone looking to buy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset","review":"The headset works great, you definitely need the bass vibration on to get good bass out of the headset. A little on the quiet side, but only an issue when you want your music etc. to be at potentially damaging levels. Pretty comfortable even with long wear times, though not perfect in that regard. Would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caught fire burned my motherboard port aswell","review":"Headset usb caught fire and melted. Ruined my motherboard usb ports and they were suppose to fix it. They never took care of me. Bad company so far"},{"rating":"1","title":"They are ok","review":"Overall, the sound is ok for $25 headphones. I am disappointed with the quality of the bass. There is definitely a lot of bass, if you want to call it that. It is as if they are manufactured to actually produce a 'vibration' on your head and it is annoying. The actual unit vibrates on your head while in 'normal' mode and prepare to be thoroughly annoyed when its in 'max' mode. I have been leaving it in off mode (no amplifier) and it sounds ok; however, when listening to softer music you hear a lot of background noise (noises that I have never heard with other headphones/headsets). Don't buy these expecting to hear any sort of detail in your bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts my ears after 25 minutes of use","review":"This headset is ok but hurts my ears like hell and I'm planing to buy new once just because of that reason. I had fatalitys pro and they where the best I ever had but then again I paid $50.00 for them. I got this headsets for $25.00 and I only hoped that I did spend the extra $25.00 more so I could enjoy the comfortability I had before and not worry about my ears hurting after 25 minutes of use. Would not buy ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect photo of items","review":"The photo of this product (10067953) is not a true representation of what one gets in the kit.The picture suggest one would gets a full body harness, lanyard, D-Ring connector strap and a pouch.Well, there is NO D-Ring connector strap included in this kit and the buckles on the leg strap have been replaced with clips."},{"rating":"2","title":"All dogs need love","review":"This is a great book to introduce to a young child.One great thing about Australian culture (and probably many other cultures) is that we have a great love for dogs.In Mutt Dog we share in Mutt Dog's initial poverty and rejection, we can feel the loneliness and cold of this unwanted canine.It is heart-warming to see Mutt Dog taken in. This is an entertaining story not without a great message for young people.5 stars without hesitation. Woof!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet dog story","review":"This picture book is about a homeless dog who is looking for a place to spend the night. He tries lots of places like a park bench, a cardboard box and under some stairs. Every where he goes he gets told to Go Away! The dog ends up at a homeless shelter. The owner takes pity on him and let him stay for the night. They is not enough food to share with the dog so she sends him on his way the next morning. HE wonders around most of the morning hungry and alone. Then he hears the lady from the shelter calling for him. She takes him home to her own family and they make him their dog.What did you like or not like about the book?The story is very sweet.Would you recommend this book? Why or Why not?We would recommend this to all dog lovers. This is a great story to bring up discussion on homelessness and poverty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookware!","review":"We've had this cookware for 6 months now, and so far we've been very happy with our purchase. The nonstick works great - everything comes off with no effort at all, but you can still get a good sear on items if you need to, which wasn't possible in our other nonstick. I've even burnt things in these pans and it came out like it was nothing! I love that Scanpans are environmentally friendly, and I'm hoping that I'll never have to try out the return policy! So far I've not noticed any nicks on the edges, which typically is the first sign of aging. My only complaint is that the lids can get VERY hot, and with the smaller pans this can make them a little difficult to remove. However, even the lids clean up with little effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SCANPAN NON-STICK COATING COMING OFF","review":"I had a set of Scanpans for a little over two years. The non-stick coating is coming off in all the pans. The problem appears as pinhead sized silver spots where the coating is no longer there. Note that I always used plastic spoons cooked on low heat and washed the pans in the dish washer. Except for this major flaw, I liked the pans. Very little sticks to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure at first","review":"My wife was not sure at first if she liked them but now after 1 month she loves them. Easy to clean and heat evenly, fair price.GOOD DEAL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work with Bosch Induction Cooktop","review":"I had these pans delivered the day before Thanksgiving to be used with my new Bosch induction cooktop. Imagine how freaked out I was when I realized I actually had no pans to cook with for Thanksgiving? I have no idea why it states that they work with induction because they simply do not. The unit would not turn out. I went out and bought a couple of enamel-coated cast-iron pans and it worked like a charm.These pans also seemed extremely lightweight and cheap looking for what they cost - I just don't get it. If you need induction cookware, definitely do not order these. The packaging is pretty involved and I had already unwrapped everthing and washed each individual piece before I realized they wouldn't work and it was a total hassle to re-package them for return."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless guarantee","review":"These are NOT a guaranteed product. I have never used even metal utensils only plastic and wood. They are no longer non stick and they have scratches in the bottom. I have been told by Scanpan that the scratching is NOT covered in their guarantee. Buy T-fal at your discount store. Good nonstick and you can buy 6 for 1 Scanpan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very intense and provocative","review":"Your milage may vary; but I found this movie white-knuckle intense and extremely provocative. There is little danger of giving away the plot; it is not particularly complex. Three stupid, arrogant American teenagers tempt fate by crossing an unguarded gate from Finland to the former USSR, which at the time was very much the USSR and a Very Bad Place for Americans. They make photographs of themselves on the wrong side of the gate. So far so good, but then they get lost and go the wrong way right into the hands of the Russians who mistake them for spies. Some interesting subplots are also happening that keep things moving, that I'll keep a secret for ya. I can promise you one thing: If you are American, after seeing this, you'll salute the flag, think real hard before traveling overseas and I'll bet you never photograph yourself on the wrong side of an international border!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Stupefying and moronic is the most apt description of this waste of celluloid. Though made during the Cold War, its portrayal of Russian people is unfairly mean-spirited and in a review I read elsewhere, it was described as xenophopic. I would go so far as to say it is propagandistic. Its the kind of film which will appeal to today's dumbed-down American who thinks he's a little more special than everyone else in the world and that he has the right to blow up foreign villages and otherwise disregard laws and civil behavior. The idiotic characters justly deserved the punishment they received in this pathetic film."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BAND WOULD MAKE A PERFECT NOVELTY ACT","review":"If this is \\"Alternative's\\" future, than Alternative is dead. This band would be wise to get out of the music business, unless they might consider becoming an Novelty act doing satire like Wierd Al Yankovic. I actually overrated them, because I think they could be great doing comedy, but \\"real music\\"-forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another think we're cool-gotta be like THE BREEDERS band","review":"Now I know why the Alternative music scene is dying, with silly people like this in the music business. Makes me wanna throw-up. I used to be a big fan of the \\"Alternative\\" music scene, but lately I resorted to listening to classic Rock, because I'm bored with the endless Dorky bands that so-called authorities on what's considered \\"cool\\"are pushing. This sort of stuff is what is turning potential fans away from the \\"Indie\\" scene, and causing them to gravitate towards Hip-Hop, and Metal. Where is your passion, ladies? maybe if you actually sat down and listened to some \\"real music\\",your song writing skills, and performance would improve immensely. I look for the day when creative song writing, originality and passionate music returns. until then I'm going retro, and listening to some old Cure, or U2."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BANEL GIRLEY POP","review":"This band is the result of what happens when upper middle class preppie college girls get bored at school and think they have the capacity to put a band together and write songs. I used to be supportive of female oriented bands such as\\" Belly, The Breeders, L7, and Veruca Salt\\", but this stuff is an insult to women who are trying to break into the music business. Velocity Girl at its worst with some Romper Room type stuff thrown in. I've known many female musicians, who could run rings around this band many times. If it were not for the mere fact that they were signed to a major label, this band would have recieved minimal reviews, if any at all. I don't percieve this band to become anything other than a tax right-off, with maybe a very small cult following."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death to Melody Doubling","review":"I have yet to understand why the people who arrange these books feel the need to put the melody in the piano accompaniment, so you have to decide if that bothers you. Usually it isn't difficult to eliminate the melody from what you're playing, but with this particular book I find it quite distracting in a few places.Otherwise, I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll be playing in minutes...","review":"Larson has a knack of writing easy-to-play piano riffs that are a delight to listen to. When I started learning piano, I revelled in playing the songs in this book as some are so simple, yet so beautiful. After very little practice, you will be singing along to these great songs.If you are a fan of Rent, check this out. The recording is great and the music well arranged. From show ballads to rock songs, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"old school","review":"I bought this book because of the book cover and the big font, looks like college books from 80s.

ALL TRACKS ARE RE-RECORDINGS!There are no liner notes on history of band and there are no notes on the circumstances of these re-recordings-such as who did the music and when did they do it.The music isn't bad but I wanted the original recordings!

The music of Osvaldo Fresedo is some of the most romantic one ever played. It is soft, sensuous and has a pleasantly driving yet subdued rhythm.I find it to be great music for listening and for dancing.I'll give this CD four stars instead of five, because the cleanup of those tracks was not done as thourough as some other labals did. But that is just a minor complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticking with traditional litter.","review":"This was one of my \\"I want to be cool and environmental\\" attempts.But it doesn't clump. It doesn't cover. It's hard to scoop. It doesn't conceal odors. It's a pain to clean. I don't know how anyone can use this on a regular basis. And it's so unnatural -- my cat used it, but I'm pretty sure she preferred regular soft litter to the pile of little cylindrical rods that were piled in her litterbox.Worst of all, it doesn't cover odors. At all. Or maybe it does, if your cat doesn't poop. You won't smell urine, until you actually get close to dump it out and the gloppy mess moves. Then it's rancid.On the upside, cats can't kick out piles of litter or track it around the house. And there's no dust (but there's also normal litter with minimal dust). I would never in my right mind buy this again. If you're looking for a natural litter, try Swheat Scoop (it's considerably better than this, but I'll still stick with normal clumping clay litter)."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHEN THE EMPRESS STRUTTED HER STUFF","review":"What this writer would not have given to be able to see Bessie Smith in her prime and in her glory. Bessie is an acquired taste. By that I mean that when listening to her recordings, especially if done in chronological order as here, it takes time until you are emerged in the music. Then you do not want to turn the damn thing off.Bessie Smith was no Billie Holliday. That shows no disrespect for either talent. Although Billie covered a number of Bessie's songs her's is a more stylized rendition for a different, generally more urban and urbane audience, than the juke joints Bessie, unfortunately, had, to play at. That said, for sheer power and depth of raw feeling- go to Bessie. Many a tough situation in my life got, at least partially, smoothed over listening to Bessie by the hour. What else can one say. Stand out songs here are St. Louis Blues and After You've Gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service!","review":"What's not to like?

Produced in 1979, the disco era influenced everything from clothes to dancing to disco-izing other genres of music. In this case, disco got its hand son the musical EVITA.The arrangements are decent. They tend to run a bit long, though. The vocals are a bit weak and don't show much ability in range. It sound like they are all singing in eighth notes. It sounds very choppy.It also tends to sound repetitous. What they could have done was record more songs with shorter time lengths. Then, it wouldn't sound like the song was being worked to death, especially when the entire arrangement tends to be weak in the vocal side.Buy this CD only if you are must have everything EVITA or even Disco.

What's worse is that Samsonite recognizes the problem but only wants to replace the suitcase at a cost, while the newer models clearly have reinforcements in the wheel area demonstrating that this is a design flaw and should be covered by warranty.I agree with the other reviewer that the \\"expandable\\" feature is great and spinners are the way to go.

I see this CD and am surprised to see how many commercial hits there are from when I was a lad. I remember clearly \\"I Want to Be With You Always\\", \\"I Love You a Thousand Ways\\" (at the same time), the classic \\"If You've Got the Money\\", \\"Always Late\\", my mother's favorite \\"Mom and Dad Waltz\\" and \\"Cigarette and Coffee Blues\\" (though I prefer its songwriter Marty Robbins' 1963 version better with, I believe, Owen Bradley on piano). Then down the line was \\"Saginaw, Michigan\\".

Not only did it leave the \\"attractive\\" black as soot band around my finger, one of the rings I ordered (I ordered three for myself, my girlfriend and our \\"gay supporter\\" roomie) was defective in that the band that is supposed to spin, wouldn't budge without great force.

It's very useful in trying to understand what Flash can and can't do and it has a lot of good information about planning a Flash project and what you will need to think about for the final Flash movie file. The only weird thing is that the book is about Flash 5 but it comes with Flash 4 on the CD Rom.

It is true 10 gauge although there is a small plastic tube that runs the length inside each wire in the whole cable. The individual strands are also insulated with cotton type material which was really annoying to take off by hand to ensure maximum current flow. The wires are built like Fort Knox so I used a utility knife to cut through each layer protecting the copper. Once stripped, it fits in perfectly with a nice tight fit and provides good current flow to the subwoofers.

The band rocked our world for thirteen years and their music still rocks. A-Sides are a collection of greatest hits. It features songs like \\"Nothing to Say\\" to my favorite song, \\"The Day I Tried To Live.\\" Soundgarden rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-sides, quite the cleaver title","review":"A-sides is basicly a soundgardens greatest hits. They didn't do to shabby of a job either. As of any greatest hits, they took the best of the best out of the early days of SG and the later days to created a pretty good compilation. But however there are a share of songs on here that I don't particularly like. Songs like jesus christ pose(amd I the only one who does not really care for that song? but it's monotanous rythim get on my nerves like a rusty cheese grader, but people opioins do change over time you never know), ty cobb and bleed together. The rest is beyond good."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of soundgarden","review":"Soundgarden was really the first of the so-called 'grunge' band I can you can. However, their music is really transends that particular time in music. It doesn't really carry that same sort of feeling of being in the early 90s like pearl jam of nirvana. A-Sides is a decent collection of their songs going from their days as an independent band to their last album down on the upside. However, if you buy this and like it, you definetely need to also get badmotorfinger and superunknown which are the band's two best albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundgarden's \\"Greatest Hits\\"?!?! You gotta be kidding me","review":"As a huge Soundgarden fan, I guess the reason I give this \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD 2 stars is because I already own all the albums and there is nothing new here. Which is quite disappointing because there are some pretty awesome Soundgarden B-sides out there, including the dense and brooding \\"Blind Dogs\\" song they did for the \\"Basketball Diaries\\" soundtrack, the bouncy cute rock of \\"She Likes Surprises\\" from the European version of Superunknown, the excellent Devo cover of \\"Girl U Want\\", and the revved-up testosterone-laden \\"Kyle Petty, Son of Richard\\" from the obscure \\"Home Alive\\" CD. It would have been nice to include these rare cuts on a Soundgarden compilation album, the only one you get here is \\"Bleed Together\\" which is nothing to rave about."},{"rating":"1","title":"packs all the fun of radio listening on to one CD","review":"O.K.

(Yep, I lived in a cave during the whole grunge thing.) I recently got into Pearl Jam and Nirvana and had expected the same quality of music from this album -- especially since it purports to be a \\"best of\\". But this band doesn't even come close.

There aren't even any catchy hooks, let alone any hint of true talent on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Information","review":"I have read numerous books on the Native American Medicine Wheel, seeking to understand this Old Way of relating to the Earth and all upon it.This book gives excellent information as well as clear instruction on that subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lost classic tunes","review":"This was the album that launched a number of careers to say nothing of the band SPIRIT itself. Jay Ferguson and JoJo Gunn had a moment in the sun but this was the base for it all. Forget the hit Mr Skin from Dr Sargonagus. You can hear the undercurrent for all the rest in this session. Fresh Garbage is the key to it all. I can't get the tune out of my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit may have never made it out of the '60's or early '70's but this album is a must have!","review":"I believe that this was Spirit's first release (though my memory fades over time) and, if not, close to it. Randy California's brilliant guitar leads, played on an original Danelectro, not less are a perfect compliment to Jay Ferguson's jazzy keyboard style. There has never been another band like Spirit; the closest I can get to it is Steve Winwood's work with and after Traffic and some of his solo stuff. It is in a genre unique unto itself. Again, a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Out Of The Gate","review":"In 1968, when this album was released, I was living in the Phillipines at the time. A friend of mine wrote me and raved about this album and how great it was. Needless to say, the record wasn't available in the Phillipines, and I wouldn't get a copy of it until I moved back to the states in 1969. My freind was right. This record is a gem. The album was still being played at a lot of parties I attended a year and a half after its release. A true touchstone to the late sixties and psychedelia of the times. The band is right on when it comes to playing and harmonies. This album seems to have been lost in the shuffle of great sixties records that came out at the time. My copy was stolen. Rediscover it, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisiting the Good Ol Days","review":"After school, late sixties, Friday night. My buddy and I are upstairs listening to the latest LPs. He whips out this album. Strange cover, a weird kind of mellowness to the music but combined with solid driving jazz grooved guitar riffs, very West coast. Topanga canyon, never heard of it until then, but as the warm distorted flow of the mescaline would start to kick in and the sun was just starting to go down, I watched the world from my own Topanga window. If I listen to this album today, I can almost feel that time again. God I miss the sixties and being a punk experimenting with anything and everything. This album represents an insightful trip into a time that will never come again."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay i guess","review":"the opening riff from Taurus was not stolen from led zeppelin, the openings of both songs are just similar, Spirit even said they could see no influences in \\"Stairway to Heaven\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of the Album Spirit by Spirit","review":"I bought this cd having heard only one of the tracks before and that track was the only good one on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zeppelin Stole Stairway to Heaven!!!","review":"Flat out, the song 'Tarus' IS stairway to Heaven.

He uses both the heating portion and the massage element and LOVES it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heating Pad Does Not Heat","review":"This heating pad was to replace another Sunbeam pad that has provided many years of excellent service.

However, the humming tends to be a bit louder than I expected...so I would advise to keep it on the low setting. As for the heating aspect, it doesn't get hot at all or rather it doesn't produce enough heat (at least) for me and only 1 side heats up. BARELY gets luke warm at BEST.

He says it has helped him so much already and we've only had a couple of days. The vibration changes intervals which helps keep the pain signals scrambled enough to maintain relief.

It was of no use to me at all since I needed it for my lower back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunbeam massage heating pad","review":"After only almost a year of consistent, but infrequent use, the massage portion failed. It was an odd product, anyway, having to emplace in one direction and its massage was variable in output. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not generate much heat","review":"As a heating pad, I give this thing 1 star. It takes forever to warm up to 'maximum', which is a pitiful amount of heat. Even with the cover taken off, heat on 'high', and the pad against my bare skin, it still isn't much warmer than the body heat given off by your average house cat. That might be enough for other reviewers, but not me.As a massage pad, I give it 2.5 stars. Yeah it's loud, but it does feel nice and relives some soreness as long as you are leaning or lying down on it so that it presses into you. Otherwise you won't even feel anything.I'd recommend this pad as a (very) cheap massager if you have some mild back soreness or something. I wanted this thing for heat therapy on my wrists, but the heat isn't nearly high enough to help anything. I guess I'm going back to microwaving a sock full of rice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat and Massage Pad","review":"This is a wonderful product especially for lower back pain and neck pain. I use mine daily and wouldn't be without it. The price on Amazon was lower then I have paid before which was a nice surprise. It has a washable cover and is a must for your pain. Yoiu not only get heat but a 2 speed massager that eases stresses away along with any aches or pains. Great value !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vibration feature isn't worth it; heat is","review":"The heating pads that I normally purchase get tangled, twisted, and essentially out of shape. I don't mind straightening them out once in awhile, but every night, they bunch up behind my back, and I'm a bit tired of having to straighten them out. If I'm particularly sore that day (broken vertebrae), I just don't want to deal with it.Another reviewer had stated that this tends to be fairly firm and less prone to twisting and tangling. So far, that has been the case. It heats up adequately to soothe my aching back, and it doesn't bunch up.I have tried the vibration feature. I really don't think it's that useful (docked a star for it), but I assume that's also what keeps it straighter.All in all, I like it. I recommend it if you're a bit tired of dealing with the standard heating pads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat! Heat!

The internal workings all ended up in a big ball all rolled up when you use it and it heats up for awhile. It also doesn't have enough cushioning covering the vibrating mechanism, and it feels like sitting against something obtrusive all the time. I have back problems so I thought this would help...well, it maybe lasted four months and I see amazon has a one month return policy so I have to see if I can get my money back from the manufacturer. I paid over $25.00 for this and it better last more than four months! The pad had a hot smell and it turned off with both lights on.... it shorted out and a good thing it didn't start on fire. It sure smelled hot. I'll try to return it and tell you if I got my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and not hot","review":"As some of the other reviewers noted, this did not get nearly hot enough.

The pad does not come with a power source, so thats another thing you have to have around or run to radio shack to get, which sort of defeats the purpose of AMAZON. It barely heats up. The cover is only has three snaps, and it doesn't stay on very well. The vibrating mode is OK. Also, as other reviewers have said, it is too small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"I wanted a heating pad for my lower back but also one I could use on my shoulders and neck. This heating pad is okay for the back but not for the shoulders. At first I liked that it was thick and seemed to support my lower back, but after a while that thickness started to bother me. It heats up okay, not crazy about the massage feature and would prefer a soft heating pad without the bulk. I bought two of them and am sorry I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only thinkg like it","review":"This is a replacement.

A minor annoyance is having to use the watch stem to scroll through some of the screens. The biggest drawback is the watch band. When I first opened the watch, I thought they shipped me a female watch by mistake by the width of the band. I later found that Timex considers this a \\"unisex\\" band. The lack of Velcro surface will be a problem in the long run and the rubber keeper added by Timex to resolve this falls on the floor 80% of the time when I take my watch off. If I were to purchase again, I would purchase one of the models with the non-Velcro band. Will probably purchase one of those bands now to make my review 4 3/4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need a new one - they are so helpful","review":"I have owned 7 of the Timex database watches (the first couple were a joint project from Timex and Microsoft and data was transferred by flashing bars on a computer screen).

This page (three actually) is demonic looking and certainly not appropriate for a child. Had this been sold as a Halloween book or something, well, at least you would expect something like that and could avoid purchasing it. In my mind there is absolutely no reason an airplane book needs to include evil images like that and I am debating between sending it back and ripping the inappropriate pages out (about 5 total because of the directions).

Six days after I purchased it, I exchanged it for another because the little switch stopped working. Seven days after that, my wife just took it back because the same switch broke. It's well designed that youngsters can use, but not built for use more than once or twice a week, if that.

I'd go so far as to buy another version of the game - or even pay for a \\"de-censored\\" patch.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Witcher","review":"I ordered this because of all the hype. Had I known I wouldn't be able to get it to run on my Windows 7 laptop, I wouldn't have bothered. After a long install and excitement to play, error after error. I googled up the wazoo looking for solutions and each one I did was for nothing. I followed directions for the driver error fix, yet no change. I uninstalled multiple times, re-installing and starting over with patches, fixes, etc. This game now sits collecting dust because it wasn't in the least bit compatible.

I can not stand the combat, it is for me a game killer. Combat is as follows: left click the mouse, wait 1.0 seconds, left click the mouse, wait 1.0 seconds left click the mouse, wait 1.0 seconds..left click the mouse, crap clicked too soon...left click mouse... oh lets cast a spell, right click the mouse..ect ect. It ruins whatever else maybe good about it. Its a RPG for Dummies, with half baked \\"moral\\" dilemas that everyone raves about, seen them, played them in much better packages, not exactly ground breaking. If you think Fable was a great game, this one will make you happy..If you prefer games like Planescape Torment, I would avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty fun","review":"I played this through chapter 2 and lost interest. There is alot to it and it kept my interest until I realized that some of the quests are outright boring. I really wanted to like this game, but the dialog is boring. The dialog option you get to choose do not flow well with the conversation. The game is very buggy as well. Save a lot because it will crash. There was a part when I just kept going up to this gate and I got some dialog and then the game camera was stuck, I couldn't do anything...I gave up after that. It seems that developers need to fix a few things still as I am playing the newest version. The fun part is the fighting and building your character. The stat tree is kinda cool. Making potions from herbs is cool. I wish they would have made more of a way to blacksmith. You only get to switch between 1 piece of armor. The game is just kinda boring. I bet it was pretty darn cool back in 2007 though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Single Player PC Game I've played","review":"This is the best single player PC Game I've played. I'm now looking for more like it. Storyline is awesome, you can choose 3 different paths; Either with the non-humans, the humans or to be neutral. Lots of bloody swordplay, lots of side-quests, even some adult situations.Only two slight downsides to this game. One, all the nudity is covered up in this version. Uncensored is only available outside of the US (unless you order it from someplace else online, but I love amazon's free shipping so I settled for censored version). And two, you can whip through this game pretty quickly. I did so the first time; then played it a second time using an online quest guide to help me get every side quest done that I might of missed the first time I played. But overall, I'd say it was a very awesome game."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game. wish i had a better video card though.","review":"to sum up,the story,graphics,and rpg facter into an impressive game. right up there with oblivion. i love the adult content that alot of games wimp out on.some of it is downright funny to hear the npc use the f word out of nowhere.the mix of melee combat,alchemy,and magic is very well rounded.the story is very gripping,i continue to plod along to find out what happens next.now for the bad. this game is relativly demanding for your pc's graphic abilities. if your video card is older(like mine is) be prepared to play on bare bones settings.also,dont install the new update for it as it tends to make the game crash during loading screens.which is another slight problem.the game takes forever to save/load.no multiplayer here either.other than that it would get 5 stars.a must have for pc rpg gamers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this game unless your computer is newer than new","review":"I have a Dell XPS 700 Dual Core 2.4 Ghz with 2 GB of RAM, and an NVidia Geoforce 7900 GS.Transitioning zones is painfully slow; I could read up to a chapter of a good book while I wait. Moving in and out of buildings as small as a hut is considered a zone where the system needs to load the zone. The game crashes frequently as well.This was the most money I completely wasted in 2007. I'm sorry I purchased the product.Yes, if some one pays for full shipping, they can freely have the product from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst combat engines ever","review":"If you look at the one and two star reviews you will notice a constant complaint - the combat. It is truly awful, try the demo and see for yourself. It is unlike any other rpg, you have to click at the exact moment when a silly flash happens on the sword, it is based on twitch reflexes and is like an arcade game. Just the combat alone makes this game a must not buy because like in all rpgs, combat is a main focus of the game. Lets just say even the developer knows this design was a total lemon and will be changing it for the witcher 2 (quietly though). Unless you want to be play an arcade style rpg skip this, there are many other rpgs with real depth and good combat mechanics than this available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"If you enjoy aggravation buy this game,enjoy crashing to the desktop ,buy this game. my computer is high-end enough that it runs on high settings but even if i tone it down ,it crashes. customer support?

However, I was unable to play it more than 30 minutes at a time due to it crashing constantly. It would happen when the game was loading a new screen and when I tried to save my progress. My computer specs go above and beyond what is recommended, I have downloaded all of the patches available, I have tried everything under the sun to get this game to work, and yet it STILL crashes. This is now a well known issue and there are tons of people, besides myself, having this problem.If you have Vista wait until they come out with patches that fix this because the game is unplayable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Mistakes Made in thie Release Do not buy","review":"This will be short...but not sweet. This company made a huge effort to create a beautiful game and I think in a large degree they succeeded. But they made a major mistake for the US market. And for the UK and the Germany markets too. They elected to censor their own creation. They cut from the US version and the UK versions aspects of the game that are natural, normal and healthy but in the bizare modern US morality market, we are allowed to see unlimited blood, violence, gore and profanity but not the human form. In the German version they cut the \\"violence\\" but left the human aspect untouched. These are decisions the buyer has the right to make for themselves. They also did not think we read in the USA so we do NOT get a printed manual. And they do not disclose this in any evident manner in the advertising. I do not sadly recomend purchasing this until an honest and open choice is allowed the purchaser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"Maybe it is just that Oblivion set the standard so high for RPG games but I am disappointed with this game. Graphics are only average, the game is pretty linear, combat not that fun, and much to my disappointment I just could not get into it. Maybe you will have a different experience but I would be cautious about spending over fifty bucks for this game like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resource intensive","review":"Has some merits but pales in comparison to Morrowind\\\\Oblivion, Dungeon Siege, Lion Heart, etc. Its obvious the creators have opted for glitz over substance. My suggestion? Save your $55.00 + replay Diablo. Far more fun and satisfying without the obvious performance and technical issues. When the 1.2 patch for this game is about 115 mb's its obvious there are some serious technical flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best RPGs to date","review":"One of the next generations of rpgs, the Witcher delivers all that it promises. Comparable to oblivion but much more story-driven and lacking a true sandbox enviroment.This game is what happens when you turn a great story into a video game. The world is much more mature,rough, and realistic then any other i've played.The story does have a guiding hand throughout it but it is so thoughtful and immersing that you feel like that's what you want or should be doing anyway. The trapping of old stagnant storied rpgs are not present in the Witcher. The game allows you to progress the story to your own tastes and the resolution can be reached in each chapter multiple ways.If you have a decent computer and a fan of rpg/action games, The Witcher is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt, the best RPG ever","review":"I'm a long-time RPG player.Gothic 1 & 2 were my favorite games until now.The Witcher is the most open RPG I've ever played.Every choice, every decision you make affects the game.I never thought there would be a game this fantastic, this all-consuming.Everything about this game was well done by ther developers.The people that did Gothic 3 should have done this well, for that game (Gothic 3) was a total waste of money.I didn't like Oblivion at all. It's way too repetitive. Seems like you're doing the same tired old crap over & over.The Witcher is different, very different.The story, the battles, this game sucks you into a wonderful fantastic world and keeps you there.I've already finished this game and am currently playing it a 2nd time.This game will remain at the top of my favorites list until they come out with \\"The Witcher II\\".Yes, this is truly the best RPG ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing the single most important parts to true crime novels","review":"to even be readable a true crime book needs to contain explicit, detailed, raw description of each and every murder committed.

Not much later Ferlin Husky (most notably) had a hit with \\"A Fallen Star\\". Ned finally got his recognition from the rerelease of \\"From A Jack to A King\\" that he had recorded during the same period as when the others had hits with the songs he had penned. Here you get to hear his version of \\"Dark Moon\\". His \\"Invisible Tears\\" is a cleverly-written, well-performed song also done up instrumentally by Ray Conniff and studio singers the same year. A heart-tugging \\"One Among the Many\\" went unappreciated but Ned still would occasionally have a song hit the charts. He did not like public performances however and reportedly was not well-promoted by record companies when he refused to tour.

Oscar taking Nat Adderly's \\"Work Song\\" and Bobby Timmons \\"Dat Dere\\" put great lyrics to great songs, to this day these gems are being preformed by both singers and instrumentalist.Oscar presented strong social commentary with songs like; \\"Bid Um In\\",\\"Love songs\\", the mournful \\"Rags and Old Iron\\". Moreover, Oscar showcased novelty and humor with Nat \\"King\\" Cole's \\"Straighten Up and Fly Right\\" along with his own \\"Signifyin Monkey\\", and the very funny \\"But I was Cool\\".

Thus far I have been impressed with the radio, but there is one thing that disappointed me about the product.According to the description, this radio comes with a wrap-around carrying case, earphones, a reel-antenna, and a wall-wart transformer. Seemingly, the carrying case is no longer included; as it was one of the selling points, I'm a little disappointed. Hopefully I can get a case in some other way. If not, I'll be returning the radio as a case would have made this travel-able radio more useful.Other than that, this radio is a nice (better sounding) companion to the G6 I bought as an introduction to shortwave listening. There are some noticeable differences in capabilities, but since the smaller radio is almost twice the price I expected that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic body does not support large antenna","review":"As soon as I received this radio I tried it out by turning it on and pulling the built in antenna up.

I used it only one day and it worked well. Then, the next day, the digital readout--which is essential because you need to see the frequencies--started losing some of the lines as if there was low battery power or a short. Going to AC didn't change it. I'd turn the radio on and off two or three times and the digital readout would again work for awhile and then act up again.

I got this radio prior to going to West Africa in the Peace Corps in 2003, and it probably saved my sanity. I played the BBC World Service about 6 hours a day for two years, and only had to replace the first one after I knocked a huge glass of water onto the first one while trying to swat a fly. (That was a very unhappy day.) I still have number two, still travel with it all the time, and use it as my clock-radio at home. I got great reception on the shortwave stations while in Africa, and great FM here in the US. I love the lock feature which saves my batteries when the radio is packed, but agree with another reviewer that the antenna could be improved. The included \\"external\\" antenna seemed to make absolutely no difference most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Radio","review":"I'm an experienced DXer, and own both classic tube analog and full digital receivers, but wanted a shortwave for travel and camping without spending a fortune.

If you look at good quality table saws with metal tables, you will see the marks from the machining operation. After returning this router table, I found a much better one at Lowe's under the Skil brand name for $139."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets my needs","review":"I am a hobbyist and like to do small remodeling projects around the house. This router table seems more than adequate for these needs. It isn't a high-end model or a custom rig that will allow flawless woodcrafting. It does provide a flexible and safe work surface for basic routing. In the end this table matches my woodworking skills and will serve me well as I continue to learn.Pros:Well constructed, flat work surfaceSmall footprintFits a broad range of routersIncludes a nice array of accessories and safety featuresCons:Cheap on/off switchAssembly instructions could be a bit more clearThe tool \\"pocket\\" on the side is pretty much useless as the \\"door\\" pops outIts got a lot of plastic (strong plastic mind you, but still plastic)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped Table","review":"Great value but table top was warped. 1/8 inch out, center to right side. Otherwise, I liked the table so I called Bosch to try to order just a replacement top but no luck. The Bosch rep claimed there is a history of tops damaged in shipping and the defect was not due to manufacturing. The table shipped in the original Bosch packaging, with no additional outer packaging from Amazon. The table weighs about 40 pounds. There was no visible damage to the box or the contents. Too bad because I would have preferred to keep the table. I returned the table with Amazon's typical superb no questions asked return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Dwarf is for me what chicken vindaloo is to Lister","review":"I used to watch Red Dwarf years ago and when I saw it was available on Amazon I had to check it out again.

Series three is one of my personal favourites, every episode is hilarious, in particular 'Marooned' which finds Lister and Rimmer stranded on Starbug and 'Polymorph' which plays out like a comedy version of aliens. There really is nothing bad i can say about this wonderful series (appart from Seasons 7 & 8 of course) and the DVD's are excelent. The extras on offer here include an Original Documentary 'All Change' which features cast and crew interviews. There are also Deleted Scenes, Raw FX Footage, Trailers and of course the Smeg-Ups.

The groove kicks in from the start and goes forever propelled by 2 basses and an array of percussion and drums. There's no really an opening theme. Rather, musical ideas coming from Zawinul and Shorter. The whole piece is played within narrowly defined chord. It is amazing to hear what can be done, what stories can be told with limited number of notes to choose from. This is ultimate modal playing (would make Miles smile). I love the interaction between Joe and Wayne; suggesting simple melodies to each other to expand upon.

It hits perfectly all the hallmarks of Miles Davis' early electric period (In a Silent Way to Bitches Brew) and adds some nice twists along the way. The group had found itself after two interesting but rough albums, and everything works here: a perfect groove where all solos contribute to the whole. After Sweetnighter, they would take a turn toward more composition and less improvisation, and Wayne Shorter evidently started mailing in his work, but this at least was one heck of a record."},{"rating":"2","title":"No JACO but still very good","review":"Miroslav Vitous is fine, but you cn really tell that Jaco Pastorius on bass later pushed these guys to the top.

Non-stop home is particularly painful to listen to.One of the things that makes WR so great was their [later] ability to combine lead breaks within the context of the whole score. This album fails do to that. You have unique players playing instruments and the whole does not gel.

The pace is wrong, the whole thing plods along drudgingly. I had to stop watching it after the first disk, and couldn't bring myself to finish watching it for months. To be fair, the second disk is better than the first, but not by much. And it's not that I just dislike movie adaptations of great books. The film version of Tipping the Velvet is excellent.

They usually impress me with their accuracy and character depiction. This was not the case this time. Not only did they miss the mark on the characters and scramble the sequence of events, they added more sex scenes. Actually, the sex scene in the book was mostly alluded to and was more of an emotional love scene. The movie went for the blow by blow approach, with 2 more scenes that never occured. Furthermore, they left out essential story line information that makes this tale a thriller. If I had not read the book, I still would have found the movie weak and flimsy.

Then, after Dio was no longer in the group, Rainbow became an AOR radio hit band. There are many fine tracks from both sides of the band and the best of both are on this CD. Frankly, I was never terribly impressed by the individual albums of Rainbow and so for me, this CD has everything I would ever want from the band. However, fans of Rainbow (being a divided group themselves) will either hate one or the other half of this CD.

However, the early material from the band with Dio is also legendary. \\"Man On The Silver Mountain\\", \\"Kill The King\\", and \\"Long Live Rock 'N' Roll\\" are among the earlier songs that flat out rock. All of the tracks on this compilation are worth a listen.For anyone who enjoys the classic hard rock of the '70s and early '80s, I strongly encourage you to check out this band if you are unfamiliar with them.

Sean Penn is brilliant in this movie as a young boy who accidentally kills another even younger boy and then gets sent to Juvenile lockup. The move from bottom of the stack rank to the top in the prison is priceless as is the same sulking eyes that we are used to seeing in his more recent movies. The pace of the movie does leave a bit to be desired however and I think they could have cut off about 10 or 15 minutes. That said, the dialogue is great.

And if you're an ELP fan, you'll love Meco's cover of the Jerry Goldsmith Star Trek theme. It's arranged and performed similar to ELP's version of Copelands 'Fanfare for the Common Man'. I had heard this arrangement at a parade once, but had no idea that Meco had done it. He's a genius. Now if I could just find the 45 version of 'Close Encounters' I'd be real happy.

It's a good mystery story and one of my favorites of the series). This book introduced the Amish people to my daughter and made for good discussions after we read a few chapters every night. The series also brings to light how things were \\"back then\\". Telephones with cords, big convertible cars, and a unique vocabulary. I love that we can download the book for immediate reading. My daughter and I pick out the books together and dive right in. The ebook is exactly how the real book is with the illustrations included. My daughter looked forward to the pictures and scrutinized how each one was drawn. More than sharing the reading time, I love the discussions that come from reading these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling!","review":"This is a book that I will never foget because Nancy Drew had bad experience that made this book more interesting.It starts out that she is hexed and some people think she is a WITCH! I reccomend this book to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully Boring","review":"This review concerns the original 1955 edition and the revised 1975 edition which is a shorter version of the original. A search for stolen antique furniture sends Nancy, Bess and George to the Amish country of Pennsylvania. This book was sooooo boring. The mystery was not interesting and typically the \\"exciting\\" chapter endings had little or nothing to do with the mystery. There was a secret connected with one of the pieces of furniture, but you learn so little about it until the end of the book that I just didn't care and when it was revealed it was dull anyway. The end of the book is terrible as the crooks are caught without any help from Nancy. Unless you want to read the entire set, I'd skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOKIN'","review":"this CD has cream-of-the-crop players on it and is a joy to listen to. I have this on vinyl so I won't be blowing [...] on the CD and very few discs are actually worth [...]. If you can find it for a reasonable price then get it. In the meantime I would HIGHLY recommend the TOM CAT disc that Tom put out with the L.A. Express. That has been a favorite of mine for 30 years. And it's got Robben Ford on it!![...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nil Lara--one of my favorites and always great to have more","review":"Nil Lara's first CD is one of my desert island discs.

The semi-acoustic sound helps the mood of the album, and of course, the technical skill of the band is perfect. When it was first released, the band seemed to go into a different phase of style, which was brave and new. The 1999 \\"Mindfields\\" album, intrestingly, went back to the sound of earlier albums. But for me, whatever these guys do, is fantastic. The bad press that Toto always seem to get is simply not justified. Stand out tracks from Tambu: \\"Gift of faith\\", \\"I will remember\\" and \\"The road goes on\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, as usual.","review":"I always look forward to a new Toto album because I know it's going to be good. Tambu is no exception. With Steve Lukather still doing most of the lead vocals, there are some real gems here that belong on anyone's Toto \\"best of\\" collection. \\"Gift of Faith\\" sets the tone for the entire album and \\"Slipped Away\\", \\"Time Is the Enemy\\", and \\"The Road Goes On\\" are all incredible. \\"The Turning Point\\" and \\"I Will Remember\\" are good as well. This is a can't miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toto-Rific","review":"Although not one of their best selling lp's give this one a chance. It is the first offering with simon phillips on drums (after the loss of jeff porcaro),and with Steve (Luke) Lukather handling most of the lead vocals and adding some great guitar riffs this album offers Toto fans something differant. The band is starting to move in a differant direction with this recording and the result will surprise most Toto fans. If you don't already have this one give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tambu -worth the search","review":"I have recently purchased Tambu.Since Jeff Porcaro's unfortunate passing he can't really be replaced but Simon Phillips is certainly as good as it gets. I have always admired this band because they contribute to the music as a band,not just one individual's take on writing lyrics and music. I have all of the band's music except Through The Looking Glass and I just love these guys. Gift Of Faith, Slipped Away,Time Is The Enemy,Drag Him To The Roof and Dave's Gone Skiing, The Road Goes On are very strong tracks. This band will probably never get the credit they are due. Too many people have only heard their ballads on the radio. I have always found that radio hits are not always very representative of the real talent in a band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar Work by Superb Studiomen","review":"Simon Phillips appears on \\"Tambu\\", replacing the long-time drummer Jeff Porcaro (deceased, natural causes), and seems to fit the Toto mold just fine; he also manages to stretch the skins on those drums a bit differently, to make his mark with Toto on this CD.I was very pleased with this CD, enjoying the skillful and slick packaging (made to look like a cheap dime thriller/novel, a la Indiana Jones) as well as the music inside. Toto's sharp licks on keys and guitar are the best in the industry - take a look at any of the other pop stars out there, and you'll see members of Toto listed among the musicians in their liner notes.Favorite songs include:I Will Remember / Slipped Away / If You Belong to Me / Time is the Enemy / Drag Him to the Roof / Dave's Gone Skiing / The Turning PointGood stuff from great guys.Peace Out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the bettter Toto Albums","review":"There are some great moments on this one. \\"Slipped Away\\" is my favorite, and \\"Dave's gone skiing\\" is an instrumental that is (if this is possible) actually kind of funny (there's a second syncopation thing that has an unexpected twist, particularly if you're a musician and have played this genre). I don't know why Toto gets slammed by critics for being technically proficient. I'm going to argue if you're interested in MUSIC in the rock genre, you're going to have to look hard before you find a band better than Toto. If memory serves, this is Simon Phillip's Toto studio album debut, and he plays great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for :)","review":"If you are looking for a light weight and easy to use soft camera pouch for your Lumix GF1.

The Swan is my all-time favourite track, i can listen to this song forever, absolute masterpiece. La Delaissado,Prospero and Quietly Crazy For You, although heavily jazzed up with somehow messy improvisations from Peter Erskine on drums have the same \\"New Age\\" synths that makes the Swan so extra loveable, but the Swan is more organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, No directions","review":"Ordered two of these for a toy box I'd built. The mechanism isn't robust enough to keep the lid from slamming though. Maybe my lid's too heavy. Nonetheless, there were no mesurement instructions as to placement included so I had to guess. Wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book, couldn't put it down","review":"I absolutely loved the way this novel was written, it can be read by anyone, it set a comfortable tone, and is an easy novel to read.

A definiete 5+++ in my books."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is awesome!!!","review":"i found thiis book to be very interesting. this is the first book i actually read. it was almost like it was a real story because it is something a real kid would do. i hope to read more books like this during the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally someone wrote a book for tenagers","review":"I am 16 and in my junior year of highschool. Usually reading books is a drag but rule of the bone was the first book I couldn't put down. I thought that this book was great. It was great of Russel Banks to write this book.THe story was very original and interesting. the whole idea of a troubled teen who runs away from home and finds a leader who is a complete opposite.a black old rastafarian."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was down to earth in today's society","review":"I thought this book dealed with real stories that happen to some kids today.I give Russell Banks a great deal of respect for being able to write from a 14 year old's point of view. It's definately a book that you don't want to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rule of the Bone","review":"I really enjoyed ready the novel , the rule of the bone, by Rusell Banks Being a 15 year old , I can some what relate to Chappie(the main character). This book is a uniquely written story on a period of his life. Along the way you will meet and get to know many interesting and distrubed adolesents and adults.Chappie comes from a somewhat abbusive family.His mother and step-dad are hardly ever home, and they only start worrying about him once he steals. Chappie runs away from home and gets invovled in a motorcycle gang. Through this gang he becomes and drug dealer, and a user himself. The story is very interesting and once you start reading you won't be able to stop.The lanquage that Rusell Banks uses is kind of complex and hard to understand, but it slows you down and lets you enjoy the story more.I would not recommend this novel for children 13 and under."},{"rating":"2","title":"watchout","review":"The main character in Rule of the Bone is a confused boy, Chappie, who falls into many of the cracks in society's sidewalk including theft, illicit drugs, and not understanding his peaceful self. Chappie is a white kid with a Mohawk who sticks himself out but doesn't really want to be noticed. After the muscle-bound biker leader sacrifices his life to rescue Chappie from a fire, Chappie takes on a new identity - Bone. Bone decides to go with the flow. From I-Man Bone learns some true and scary issues about people, nature and doing what you feel is right. Rule of the Bone is an eye-opener for the common American who follows tradition. I believe this book helps determine the identity of your true self as if you were born in a different land than the United Stated and raised as I-Self."},{"rating":"2","title":"a childhood guide","review":"This book, I could relate to, other books I just read. This book has great characters a great book for kids who don't really like reading. It will get them into it I have been reading ever since. I wanted there to be more so now I keep reding hoping to find another great book. Russel banks can touch kids and relayte to them kids can tell an elder or a fake trying to write like a kid. He (Russel Banks)uses slang terms that me and my friends say that when my mom hears she looks at me like were crazy. If you have kids or are one this a great book about an every day kid.

What an adventure. He writes with spirit and so intelligently, once you read fine lit as this you see the rest of popular fiction for what it is. eck. Pick it up. It's smart, funny, If I still had my copy I share some of my favorite lines, I highlighted a bunch for his wit and insight. One of my favorites Russell Banks."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"A friend recommended this book to me, and I can't thank her enough. It's amazing, simply amazing. The characters are original and compelling. Bone's journey is incredible, yet believable. Especially intriguing is how he tries to understand morality as the adults in his life repeatedly let him down. I couldn't put this book down, and when I finished it, I was on an airplane flying home. I was overwhelmed by how much this book affected me. So much so that the man sitting next to me noticed, \\"Wow, you really enjoyed that book, huh?\\" It really is am amazing novel and astonishing in how well Russell Banks captures the voice of a confused, neglected teenage boy. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book... worth the read","review":"I'm going to keep this short, because i'm sure the other 32 current reviews do a great job of comparing to catcher in the rye and such. This book was recommended to me by my english teacher when I first finished catcher, and wanted more. It's definitely a great book, but as someone growing up in the era definied, I found it somewhat cliche at parts. I figure enough years have passed that most people picking it up now wouldn't recognize the cliches, and would enjoy the book for it's great adventure story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank god I go to school","review":"Thank god my school made me read this book. To hear how good it is all ya have to do is read all the reviews above and below this one. This kid strives to become the ONE adult white american who is not compleatly messed up. Rock ON."},{"rating":"1","title":"teenage angst has paid off well","review":"Very repetitious writing, very didactic and simplistic storytelling. The stock \\"abusive stepdad \\" character, the passive ineffectual masochist mother cliche, and a witless reggae junkie yoda mentor all conspire to make a lame, feel-good, \\"Ed Flanders\\" type update of Catcher in the Rye. The book gets two stars though for having this great scene: the main character trashes a yuppie summerhouse only to bum a ride off the very same yuppies, who are vividly described with hilarious vulgarity, and as such this is the only memorable moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story---Incredible writing","review":"You can't really describe this book well enough in a review, but it is excellent. Captures a generation very well. And ANYONE who says the writing is \\"without skill or style\\" should do themselves a favor and stop reading. Banks, who writes all of his books in the first person, has done a truly amazing job taking on the rambling, slang-infused language of a teenage punk. So good---READ IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rule of the bone was a excellent book","review":"Rule of the bone was cool because it dealt with sex, drugs, and a troubled teen. I think every teen should read this book because we can all relate to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the first book I ever finished reading.","review":"I thought that the book was great. It shows you how lucky some kids really are. The way that the author wrote the book was really good. It was easy to relate to it. The author made it seem like Chappie was talking to you. I think that is why it was so easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Wow... this book is unbelievable. I really liked it. It was so easy to read. Written on a teenage level. It is bad. It is just hrd to belieave what this kid Chappie aka Bone does. His adolescent life is crazy and hectic. I dont know how anybody could survive that. it was really interesting and it made me feel really bad for Chappie. His life is so messed up. It is also interesting.

I enjoyed it alot.","review":"\\"Rule of the Bone\\" was a great book.I enjoyed it alot. It teaches a good lesson on life. How you should not abuse kids, because they are very fragile.

He got kicked out of his house for smoking crack and not coming home. In the house he also lives with a gang of bikers. All they do is stay home, drink, do drugs and ride bikes. They were forced to move out of the house because of a fire. A lot of other stuff happened later on in the book. You should read this book to find out about the rest of the book.

Not really understanding why the book is written the way it is. Picked it back up a few days ago and I am a few chapters away from finishing. This little book surprised me! It's very good! From the kid's narrative you get sucked into the story and the characters are so real. I couldn't put this down! And when I did I'd find myself thinking about it. My advice- Don't get turned off by the writing of this book... it's all for the good of the story. <3"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Move along; there's nothing to see here.\\"","review":"After \\"Razor Blade Smile\\" I was ready for more Eileen Daly, but \\"Witchcraft X\\" is about as bad as it gets.

Confusingly, it's sometimes listed as being on Fuel 2000 Records (Allmusic) and other times on Varese Sarabande (Amazon), both with the same cover and songs. And speaking of songs, there's not a clunker in the bunch. There's a mix of stereo and mono versions, but all sound very good. This is not some cheap collection dubbed from Nth generation tapes or LPs. When I'm planning a long drive, this is one of the CDs I look for because I know it'll make an hour fly by. The relatively short length of 52 minutes is the ONLY reason I gave it less than 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"mistitled","review":"The title sounded like a great journey that after, I wish I did not take.

They had me package up the cookbook and send it to the correct recepient and the lady that received my book sent it to me.

Overall, however, the book doesn't GREATLY improve one's understanding. Most collections with pre-Socratic sections provide sufficient background (and sufficiently accessible).This book attempts to go to the next step; however, without an understanding of Greek you're going to have one heck of a time getting the subtleties.

The sound quality alone is gonna blow your mind when you think of that.Mississippi John Hurt is a blues singer, but not a raw edged blues singer, he's got a very soft and easy feel to his music. It's gentle acoustic guitar, and warm vocals that deliver some beautiful, sometimes haunting songs.I would never have stole this from my library if I realized that I could find it for sale. (I guess by now I should realize that you can get just about anything on this peice.) This is a very great CD of early blues/folk that you will enjoy.

His incredibly fluid and smooth playing style is like a steady flow of water. Im also amazed at how one man could create such a sound with a guitar and sing at the same time. This music is also incredibly happy sounding for blues, the lyrics are rather sad, but the pretty way he sings them makes it very sweet sounding. This music reminds me less of the old delta blues (even though thats what it is) but sounds more like music from the hills, almost as if there is a folky feel to it. This is definately a great addition to anybodies blues collection, and i thoroughly suggest anybody who is interested in the blues to check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle and Timeless","review":"Mississippi John Hurt possessed a gentle and timeless voice and guitar playing skill. His guitar work is considered to be some of the greatest, and most complicated, in all of American music, and his voice is immediately soothing to even the savage beast. Songs like \\"Frankie,\\" \\"Ain't No Tellin',\\" and \\"Avalon Blues\\" will surely leave many students of guitar simply breathless. To those who do not play any musical instruments, his flowing guitar technique is still dazzling, and his voice is more \\"homey\\" and \\"likeable\\" than perhaps anyone else's, even the great Louis Armstrong's. As a darling of the Blues/Folk Revival of the 1960s, Hurt often played the Pre-War songs we hear on this disc, and almost just as well as he did back in the old days, one might add. This is a great disc for both the musician and the listener in us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveals the great personality that was Roy Orbison","review":"This video provides a good overview of Orbison's career, with a focus on the end of his career when a number of current-day pop stars played and recorded with him. His almost unearthly ability to use \\"the voice\\" -- to get it right on the first take -- and to write songs that broke every formal model or mode is clear, both in the clips of his performances and in testimony from other musicians. If you have ever enjoyed Roy Orbison, or would like to be turned on to a personality you had no idea was behind his music, you'll enjoy this excellent documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This is a hard find now days...

The sole padding feels just ok but the material they use should be questioned... I dont think its comfortable on the skin at all. And its true the bottom can be slippery coz it's pretty much flat. I don't think it's worth the money. If it was $13 bux I would get an exchange for a bigger size.My questions is why the hell do these companies make sandals that are uncomfortable and charge us what it's to worth???

By the end of the day, your feet will hurt. I have a different pair of flip flops made by Crocs which I bought at a shoe warehouse that have the same thickness but with a much better shock absorption than the Reef sandals. Must have a different composition. As a bonus, the Crocs have tiny knobs on their sandals' foot bed which does make walking in them feel good to the skin, and at the end of the day in those, my feet don't hurt as much as if I'd spent the day in the Reefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts My Arch and Toes","review":"I had yet to find a Reef sandal I didn't like, until this one. The straps of the sandals are attached really far back on the foot bed. So far, that when I walk, it pushes on my arch. I've also noticed that when I walk my toes start to hurt after a while. I don't know if that has anything to do with the way the strap is pushing on my arch or what. I was hoping for more cushion as well. I am really disappointed with this sandal.

This is a very accessible recording, mostly light and upbeat in tone. I was lucky enough to see him perform live many times all thru the 70s and up until a couple of weeks before he died. Sublime.

I also have a set of Serengeti 'Ronan' frames that fit a little less snug also with the polarized Sedona lenses. My next purchase will be 'Piza' frames with polarized drivers lenses (have worn the drivers lenses in the past too). I have been updating for styles and replacing for loss (unfortunately).Serengeti (Bushnell Canada) customer service has also been fantastic. On a set with metal frames one of the screws came loose allowing the lens to fall out (and break). Bushnell replaced the set of glasses no charge.

Unexpectedly she finds herself flung back into the 1860's. I cried with her, and learned a new perspective of the Civil War.

In my opinion, this is true entertainment. Buy it, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted: Likeable Heroine","review":"While the writing is smooth and competent, the plotting and characterizations leave something to be desired. Laura Truitt, apparently intended to be spunky and forthright, comes across as thoughtless, rude and sometimes cruel, often acting like a child with no social graces. The hero, Stuart, is longsuffering and bland to the point of boredom. Laura's search for her daughter was the most compelling part of the book, yet that did not deliver the emotional punch that it should have. Many of the plot elements seemed contrived. That said, Ms. White has great promise and will hopefully attempt something in the future that is more original and borrows less heavily from those who have gone before (namely, Diana Gabaldon and Margaret Mitchell)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.","review":"This book needs a good editor and a more polished author in the worst way! It is not believable, in that Civil War era ladies never swore and no civil war era hero would tolerate profanity of the sort spouted by this crude heroine. Nor are the heroine's interactions with her long lost daughter believable! The writer certainly shows promise, but she has a long way to go. Entire passages of this novel just make the reader wince. I can't believe that the other reader reviews are so enthusiastic. I read an average of one romance novel a day, and this book is NOT a five star effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent intro to Russell's writing","review":"Considering that Russell wrote about almost everything, this provides a lighter introduction to his thinking.Of course, he is not afraid to be controversial.

I purchased this TV last week, and I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase. The picture looks great (especially DVDs through the component video inputs), the sound is way above average for a TV in this range, and the features are equal to what you'd find on pricier brands. Basically, Toshiba gives you the quality you want but without the huge pricetag. One thing made me sad though: only one set of Component Video inputs. So if you want that high quality Xbox experience in addition to DVDs, you'll have to switch it through your receiver (which is what I do). Anyway, great TV and great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice TV, not-so-great delivery","review":"The TV indeed has great sound that more than fills up the room. The picture quality and sharpness are excellent. In close-ups, shadows on people's faces can appear slightly purplish- or greenish-grey, but maybe the color can be adjusted to correct this. Delivery was right on time but it was a nightmare because the one Eagle delivery guy could not possibly uncrate and install the 150-lb. beast all by himself. He was a very nice, very conscientous guy who truly gave it his best effort. The TV is cumbersome to say the least and so front-heavy it literally fell out of the entertainment center once. I'm hoping that's not the cause of the color problems because Amazon doesn't accept returns of TVs over 27\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tube whines","review":"The TV tube buzzed so loud, turning up the volumed only gave me a headache.

In the liner notes, Jules Shear describes the CD as the best of their music. The liner notes also imply poor sales stopped this one from being initially released ... my guess is someone at Columbia simply thought it sucked. Even for a J & PB fan, this is a disappointing legacy.Their first two records (out of print) were so refreshing. This CD feels much more like a major change - for the worst - in musical direction. Not nearly as fresh or lyrically interesting as the first 2 Jules & the Polar Bears records.

As usual though, I'll confine myself to the sound quality of the disks.Once again, extreme dynamic compression and clipping rule the day. I can't say for sure if the damage occurred during the recording, mixing, or mastering (probably all three); but it is constant and it is severe. And it may have been an artistic choice and not something designed merely to create the loudest possible record as these guys are artistes. Regardless, what could have been fantastically dynamic and engaging music instead boarders on noise. Unless you are a fan of Merzbow type assaults and effective dynamic ranges of 3 dB, you'll prolly be reaching for the eject button before finishing the first disk.Thee sound quality really deserve a zero rating, and in my opinion these disks are un-listenable.See wikipedia \\"loudness war\\" for some info, or google 'pleasurize music'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Canceled","review":"Unfortunately, this product has been canceled by Vince McMahon, due to his unwillingness to have anything to do with Randy Savage.

I just finished it for the fourth time and I'm not finished with it at all - I'll re-read it again and again.The best criticism of it came from Lewis himself in his (later-written) introduction on Romanticism, but my two-cents is that some of the conversations and speeches are so erudite that they take a great deal of knowledge to follow the thoughts. That can be a plus - the reader is given plenty to think about. But it can make it slow going. Also, a bit of caricaturing points-of-view grated on me this time.But the characters are fascinating, even startling at times (the gaunt woman who \\"picks clean\\" her environment so as not to let fleshly realities contaminate her!).

Yet this movie contains some mild to moderate VIOLENCE, WHICH MAKES THE APPROPRIATE AGE ABOUT 7-10 YEARS OLD.THERE IS NO REAL STORY OR CHARACTERS: The characters have too much dialogue that doesn't really show their personality. They are hard to relate to (not because they're dinosaurs, but because they're shallow). The wonderful special and visual effects only satisfy for the first 15 minutes.So, as I said, the mild violence mixed with the hollow and childish story make this movie hard to reccomend to almost anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard Edition DVD Won't Play","review":"I had read of problems with the Collector Edition not playing on some DVD players, but the standard edition won't play on my Toshiba SD-2109. This is the only DVD that I haven't been able to play on this player. It can't get past the loading function. Disney is quickly earning a reputation for shoddy quality control, between Dinosaur and the faulty surround sountrack mastering on the standard edition of Tarzan (the left front channel sound was recorded on the left rear channel as well as the left front channel)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD fails to play","review":"I have tried two different copies of this disc. Both have failed to play in my Toshiba SD-3109 and the DVD player in my computer (a Samsung OEM, I think).I would advise everyone to buy another movie rather than gamble on it working in their player."},{"rating":"2","title":"I gave it 4 stars...","review":"because I love the graphics, so real life like.

Great for kids and entertaining for adults!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it. . .","review":"The animation was beautiful. The critters blended in with the real backgrounds and looked like they belonged. I'm sure that Walt Disney would be proud of the new computer animation studio that was built for making this film and future releases. But I thought that the characters and story were lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"It's a wonderful movie. It's great quality and the movie came really fast in the mail. I would purchase from here again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great visuals but problems with DVD...","review":"I purchased the Collector's Edition and it stutters and stops on my Pioneer Elite DV-37 player about every four minutes. I own over 200 DVDs and I have never seen this before. It's incredibly frustrating. I exchanged the DVD and experienced the same problem (possibly even slightly worse).I wonder if others are experiencing this or if there's a difference between the Collector's Edition and the 'normal' one. Disc Two (all of the extras) seems to work fine. I ran it on the DVD player in my PC and it seemed to be fine. If anyone has any ideas, I'd love to hear them.Visually, the movie is stunning. Story wise, it's a \\"Land Before Time\\" kind of story. A little light for a lot of adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, if only it will play...","review":"A good fun, entertainment movie, though it could be too intense for kids under 10 yrs. My 3 yr old son loved it at the movies! 5 stars for content. Minus 4 stars because the \\"Film Facts Fossil Dig\\" (making of) feature on the 2-Disc Collector's Edition stalls the movie both on my PowerDVD software player and my standalone player. I've yet to play the DVD without interruptions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DINOSAUR COLLECTOR'S EDITION IS A RIP OFF...","review":"The movie is fine, but the 2-disc Collector's Set is a scam.

THIS IS ONE NO ONE CAN BE WITHOUT IN THEIR COLLECTION."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a classic but excellent nevertheless.","review":"Many of the previous reviews have already said what I'm writing here. Stunning animation, great sound, weak storyline. My two kids both love it (and, after all, it's them I bought it for. Honest!). The extras on the second disc are well worth the money and will provide much additional pleasure (though, in this case, kids have little interest in director's commentaries and the like).Enjoy the visuals and don't get hung up on the storyline. You'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"This is not a movie for anyone with a vaugely scientific way of thinking. The villain is the one supporting Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection, and the hero is the one opposing it, which was so blatant that my twelve-year-old daughter could point out. Admittedly, the beautiful CGI work is impressive and undoubtably visually pleasing, but there are few other redeeming characteristics. My two kids have always enjoyed Disney animated classics, but they have been of considerably better quality than this.Makes a good gift for a young child, but for few others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful adventure!","review":"As I stated in my review of the soundtrack, I took my family to see this movie the first night it was released. I'll have to say I was wonderfully suprised! From all the ads on TV I almost expected Land Before Time digitalized. But from the opening sequence I was mesmorized. The characters were interesting, the situations were thought-provoking (Well, as much as any \\"dinosaur\\" movie could be), and of course the music was just downright awesome.Probably the only downside of this movie (and it's a small one) is that the plot is a little predictable. Also there are a couple of scenes that could be a little intense for the real young children in the audience. However, that is made up for by the absolutely stunning visual effects and cimematography. The opening sequence is beautifully filmed, and breath-taking. I would strongly recommend this for any family looking for a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY CAPTIVATING VISUALS MIGHT LOSE SOMETHING ON THE SMALL SCREEN","review":"I did not experience any problems like I read in some of the reviews. I did have a problem with one of my older players though, it would have the closed caption on no matter what I selected.

I own over 100 DVDs and they all play except this one. My player can read the supplemental features disc but not the movie disc. Very frustrating!

Very different from their other offerings, but one of their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you see a movie that won't play?","review":"My son and I have tried 3 different copies of this DVD on two differrent DVD players. It won't even boot up on mine, which is a year old. On my son's DVD player, the first two copies booted, then froze up later during play. The third copy wouldn't boot at all. This is absolutely outrageous that Disney would put something like this out. No more Disney movies on DVD for me AT ANY TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"All That Money----","review":"A high quality production, with some truly remarkable effects. The producers of this film have spared no expense in using every single method of creating computer generated cinema. The results are often spectacular.If only they had spent another few dollars on something that in cinema is called a \\"script\\", they might have actually had something. Alas, the effects people won the day, and the film is a crashing bore. Compare this rather drab exercise with Pixar's Toy Story films, and the difference will be readily apparent. There is more life and energy in the first ten minutes of Toy Story 2 than in the entire interminable running time of Dinosaur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting version of the Moses story","review":"OK, maybe I read too much. But a story of a little baby who floats downriver and is adopted, and later leads his people through the desert to freedom (and water) just sounds a little derivative.That said, though, I did like this a lot, for a number of reasons:a) My 2 year old loves it. 'Nuff said.b) The graphics are amazing. This one is worth watching, it's truely impressive.c) The dinosaurs look pretty authentic, and I used to read _way_ too much about them. No brontosaurus in the swamp here! Dinos are fast, smart, and move in a way that makes sense to the eye.d) The meteor that wipes out the Dinosaurs is an AMAZING, absolutely riviting. Perhaps a bit _too_ apocalyptic, but my son seems not bothered, but entranced, by it.e) The movie is not annoying, even the 150th time your kids watch it. You know this is _really_ important.f) My 2 year old loves it.If anything, I'd compare this visually to Final Fantasy, not Land Before Time. It's really worth watching.Indra"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE","review":"We have a grandson that LOVES dinosaurs so this movie is one of his very favorites!Very kid friendly with a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not get this to play on my computer.","review":"While it might be an easy view for someone else, it was not for me.

Seems like there was not enough \\"action\\" for him, not enough silly gags, screaming and bumping around.. Standard good animation notwithstanding, I liked this film for two reasons: cause it's a dinosaur animated film and because it touched on all the things we want our childern to learn, but we ourselves forget: friendship, loyalty, being different, loneliness, heroism, sacrifice, fairness and its opposite.. this film is a wonderful illustration of the basics I want my child to learn / take from home and stand for when he grows up.

One big difference though is that Disney should have spent some time developing characters the audience would care about. My recommendation is to buy the \\"Tarzan\\" video which has a preview of the only good part of \\"Dinosaur\\", as it shows the first five minutes of the movie. That way, you'll not only get \\"Tarzan\\", which is a better movie, but also the only watchable part of \\"Dinosaur\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"We loved this DVD but...","review":"I wanted to say that we love this movie.

The DVD seems to work fine in my Playstation2, but my Toshiba DVD player (about 1.5 years old) doesn't play it properly. It takes up to 30 seconds (which is actually a long time) to navigate between menus, and some features don't even play correctly.

Let us be honest: Walt Disney refused to hire Jews (cf. the history of his actions when he found out Kirk Douglas is a Jew), could not draw, and Disneyland is the summation. Those who would engage in semantic tap-dancing -- \\"family values\\" does not equal valuing families -- and insist Disney Inc. is, somehow, \\"entertainment\\", fail to see the corporate mind-set. DINOSAUR (and I speak as a paleontologist) is typical of the [ethical] bankruptcy (I almost expected Uncle Remus to appear and lead the non-Mesozoic lemurs in a sing-along). Like the [underlying] nuances of MERMAID, DINOSAUR has excellent drawings (best appreciated with the volume off), but little else.

It has lots of bounus material to give you all the details on how these amazing effects were pulled off. Most of the deleted scenes shouldn't have been deleted. The game Aladars adventure had awsome graphics and was good. I think the only big problem with this movie was its numerous scientific errors.

The first Dinosaur attack had him screaming and in tears. I shut the movie off after the big dinosaur looked like he was going to start snapping the heads off the little \\"monkeys\\", and watched the rest after he was in bed.You may want to consider potential nightmares for youngsters (which my son has had for a few nights).

How comforting it was to read about a lifestyle that hasn't changed in hundreds of years. It is somehow comforting to know that there are still places in America where life carries on like this. The book was humerous too, especially if you grew up on a farm. She does a great job of portraying some of the more subtle differences in how the Amish regard money, work and life. This is a terrific read and I would recommend it to anyone. (I can almost see my German-descended grandfather in here - in some ways, he was not too different than the Amish when it came to squeezing a penny.) Anyone who had grandparents who worked the farm, particularly around some of the old German communities, will love this book. It would also be a great book for schools, I think, when the children are studying history and/or different cultures."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting reference, but useless by itself","review":"The book consists of a hodge podge of falsettas. There is nothing \\"progressive\\" about it, and there are no \\"studies\\".

I guess the book can be used as a reference to enrich your guitar pieces that you have learned from some other source, but by itself, it is overwhelming and useless -- you are better off with Juan Martin books.About the book format: it is huge and unwieldy. I saw other reviewers complain about it, but didn't think much of it till I got the book. Since it doesn't have a spiral binding and it is an inch thick, you can't even open it on the sheetmusic stand without breaking the binding.If you can, buy this book 'used' like I did. It's not worth $45. I bought it for $20, and therefore don't mind as much having spend the money on something that I won't use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic information","review":"This book was just what I was hoping it would be.

But I soon found there are a couple fatal flaws and I won't purchase it again. First of all, the openings in the basket are so large that the tines of the forks would stick through them and get lodged in there. It needs to be a finer mesh, but not so fine that particles gather in the bottom. Secondly, like other reviewers, I was dismayed to see the rust forming in the white coating. It is unsightly, so in the garbage it goes. I'm going to look for a stainless one that has smaller holes in it.

My fault for not checking that. We've had it for almost a year and the white coating has peeled off in many spots, allowing the metal underneath to rust. All we ever store in this is a tiny bottle of dish soap and a sponge so it must have been nicked by dishes and utensils in the sink and those tiny nicks got bigger over time. We've gone back to just setting our stuff on the counter next to the sink.

The first part is about Mesopotamian magical texts, while the second one involves questions of divination and curses in the Old Testament.This book is also quite simplistic and does not provide a very deep look at any of these subjects.I would recommend \\"Amulets and Superstitions\\" by Budge as a better coverage of the same material despite the fact that it is a century out of date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not Restored","review":"I am only going to review the print quality; you can read the other review for other useful information. In this case, just as Warner states, this is an unrestored print and it shows. The picture is fuzzy, the sound is awful. It may be partly the way it was originally recorded, but at times the background music annoyingly overwhelms the dialogue. Having an unrestored print with scratchy sound does not help. Worse still, the sound is about 1/2 second or more late to the picture, and out-of-sync sound-to-image is my pet peeve; it pretty much spoils a film for me. I made it all the way through the film, which I actually thought was a pretty interesting movie, particularly the Wheeler and Woolsey stuff, but I can't watch it again. One last thing: during much of the great tap dance scene, Wheeler's legs are cut off, out of the bottom of the frame. Either the director was a moron or this is horrendous print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Key Song Missing","review":"Was anxious to get this old musical as I had heard a lot about it - it has great historical movie value. I received it a year ago, and the print was alright, but missing was \\"The Kinkajou\\", a supposedly hilarious dance number. I had only heard the song on a CD and looked forward to seeing it. I couldn't, because it is not on this Warner Archive DVD. I felt cheated but didn't want to send it back - I had already sent one back which wouldn't play. Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"I loved the first six books in this series, but book seven was slow and The Mark was positively Ho Hum. In fact I only read half of it and put it down. I realized I no longer care about the characters and any good discussion of the book of Revelation and its meaning is either not there anymore or in the second half of the book. I'm way to busy for this to drag on forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Stalling Already","review":"Now I have been an avid fan of these books. I am one of the fans that would wait at the bookstore the day it came out and read the whole book before the sun went down. OVer the past 2 books, however, the stalling has become utterly ridiculous. I used to defend the authors when people would down the books because they believed that the authors main motivation was money. Now I believe them! The series was supposed to be 7 books long and that was apparent in the intial 4 books, but as popularity grows they get slower and slower. No one cares about these no name characters. It's like you wait 6 months for the book to come out because he waits till page 400 (out of 450) to get a plot and a climax going and then he leaves you hanging. Mr. LaHaye you have an obligation to you fans (the ones who keep you on the best sellers list) to write quality novels, not books with a start, garbage in the middle, and a cliff hanger in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why a new reader?","review":"In the first 7 books, there was the same reader, now, with the mark, there is a new reader, which is always a pain in the butt. This new author also tried to imitate the accents of each person. Not fun to listen to. Add to this my opinion these books are nothing but poorly constructed religious porn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God it's getting better again","review":"Ok, finally another good book in this series, the first one and then a bunch of crap in between and now this one. And I say this because with this book....I didn't have to force myself to read it. It actually picks up and is not a repeat of a lot of stuff that happened in the other books. I just hope the rest of the series is as good, maybe then I will be able to finish before the end of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This series of books is really well written and enlightening.

There is alot of background information given on the characters from the previous books. Be patient! Don't quit reading this one!! After they finish with these things, things really start to move about half way through the book. Also, alot of time is spent on what is going on with one of the undercover TribForce characters in the beginning. Hang on folks because this book does start moving and moving great! I had a little bit of a hard time sticking with it but I am glad I did.

The writing is trash, the character development is deploring, and even the story line makes the Great Tribulation seem like a cool and exciting place to be. It won't be! If you become a Christian after the rapture you'll probably be tortured to death. Don't think that the end will simply be \\"off with your head\\" - nice and quick. It'll be painful and horrific. You won't be jetting around the world like you're James Bond - you'll be crawling around on the ground eating dirt to survive. Wake up.

Those who follow these books should sit down and carefully read the New Testament. That contains a message of love and acceptance. The place in the New Testament where Jesus gets angry is in the temple where the money changers are attempting to steal from others. He accepted Mary Magdalen. Did he cast her out and call her a sinner and turn his back on her? No! His is a message of love and acceptance. Those who darken it with fear and judgment should be ashamed of themselves. They call themselves \\"Christians\\" and then spit on what he taught us.Pride goes before the fall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not hit The Mark","review":"I have read all the Left Behind series and anxiously await as each becomes available.

Christian propaganda masquerading as entertainment, the rapture was written for the Hebrews who were enslaved by the Egyptians(or was it the Mesapotamians,OH! who knows and who cares, I live in the present), they were expecting this to happen in their lifetime...it never did! and it never will!, so get over it. Bad writing!...for Mental Pygmies only."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Believer Takes the Mark of the Beast","review":"They went too far in this one. That a believer would willingly take the mark of the beast is not believable and definitely unbiblical. Oh yes they have him fighting in pretense that he is fearful of needles and therefore held down while the mark was forced on him (and they think that will fly). All the character had to do was say a word and he would not have received the Mark therefore by not saying that word he willingly received the Mark of the beast and can not possibly be a true believer but LaHaye wants him in the GC so he ignores the Bible and makes him a believer and a marked man.

I've read enough end time thrillers to offer SOME semblance of appreciation for the genre, but it escapes me how this droning rehash qualifies any more. I quit. And I quit on this note: for all the Apocalyptic novels I've read, there is NONE that delivers the power and the punch of Glen Klier's THE LAST DAY. Anyone who raves about these LEFT BEHIND \\"sermons\\" owes it to themselves to read a QUALITY work of Judgment Day fiction with well crafted characters, plot and suspense. THE LAST DAY presents all of this and more, including a \\"spirituality check\\" that is both provocative and mind opening.

Dispensationalism is what this book series is putting forth (in fiction form) and this belief system has largely been discredited biblically. (see www.prophecybooks.com) The major seminaries don't teach it anymore because it cannot be defended in a biblical and scholarly matter.If you want to learn some truth about God and the last days (or end-times), you won't find it here.

Yes, all this hullaballoo about something that happened in 70 AD. We, as Christians, need to become better scholars of the Bible. We are a horrible witness to the rest of the world. May God have mercy upon us and bring forth the true teachings of the Bible regarding Eschatology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believers resist the Mark","review":"In the latest installment of the Left Behind series, Carpathian has come back to life and is insisting that all people receive his mark. The believers resist and there are several martyrs among them who lose their lives to the guillotines which Carpathian imports for just that purpose. There is one significant convert in this book and the action seems a bit crisper and clearer than in the previous two books. This book is clearly a transition to the time when the Tribulation Force will be dispersed to gather new believers to thwart Carpathian's plans before they disappear so they are not forced to accept the Mark of Satan. Hopefully, the remaining 3 years of the Tribulation will not require 8 more books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Used Book \\"The Mark: The Beast Rules The World","review":"Although I haven't read the book yet, I feel sure it will live up to expectations, being the eighth in the series and I have enjoyed them all so far.

But his interpretation of Nicholi in The Mark is way off. The previous reader (Frank Perone?) gave Nicholi a soft and becoming voice. A voice that was truly beguiling. Muller on the other hand give Nicholi the voice of a count Dracula. yes I kid you not, Count Dracula. And because Nicholi sounds so evil, he become less compeling, less believeable and it makes the tape seem too cartoony.As far as the believer getting the mark. I think as far as this story is concerned I think it may be possbile considering the circumstances that were laid out in this book. However, I don't think any rational reader is going to come away from this book with the conclusion that you can have both. The most likely conclusion, at least mine was, I wonder if a quick beheading is going to hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure marketing...","review":"I absolutely agree with one of the previous reviewer of this book (cdlana from Bishop, CA USA). Although first book in this series was rather slow, next two or three books really kept me up almost all nights reading them. Unfortunately, it took me seven books to realize that this whole series is becoming more and more a clever marketing plot. And it's not just because the authors always leave everything unresolved in the end, forcing readers to look for a next book, but this last one really got me. C'mon guys, in all those previous books you were talking about how important it is to make a choice between accepting or rejecting \\"mark of the beast\\". Bible clearly says there could be no half-way through this, or so you said. Now, here we go. You're actually contradict it in this book #8. All this just to make sure you keep the plot hot and your readers willing to buy another book of yours. Let me tell you, you have just lost one of your readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little activity in this book","review":"Overall, I've enjoyed the Left Behind series.The latest volume, The Mark, falls short. Very little happens here. It can be summed up as: More people are brought to Trib Force HQ. Some believers die. The Beast starts requiring the mark. Three sentences expanded into 400 pages.I'm a Christian. I like the series. But I can't abide seeing the Christian authors milking the Christian public (and others) for all they can. This is the sort of thing that puts Christianity in a bad light."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the last one for me","review":"I really enjoyed the first three Left Behinds. However, the forth one began a slow decent in quality and this one just seems like complete filler material. It seems fairly obvious that these novels could have been finished in a series of six. It's a shame that these books are still just as popular as when the first one came out, especially when there are much better End Times novels that cover the subject more fully and with more intelligence than Left Behind. James Beauseigneur's Christ Clone Trilogy is very good and Brian Caldwell's We All Fall Down is even better, probably the best in the genre. I'd strongly suggest picking up either one of these novels and dropping what has become a very thin attempt at simply making money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mark","review":"It appears that the authors are trying to stretch out the series in order to maximize book sales. I really enjoyed the first few books in the series, but the last few have started to aggravate my interest and are bordering on insulting. I think that they should get on with the story.

I would suggest that teenagers read these ones instead of adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREEDY GREEDY GREEDY","review":"Whether or not you agree with the theology presented in this series you have to admit it is a fantastic premise. However the writing is truly horrendous. I could ignore that but what I cannot ignore is the apparent greed of the authors who are in cahoots with their publishers. Originally this series was supposed be seven books long but when it became a huge hit the publishers asked the writers to expand the series so they could sell even more books and make bigger profits. Personally I don't care how many books they write as long as they tell a good story and keep me entertained. Unfortunately this seems impossible to do. While this book is not as bad as Assassins it isn't much better. It's all filler. Very little happens. Just alot of lecturing. If you took out all the padding the book would be about 50 pages long. Don't waste your money. If you really want to read this book take it out of the library. Learn from my mistake"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alot of Rehash...","review":"My biggest complaint with this and the last 5 books is the repeating of the previous story to catch you up to speed in the present book. If you are reading the 8th novel you in most cases don't need 5 chapters of refreshing your memory of the past 5 books. It seems the authors took a great idea and somewhere in the middle decided to get a little greedy and try to stretch the series out to sell more books. The first 3 years of the tribulation and the rapture were over in less than 3 or 4 books but will the end of the world come, I won't pay 18 bucks a book for the next 20 books to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best by far","review":"I thought that this book was the best by far. The martyrs made me really stop and think, could I do this if I had to? I think this book makes the Tribulation more real and it really hit home. I really took this book personal, and it made me cry. I am glad I won't be here when all these things happen, and have to make these choices. I am really looking forward to the next book. But why do we have to wait so long?"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can see it actually happening!","review":"These books are great for the person that wants to get an easy understanding of Revelations. The one that has never been \\"churched\\". Revelation is hard enough to understand already, so to have books that put it in a way that you can truly see it coming to pass in the world we live in is truly exciting.

I'm glad that La Haye and Jenkins write in a way that is simple not too deep so all can enjoy the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck in a time warp","review":"This book,all 400 hundred pages,was by far the worst written of the series. The authors are dragging out the series with long detailed, boring \\"fillers\\". They know they have us hooked and are trying to gain profit, instead of the true meaning of what the series is supposed to be about. I enjoyed the other 7, but this one was awful. Of course we have to wait another 8 months for the 9th book, and of course I will read it, I am hooked. Also don't buy the video \\"Left Behind\\".

I've never read so many books so fast, didnt get much sleep, but I would finish them overnight and ran and bought the rest of the ones I needed. At this time I'm now reading the Bible and I love it and will not stop reading it. I was a very catholic person, but now after Left Behind I have converted.I'm also reading a amazing book called Once a Catholic, is incredible. I thank both Mr. LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins for opening my eyes. And I think your grammar is excellent! Please harry anb finish the next book, I'm waiting. You guys are my HEROES!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest one yet","review":"This one didn't do it for me. We're hooked, and the authors know that, and it seems this one was almost pure filler. All of the previous books ended with a cliffhanger, but it was a cliffhanger AFTER the climax. This one ends BEFORE the climax, which angers me because I have to wait another 9 months before I can finish this book. There's a difference between writing a series and a very long, single book. I was left very unsatisfied, and I think I'm done with this series for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book really blows you away. Now the Anti-Christ is full in action as he racks havoc and the last three and a half years begin. It's scary and I wouldn't like to be here and thank God I would have been raptured at the beginning of the seven years tribulation period. The Mark is really an awesome thriller and breathtaking, it's very well written: I recommend it very much. Regarding end time events I also enjoyed another excellent new book that deals with the realistic threat of nuclear disaster which is \\"THE CONSULTANT\\" by Alec Donzi."},{"rating":"2","title":"LaHaye & Jenkins don't disappoint","review":"This is a great book. Very action packed with some moments of pure emotion. I used to be a sceptic about this subject, but every mention of the scriptures is right on and accurate. Every time a verse in the Bible would be brought about, I would look it up for myself. Even though this is fiction, the message is for real. I happen to believe every word of the Bible and this book, along with the others, have made the book of Revelation a lot easier to understand. I recommend this book. I couldn't put it down and read it in less than 24 hours. It's very good, just as the others are. I recomment the series to all. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three and a Half Years to Go . . .","review":"We're halfway through the Tribulation and at 44 years-old, I am wondering if I will live long enough to see this series end. If the remainder of the books drag like this one did, there are probably 20 or 30 more to come. At one every nine or so months . . . well, you do the math. I honesty have never read worse.But, yes. I read all the others. Elementary school-level writing, cardboard characters and oh-so-painfully-bad dialog didn't deter me. Somehow, the story kept things moving along and I became addicted. The Mark, however, has no story. Just 300+ pages of filler (mostly dialog) that left me irritated and feeling ripped-off at the end. Skip this one and find something better to do with a rainy afternoon. I promise you won't be missing a thing because truly, nothing happens. Another bomb like The Mark and all future Left Behind installments will be left behind from my reading list.One star for marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best in the Series","review":"This book is a very good book.

Now what is LaHaye going to do now that the earliest known copy of Revelation (late Third Century CE) states the number of the beast as 616 and not 666? Maybe god is mathematically challenged."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book of fiction that too many people take as truth!","review":"It absolutely amazes me that so many people believe what is written in these books, especially this one! If you want to know about the truth about the end of times, read the Bible, it has it all there, with bits and pieces of the information scattered throughout the Bible. When this book showed the man getting the Mark of the Beast EVEN though he was a Christian and that he would still be saved, that was the biggest eye-opener of all that this book was full of lies. The Bible says that ANYONE who receives the mark will not get to heaven. You are either for God through Jesus OR you are for Satan, there is no compromising. You cannot deny your belief in Jesus and expect to get to heaven. These are dangerous books for Christians to read because they are full of hidden agendas. I cannot recommend even as a book of fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already...!","review":"I've read them all so far and had started to find them redundant and simplistic. This one put me over the top. Enough already. Get to the point. PLEASE don't write another 4 books to get to the end. I'm really disappointed. What started out as fascinating has been turned into something dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am shocked that the authors would dare publish such a sad excuse for a novel. I was a believer in Christ long before picking up the first book in the series, and I was quite moved with the first several books. However, it has become clear to me that the authors are simply looking for excuses to fatten their wallets and extend a book series to what will eventually be 12 books according to their web site. NOTHING happened in this book!! With the exception of Hattie's transformation there was no signinificant character development or advancements in the plot. I have lost a lot of respect for Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book 8??? How about shameless salesmanship?","review":"I agree with an earlier reviewer in that I bought the book because I had been hooked into the series. It soon became clear that Book 8 is a shameless shell that acts only as a bridge, or leader, into subsequent books.I'll read the rest of the series; however, the authors can rest assured that I'll cost share with other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"All about the Money","review":"I agree with Frank from Raleigh. This has become all about making yet more money for Tim LaHaye and nothing about telling the story of the end times. If Mr. LaHaye really cared whether or not people were educated about the end times, he would not be telling this story in what looks like it's going to be about 18 books. The story is fictionalized of course, and with a common pre-trib viewpoint that has been expressed by many others and is not the result of any original research by Mr. LaHaye. It looks like he is just interested in making money by slapping his name on yet another book. He even slaps his name ACROSS the top of a BIBLE and calls it the Tim LaHaye Prophecy Bible. It gives me the creeps. He puts his name before any others on the TOP OF A BIBLE. Is it all about money? You bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Usual","review":"When first introduced to the Left Behind series I completed the first seven books in approximately 10 days. I found them to be compelling, exciting and thourally enjoyable. I was so looking forward to #8 and literally was at the store as soon as it opened to purchase the book. I am very disappointed in The Mark. It is very slow moving, there seems to be no character development or growth. It was easy to put down and was definitely not the \\"compelling read\\" that I had so previously enjoyed. Of course I am not sorry that I read it and probably would recommend it to left behind readers however it is disappointing. I hope that more character development and story line development are in future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christ Clone is a lot better!","review":"I kept reading Left Behind hoping it would get better. It didn't. I also read (actually started reading) We All Fall Down, but there the foul language was SO EXCESSIVE I couldn't keep going. Finally I read the books of The Christ Clone Trilogy (why do I feel like Goldilocks here?) and it was \\"just right!\\" Actually it was GREAT! So if you're tired of Buck and Rayford playing James Bond, and all the females in the LB world cooing, have a look at The Christ Clone Trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like The Books","review":"I have read the whole series and am waiting for the next one. I'm sure that there is more than one instsnce in the books that are not wholly biblical, but almost all books written are just a little different than the original. It does not say that these books are absolutely and unequivocubly right. They are fiction and are supposed to be a guideline of what will one day happen as written in the bible. This is their interpretation of how it could happen.Just as movies are changed from the books and you will find discrepancies in them so will you find some in thes books but they are very good reading and easy to read and it might give some people some insight as to what will happen. They are easier to understand for most people than the Bible. If by witing these books these men make lots of money so be it and if these books can lead one soul(or more, hopefully) then they will have done a great job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read a real Christian writer","review":"Dig up some old C.S.

Who let her into this special? They ought to be fired twice.It was Ab Fab in search of actual gags... horrible. Most everything flopped. Like at least one reviewer mentioned, Mo Gaffney is actually funny in this special (which is a pleasant surprise). Of course, Jane Horrocks as Bubble is fairly good, and she's just as good in her other appearance. ;)To be fair, most people are going to get this for \\"The Last Shout\\"... and that's worth the price BBC/WB asks for, but it's still not as good as the good old days. Perhaps it's on par with series 4.Buy it if you must, but shake your fist in complaint because \\"In New York/Gay\\" is some of the worst drivel produced for television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great accessory for the iPod","review":"I thought that this product worked very well for what I intended it to work for.

However, it would lock up transferring from the camera after a random number of images (sometimes 60, sometimes 200). Tried it with multiple ipods and multiple cameras, including HPs and other on the support list -- no combination worked reliably. So, I sent it back, and had a photo store burn me dvds of my gigabytes of information instead, in about a half-hour, so then I could fill the cards up again. That was my alternative, as this didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great if you think ahead","review":"we are using this on vaction and so far it fine...we charge the ipod before going to dinner and transfer the photos while relaxing before bed.

DO NOT think of using this for any real photography purposes or with pictures above 3MP in size. To transfer 1gb Sandisk II ultra CF card takes roughly 45 minutes, and kills almost all your Ipod's battery (not to mention the impact on your cameras battery for that 45 minutes).Its a great idea, but the ipod battery is not originally engineered to support such a power supply, and does not stand up to heat...Look elsewhere for a portable harddrive to store pictures, such as Epson P-2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for traveling","review":"I own a Canon Digital Rebel XT and transfered 124 photos, 8 Megapixels ea. to my iPod in around 10 minues.

Plug it into the iPod, then connect a USB cable and insert the small end into your camera (I use a 60Gb iPod Photo and a Nikon D200). The iPod immediately senses the memory card inside the camera and asks if you want to import the pictures on it. With my hardware, it takes a little under 15 minutes to transfer 100 JPEGs (photos taken with large, superfine settings on a 10 megapixel camera, so each file is roughly 3 to 4 Mb). Easy backup without a computer. Great for piece of mind after long location shoots and on vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convient, bring extra batteries.","review":"This works well, allows you to view imported photos, but it is a slow proccess best left for the hotel room.

Best are the Colombian drug lord and the NBA star, though all are pretty entertaining. Naturally, getting his wishes granted turns into a nightmare. The fun is seeing just how much of a nightmare. Watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!","review":"This is my favorite movie of all time and I have seen a lot of movies.I can watch this one over and over and over and it still makes me laugh everytime. I think this is Brandon Fraiser's best comedy role, he is soo good at every character he plays in this. He is hilarious! I love this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked the commercials, you'll like the movie","review":"This movie is what it claims to be. It's a funny, simple film about a guy wishing to be what he thinks will make him happy. This comes with a good, old fashioned lesson about being who we are and all that..... I would have given this film a 3, but the incredible performances of both Fraser (Encino Man, Gods and Monsters) and Hurley (Austin Powers, Permanent Midnight) make me really like this movie.Fraser is perfect as the lovable loser Elliot. His geeky personality is painful to watch and makes you route for some intervention, even the devil. When his wishes take turns for the worse is when Fraser is really showing a lot of comedic talent. He ability to show the different personas with the changes is great fun.Hurley is as about as sexy as the devil can be. She makes all the horrible things she does seem a little more fun. You may want to own this one. It's worth having for when you have friends over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rates the same as Mannequin","review":"I give it 2 1/2 stars because it has some redeeming, feel good things going on at the end. About the same as another goofball teen flick set in San Francisco with the sexy female who engages in sexy play acting with the goofy male lead, and does magical things - Mannequin. So if you think Mannequin is great, then you'll love this. Switcher, you are one sick puppy!The plot is somewhat similar to the original 1967 Bedazzled (which I would rate at 4 stars), but without the witty, funny dialog. And without Peter Cook's thought-provoking theological musings, or Dudley Moore's whimsical musical scoring. So the newer version of Bedazzled resembles the original in title only. And there's a big difference between a goofball teen flick and a classic witty black comedy. It's sort of like Stripes made up to follow the same plot as Dr. Strangelove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devilish fun...","review":"The Devil in a totally different dimension! Liz Hurley plays an excellent and extremely goodlooking Devil who is out to get Elliot's (Brendan Fraser's) soul. In return for his soul, Elliot, a lonely work-aholic, gets 7 wishes.Unexpected and funny twists make the movie well worth seeing. Elliot's main aim in the movie is to be loved by the woman of his dreams, Alison. However, in every one of his wishes, the Devil tries to mess things up and Elliot ends up being a number of charcters. (Eg: drug lord, NBA star and emotionally sensitive person)If you're up for a laugh and some excellent acting, watch the movie. I have seen it several times and every time it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is a hoot!","review":"I just finished watching this movie and it laughted so hard I cried. The scene where Frazer plays a sports hero is an absolute classic. The scene is worthy of an Oscar, even though hell might actually freeze over before this could be contemplated. Brendan Frazer is absolutely brilliant and this movie allows him to demonstrate some of his ability as an actor. I only hope he had as much fun playing the parts as I had watching them. Elizabeth Hurley played her part to the hilt and I couldn't imagine a more tempting Devil. My only regret? That I wasted money renting the DVD. Buy it and enjoy the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth to buy","review":"A movie full of nonsense... Bad scenario, bad acting... I dont think that this movie gives anything to the viewers even a smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass...","review":"Maybe it was just me, but I didn't find this very amusing or interesting for that matter...perhaps unlike others I don't find Liz Hurley all that... The premise of the movie is the lonely loser meets the devil and she gives him 7 wishes...Ya ok, believeable... The humorous parts weren't that funny...and I think they could have picked a better loser than Brendan Fraser..although I think Liz Hurley played her part to a T... I wouldn't recommend this film unless you like sappy lightweight humor movies..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The great message hidden in this movie","review":"I love how this movie has a good underlying message but it is not pushy. Whith the black guy as an angel and his little conversation with Elliot. The only thing I didn't like was the fact the angel was smoking and swore, but it brought him more down to earth. Bredon Fraser is perfect for the part with his boyish good looks and ability to be dashingly good looking or a bashful underdog."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: Funny!","review":"If you have any kind of sense of humor this movie is hilarious. Especially the first 4 wishes he makes. The funniest being when he is a professional basketball player. The color commentator is hilarious with his calls. He is like an uneducated version of Walt Frazier, mixing up all his words. (e.g. Breaking the backboard on the glass). The after game interview is so funny. Elliot is a good basketball player but he is dumb as an ox (actually that's putting down the ox.) The reporter Bob Bob asks him questions about \\"The sheer virtuosity of the performance of this magnitude\\" and Elliot's answers are all redundant like \\"Well you know there is no 'I' in the word team\\" and \\"You know you go out there and give 110%\\". He ends the post game interview by shouting \\"Diablos yeahhh number 1!\\" while pointing 2 fingers at the camera.This is one example of the hilariousness of this movie.Rent it and then buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH!!","review":"I watched this movie last night, and it was TERRIBLE! The jokes are not funny (you can see them being set up a mile a way), the dialogue is terrible, and the acting is even worse. I actually turned it off about 3/4 of the way through, as I was just so bored I couldn't even finish it. In fact, I think the only reason I made it 3/4 of the way through was because Elizabeth Hurley looks great! Otherwise, pass on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so bedazzling","review":"I wasn't a big fan of the movie. I thought it was stupid. Ben Frazier wasn't that great and Elizabeth Hurley wasn't any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't laugh once","review":"This movie is bland and humorless. It should be avoided as if it were contaminated with the bubonic plague. I honestly can't believe I watched the entire thing. It must have been the confusion from all the wonderful reviews I read. Sure Hurley plays a beautiful seductress, but there needed to be more to the movie than just a beautiful body."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of Brendan Fraser","review":"I love Brendan Fraser, but even MonkeyBone was better than this one. I didn't even laugh. A very predictable movie that just does not hit the spot. Sorry Brendan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable cheese","review":"I bought this movie the day it came out because I enjoyed it profusely when I saw it in the theatres. Sure, it didn't have me rolling on the floor with laughter at any point during the film, and mostly all I got was a smirk on most of the jokes. Still, I found it enjoyable because of Hurley and O'Connor as Fraser's wannabe girlfriend. Hurley plays Satan as if she were a naughty girl stuck in an eternal job who gets her kicks by mucking up people's lives in little ways (such as snapping parking meters due). If you enjoy cheesy films, and cheeky female power figures, I say go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Devil Of A Good Time!*","review":"A movie just to watch for fun.It is fun to see how having what you really want may not be worth it.Just see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smiles only, no laughs.","review":"Can\`t understand why many people rate this movie as one of the year\`s best...It\`s a so, so comedy, not with too many laughs. One that\`ll keep you tuned on cable TV, but I doubt you\`l watch it again and again on your DVD.Video transfer is very good, sound also, using the surround speakers and sub channel very well.Elizabeth Hurley and Brendan Fraser seem to be doing something while they had nothing else to do. Their acting is a passtime. So is this movie.If you\`re a fan of Hurley, she\`s better and sexier on Austin Powers. If you\`re a fan of Fraser, look for The Mummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Befuddled....","review":"This was a horrid injustice! They should have NEVER been given the rights to trample on this brilliant original film.It used to mean something when you met another person who had seen Bedazzled. Now I'm forced to whisper when talking about it in public, as most people have only seen this terrible re-make. When I last raved about the original BEDAZZLED in a coffee shop, I was met with looks of confusion. And we all know why...I kept blowing the Raspberry all through this re-make, in hopes a resurrected Peter Cook would show up & make it stop. I must be all out of wishes, but if I had one left, I would have wished this re-make had NEVER been made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give It A Chance","review":"Ok..so it isn't Mrs. Doubtfire or Scary Movie, but it has something, or should I say someone, Mr. Fraser. If you read the other critiques, you'll know the basic plot: Man wants woman and sells his soul for seven wishes which get twisted by beautiful person known as Satan.I don't think I could suggest that you purchase this movie unless you are a true blue fan of any of the actors/actresses or the director. The players played a good game with some geeky dialogue. HOWEVER, I feel Mr. Fraser did an outstanding job playing seven different \\"characters\\" within one film (if Eddie Murphy can receive credit for doing this, why shouldn't Brendan???)Rent it just to see if you like it. My friend was rather pleased when we saw it in the theatre. He thought he would hate it. Let me state this final thought, though, if you enjoy Brendan Fraser in other films, you must see him in \\"Gods and Monsters.\\" He aptly shows his acting ability in this film without flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny...but....","review":"The movie Bedazzled is quite funny.It's pretty much drags on till Elizabeth Hurly comes in as the Devil.All the wishes are funny.I give it four stars because it could ahve been a tad better and the beginnging's not too good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bredan Fraser Is Flat Out Funny","review":"Sure Brendan Fraser has a history of wacky comedic roles, but he seems to enjoy doing them. Most of his comedies are too silly or off the wall, but this one was great. Not comparing it with the original Bedazzled movie, this movie made laugh like no other. Brendan does a great job portraying all of his characters that he goes through in this movie. With comedic support from Elizabeth Hurley, Frances O'Connor Orlando Jones and others the movie keeps the energy all the way through. This movie played like a great Saturday Night Live episode with Brendan Fraser as host. Every actor and actress played different roles for each wish that he made. Example: When Elliot (Brendan Frasier) was a Columbia Drug Dealer, Orlando Jones was one of his hench men. When Elliot was a famous basketball player, Orlando was a sports commentator, etc. etc. All and all, great fun!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Liz is Hot!","review":"Liz is incredible, and I'll never understand why she was with that phony Hugh. Try to sit through the original version of Bedazzled and you'll appreciate her presence. No one's looked this hot since Jane Fonda in 'Barbarella' and now Jennifer Love Hewitt in 'Heartbreakers.' Two warnings: the scenes where she is in a French Maid's outfit and where she has a snake around her in a bikini, from the previews, are unfortunately missing from the movie or the extras. The most it shows are flashes of those scenes during interviews. This big disappointment makes it a better rental than purchase. Hopefully the DVD of 'Heartbreakers' will include the scene with Jen on the treadmill, which is also noticeably missing from that movie. Don't make the same mistake this DVD made."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated film","review":"Ok, this is not as great as the original version starring Dudley Moore, and Peter Cook. But, it is quite good, and it has some truly laugh out loud moments. Liz Hurley is is fine form, literally, and Brendan Fraser is his usual loveable jovial klutzy self. The whole scenario when Elliot is the worlds most sensitive man is brilliant. Reminds me of this kid i went to high school with. Dont' listen to the negative reviews of this movie. Yes, This movie wont have any profound influence on your life, but for 2 hours time you'll have a good laugh. Cheers!1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bewitched by Bedazzled","review":"I wanted to say how much I enjoyed this film. Elizabeth Hurley and Brendan Fraser were wonderful together. The movie was funny and get me on my toes! Fraser plays a nerd who is granted 7 wishes by the Devil (Hurley). Each wish was entertaining and some were downright hilarious.The thing that stuck out for me was the moral principles being explained throughtout the movie. They added substance and character depth. This is one movie I would recommend for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny movie","review":"Enjoyed the movie which was surprisingly entertaining.

I guess Hurley is the current version of Raquel Welch & lord knows you sure can tell she's trying hard to seem sexy, which is not the same as being sexy. Amazing, too, how badly Frances O'Connor comes off in this, the way she's photographed & the unsympathetic way her part is written. This movie blatantly treats women like dislikable discardable objects, to put it politely. Another Hollywood clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz","review":"Snore feast!

This movie is not entertaining flat out. One: The story has been done to death. This version does put more comedy into it but not enough to talk about. Two: All the best parts were on the preview. I know it's a cliche' but it's true if you watched the preview there is no need to see the movie , other then to waste an hour and a hlf of your life.

Offensive, completely un-necessary, repulsive, juvenile, annoying... The list goes on and on. It completely ruined the possibility of me continuing to watch this movie. I'm a young, educated woman. I don't want to hear that ridiculous mess. It is a turn off and absolutely ruins the movie-watching experience for me. What a waste of good talent when the writers/director/producers can't or aren't willing to come up with anything more educated than having the actors say \\"F*F*F*F*F*F*F*F*F*\\" repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better date movies","review":"This one has a nice pace. I was drawn in from the start. The tale is Wall Street meets Friends meets When Harry Met Sally, sort of. I wasn't familiar with these young Hollywood stars and starlets.

These covers do nothing to re-interpret the emotion and effect of Depeche Mode.

I have nearly every DM album and this tribute fell far short of anything (you will agree with merely a 30-second sample).Listen, all is not evil.

He is a whiney, selfish, self centered, un-clever Hawkeye Pierce from MASH, and since he is the narrator, he is in every page and every sentence.

They show off this player's capabilities much better! The bass doesn't need an artificial boost and the sound is clear and detailed.

This little known underground classic from Paul Bartel (my he rest in peace !)contains some very odd perfomances and really bizarre ideas (I won't tell you more !). It is one of the few films were the viewer is so much involved into the story that one cannot tell anymore what's real or just imagination. So along with the main character we explore this fantastic and almost surreal world together. A real sleeper and definitely worth a look !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Write-By-Numbers","review":"I enjoyed the three earlier Betty Trenka mysteries, but this one was plodding, uninspired. A big problem is that of the Obvious Villain. Where, exactly, is the mystery? Moreover, it struck me as implausible that parents allowed their children to hang out with that very odd couple 15 years older. Not one parent put a foot down? The really interesting twist was in the development of a neighbor's personality--one who turns out to be a lot less insightful than he's been portrayed to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Word: Blah","review":"A very bland tale.

The DVD has poor NTSC conversion (meaning, it will look BAD on higher end TVs) because you can't do proper conversions of dvds from HK without the original materials. And bootleggars of course don't have original materials. If you want to support boots, and make sure that the U.S. continues to get very few quality kung fu releases, buy the DVD. IF you want to see the films, and not ruin their chances of being picked up here so all the US can see them properly, just get a region free player and buy the actual discs these guys copy.

I even attended group therapy for my anxiety. Sleep was a thing of the past... and if I did happen to fall asleep, I was awakened by screaming panic attacks. I needed help badly. My life was on a downhill spiral. Among the many books I read, QR The Quieting Relfex was the ONLY one that proved helpful. It is clearly written, quick to adapt and it became my 'bible.'

Cheap-lounge-singer-who-can't-afford-a-piano bad. That train wreck of track sets exactly the worst tone, destroying the mood for the rest of the album. If it weren't for some of the later selections from La Bohème and L'Elisir d'Amore, this CD would be a total loss. Even then, these gems are completely drowned in a gushing flow of treacly Italian \\"classics\\" apparently aimed at a certain demographic of blue-haired, tittering Pavarotti fans.

Yeah, I got lots of background stories about Lena and the people around her, but I rarely caught a glimpse of who she was as a person during the situation she was going through in the present. I only knew how others perceived her due to the copious amount of descriptions that Ansa provided. I stopped reading the book about halfway through.

I thought I would never finish reading about how good of a dresser Lena was or how perfect the tiles in here bathroom were laid. The time spent on writing this stuff should have been spent on the PLOT of the book. It took too DAMN long for Herman to even appear! I was extremely bored with this book.

I haven't read any of Ansa's other books, and this one makes me not want to. This book could of easily been 200 pages less than what it was and had a chance to be interesting.

She has the best of everything that a successful and generous woman could want - except a good man. Unbeknownst to her, her special powers summon up Herman, a man perfect in every way, except one ... he's a ghost.

It's a hilarious and touching race through independence, passion, love, loss, and back to independence and contentment. This one was really hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waist your money or time!","review":"I always said, that if the first 25 pages of a book don't keep me interested, then it isn't worth reading. This book was hard to figure out. The author spends too much time on describing the designer clothing that Lena McPherson wears and the fancy estate in which she lives.

I expected more out of Mrs. McElroy-Ansa and she fell short on this one. I should have had a clue with the way Baby of the Family ended. Unless you like long winded books that takes more than 100 pages to get to the meat of the story, spend your money on another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!","review":"I am a huge fan of Mrs. McElroy Ansa's works.

Like Baby of the Family, this book was rich in detail and speech. However, in Hand, I kept waiting for something to happen to Lena, the main character. Sure, she summons up a ghost and has lots of sex and love. The problem is, everytime the story started to move forward and show a little conflict (a female ghost rival, an angry town that feels forgotten by Lena), the conflict is resolved far too easily. The book encourages us to stop concentrating on the material and enjoy life as Lena learned to do, but it was hard for me to identify with a woman who can stop working with no financial impact on her or her lifestyle (huge piece of land, beautiful house, nice clothes, horses, top-notch car, etc.) I think Lena's in an far easier position to drop it all than most of us and her transformation was uninspiring. I'd put this one at the bottom of the three Ansa books."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many descriptions -","review":"I know some books take some time to develop and i enjoy lengthy descriptions, but unfortunately every page is a lengthy description of every possible thing.

Some of the information is clever and useful, such as different types of shelter, navigating by the sun and stars, and a fairly extensive list of edible plants (black and white drawings only but still pretty accurate ones), but other information is very outdated, most notably some of the information on reptiles and fish. For example, treating a snakebite by cutting the skin and sucking out the poison - NOT a good idea, and will cause more tissue damage than benefit! Also, the idea that barracuda are aggressive fish that attack without warning or provocation... some of this stuff is straight out of a B-movie. Still, not a bad place to start if you're a novice and want to learn what dangers to watch for in the woods, and it's pretty cheap (free online if Google \\"FM 21-76\\").

This is correct and caused the instructions not to work for me, but this doesn't mean it can't be installed. Install the first outlet over where you want to car to stop. Install the third outlet on the garage door, but tie a knot that's easily undone. Don't install the second outlet yet. Just hold it in place. If things don't work, just move the second outlet forward or back until it does. You may also have to undo the knot on the eyelet on the garage door and add or remove slack.

They could have had a few special features on the DVD release (interviews, poster concepts, trailers, etc.)The movie's premise is excellent, the plot excellent, they used a lot of the necessarycharacters from the three universes, the action was strong, and they combined the universesin a great way!

I suppose they figured that the story didn't necessarily have to make sense as long as it was fun. Eight-year-old me was entertained so it's hard to argue with the thinking.Still, shows like Batman the Animated Series elevated the quality of a lot of kids shows. Sure there will always be some garbage but overall I think the modern takes on 80s properties are huge improvements.This movie plays with that. My exposure to the modern TMNT cartoon is pretty limited but it looks pretty impressive. It also seems to take itself VERY seriously for a show about giant talking humanoid turtles. The old TMNT embraced its goofiness. They play off each other perfectly.It's like the Odd Couple but with more mutants and throwing stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turtley awesome!","review":"A magnificent entanglement of old and new school TMNT!

But you give a movie with no features, plus it is the \\"Edited\\" version which is ridiculous, since the Unedited version was online for FREE. This is ridiculous and shows disrespect to the fans who poor money into this franchise (like me). Even the color is poorly done...it advertises the movie badly and is misleading, showing no signs of both the 80's cartoon versions or the black and white comic book versions (both of which are in the movie...but you wouldn't know that by the cover).This is crappy and an idiotic strategy. Paramount and Nickolodeon are off to a poor start after buying this franchise...you're not giving the fans any respect...so I give a good ole' 'piss off' for trying to make a cheap buck off of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"They slap the fans in the face.","review":"Awful cover, Showed in 16x9, animated in 16x9, and aired in 16x9.

I grew up on the old style 80's cartoon and was really looking forward to watching this. I have all of the old cartoon on DVD and most of the new.I knew that they were going to make fun of the old toon, which was OK because it made fun of itself. Instead, the writers seemed to only want to show how awesome the new versions are and how awful, incompetent, annoying, etc. the old ones were. In doing so they ignored the personality differences of the old turtles (it was like having 5 Michaelangelos at a time) and had a ton of plot holes and inconsistencies with what happened in the old cartoon. If the old turtles had been that annoying, I would never have become a fan. I had to stop watching after 30 minutes, which I never do. If you hated the old cartoon and love the new, then this is for you.

Why not use the artwork, such as the poster, for the dvd cover? This is just pure lazyness from people who don't care about the fans, who just want a quick buck. The movie itself is the edited version, which if had any faults was the missing 9 mins, that were cut for commercials, which resulted in some plot confusion. Viacom(paramount/nickelodean)at least put some effort towards giving us a good dvd. The TMNT has always been given a the short end of the stick when it comes to dvds, so I expected it.

Their most threatening asset it not their brawn but their brains. They are ever vigilent, mentally disciplined, and ingenious. Unfortunately a band of paid assasins are just as disciplined. The only thin thread in the book is how they finally get one up on the assasins, grab one clue in a million to one chance and set a trap, averting a fifth assasination.

Although written before 11 September 2001, this book provides the basic building blocks necessary to interpret why terrorists do what they do, why they sometimes succeed, and why they often fail.

Hell the funeral was the is best part of this movie. This was so bad that I even hated the sound track. I hated the sound track because it was part of this movie and not because it was bad. This starts nowhere and goes downhill from there and very slowly at that. I wanted to shoot that s.o.b. of a kid, especially when he jumped up and down on the fish. I am going to stop now because I am getting mad all over again just thinking about this movie.Before I stop there was one moment of really bad taste in this movie that was a very low pont for me. It was when the mother of the dead man asks for the engagement ring back.This is truly a time waster of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Chick Flick!!","review":"Found this to be another cute chick flick that at the end you leave feeling good. Jennifer Garner is a delight. Sweet and gorgeous at the same time. One of the prettiest actresses out there. Very fresh!!! Plus her husband isn't hard to look at either!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Catch & Release?\\" I say just let go!","review":"Boy, am I bored. I can't think of anyone who I'd like to recommend watching this, except for some uptight teenage girls. I just finished watching it. The main plot isn't all that bad. It could have had its niche. But the director managed to make a slow-moving,lifeless piece of work which I think most viewers would find it hard to sit to the end. The only thing that got me to watch this in the beginning,like some other viewers,is Kevin Smith. I love to have a chance to see how he acts in other people's movies. But I can only say even with that, the movie is boring like hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artwork on front is damaged","review":"I Love this movie and couldn't wait to own it. However, it showed up with creases and wrinkles all over the front artwork. This is the second one I received this way. The first time, I returned it because I thought the problem stemmed from the way it was packaged. Apparently, it wasn't because the replacement was in worse shape than the first. It was even difficult to get the packaging off of the item. Part of it is still sticky despite my best efforts. I own numerous DVD's and Blu-rays. I have never had a problem with any. There is just something wrong with Amazon's copies. Very disappointed in the packaging. Love the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OH! Just fabulous.","review":"The best romantic comedy that I have ever seen. Jennifer Garner was fantastic as usual but who wouldn't look good playing across from Timothy Oliphant? This is the first and maybe only, romantic comedy that I have ever seen Timothy do. He was amazing. Our favorite bad boy as the endearing romantic lead. This is one to remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Flat","review":"I barely made it through this movie. The story contained an endless string of awkward moments with nothing uplifting in between. Well, it tried to be uplifting in places, but fell flat. There was no drama and no successful comedy. The actors gave monotone performances and none of the characters were particularly likeable, especially Jennifer Garner's character. In my humble opinion, watching this movie was, frankly, a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I was really expecting this movie to be cute and funny and unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. It's incredibly depressing the whole way through- the end is predictable and not worth waiting for- I simply did because I had such high expectations and was aggravated I had waited so long for such a bad flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaming Pile of Narcissistic Bilge","review":"One of the earlier reviewers claimed this was a great date flick. Maybe.... for hyper-high maintenance dates, or future stars of Court TV's Snapped. This movie was bad, I cannot stress how bad. The story featured a bunch of early thirty-somethings doing nothing, but whining about why they couldn't be happy, lying, and doing the right thing by doing wrong. (Just a question. Is everyone this screwed-up as portrayed in this movie? Am I the odd one for not lying to my wife and slacking off at work? Guess so.) They are so self-centered and shallow that they simply become extraordinarily annoying when only twenty minutes past. The choices they make just complicate their lives with one another, so they can inflict more pain on one another. Oh well, just do yourself a huge favor and skip this waste of time. After all an hour and a half is still an hour and half, and the time you watch is time you cannot get back, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This was one of the WORST movies I have seen in years. The characters were not developed well and did not interact with each other. I struggled to keep on watching it, and I did. When it was done I was only glad that I had NOT purchased it. It was HORRIBLE. Nothing cute, romantic or even interesting in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a comedy??","review":"Wow, I really struggled with not shutting this movie off and throwing it away. I got through the movie just to see who all ends up with who because there were just nothing else to think about. I couldn't even imagine any of these situations really happening in life. Too much of a stretch for reality. Jennifer Garner is the only real reason to watch this movie and even that is a stretch."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the girls..","review":"Probably not a guys' movie, but a good one for the girls.Emotional, but entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoy this movie.","review":"Romantic comdey. I'm a sucker for romance...love it!!! I really like this movie so much, I watched it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film with depth","review":"Though the studio clearly had no idea how to market this delightful film, it shines amidst more lackluster and formulaic movies. It may not fit into a \\"comedy\\" or \\"drama\\" category, but the writing and acting portray greater depth - how you can laugh and cry all at once. Showing that life is more that just funny lines or easy love stories, \\"Catch and Release\\" offers complex characters and honesty. Beautifully done."},{"rating":"2","title":"ohh olyphant..","review":"first things first.. im sorry, but im a huge fan of tim olyphant. he a gorgeous actor who can actually act. and jen garner has been my fave since 13 going on 30 in '04. what an excellent flick and anything shes in is outstanding. the movie was not what i expected, it was even better! couple weird parts, but ya need that sometimes. couple of effed up parts, but ya need that, too. and it was a love story in disguise. im a big sap and love drama and romance. i give 5 stars for this. i rented it on instant video and now its in my cart bc i gotta own it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good background noise for a nap...","review":"I don't even know where to begin. This movie starts slow...and just gets slower. There's very little character development, despite that being the one of the main (implied) themes of the movie. The acting isn't great and the script was lousy. Since I'm one of those people who always tries to find something nice to say, I'll mention that I loved the house. The layout was open and beautiful but it didn't really fit the mood of the movie. Garner's \\"trapped-in-my-mind/trapped-in-the-situation\\" attitude with the situations in the movie really didn't fit with the home she was staying in.There needed to be more action (vs. boring dialouge) in this movie. There are too many twists and turns and only a vague storyline. If you absolutely ~have~ to see this movie, borrow it, rent it, but whatever you do, ~*~don't~*~ buy it. You'll only be able to stomach the monotony once (if you're lucky)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad guy wins the girl","review":"I didn't get this story at all. How can you explain that the guy that has sex with everything that has two legs, wins the girl and the long time friend that expresses his loyal, long suffering love and devotion for her, doesn't even have a chance for a date??? When she chooses the gigalo (or is that someone that gets paid for it?), I was dumbfounded and found the movie a waste of my time and values. I will give the copy I bought away for the cost of shipping, or burn it, same difference.There are still people here in America with common sense, that know the difference between love and just hot sex, that still want to enjoy a great story. This had neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good!","review":"I had low expectations going into this movie & I was spot on this time. In this film Jennifer Garner's character has just lost her fiancé to an accident days before their wedding. Because she has no money, she moves in with her fiancés two best friends Sam and Dennis who's acting skills were very poor in this film. One of her fiancés childhood friends from LA Fritz (Timothy Olyphant) arrives for the funeral and moves in with the three roommates and stays for some indefinite amount of time. Only a few days after the funeral Garner's character finds out that her fiancé has a kid and that he had been cheating on her. Only a day or two later Garner's character begins a romance with Fritz who is really a piece of crap in this movie. The whole movie was full of holes. The romance wasn't cute or sweet in any way. I still can't figure out why she was living with his roommates & why she had NO other friends. So Jen, your acting was great the movie was NOT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not wonderful...........","review":"I love Jennifer Garner, she is a great actress, and I thought this film would just be a nice sweet romantic comedy with the perfect touch of drama. It was that, but it just wasn't gripping and didnt seem to go below any surface of the film. I thought the relationship that developed between Jennifer's character and the guy she becomes involved with would have developed or been portrayed differently. Maybe the soundtrack could have been different as well, music helps bring a film together, and sadly, this one just didn't seem to flow. It was kind of predictable, but just missed something, I can't explain it, just that something that is like a nice cup of hot chocolate with just the right amt of marshmallows on a cold winters night.I'd suggest renting it first, before you make a decision to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good.","review":"I didn't have very high expectations for this movie, and saw it just because Kevin Smith was in it. But I was quite surprised at how drawn into the characters I became. Regardless of what other movies you can compare this one to, it does manage to keep you interested. The plot unfolds at a comfortable pace and allows you to grow attatched the the characters that other romantic-comedy-types don't neccessarily allow time for. It does however, start on a bummer but by the middle of the movie you find yourself rooting for Garner's character and trying to figure out how your own morals would direct you if you found yourself in her shoes... definetely a chick film. If guys are renting just to see Kevin Smith, in my opinion, his character isn't enough to carry the show, but he does give a great performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"I normally love chick flicks, but this one is awful. There was no chemistry between the leads. And we found it very disturbing that she would recover from the death of her fiancee so quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Jennifer Garner has a smile that can light up rooms, but not even her charm can save this very mediocre movie: the plot is facile and glib, you can predict the end of the movie after the first five minutes, and the entire film suffers from a lack of definition: is this a romantic comedy? Is it a tragedy? The director seems to want to do both things and the result is a failure. I look forward to seeing Garner in a better movie than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch and Release","review":"Great chick flick movie. Jenneifer Garner is good as usual. However, there are moments when the film seems to drag a bit, but overall very entertaining! You get a sense of the characters but there are almost too many to get the depth of who they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time....","review":"What is happening to our world? We are becoming so superficial. This film shows the sickness of our culture...where an obviously lust driven relationship is idealized. I did not decide to marry my wife because of how she looked or how great sex would be the first time (most first times are really not all that good...if you think so, you have never made love with someone). I left this film feeling completely empty. If Jennifer's character had attempted to start a real relationship with the friend who she was not having empty sex with, this film would have been redeemed! But instead, it sucks! Kevin...what were you thinking even showing up in this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Catch & Release","review":"This movie was terrible, It did not hold my interest, there seemed to be no plot to it.. I was bored and wish I had never bought it. A total waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AVAILABLE for DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have tried to rent this twice and it never was sent to my unbox video player. I even tried a different movie and the other movie worked fine. I am upset with Amazon because there is no contact information to relaying that this video does not work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I thought this would be another cookie-cutter romantic comedy, but it was pleasantly surprising. It was more of a dramedy. I think if you went in expecting a romantic comedy, you were going to be disappointed. I saw it more of the complexities of emotions that are present when grief and betrayal become entangled. Yeah, it had the happy ending, but the journey there was far more realistic and satisfying than the usual Hollywood offering. I get why a lot of people found it disappointing. I quite liked it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch & Never Release!!!","review":"I waited a long time to watch this movie for a variety of reasons. One, I was not a Jennifer Garner fan(I have become one since viewing this movie). Two, I am not usually a big fan of light, fluffy films!! So, I was pleasantly surprised. This is an engaging movie with stellar performances from all the cast. Timothy Olyphant is a standout as the misunderstood Fritz, who appears to be all playboy, but is actually tender, honest and a perfect match for the lady. Watch it, enjoy!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch and Release","review":"There was lots of laughter to offset the sad premise of this story. It was entertaining all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"One of the least engaging movies I've ever endured. It's hard to know how to criticize it when I can't see anything it was attempting. The biggest problems are how little of a sense you get of who the characters are to each other and the cryptic way the plot unfolds without containing any interesting mysteries. As a Kevin Smith fan I don't understand why he thought this movie was worth his time. Even his part didn't make me laugh. I'd give four stars to his commentary track that goes a fair way to redeeming the overall product though."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has moments","review":"A friend recommended this to me and I understand why he liked it. The movie is original in some ways. It shows guys grieving for friends. It shows the community of a small group of friends. It shows humor in very a real way in tragic situations.With all that being said, the movie dragged for me. The humor is very understated and doesn't come very often. The romantic relationships are forced and very cliche in the story. None of the characters are all that likeable, although the acting is top notch for the most part.The movie just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not a good movie. At all.","review":"Kevin Smith was the only good thing about this movie. Otherwise it was horrible. One big advertisement for why not to live in Boulder. Horrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was hoping for more romance.","review":"Is this how love and romance is in the 21st century? The scene with Jennifer Garner in a bathroom hiding in the bathtub while a friend of her dead fiancé is having sex with a woman he does not know, not knowing Jennifer is in the bathtub, was pretty shocking. I think movies like this set a terrible example for young people. I was hoping for a movie with some romance, instead this movie has people using sex as if they were eating potato chips. Plus, Jennifer's character sure didn't grieve long before she was in bed with the same guy who was in the bathroom scene.My mind is agog with the lack of respect and loose morals that both men and women display in this movie. Had I known, I would not have watched it, let alone bought it.I give it one star instead of none, because the scenery was pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we watch the same movie?","review":"Catch and Release was one of the worst movies I've watched in a long time. Supposedly this movie was a comedie/drama. There was nothing funny about this movie at all, even in the slightest. The movie is all about a woman (jennifer garner) who makes one poor decision after another. There was little plot in the movie and it should have been about an hour shorter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic and fun band","review":"As others here have said, The Hooters were definitely underrated.This cd is full of great original songs spanning the band's career. My personal favorites on here include: And We Danced, All You Zombies, and She Comes In Colors. Also, I totally love the band's version of Time After Time. I actually prefer it over Cindy Lauper's version (which is fantastic in its own right.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good greatest hits collection","review":"This compilation is a good collection both for people who kind of like the Hooters and for die-hard Melodicans. It contains all the best known songs, plus a couple of rarities (\\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\"from the B-side of the \\"Johnny B\\" single, and \\"Time After Time\\" from the \\"Nervous Night Live\\" video).Unfortunately, all the songs come from the three Columbia albums (\\"Nervous Night,\\" \\"One Way Home\\" and \\"Zig Zag\\"), so if you're looking for your favorite song from \\"Amore,\\" \\"Out Of Body\\" or \\"The Hooters Live,\\" you're out of luck. I suppose Sony didn't want to bother getting the rights to use songs from another label. Luckily, this won't come as a disappointment to anyone but a die-hard fan, since casual listeners have probably never heard any songs off the non-Columbia albums.If you are looking for a really good Hooters collection, I'd definitely recommend you get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"a seriously underrated band","review":"Like many others who claimed to be true Hooters fans, I owned \\"Nervous Night\\" but didn't buy any of the follow-ups. Now I realize the error of my ways. Like \\"NN,\\" every song on this collection just blows me away. I remember seeing them do \\"Lucy in the Sky\\" live in '86, and I love the fact that they put the live performance on the album. I am amazed that \\"Beat Up Guitar\\" was never played on the radio. If you've worn out your vinyl \\"NN\\" and need more Hooters, be sure to pick up this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I adore this CD...","review":"As a kid, growing up in the Philadelphia area, the Hooters meant a lot to me. I am still one of their biggest fans. I remember the first time I heard them do \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,\\" at the Amnesty International show back in '85 or '86, and I was completely stunned. This is a very nice look back at some of their brighter moments you may have missed, but, for me, having their rendition of \\"LSWD\\" is more than worth the price of this CD. The whole catalog is worth having, IMHO, but, for someone who thinks they were some \\"one hit wonder\\" band from the mid-80's, it's a good place to start, and realize how completely wrong you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item...","review":"...so sent it back with an explanation of exactly what I need-over 3 weeks ago, but havent heard anything back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item not pictured","review":"I have a canon rebel XT, I lost my charger some time ago and bought this one as a replacement.

Waste of money for me, but if your battery only has two contact points you can give it a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too great a price","review":"My question is whether the author has ever seen the show? It sounds like she may have seen the movie since she says Daniel is blond, but other than having the names right, I'm not sure we're even talking about the same people. If you manage to make it through the holes and uneven development, then you'll probably be disappointed by the ending. Very rushed and unsatisfying.

The general idea is good, a typical trip to a planet that gives up people for hosts so they won't be destroyed by the Gou'ald. Some good dialogue. Nice descriptions of settings. Jack in his top sarcastic form. The main problems are how short the book is - making the pace rather rushed and the end rather unsatisfying - and the somewhat lumpy characterization and technical plot holes. Both of those can probably be explained by how early in the series the book was written, but they're still... painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my type","review":"i didnt enjoy this book, the general idea was good and tepical but there are big holes in the book that make you wonder. they did not chich if there is a dhd on the planet, they did not have radio comunications, they could not dial home but home suppose to call to know what was wrong, they made damege on that planet & and the locals may be punished by the gouald for their actions and all they did is to tell a kid to contact the nox enen the nox closed thier gate after their first engagment with sg1"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you need an SG-1 fix, this book might do it.","review":"Ms. McConnell has captured the characters of SG-1 with The Price You Pay and has given a little insight into what goes into preparing for a recon mission.

I have had the pleasure of being treated personally by the author in a group session and everything I was willing to work on is no longer a problem. I still have a ways to go but it's just my own procrastination.I have never taken any medication and I strongly advise against developing an addiction on top of an avoidance. I recommend finding a qualified cognitive-behavioral therapist (they do exist, try adaa.org) and doing your homework. I think group sessions (3-5 people) are actually much better than individual ones, because getting over embarassment of the condition is essential to its resolution.

(I mixed it with maybe an ounce or two.) There was really no other way to get it into my body without mixing it with water. It smells like dirt but tastes a hundred times worse.I can't really say if it worked, because after about a month I just couldn't stomach it anymore. During the time I took it, I didn't notice a change in my cycles or any noticeable change in ANYTHING at all.If you want to try it, Amazon definitely has the best price.

Every woman is different. The 1 rating is from my experience. I can't give it a 5 if it did nothing for my milk supply. I tried fenugreek as well and it didn't do anything. What worked for me was brewers yeast and Odul's non alcoholic beer. I hate all alcohol, but I can say the hops in it really helped a lot. I was one of those who produced NO more than 2 ounces a day. If I were to do it again with another baby I would not try goat's rue again but I would try the fenugreek again and start day 1 whether I am having problems or not. I was told that fenugreek works best if you begin it immediately. I definitely would do brewer's yeast.

We love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this dog shampoo!","review":"We have two large, yellow labs, and this product has been wonderful! It's easy to use, as it lathers up, making it easy to work the shampoo into their fur, thereby cleaning thoroughly.

This is the best dog shampoo we've found yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Godsend","review":"This shampoo is amazing. My dog suffers from environmental allergies and she has to be bathed a minimum of once a week. We've been searching long and hard for a shampoo that wouldn't dry out her skin, and wasn't disgustingly perfumy. I also wanted something that would be biodegradable, and have limited ingredients.Earthbath All Natural Oatmeal & Aloe Shampoo fits the bill. There were no negative skin reactions, it smells VERY pleasant, and even left my hands soft and moisturized. The other benefit of this stuff is that it doesn't require much shampoo to get her clean. Granted, as an American Pitbull Terrier, she has incredibly short hair, but most of the other shampoos required much more to actually make her feel clean (maybe they were leaving a film behind?). I'm half tempted to use this stuff on myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I bought the tea tree \\"flavor\\" for an itchy dog based on all the good reviews, but wasn't impressed.

It also leaked all over the packaging which was a bit annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puppy shampoo","review":"I purchased the puppy shampoo from Earthbath off of Amazon because I found the exact same shampoo in my local PetCo for twice the price. I love this shampoo for my 5 month old cockapoo (although he hates bath time). The shampoo rinses out nicely and leaves my puppy smelling subtly like cherries.

I no longer have to do that because the Fool A Bug does its job and keeps ants out of the food bowl. It is a very sturdy plastic material, so it even withstands raccoons and possums that come out at night looking for leftover cat food.

However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the quality less than spectacular. Granted, this is my one and only experience with wireless headphones, but even from 2 feet away, I experienced static, line noise and frequent interruptions. This is especially true near phones - the transmitter base actually caused my analog phone to ring. Another disadvantage is that the headphones are rather large - for the sake of comfort, the \\"backbone\\" of the headphones arches way up over your head. In retrospect, I think they were overpriced a tad, given the above.However, to finish the review on a good note, I really like having the volume and power switch on the phones themselves. They are comfortable to wear. They are *not* noise-canceling, or even that well insulated against outside sounds, but in general, they get the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"A defective set?","review":"After reading the rave reviews of these headphones, I have to wonder if I have a defective set: there's a constant background hiss that won't go away, regardless of how I fiddle with the input levels and volumes, and reception is poor even when I'm sitting right next to the base unit.

The static that cut in and out didn't bother me so much. The strange noise that came in and out that sounded like someone was playing with an old radio and adjusting the frequency didn't bother me that much. What led me to smashing this product was it constantly tuning out. It would tune out, I would press the tune button, music would resume. 1 second later it would go out again. Just as I'm getting into the music and the game that I'm playing I would lose the music which was very aggrivating for me.

The other songs also are very good but on some of them sometimes her voice lacks finesse(not much - sometimes just the end of the song) perhaps due to the constraints of the Italian language itself or perhaps she is not so young anymore.

The Gentle Leader is a must-have for owners who want to humanely train their dog to walk on a leash and follow commands without being pulled by the dog. The Gentle Leader goes over the dog's snout and clasps at the back of the neck. Your regular leash attaches to a ring that hangs below the chin (it is part of the Gentle Leader). Any time the dog pulls on the leash, his/her head will turn instead, which prevents him/her from pulling you. The dog doesn't get choked like pinch collars and collars with spikes do.All puppy and dog owners should use the Gentle Leader to train their pets to walk on a leash and follow commands. It gives you more control over the dog, which is safer for both of you, and makes training your dog to walk on a leash easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gentle leader is not gentle","review":"I love most Premier products, and the easy walk harness is my best friend. However this is dangerous. You have to have it tight just for it to fit, the nose strap is very thin, and it comes off easily. On top of that it hurts. There's nothing more disturbing than your dog yipping when on a walk. And I'm talking a rough, brave dog, not one with anxiety who's sensitive. I did some research and it turns out that the gentle leader can do long-term damage to your dog's nasal nerves. My dog now has breathing difficulty. Beware: just because it isnt sharp doesnt mean it cant hurt your dog.If you cant walk a dog on a regular collar or body harness, don't walk the dog. Do your research if you love your dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant attitude adjustment","review":"I was introduced to this leader by the trainer at my local Petsmart. My Aussie Martie has a tendency to lunge at other dogs in a palyful manner but it really freaks them out. Before I was using a choke chain collar that was overly big for him and he would just pull and pull. During the class after one such incident, the trainer pulled one of these leaders out and put it on him easily. The change was immediate and profound. Martie began to heel and his focus was on me almost the entire time.He does still try to remove the nose strap with his paws sometimes but he has not been able to yet. I advise watching the video on how to fit your dog I think its important to make it a comfortable fit for your dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Leader","review":"So many dogs, so many walks, why not make them all enjoyable? The Gentle Leader is great for dogs and great for dog owners and walkers. No unnecessary pressure on neck/throat/joints. My dog now tips his head to help me place the Gentle Leader over his head. Our earth angels give us the best, now we can return the favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"We have a very high strung 1.5 year old English Setter and this collar is working great to break him to a leash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...but....disappointing","review":"We purchased this collar for our dog who is very dog reactive. It hasn't helped with his out of control lunging, but that could just be our crazy dog. Here's the reason for the mild review...it's only been about 4 or 5 months now, and it's fraying so much that I know we'll have to get another one very soon! I would expect longer wear from the product. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"My DOG doesn't like it","review":"This was yet another of many attempts to get my medium-sized dog to stop pulling. He absolutely hated it and refused to go anywhere. It was like an episode of crocodile hunters- he was on the ground spinning and tangling in it to get it off. The part that goes over his muzzle was irritating his skin as well. I went with another no-pull leash-- the one with the hook on the chest and one strap goes under the front legs. That one works WONDERS if you can find it. This one is too difficult to get adjusted to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"It works great, but it's quite unconfortable for my dog, he doesn't like it very much. So we switched to the easy walk harness wich is awsome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Leader Head Collar","review":"I was happy I guessed right on the size as fitting is crucial. The DVD was very helpful in fitting and handling the dog with this new collar and technique. My dog is a Doberman puppy- but a huge puppy and she pulls during our entire walk. The collar has definitely helped and I am enjoying our walks far more. I have her staying by my side most of the time and she only trips me a few times per walk- so this is definitely progress. Thank-you Gentle Leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"miracle","review":"anyone with a large or very strong dog should have this product. our great dane who we previously struggled to manage even when she had low energy was impossible to handle when she saw another dog or got excited. with the gentle leader i can control her with my pinky, its incredible. she doesn't dislike it and its much better for the dog than choke and prong collars i think."},{"rating":"2","title":"GENTLE LEADER","review":"I got one of these for each of my dogs. They work but the dogs still fight it everytime I put it on them. One even rubbed the skin off her nose trying to get it off. BUT, it does calm them down and makes them walk nicely (when they're not fighting it). Probably just need more individual work before trying to walk them both together. I'd buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This collar is great!","review":"This collar is absolutely fantastic! As long as you follow the instructions, fitting the collar was relatively easy. After one walk, my dog is hardly pulling at all! She now walks on a loose leash. I will be interested to see how she does when I walk her with my other dog. She is still pawing at the collar a little, but I have a feeling this behavior will disappear once she gets used to it. This is a fantastic collar that wasn't very expensive at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of works, rubs the fur off","review":"I have a 110 lb lab who is a strong puller. When I first tried the Gentle Leader on him, it took a while to get accustomed to. After the initial training period, it worked great for a few months. He has started pulling again in the recent months, bad enough to wear the fur on his nose off from the nylon. It does not seem to bother him in the least. However, we run at least 20 miles a week and it is causing unsightly scabbing. It is also riding up into his eye area since he is pulling so hard. I really don't need this kind of resistance training! I'm trying a no-pull harness now, though I think he will be too strong for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for large dogs","review":"I have a 200 pound St. Bernard. I didn't want to use a choke collar because I don't think they are very nice so I bought the gentle leader on the recommendation of a trainer. How it was described to me is that you need to use it like a horse harness, that your dog will despise it for a couple of months and buck and try to rub it off but if you are consistent then your dog will soon love it and not give you any issues. The trick I learned was to pull up when he was being bad, make your dog look at the sky because dogs hate that. And it is like magic.....he stopped doing whatever he was doing! Now I am 105 pounds when wet so it should say a lot that I now was able to train my dog to walk happily besides me with the gentle leader. Not only have I continued buying them as he grows (now in X-Large) but I recommend them to everyone who has issues walking their dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL TOOL","review":"My dog pulls so much but when we got the Premier Gentle Leader and Easy Walk Harness our lives were saved. My husband and I didn't want to take her on walks because she would come close to tearing our arms off but the Gentle Leader and Easy Walk Harness changed everything. If I ever have a pulling dog again I will be sure to get one or both of these products and tell EVERYONE I SEE that has a pulling dog that this is what they need to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Leader","review":"My dog learned to walk with it and not drag me.

This product not only trains your dog, but helps with wear and tear on your face!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stopped the pulling!","review":"Our German Shep. always has issues pulling. We had bought a pinch collar but we hate using it and he still tends to pull a bit. We have tried several different techniques to stop his pulling but it only alleviates he problem momentarily and he goes back at it. We were skeptical of this collar at first but decided to give it a try. Upon purchase took us awhile to figure out how to work it and put it on him but a quick Youtube video howto gave us the insight we needed. After he got used to it its a lovely collar. He does not pull at all anymore and walks like a gentleman. When he walks to far it turns his head to the side, which annoys him and therefore he stops doing it and walks alongside me like he is supposed to. He walks like he did when he was a puppy and our teenager pulling is gone. Love the collar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great for large/strong dogs","review":"I use this with my German Shepherds and it greatly reduces pulling. Sometimes one sort of yanks it at the start of the walk and will occasionally flop on the grass in an effort to rub it off...but he's learning! It really improves our walks."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works after all!","review":"After watching the included video we were ready to send the collar back, it looked like a lot of trouble to get the dog acclimated, but we decided to try! Once we adjusted the collar and fitted it on our usually well-behaved Miniature Schnauzer we were again ready to send it back, He wiggled, shook, rubbed his head in the grass and otherwise objected! Surprisingly, within a very short time he settled down and we went for a very pleasant walk. Since then, he has worn it on our daily 2 1/2 mile walks without a problem. The collar really does work. Our dog liked to walk faster than my wife and I. Holding him back could get tiring on a long walk. Just tightening the leash stops his pulling. The collar seems a bit overpriced, there's not much to it and it is a bit difficult to determine the proper size, (I had to go to the manufacturer's website), hence 4 stars rather than 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems outweigh benefits","review":"This collar hurt my dog more than it helped him. I tried it with the neck very tight & nose strap loose enough to go to the nose but not over. My puppy wheezed, the collar didn't stay up high behind his ears (with just 1 finger room), and the nose strap kept sliding up to his eyes & cutting him under the eyes.So the trainer adjusted the collar to be looser & the nose strap to be tighter. So now there was no wheezing, but the tighter nose strap just made it cut him more sharply under the eyes and slide up over his eyes more easily which drives him crazy (understandably). He now has bald spots under his eyes & is always rubbing them.My dog's a lab puppy, normal sized, but the control this collar gives isn't worth harming my dog. Going to try the haltie (sp?) collar or something else. So be warned - it does help keep your dog from pulling, but it might not be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog Head Collar","review":"Completely unsatisfied with this product. The product did not work as advertise. It might work for some dogs but I have a Boston Terrier which have short snouts and the product does not work at all for this type dog. I would check and double check before buying this type product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK","review":"I bought this because my dog pulls all the time and a trainer had suggested a nose type collar. My arm hurts all the time from her constant pulling and she has a few times almost made me fall. This collar would not fit her right with no amount of adjustment, it put pressure on her eyes. I don't know if my german shorthair's eyes are placed any differently than any other dog but the strap would not stay down on her nose at all. I do not want to do any damage to her so I returned the collar.Note-- I do not see how playing tug of war would make a dog walk on a leash properly. (a poster from above) I have tried using treats, voice commands, etc and nothing works to control her pulling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog chewed it off after first use!","review":"It said in instructions that it can be left on but as soon as I left my 7 month old dog with it he chewed it right off. I had fitted it tightly but it has straps that just hang which he was able to reach. Needs redesigning.A call to customer service resulteed in a very curt reply from a woman who informed me that a dog could chew almost anything and offered a replacement for another $7.95. Why would they tell you it can be left on permanently?? I guess to get another $7.95. NO THANKS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very stressful...and not a solution","review":"I am surprised at the good reviews for this item. My Scottish Terrier had this thing off in a matter of seconds. It took us forever to get it on him and as soon as we went outside he laid on the lawn and wiggled it right off of his nose (and it's not because he has a small snout). It looked like he was being tortured so it went right back in the box, another waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is OK","review":"Our dog's vet and trainer recommended the gentle leader.Its downside has been that my dog does not like it much and tries avoid it when I am trying to put it on before a walk.The upside has been that I can have more control over her, something particularly important given that she is reactive, stronger than me, and we live in the city. If she lunged and I cannot control her it could end badly.She warms up to it quickly and goes happily about her walk.The leader helped us train her not to pull. With the regular collar she would always pull, sometimes even to the point of choking herself while pulling; this has stopped.This product did not magically fix the \\"pulling problem\\" but combined with training (stopping or turning back when she pulls and only moving when the leash is loose) it has worked for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less pulling, but dog doesnt like it","review":"The gentle leader makes it much easier to control my dogs pulling. My lab doesnt pull nearly as hard, but she stops mid walk and try to pull off the leader with her front paws. I'm hoping she'll get used to the leader and stop doing that. The leader is wonderful for my bassett hound. The bassett could slip out of regular collars and pulled too hard with a harness. This works much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"gentle leader","review":"This is the best thing I have ever purchased for my dog!! She used to pull me down the street and now with this new head collar she is an angel!! She walks right beside me and I can finally walk her comfortably. She didn't like it on her face at first but she is getting used to it. I use it every time I walk her now!! I love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle leader - great tool","review":"We ordered this collar to use with our German Shepherd Rex. At first he was not very happy about the strap over the bridge of his nose, but after a few times he as gotten used to it. It is important to get the collar properly adjusted for comfort and functional reasons. Once the leader is properly adjusted it goes on in no time. Rex is able to fetch, drink, and go running with this collar without any problems. This is a great tool to have in your dog training tool kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stops the pulling","review":"While using this, my 5 month German Shepherd stops pulling on the leash. The only problem is that she knows when she's wearing this and will still sometimes pull when she's not wearing it. She also hates wearing it and tries to swat it off with her paws. The product does what it is supposed to, however, and she doesn't pull at all when wearing it, and noticeably less when not wearing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick results","review":"After a week of slowly introducing the concept of wearing the collar with lots of treats, we are now using it on daily walks. The difference is AMAZING. My chihuahua-boston terrier (about 17 pounds of cat-sized dog) used to pull and lunge at EVERY squirrel we passed and try to attack/play with all other dogs and cats we might meet on the walk. Now he is able to calmly continue walking passed these distractions, especially when he knows a treat will soon follow. The only thing we haven't been able to figure out is how to get him to go 'number 2' while wearing the collar. He seems to feel a little too restricted and uncomfortable to release, so I have to take it off for a few minutes when we reach his 'spot'. Otherwise I am more than pleased with the purchase, it has allowed me to continue walking our headstrong dog late into my pregnancy despite icy sidewalks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Life Easier","review":"I have a 1 year old Lab/G. Shep mix. She made walking so difficult, constantly pulling my arm and dragging me down the street. I got the adjustments right and took her for a walk with the leader. There was such a huge defference! At first she put up a fit and tried to get it off but after about 10min it was probably the most enjoyable walk I've ever been on with her! I'm sure after a few more walks it'll be perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solution for problem pullers","review":"We bought this product for our 8 month Aussie puppy, who is an incorrigible puller. This is probably the best product on the market to fight your dogs urge to pull. When they pull it turns their head. I have never seen a dog able to fight this thing - he'd have to have a huge neck. It also does not impede our dog's ability to eat, drink, or bark. It isn't a muzzle. Unfortunately, it rubs on the snout and Austin has lost some hair there since we started using it on him. So we are going to focus on training with a regular collar, but we are happy to have this in the bag in case the training fails. This would be the collar to have if you have a large excitable dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Leader","review":"This is a great product! We have five dogs, well more like 4 1/4, I don't consider the Chihuahua a full dog,LOL. I bought four gentle leader and it works well. Walking four full sized dog can be though, especially when they see something that intrigues them and they just want to investigate (i.e. another dog). We are able to control them just fine. The collar is made to bring their nose down which doesn't allow them to keep forward and be fixated. The collar also aids from pulling, but I believe that's more on the training end of things. My girlfriend is 100 lbs and she is able to walk all the dogs at the same time thanks to the gentle leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved our Walks","review":"I purchased one of these from our vet after trying all other options. They sized it to him and instructed me on how to use it. I read through the book and use it on a daily basis. We put on our gentle leader in the evening and yes he still trys to rub it off but he doesn't like to wear anything, including a collar. But he walks like an angel. He is so much better behaved even when we aren't on our walks. It calms him down and is much better behaved. After exhausting all other options I am glad I tried this! I avoided pinch collars at all costs, i didn't want our walks to be punishment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More control","review":"Gentle Leaders are the best invention ever!!

I didn't believe this thing would work until I actually started using it, and it's been a life saver. Walks used to be frustrating, either because I was getting constantly pulled by the dog or because of annoying and ineffective techniques to make the dog not pull. With this product, however, I now look forward to walks with my dogs. What a difference!"},{"rating":"2","title":"collar","review":"I think it's a good product. Dont know to much, my dog is not talking back, but she pull less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love love love.","review":"My pup still pulls even with some training, but he doesn't pull as hard so it's an improvement.

I hope that they will get used to it soon. In theory, it should work fine. I think that having them wear the head collar around the house while we are at home for a while before heading for a walk again will hopefully get us better results. The product is well made and the DVD is very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Leader ... Extremely Effective!!","review":"My young dog (Standard Schnauzer) has loads of energy and all of my other leads have been relatively ineffective in channeling that energy during walks and jogs. (I am really not interested in inflicting pain to slow him down.) This Premier Gentle Leader Head Collar for Dogs did the trick; he is gently reoriented and under gentle but firm control. I can now ride next to him on my bike with this leader as my only control. When my dog sees me get this leader out, he comes bounding to get it on and go out for our \\"bike run\\". I attach a 5-foot GenuineDogGear braided snap leash to the Gentle Leader as the perfect shock-absorbing match for biking with my dog. I will be buying another set of this gear because I never want to be without this combination for this or any other dog I own. Be sure to study and follow the explicit directions about how to get this collar adjusted properly and about how to use it; otherwise it won't work so effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oshea","review":"Did not work for our dog.

He has never had prior training and was always pulling on the leash! Obviously, because he's such a big dog, his pulling habbits had to stop. My trainer recommended a Gentle Leader, so I checked Amazon.com, of course, and they had exactly what I needed. This thing is definitely an attitude adjuster! When he's wearing the Gentle Leader, he tends to stick closer to me, and when he does decide to pull, he's quickly stopped by the Gentle Leader pulling him back to me.This thing is amazing! I recommend it to ANYONE with ANY pulling problem with their dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like magic","review":"My 3 year old cocker spaniel was always pulling and chasing things on walks. It made walking him a tiresome chore. I had enough and had to try the Gentle leader after hearing so many good things about it. Well, it took several days for him to adapt to the collar, but now he walks without any pulling and (usually) doesnt chase anything. He doesnt even fight it when I try to put it on him anymore. Magic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased!","review":"I have a 6mo lab and once he started pulling on our walks, I knew it was time for something. Rather than use a choker, I decided to give the gentle leader a chance! It is a miracle! At first my dog didn't really like it because he wasn't used to something being around his nose. He is still not the biggest fan, but doesn't fight me when I put it on! He walks right by my side, and on a scale of 1-10 pulls me at a level 1 (next to nothing). I would highly recommend this for anyone that has a dog that has the potential to pull them! It is a much nicer version of a choke collar, and a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"My dog is a Saint Bernard and I tried the halter today and it fits much better than the large. I had a couple of tries with people crossing our path with dogs and dogs barking behind clearly seen fences and not once did he come out of his thing and not once did I almost get pulled off my feet. Also he does not pull unless there is another dog so now it is easier to walk by any dog with just a little tug from me. I highly reccommend this. I should have boughten this a long time ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product.","review":"Over the last few years, we have used several of the Gentle Leaders. It was recommended by our vet.

He is approx 70 lbs of puppy on the end of a leash, and I think he has aspirations to become a sled dog. He is part bulldog, and has a lot of muscle strength in his chest. He is easily able to walk us on a regular collar. The gentle leader collar made a huge difference with the pulling, and I have recommended this product to several friends. However, we have only had the dog for three months, and he just chewed through the nose band of his second gentle leader. Both times, the damage occurred literally in a matter of seconds. I had let him off the leash to assist one of the children, and by the time I turned around to reattach the leash, this collar was hanging in pieces.

Both of whom pull; the shepherd mix pulls terribly. At first the collars worked great. I put it on, instantly no pulling. However, after a couple minutes the dogs would begin clawing at their faces, causing one to bleed within seconds in desperation to try to get it off. The lab mix would do ok, occasionally clawing but not hurting himself. If the collar would stay put exactly where it is supposed to be, it may be better. However, the collar will slide down the neck even at the recommended tightness. The buckle/tightening portion of the collar is not so good and after a minute or so of walking will begin to loosen, thus causing the repositioning of the collar and making it harmful to the dog. If making it tighter, the collar will press in on the bottoms of the eyes of the dog, causing obvious discomfort. Be prepared to return the item if you get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The leader did not work with my strong nine month old puppies.

I wanted my dog to walk with me without using the gentle leader. I go for walks with the dog(a lab) and my 2 year old grand baby so unfair to the dog I gave in and got the gentle leader. The puppy didn't like it at first but after 3 walks she wears it just fine and it does what it says it will. She does not pull. But I am afraid like what one person wrote she is not learning not to pull, the gentle leader won't let her. I want to walk with me just because she knows where the treats are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I had read a lot of good things about this head collar and what it can do to reduce pulling on walks, so I decided to get one for my 97 pound lab. He's always been a terrific puller and we've never really been able to control him with just a leash and normal collar.The head collar doesn't work. My dog fights it horribly when he wears it, so much so that after a single walk the strap rubbed his mouth raw, and there was some bleeding. I stopped using it immediately. We've decided to try the Easy Walk harness (also made by Premier) instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Product","review":"Having fashioned a head collar of sorts for my dog before buying this product I had a general idea that it would work for her. The Gentle Leader is well made, and easy to size and fit on your dog. Overall it seems to reduce pulling and lunging for my hyper-active jack russell mix dog. After a few weeks of wearing it and working with it though she has become less responsive to my correcting her with a gentle yes constant tug on the leash to get her to heel. She will still heel when corrected, but seems to need a lot more correction then she initially did when we began using the head halter. That's her own stubbornness though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I can walk the dog!!!...","review":"Recently, I had gotten to the point where I refused to walk our Lab for fear of being pulled face-first onto the concrete. So when my boyfriend bought this collar, I didn't think it was going to work. But when I finally got up the nerve to try it, I was pleasantly surprised. No more pulling and feeling like he was going to wind up choking himself. It was an immediate improvement; I was walking him instead of him walking me.

My 80lb one year yellow Lab quickly learned almost all the commands except the Heel command. To a point I refused to take him for a walk.

This makes it so that when I pull, it slides around her head eventually and rests on her eyeball. Not pleasant. The only solution is to put it underneath her chest, under one leg, but I can't turn her well, and she gets annoyed. But it works well for the most part.

He is a Husky/Pit bull mix. Great dog but his chase drive is unbelievable. Probably because his previous owner allowed him to chase the cats around his house.he had absolutely no training before I got him and after our walks my arm would be sore from his constant pulling.After reading all the good reviews I purchased the \\"Gentle\\" leader.I watched the video and was very careful to adjust it properly.It worked great. On our first walk he walked right with me with very little pulling.After the walk I noticed a slight abrasion on his muzzle and figured I needed to adjust it further.After the second walk his muzzle was raw and bleeding.It did \\"work well\\" as I had complete control of him but the price he paid in fur and flesh was too high.I threw this piece of garbage away. I would not recommend this to ANYONE!!!If you love your dog do NOT buy the not so \\"gentle\\" leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dog Collar","review":"I have to admit that my dog is not thrilled with this collar, but I am!

I tried all of the recommended dog expert tips with no result. Out of desperation I decided to try this. The change was amazing. I have a very energetic dog, who needs walks. Those walks went from a constant battle to an enjoyable stroll. Whenever I put him back on a regular lead and collar he reverts back to his bad old ways. Please try this if you have a dog who pulls when you walk him. Be sure to watch the video, because getting the fit right is really important to success with this collar."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, it's not a muzzle!","review":"I have answered this question about 300 times since starting to use this on my Lab, my Lab is STRONG, I am NOT, this evens us out :)My 5 year old niece can walk him with this, very easily too, with one hand.I tried the prong collar, a standard choke collar, and a few other expensive \\"systems\\", and I was really resistant to trying this, which is a shame, because I wasted a lot of money.It has a few \\"cons\\", the first being that the dog hates it, he is fear dominant, which makes him fight this collar sometimes, the second is that when he is wearing it, he gets \\"the look\\", the \\" I am so mad that she has complete control over me look \\", so thats why I have to answer the \\" Is that a muzzle? \\" question.All in all though, It is a humane solution to pulling and I will continue to recommend it to people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"Great on our Great Danes.

It is now Jan. We have two dogs that are part Shih Tsu and part Bijon. On a leash, they were all over the place, pulling and wandering and getting aggressive with other dogs. With the Gentle Leader, one of them became very docile and manageable. He walks beside us with no pulling or wandering. The other dog takes longer to settle down and pulls a little more. He is more curious and he still wants to wander some but he is much more in control. Both are much more manageable when confronting other dogs. Watch the video and do exactly what it says and you will be amazed in the change in your dog! This is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"This is a great product. My 50lb pit has a whole different attitude when I walk him with the gentle leader. I was walking him with a pronged collar. The gentle leader irritated his skin a little bit at first, but he has very delicate skin and it has since gotten used to it. I think the best feature is that there is no pain associated with using the gentle leader properly, unlike a pronged collar or choke chain collar (which is actually quite dangerous because it can permanently damage their trachea). Because of this it is a great training tool--you are not using fear to teach, but an intelligent method that the dog will most likely understand more quickly.I found that the strap that went over the top of his head kept sliding looser, so after I cut the excess length, I ended up needing to fold it over and sew it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home and Herbal Remedies","review":"I found this book to be very useful.

I did get my fair share with Helen playing the Mary, the dim-witted flight attendant! I liked the scene with her and Russel Crowe debating who's the better \\"Star Trek\\" Captain! Crowe liking Kirk (of coarse), and Slater adoring Picard! But honestly the movie was a bit loud and story undeveloped (especially the ending)! Crowe did some fair share with his role of Zack Grant, but if Mel Gibson was cast in the role, that would have given the character some style and justice to his part!

Everything about it goes against what Russell prides himself in making a movie. His charactar's dialogue is contrived and unrealistic. He is famous for battling directors when it comes to the integrity of his charactar, but he didn't win this battle.

This is after all just my opinion.I don't think the director knew what to do with his actors besides making them run around. This is film... let the actors faces tell some of the story.

Okay, it's a low-budget, made-for-cable action film, and I shouldn't have hoped for too much, right? Well, I've come to expect Russell Crowe to pull a riveting performance out of even a weak script or a two-dimensional character - just watch \\"The Quick and the Dead\\" or \\"Virtuosity\\" for evidence of that. Unfortunately, Crowe's Zack Grant was flat and uninteresting and the character of Mary, played by Helen Slater, was simply excruciating. The only performance in the whole film worth watching was Etsushi Toyokawa as \\"bad guy\\" Yuji. He brought some complexity and subtlety to what could have been just another flat character. The bottom line? Skip this one, even if you're a big Crowe fan. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you absolutelt LOVE Russell Crowe...","review":"OK, so it's not the best movie ever made, but NO ONE can second guess Crowe's ability to put himself inside a character until the viewer forgets who he really is.

I think the absurd character 'Mary' was a little (OK, a LOT) too 'flighy' of a flight attendant for my tastes, but let's just forget about her, OK? Also, was it possible for yuji to have a more annoying and difficult to understand voice? Oh well, overall, I enjoyed this movie, but that's mostly because I am such a HUGE Russell Crowe fan!

Its a buzzing, warbling sound that is correlated to the audio and which is not present when not using the normal headphone out port. I tried multiple USB ports & headphones with the same result. This is when I noticed that the driver is bound to one and only one USB port. If you switch ports, you have to uninstall the old driver, and reinstall it for the new port, and reboot! This has unintended byproduct of resetting the audio levels to maximum, which is loud enough to cause pain. This driver issue is a huge hassle with a laptop, as I have to switch between docking station and laptop USB ports, depending on if its docked or not.

The main purpose was to have an optical audio output for listening to MP3's.

The blue LED lets you know that it is powered up (and you can see the red LED in the optical port). No hassle, and most importantly no hum (and the sound volume was much higher too so I no longer have to jack up my stereo's volume when switching from radio to iTunes).I didn't test any of the other functionality (audio jack, mini-disc output) since I didn't care.

This was not one of the better ones. I forced myself to read the first few chapters, but never picked it up again. I couldn't get past the sense that Brazelton wrote with an air of egotisism when he wrote this. It sounded more like self-exaltation to me (\\"I see this [pregnancy] as the first 'touchpoint' . . .\\") than as nitty-gritty practical adivce for parents. At first I thought is was just me, but Iv'e talked to other people who have thought Brazelton seems awfully full-of-himself in this book. Brazelton is, however, one of the leading authorities on infant development, and a very gentle, family-centered physician.

I did not learn anything from the story, I did not gain any insight, I do not think about things differently any more. This book just reminds me of a cartoon series because of the different short stories. I would have found this book infinitely more interesting if it focused on say the stories \\"Robbie\\" or \\"Reason\\".

But by today's standards, these stories are pretty weak, and no robot can distract from the substandard writing.Subject matter aside, the characters are even worse. Flat and unrealistic, with dialogue that sounds like it was written by a 7th grader, I found myself hating many of them not because that was the author's intent, but simply because I couldn't stomach the cheesy things they said!All in all, I would recommend that you pass on this one, unless you're just curious to see what passed for science fiction in the early days."},{"rating":"1","title":"the mind and character of a robot","review":"this book isnt great--written in the 50's--it really doesnt hold up these daysthe characters are too flat in descriptioni would pass on this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"This book was an excellant excersize in understanding the possible problems and solutions to the inevitable technology of Robots.

Each story revolves around some type of Robot dilemma usually involving conflicts regarding around their ethical codes otherwise known as the three laws of robotics.I highly recommending reading this first before jumping into Asimov's fantastic robot series. It's a fine example of Asimov's unique style that can only be summarizes as \\"intellect over action\\".

His ability to give such robots \\"life\\" is unmatched and will probably remain so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, as always","review":"Asimov 's insight into a possible future with robots is phenomenal and thought-provoking. His writing style draws in the reader, making them want more. Luckily, this book is just the beginning of the Robot series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Asimov short-stories","review":"If you've never read Asimov this is a good book to introduce you his robot series. This collection of robot stories that appeared in several magazines in the 50's are entertaining and clever. Asimov's style as usual is flowing and engaging. The stories deal basically with diverse situations that provoke peculiar behavior in robots. They are almost little mysteries that the characters need to understand and resolve. Drunk robots, crazy robots, religious robots...take your pick. It all makes sense in the end and Asimov is extremely careful in always working along the rules he sets in the beginning. In short, very entertaining and undoubtedly a classic. These are the stories that created the way in which we see robots today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Science Fiction Novel?","review":"This is simply the best science fiction novel I have ever read. It is well written, I stayed interested in every story / plot, and some of the characters were really enjoyable, especially Mike and Greg. The stories keep getting better and better throughout the book as well, Asimov starts out with simpler stories, then they get more complex toward the end. Not only is it a straight up enjoyable novel from 'majority reader' perspective, but the underlying concepts and meaning in the book, as well as the layering and intricacies of the plots, are actually pretty brilliant, and worthy of serious appraisal.I would love to find another science fiction story as good as this one, sadly I have not been able to do so. As I am more of a fantasy fan, my experience in science fiction is not as grand as fantasy, but I have read my share of them. If anyone could suggest some really good science fiction novels I would really appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Robot","review":"Of all the scifi novels I have read over the last 20+ years, I Robot, stands out as the basis of all scifi novels that have come after it. I cannot get I Robot out of my head and have re-read it several times. It is the basis of all sci-fi. Who has not read scifi and reads scifi, does not know the rules? It is in every scifi novel about robots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it before you see the movie","review":"I, Robot is actually a group on nine short stories that describe the early history of robots, as developed by the great Isaac Asimov via the guise of an interview with Dr. Susan Calvin, the robopsyhcologist that worked for United States Robotics. The stories are all built around the three laws that robots must follow (which many other reviewers discuss, and so I will refrain from here).The movies really has little to do with the books, from what the trailers show. The character that Will Smith plays does not exist in any of the short stories. Also, at the time the movie takes place, in the books, robots are not allowed on Earth.Regardless, understanding the premise of robotics and how and why robots act as they do, will almost certainly be greatly enhanced by your reading of this quick and fun book. Then, you can read some of the other Asimov robot series (Robot Dreams, Caves of Steel, Naked Sun, Robots of Dawn)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I enjoyed this book and recommend it for those interested in the evolution of science fiction. There's a distinct quaint flavor to scifi from around this time, the 40s, with the idealistic hopes of the era giving its fiction a positive, optimistic resonance. There are many laugh-out-loud moments in this book at the eccentricities of the robot characters, as well as some quirky reflections of human kind. It may not be for everyone, for those who like sagas of high drama and tension, but if you're after some thought provoking fun, this is a good place to find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For New Readers of Science Fiction","review":"This is a great book for someone wanting to get familiar with one of the great writers in SF.

I found that this book was not nearly as suspensful as I expected it would be, and there was no major climax at the end of the book. This book consists of several short stories that are connected by two main characters. Each story is about a different robot and a different conflict. It just did not appeal to my liking, mostly because of the way this book was written. I also like books with more action, suspense, and an exciting ending, and in my opinion \\"I, Robot\\" had none of these things. I did not feel like the book was interesting enough to keep turning the pages to see what was going to happen next. I have read other Science Fiction books that I have enjoyed much more than Mr. Asimov's book \\"I, Robot\\".

Read \\"The Complete Robot\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nerds go crazy!!","review":"I was thinking this book would be awesome seeing the movie previews and all, but this book was a bit of a let down.It's more like a bunch of stories that are loosely connected by something like an interview or something.The series might pick up in the other books, but I, Robot is kinda boring, so why would you want tobuy the others? Of course!You're some kind of nerd!The stories in I, Robot are boring andstart to get repeatative. Super robot gets invented,people who made robot screw up,robot goes crazy and threatens humanity. That sounds almost exciting, right? No, the robot harms no one, no bloodshed, no gore, plain clean boredom. If I had seen the movie, my expectations may have been higher, therefore my score would most likely be lowered. So, after reading this, if you still want to by it, you either want it to go to sleep, or you're a nerd."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's that I smell? It's the garbage that is I, Robot.","review":"OK, for the life of me, I cannot understand how Asimov has come to be revered as a great of science fiction. The dialog in this book is so overly simplistic one would think it's targeted for a grade school student. (Hmmm...On second thought, that's an insult to all grade-schoolers out there.) Characters are predictably dramatic, and the plots (yes, plots...this is a series of short stories, not a novel) definitely cross the line (and make leaps and bounds into the land) of ludicrousness. Case in point: The robot that reads minds, and has a conversation with a roboticist about the fact that she's in love with another roboticist. (Are you serious here, Izzy?!!!)In short, don't buy this garbage. Opt for any of Arthur C. Clarke's books instead. (Childhood's End, for example, would be an excellent alternative.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! Enlightening! Delightful!","review":"I love this book!

Im using them for 72mm filters and the filters are secure inside the pouch and the material seems like it wont scratch the filters.However, I would only recommend this pouch if it was to live inside another gear bag.

I often wonder whether I have translated a sentence correctly because it does not make sense in English. For anyone familiar with Wheelocks concise, clear, and generally wonderful grammatical appendices, this book will be quite a shock -- the verbs are not arranged in anything even resembling a clear order, and all of the headings are in the same typeface, which makes them difficult to find on the page. A much better text, particularly for independent study, is the Joint Association of Classical Teachers' _Reading Greek_ series, which has a companion book specifically designed for independent study. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introductory Greek text.","review":"Anne Groton is to be congratulated for writing such clear explanations of Greek grammer. She is very knowledgeable and chooses vocabulary and reading selections which build rapidly to a working knowledge. Her lessons are just large enough to be digestable at a sitting. Having learned from a rather grim pre-WWI text, I truly appreciate her work, and am enjoying using it to brush up on this wonderful, flexible, and expressive language. Very strongly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"I notice that this happens all the time. A professor, whose intelligence of a subject matter is so great and profound that everyone thinks they should write a book with all the information they know. However, most people don't take into effect the fact that good intelligence is not the same as being a good educator. Like another one of the reviews stated, she may be smart, but the lay out of the book is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are superior texts to be found (God willing)","review":"I have no doubt that Dr. Groton is a top notch classical scholar but this grammar text is very, very disappointing. Most of the grammar explanations are too short and way overloaded with technical definitions. Even more frustrating are the practice sentences--they are hard to translate because when translated they hardly make sense in English! They are very convoluted and utterly uninteresting. There are selected adapted stories from Aesop in the first 25 chapters and while these may have some merit, I find them dull. I am a college student and I imagine most people who use this text are and I find the fables uninteresting. It really is a shame that a format like Wheelock's Latin could not be adapted to Greek; I think adapted sentences from Plato or Homer would be far superior to tanslating such sentences as \\"Oh Goddess, let the wise boys pursue the maidens into the sea\\" or similarly trite and contrived constructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super-low budget, multi-genre blast","review":"I wish someone would give this a proper DVD treatment.

This display comes with the highest contrast ratio I have seen in an LCD display yet; with a 700:1 ratio, they are no mistaking greys for whites or blacks.

Instead of just having central Chicago covered, it goes all the way to the city's borders, so it's great when I have to go way south or way west, or other areas I don't venture in very much. Also, it seems like thier arts listings are more comprehensive, and there's a huge new section about what to do with kids (although it seems to be targeted to the nanny-set).

Every now and again a super low budget indie film will fly way under the radar and end up being a gem... this is not one of those movies. I have no problem with the production value at all, this movie wasn't good because of the way the story was told and the acting. The premise was so cool and promising as the springboard for a quirky dark comedy, but instead it turned into an incomprehensible mess.The film ends up being overly confusing and convoluted... it just loses its way after about twenty minutes. Additionally some of the acting was quite suspect. Normally I'm not one to complain about acting, but a few spots of blatant cringe-inducing overacting forced me to take note.

However, I liked the idea of taking the thermal carafe to the table, so I bought it anyway. I'm sorry I did. The coffee is just barely hot enough to start with, and after 15 or 20 minutes in the \\"thermal\\" carafe, it is completely tepid. I will not be buying anymore Black & Decker products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Black & Decker standards...","review":"We previously owned a Black & Decker standard glass carafe coffee maker, and were extremely pleased with it. We then went through a Gevalia branded thermal carafe drip coffee machine, and loved it. When it finally quit working, we purchased this machine, and have been very disappointed. It's cheaply made, and the carafe leaks. We are constantly having to mop up drips and the carafe doesn't pour well. It makes \\"okay\\" coffee, but this product is definitely NOT up to Black & Decker standards. If you want a good drill or saw, get a Black & Decker. If you want a good coffee maker, get another brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution ! Basket spring rust and sharp fragment !","review":"I have owned this coffee maker Black and Decker TCM450B for approximately four years and the spring in the filter basket has rusted and a broken piece fell off the top of the carafe into a cup of coffee. Luckily I noticed before I swallowed the sharp rusted metal half circle. I do not have hard water or rust issues and have used and cleaned the coffee maker regulary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality!","review":"I have used the Black and Decker thermal coffeemaker for over 13 years. Good product, great company, so it was a very easy decision to order another when the one I had finally died. The only difference is the all of the previous ones had the stainless steel 'looking' carafe. At any rate, from day one, the water reservoir cover warped from the steam. The coffee filter basket does not close well and finally when you pour the coffee, you lose and spill much of it. You have to be so careful in pouring the coffee not to make a mess. One can chalk this up to user error but not in this case, this is my 4th B&D; coffeemaker of this general type and this particular one is cheaply made. I will not buy another of this brand, too bad really. :-(p.s. I typically do not feel so strongly about a product to write a review, but this is very, very poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the Dribble Coffeemaker","review":"I bought this coffeemaker to replace the older version of this. I am disappointed to say that it does not keep the coffee as hot as the old one, and the buttons for setting the time, etc. are incredibly sensitive, so be careful when you're wiping off the counter!!The biggest disappointment is that it is like a \\"dribble glass\\".

The thermal carafe began leaking and we originally thought is was just dribbling when pouring. Then it began pouring--out of the bottom seam and also the bottom. Obviously, the glass insert was cracked.

You guys at Amazon really know how to keep customers! Thanks.Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe great: Coffee Maker Poor","review":"I bought this machine for the carafe. Since my husband and I get up two hours apart, I wanted a way to store coffee withough burning it. That part of the machine works great. What doesn't work great is just about everything else. The water storage compartment leaks all over the counter. The off/on button broke just after a few uses. The lid to the carafe has to be balance perfectly in order to screw on - hard to do first thing in the morning. If the grounds basket is not snapped perfectly in place it swings open during brewing. Very disapppointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"Some reviewers said this was very cheaply made and they were right.

This machine is definitely going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"After owning an earlier model of this unit, one that lasted and lasted, I was so satisfied that I bought the TCM450B no questions asked. What a mistake! When I got it home it didn't even turn on. I packed it up drove to the nearest store that would take it back and picked up a second. I've had it less than six months and it too quit. When it works it's fast. I like the insulated carafe. At the current sale priced now at about $20.00, that's still not a buy if you can't make coffee! If I had one that worked it would get 5-stars. My biggest mistake was not buying on credit and not saving a receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"This coffee maker is a diaster!","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer. The temperature is luke warm, it constantly drips from the bottom no matter what you do or how careful you are. I bought because it was a Black & Decker as I have had great luck in the past. They really blew it this time. Do not buy this disaster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Coffee, Bad Carafe, Molten Plastic","review":"The coffee tastes great. Too bad the carafe spills nearly every pour. Whenever I used this coffee maker, I had to make an extra cup \\"for the sink\\" since it would spill about 1/8 of what I poured.More bad news - today I went to grab my coffee carafe from the coffee maker and it wouldn't move. It turns out that the bottom surface (where the carafe sits) had melted and fused to the carafe. SCARY!I opened up the bottom of the coffee maker and could see that there was only a thin piece of heat shield between the heating element and the plastic bottom. To the untrained eye, it sure doesn't look like a very safe design.Bottom line - stay away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for the beginning actor","review":"Required book for intro acting class.

There is very little text, and it is mostly photos of couples. It's a nice blast from the past, but it should be labeled as a book of photos. The text is negligible, and doesn't add much to the book.

It is so interesting to see how styles have changed over the years. I think I'd like to see some updates and additions to this book - to include the 90's would be great, too.

The combination of his series of wild experiences along with his enthusiasm for the research puzzles he confronts made this book read almost like a double thriller. This could be read as a travel book, very much like Eric Hansen's books, with a bonus of learning a lot about nature, evolution, ecology, etc. Or, it could be read as a book of ecology and evolution with the bonus of extraordinary adventures. At first, I kept on reading the book more for the adventures and then realized that my excitement about the science was growing. I have never had a book sneak up on me in this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good!!","review":"I bought this book under the impression that it was a potryal of the life of a boy with autism. Instead, it is pretty much useless chatter by Ian's uncle about the evolution of language. He did not fully talk about Ian until about 3/4 of the way through the book.

Both the First & Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant are not for the faint of heart, but for those who like books that challenge them. Donaldson is worlds removed from the formulaic, trite swords & sorcery novels that fill up so much of the Fantasy section in bookstores. His characters all have great depth and complexity, and this makes reading his novels truly worthwhile.While I do admit that some of the books drag a little (the beginning of Lord Foul's Bane, for example), there are many moments of poignant emotion and beauty throughout. The Giants reaction to the sight of Revelstone, Covenant's caamora for the Unhomed; passages like these are a joy to read.All in all, I highly recommend all six Covenant books to anyone who is looking for thoughtful and well-written fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta be kidding me...","review":"Whoever rates this series anything better than a 5 has certainly never read david eddings, Stephen Lawhead or C.S.

Nevertheless, I was truly surprised at how good The One Tree was (equal to the Illearth War) and actaully had high hopes for the conclusion as a result. But it sucks. It drags along, is very predictable and the hero ends up being freakin' Linden Avery whom I never bonded with (she doesn't belong!).

Countless pages are devoted to describing the scenery and to describing minor conflicts that don't add anything to the story.Convenant goes on and on about the paradox of power, then when the actual finally heats, up the outcome is determined by luck or chance. There is the law of the land, there is Donaldson making up the law as he goes along. Very very weak. Overall, the characters remain one dimensional. The story is extremely predictable. But above, it's just not fun. After a while you begin to really not care about the characters. I got tired of their depression.

Throughout the six book cycle, Donaldson's grasp of the Land improves, and the world portrayed in the final three installments and the last installment in particular is far richer, more detailed, more alive, and more believable.

Every attempt to finish his movie or imitate is just unrealistic that people will say \\"Hey he is just like Bruce!\\" Tower of Death does not have the Bruce quality or realistic fighting scenes. It is made up of acrobatic moves. Unless u want to see that then go ahead rent or buy it.

It is poorly edited together and the acting is horrendous. I was also very disappointed in the choreography. They fight scenes were sluggish at best.

So not only do we start out following some Bruce Lee clone, the film kills that one off and has us follow another one thirty minutes into the story. The main reason to watch this one is when Bobby Lo fights a lion, which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, who is usually pretty awesome but his screen time is significantly small. Mainly watched this and the original Game of Death because they're a part of the Bruce Lee boxed set. It's no wonder they're included with Lee's finished works. No one would buy them otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed and very ANNOYING!!!!","review":"Ok i rented this movie thinking that it was another awesome Bruce Lee movie, but NO! it was a movie with CLIPS OF Bruce Lee movies like Enter The Dragon.

Second, the editing is very bad. They did not bother matching scenes from the stand-in's clothing to the edited footage of Bruce Lee. One of the reasons I bought this DVD was because Yuen Wo-ping choreographed the fight scenes. He has done many films including \\" Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon \\". And a chance to see his choreography with Bruce Lee would have been amazaing. Unfortunately, all you get is mediocre choreography with bad actors.

Armstrong brings up the idea that if werewolves are real, why not vampires, shamans, sorcerers, Vodoun (voodoo) priests, half-demons and witches?Elena finds herself in the midst of a crowd of Otherworldians (my word, not the author's) and using all of her intellect and instincts to overcome the bad guys and regain her freedom. Armstrong does a great job of making the reader feel the captives' frustration and anger. By the end of the book, *I* wanted to kill Winsloe (and I'm sure you will, too!)All in all, another great installation in a very clever series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitten","review":"Bitten is truely one of the best books I have ever read. It's full of suspense, breath-taking action and gore, and complex characters that you don't fully understand til the end of the book. A rather sweet love story in the middle of it wont hurt either! The characters feel much more intimate with the romantic addition. Kelley Armstrong is one of my favorite authors now, thanks to her addictive style of writing and astonishing detail put into not only the book and the perfection of it itself, but the reality and complexity of every single character. They all seem real. This book is the best so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"I absolutely loved Kelley Armstrong's first book \\"bitten\\" and after reading so many other novels I couldn't get into, I decided to buy the whole series.

Great to see the old WWF logo not blurred out constantly, even if the 'word' is beeped out.All in all, its a 5 star release up to about 2002, from there on things get a bit rough, but for any true WWF/E fan, this set is a must"},{"rating":"1","title":"WWE SHOULD BE ASHAME OF THE PACKAGING OF SUMMERSLAM ANTHOLOGY","review":"I recently purchased The Summerslam Anthology.I was excited to see the first 11 Summerslams which have never been released.When I opened it I was totally disgusted.The WWE has the nerve to charge 150.00 and up to 199.00 {BEST BUY} and the dvd,s are pushed into cardboard sleeves and when you try to take them out the discs become all scratched and ruined.The WWE could have placed each of the 20 discs in a thin line clam shell,but to save money they place them in these cardboard holders and the discs become ruined.What a shame to have a classic dvd set like Summerslam become ruined over the packaging.If you are a collector like myself I would say skip The Summerslam Anthology as all your discs will be ruined when you try and remove them.WWE should get smartScott denny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Club Classics, Not Radio Hits","review":"Dan Kelly mentioned in his review that there were no major \\"hits\\" on this CD. This is not a rehash of the same tired selections on a dozen other compilations, but rather lesser known club classics. The selections span about eight to ten years and many of them are from the 80s, after the decline of \\"disco\\" and the emergence of dance clubs. The music changed and this is an accurate reflection of those times. I was a club DJ in the Boston area back then, and these are the songs the crowds were dancing to - maybe not in every club, but in the best clubs where the music was increasingly diverse.I understand the \\"Club Epic\\" and \\"Club Columbia\\" series are out of print now.

Also some interesting points on sake and other resources.

Some of them are long, but while I'm on the diet, sometimes I want to cook something that tastes really really good. And this book has great taste if you like great taste. Some of the ingredients are exotic, and hard to find, but the book tells where to find all the ingredients, most locally.The other 5 star raw food books(the ones I read) aren't worth 5 stars. This one is, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful people, exotic recipes, but not entry-level","review":"I read this book but was glad I didn't purchase it sight-unseen. I am a newer entry into raw-foodland, and the \\"real world\\" reference in the title is very misleading. This is the book you want to buy *after* you've gotten your feet wet, committed fully to the life, mastered all the basics, and have the time, equipment, and resources to take it to the next level. Honestly, I found Ani Phyo's book to be much more useful, down-to-earth, and realistic for the everyday cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this book.","review":"This is a beautiful and unique cookbook that inspires you to get in the kitchen. I NEED pictures of food when I am cooking and this book delivers. There is picture after picture of creative recipes that look and taste delicious.I have only made a few things from this cookbook because the recipes take quite a bit of prep time at first but once you've made them a couple of times it's a piece of cake because you know what needs to be soaked or dehydrated in advance. My husband and I are hoping to eat completely raw once summer begins and we have a little more time to plan our meals.I'd say this cookbook was a purchase I am very happy with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book, but please stick to black print on white paper","review":"This book is a great read, as well as being beautiful to look at.I havn't tried any of the recipes yet, as they all look like I will have to do a lot of hunting and prepping before attempting.My only gripe is the color on color print. I am having such a hard time reading yellow words on an orange page, or white on black.Is it just me?I would much prefer, if the printing was not so hidden in color.Otherwise, so far the book is great.If the recipes pan out, I may come back and give it an extra half star.

No other book has transformed my thinking as quickly as this one. The Spicy Thai Vege Wraps were wonderful and I love NOT COOKING anymore!

In spite of that, I'm buying copies for all my friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book.... more than just recipes","review":"I bought this book for the recipes as I am new to RAW eating, and was really only a 'vegan' (I do on occasion eat fish) for a short time, so I wanted to learn more and a friend of mine who follows the 80 / 20 rule and is a vegan pastry chef recommended this book for the recipes. I found that it covers more than just recipes, its a journey and one that helps enlighten the reader and guide you on a magical path to something completely new and exciting. I am not a strict raw / vegan foodie, but I am conscious of my health and Sarma doesn't preach, nor is she hard core, she is just educational and excited about food... brilliant book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Savory and inspiring recipes!","review":"I recently purchased this book and was immediately struck by the gorgeous photographs and mouth-watering recipes. Some are time-consuming, but Sarma and Matthew also provide quick recipes and advice for preparing raw food on the go. The organization and tasting/preparation notes make this book a great starting point for innovating in your raw (or vegan, or cooked, or ANY) kitchen. There is also a resource list in the back that directs the reader to sources for less common ingredients. These recipes will amaze you with their complexity and depth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nonsensical people!!","review":"Well.. I ordered this book as a creative guide into raw foodism after reading all the reviews describing the MILLIONAIRE you have to be to afford a dehydrator.

There are usually many different aspects to one dish, such as a dehydrated part, a sauce, a main dish and a garnish. The book does have beautiful illustrations and good info about raw foods, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are just beginning a raw foods lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really the real world of raw food","review":"I got this book because it is my friend's favorite but I haven't yet made a recipe from it and I bought it in August.

But I'm not too impressed by the book, sorry to my friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not practical, way too time consuming","review":"This book is beautifully put together, but wow WAY too time consuming. It's been sitting on my shelf for years now because the recipes are too complicated. This would be a good book if you were planning a fancy dinner party and wanted to show non-raw eaters that raw food can be better tasting than they think. But for day-to-day recipes, this is not a great option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done","review":"This book is done beautifully, but the recipes are far too complex for me. I like recipes that require less ingredients, less machines, and less of a mess in the kitchen. If you want to spend a lot of time, this is a good book, and designed with good taste. One flaw is that the white writing is sometines written on light backgrounds and is hard to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raw Food for the Rich World","review":"If you have an unlimited budget and time, this book is for you. If you have access to, or like ordering specialty items, then rejoice, for you have found the right raw food book. If you LOVE coconut, and don't mind that the average recipe calls for 6 or 7 to be chopped open on your countertop with a machete (at $2 per coconut), then you have found paradise. I'm sure that all of the recipes taste wonderful, but I'm likely never to know. I did enjoy the read but this book will probably collect dust from here forward. I've never met a book so ineptly named. I'm guessing the chefs have never lived in the \\"real world\\", or were paid an average salary either!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"Spectacular book! One of the best raw food books I've ever purchased--and I have about 12! I loved the photography and recipes, but equally impressive are the writings on the authors' personal experiences and philosophies regarding raw food. Although it's embarassing to admit, I, too, have had certain mournings regarding giving up beautiful cooking utensils/pots, cookbooks, and meat, though I know I feel so much better on raw food. I appreciate that the authors comment on these issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book has great photos in it and comes across as hands-on and informed.

As an emphatic Bunny Wailer fan, I bought this DVD with the highest expectations. Boy, was I disappointed. The special \\"guest\\" footage is some nameless Japanese band performing from a totally different concert. Then the reggae starts. Heaven help us! The whole concert is extremely amateurish to be polite. The sound quality and picture quality are abysmal. The songs performed by the legendary Bunny Wailer himself are wonderful songs, but please, this is a terrible presentation. There are countless skips and cuts and the camera angles are ridiculous. One can't help but wonder at the authenticity of this production. Please, save your money. The great Bunny Wailer deserves better treatment.Smash B"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off at it's worst","review":"I also bought this DVD and totally agree with others that this was the worst rip-off I have ever come across.

This movie is a special favorite of mine. I'm so glad I bought it to add to my collections! This movie rolls off the screen without any lags or slow parts in between.

It started listing pretty bad and the pump that fuels the water cannon completely flooded the hull. Do not waste your money.

Her mother and father had an association with an occult group during WWII and had somewhat to do with events similar to those portrayed in the book. Katherine Kurtz was given her mother's diary and papers by Dolores. Katherine returned them to her, along with the galley proof of the book, saying, \\"You'll need a box of tissues handy when you read this.\\"And you, the reader, may well do so also. While a fictional book, there are strong, true esoteric underpinnings to the story. That is why it works so well, resonates so well, reads so well. Having spoken with both Dolores and Katherine about this book, I will say it is indeed, 'more than fiction'. Which, of course, makes it all the more delicious. I re-read it about once a year.Find this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fiction at it's best","review":"Katherine Kurtz does a wonderful job at recreating history and pondering what could have been. She looks into the lives of people desperate to save England at the height of the Battle of Britain. She explores what it must have been like to be a member of the Royal family devestated by the abdication of Edward VIII and the impending invasion of Britain. Her historical research into the Order of the Garter,the death of Thomas a' Becket - Archbishop of Canterbury,and other historical references is as accurate as historians can agree.

We saw them several times live. We couldn't help it.This 2 CD set truly is a EXCELLENT intro or reminder of the fun and power, not only music but intellectually, of Fishbone. The first CD covers the standard 'best set' from their albums. I love not needing to carry several CD cases now to get my Fishbone fix.The second CD is an excellent reminder collection for those fans who were actually there to collect this music, or for those fans who would like more Fishbone to play with!This album does NOT portray Fishbone as the excellent live band they are. See them in concert for that!This album does NOT cover ALL their great music.

This two-disc set really isn't worth the money considering there's several (inferior) demo versions of \\"Lying\\", \\"Modern Industry\\", and \\"Party at Ground Zero\\" wasting valuable disc space. 101 is definitely a sampler for those afraid to jump into the Fishbone catalog. With all the songs spread over these discs, there sure is a lot of filler. I suppose Columbia doesn't want to give Fishbone soldiers bang for their buck. There's no way that \\"Love and Bullsh*t\\" and \\"Scrooge\\" can compete with the simple synth beauty of \\"In the Air\\" and the \\"Many Millions\\" which is just as good as \\"Fight the Youth\\".

BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good collection that misses too much","review":"This is a nice collection, but be warned that CD2 is mostly rare tracks and B-sides that might only be of serious interest to Fishbone afficianados.CD1 is a mash up of most of their early work and hits.So, here's the rub... You miss some of the best songs off \\"Truth and Soul\\", a great album, as well as \\"The Reality of My Surroundings\\". Both albums are worth owning in their entirety. This compilation is like reading chapters of great novels.For the cost of this CD, you could score both CD's used, and have enough left over to maybe even squeeze in Chim-Chim's Revenge.I think Bruce McCullough said it best: \\"Best of albums are for housewives and middle schoolers\\". The used CD's are cheap, and you get the offbeat tracks as a bonus.Fossil Fuelin' is a great addition for the Dedicated Fishheads, but as \\"collection\\" in one Jewel Case fails miserably.

It looks to me like this has really gone to NDW's head, which isn't surprising I guess. The other books had the ring of authenticity. Whether it was \\"God\\" or not talking, who knows, but the spiritual teachings therein felt right, true, real. This one has NONE of that. Sure, it has some good 'truths' in it, but nothing you can't get with a lot more juice and fun and sense of wonderment in the original three books. I see others love this one too, what can I say.

Due to the fact that I found it under the \\"Christianity\\" section of the religious books, I assumed that I was purchasing a Christian-based book. I couldn't have been more wrong.First of all, the author is redundant. I don't need someone to condescendingly explain themselves more than once; it's an insult to my intelligence. Secondly, what is \\"Christian\\" about this book? Absolutely nothing! We are all God? That alone debases what Christianity is about. I was also amazed that he grouped Jesus in along with Ghandi, Buddah, and the Dalai Lama.Another thing I particularly appreciated was his permission for the reader to disagree with his beliefs.

He has a very deep voice like those commercial-readers on TV and he talks in a very intense and dramatizing fashion. I guess he is trying to sound like god himself, but the result is just irritating. Please do not use commercial-readers for future audio-books. I also love to listen to Deepak Chopra. He could set the example on how to read in a more soft and neutral way which pays respect to the content."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best so far","review":"Like many of the others who have written their thoughts about the lastest in the CWG series, I found this one to have the most personally profound enlightenment for my own place in the search for who I am.

That confirms each of us are One and we can certainly make a major difference in our own experience and of the world also, if we choose to.Points are repetatively introduced from many different perspectives.

It arrived turned on, thus reducing its battery life and the battery is one of those hard to locate fat circles.

I contacted Plano and several emails later they instructed me to return the case to the factory where they replaced it with another case of equal or greater value. The case I received in return has a plastic zipper vs. the metal one on the original case, which I surmised would be far more durable. I must admit that there is FAR less chance it will beat up my firearm, I just am not sure how long the plastic zipper will endure. I must admit, although I was less than satisfied with my original purchase, Plano DID make every effort to make it right in a timely manner and make me a \\"Happy Camper\\"!Kudos Plano!"},{"rating":"2","title":"helpful","review":"Never would have related divorce to a 12 step program but I guess love is an addiction.

The \\"heroine\\" of this tale (I use this term very loosely) was boring and uninteresting and frankly also kind of easy. The other characters in the book weren't much better. None of them were developed past a name and physical description. The action sequences were bumbling and the subplot confusing.

Adding Jennifer to the duo just made them that much more uninteresting. I'm not sure where Alex's political friend was supposed to fit in the story. It seemed like a chapter from another book got mixed up in this story. I would have preferred more follow up with the murders than all the dialogue between Alex and her Alzheimer ridden father.

Put simply, the author tries too hard in creating these characters, all of whom are indescribably complex. There is no way to get a handle on anybody. If he would have backed off a little bit, the characters would have become more believable. The finale was solid, but maybe because I was so glad to get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"a well executed murder mystery...","review":"'Body Language' is my first book by James Hall and it certainly won't be my last. The interwoven story about a woman who is chasing a serial killer and in turn is chased by others is well told. The characterizations are fine, and the dialogue is crisp and often quite funny. The author captures the Miami setting perfectly. My only quibble has to do with the ending; the author ties everything up to nicely, which is to say he has taken a story that was somewhat believable and made it totally unbelievable.Bottom line: a storyline that seems vaguely familiar but has rarely been captured better.

Even Mr. Parkhill, the god-like teacher, can't help but be infected by Mr. Kaplan's unique interpretations of the great works of English literature--the Shakespeare story was a classic.

I wondered if I would still enjoy the book as much, or laugh as hard, as I did when I first read it.Without a doubt, this book has staying power. It has lost none of its charm or humor or compassion.

It only adds to the revenues.I stopped buying the books after book 8. If I jump from there to the last book (when will that be???)

No surprises. It didn't explain anything new, answer any questions, or really fill in any gaps. At least not to me. But, that may be because it has been years since I read the first book in this series. If the author is going to write, prequels or sequels, that's fine, but finish the story that was started a decade and a half ago. There are thousands of storylines which can be developed into thousands of books just from the sheer scope of this series. But, after over 15 years and about 8,000 pages later, I'm beginning to wonder if the Wheel is going to turn, ages pass, and the series come to a conclusion before the author dies.

I'm convinced he's lost his thread, and after ten books and New Spring, my towel has been thrown in.Allow me to end with this: for those of you who have read George RR Martin's 'Song of Ice and Fire,' which is EXCELLENT, and want something else along the same vein, if you read Steven Erikson's 'Malazan Book of the Fallen,' you will once again be reminded that life is too short to put up with Robert Jordan when other great fantasy series eclipse anything that he's done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Prequal","review":"New Spring, is... different to say the most.

Really the story line isn't very interesting. In the start a foretelling says that the Dragon is reborn in so many words.It is an okay book and I would still read it, but no new plot elements are introduced and I would rather read the end of the series than a prequel.

I read the first 8 of the series, and it gradually lost its way. After finishing \\"Path of Daggers\\", I realized that absolutely nothing had happened over the course of several hundred pages. Oh wait-women adjusted their skirts a few hundred times and talked about how \\"wool-headed\\" men are, and Rand had about 500 conversations with his inner, psychotic split personality. We also heard about how when he uses the power it feels \\"tainted\\", blah blah blah.This series would've been great if it had ended after 5-6 books.

For me, this novel gives much insight to Moiraine as a character, making her untimely end with Lanfear that much more profound, while leaving room for her to develop into the Aes Sedai we know from the Eye of the World. In terms of style, its refreshing to have a book that focuses on a few well known characters and a simple plot rather than the convoluted story lines in the last few books of the Wheel of Time. Definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far better than Book Ten","review":"After painfully following the stagnation of the Wheel of Time series in the last few books, I was glad that Robert Jordan came out with ths fresh prequel. It lends insight into the past of many of the main characters and manages to recapture some of the excitement of the earlier books. One could, with reason, accuse Jordan of milking a commercial success (as David Eddings has) with endless prequels and sequels and adventures had by peripheral characters. At the same time, for those of us who appreciate the enterprise of constructing a rich world full of well developed characters, this kind of offshoot from the main project is entertaining and well worth the detour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Excellent book with wonderful insights to Moraine and Lan while they were still 'Young'.

Great Book though WELL worth the buy.Would recommend Modesitt or George Martin to keep you satisfied why Jordan gets to business!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FAN TIRED OF BEING RIPPED OFF!","review":"ROBERT JORDAN SHOULD REREAD HIS FIRST SEVEN BOOKS.THEN MAYBE HE'LL BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THE CHARACTERS AND STORY LINE TO IT\\"S RIGHTFUL END.WORD TO THE WISE RJ ;STOP RIPPING OFF WHAT READERS YOU HAVE LEFT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"When my wife told me that another book was just released I was in suspense and eager to get my hands on it.For those of you who've read the last couple of books in the series, this will seem like an entire year wasted on a book that could have been written after the series was finished.The male source is finally clean. And while we're salivating for the final battle to commence, he writes a story about Novices going on an adventure.Thoroughly disgusted, I cannot bear to read any more of his books until he gets his act together and stops writing about snotty Novices, Accepted and power junkie Aes Sedai scheming and whining about how every single nit picking detail is or should be done in, around or for the White Tower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a test to see how far he can push his fans?","review":"The saddest part is that in an interview that he gave years ago he said that he has had the ending of the series ready since day one. It just seems so pathetic to me that he is dragging this series on seemingly to test those of us who have been reading since the beginning (joyfully through 1997 and painfully since then). I feel like a drug addict in that I know that the book is going to be crap but I read it anyway because I hope that it will be as good as when I first started.While this is not a bad story and almost seems like he is getting back to his original style it really ticks me off that he came out with a prequel (which I of course bought and now feel like I am just encouraging him to drag this out as long as he can)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull prequal","review":"New Spring, is... different to say the most. The only interesting part of the book is the perspectives of the story line. I did like the way Jordan Robert used perspectives of characters' rarely used before. Getting to \\"know\\" the characters minds is the only reason I would read this book if I've already read the rest of the series.The book is about Moraine and Siuan finding the Dragon Reborn. Really the story line isn't very interesting. In the start a foretelling says that the Dragon is reborn in so many words.It is an okay book and I would still read it, but no new plot elements are introduced and I would rather read the end of the series than a prequel. The plot is already moving too slowly in the series. I suggest reading New Spring anyway, especially if you've not read any of the Wheel of Time series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing read for the WOT","review":"I must say, I think this book is a relief to Mr. Jordan. After so many novels with amazingly complex plotlines, he was beginning to drag, but with this book, it feels like he's taking a break from the Wheel while actually filling in backstory.Let me clarify: the book has only two plotlines. Yup, two. And here he weaves them together very well, and the pace is excellent! I in all seriousness could not put the book down. Jordan is such an excellent author, one of the best I've ever read.I would give this book about 4 1/2 stars, since it is just not as ambitious as the longer main novels, and also since the first half of Moiraine's thread is heavily influenced by a certain other popular character in a school trianing in the use of magic.The story is simplistic, but (as with all of Jordan's work) SUPERBLY written, and this keeps it interesting in scenes that other authors wouldn't be able to write.Very much recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Jordan or Martha Stewart?","review":"This book is garbage unless you like chapters of descriptions of room decorations and fashions. Wheres the story? Theres barely a couple of paragraphs mentioning what is the whole reason for the book, and the rest is all about what the women are wearing, or what the decorations are in each room they are in, in horrible monotonous detail. In between we are treated to the interpersonal relationships of the women in even more boring detail. Its a soap opera. I put the book down after reading half. I am disappointed that I even spent money on it. Unfortunatly the Wheel of Time series has turned into the Ladies Home Journal for the feminist dominatrix interior decorator fashion lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop buying this crap","review":"Bad enough that he did not finish the series, but now he wants you to pay to read prequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please wrap it up","review":"I agree that Mr Jordan should not be releasing sequels before the series is finished.

PLEASE end OUR misery!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored....","review":"When I first picked up the Eye of the World, I didn't know what to expect. I was captivated by Jordan's smooth writing style that keeps you turning pages. As I progressed into the series into books 6-7 I felt Jordan needed to wrap it up soon, he was getting long winded and the story wasn't going anywhere. So I figured I would just wait until the end of the series to pick it up again. But Jordan wants to milk a cow that is out of milk. From the reviews I have read on amazon.com I am not the only one thinking Jordan should finish the series in 1, 2, 3 books at the most. I think the reason it sometimes takes him 2-3 years to write a book is that he is out of ideas. So he writes a short(by his standards) prequel to hold the reader of. He now numbers 2 or 3 prequels but the end is still no where in site. Do yourself a favor, save your money, wait until the entire series is finished, then buy the entire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was shocked","review":"I have stuck with Jordan for year after year after year. I have collected all of the WOT series in hardback. Like many of you I have grown very bored and disillusioned by the direction the series has taken. Needless to say I was dumbfounded as to why when we are all hoping for a dot on the horizon to show us that the end is near, here comes a _prequel_???? Unbelievable. See you in 2 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"How about finishing what has become a overly-bloated series before starting a three book prequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"****ARGGHHHH****","review":"I broke my New Year's resolution!

A prequel to a series that has not been finished yet. Wow. All i can think is that Mr. Jordan only has eyes on his check book and filling it faster.

It sheds some light on the customs of the borderland countries and goes into depth on the final test to become Aes Sedai. I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop, will you?","review":"I believe it was purported that Robert Jordan had the ending already pictured when he started writing the series.For someone who already has the ending in mind, you would think that a prequel might be something that you may want to consider after FINISHING THE ORIGINAL SERIES?Or has the author forgotten to mention certain details that we need to know? For someone who has written over 1,700 characters (historical and present -- yes, it's true, COUNT THEM), you would think that he had all his bases covered.Or maybe the emperor has no clothes.Get on with it, Mr. Jordan. If you have seen the ending, then write TOWARDS it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the recent novels.","review":"I actually enjoyed this prequel, which surprised me, since the most last few books of the series have bored me to death. Jordan got back to the roots of the story, and in doing that he got back to what was enjoyable about it. There weren't so many characters and plots going on in this book that the pace had to be slowed to a couple days through the entire novel, like the most recent full length books, and you learned a great deal more about Moraine and Lan. Lan is one of my favorite characters and I like Moraine a great deal more now.I wish Jordan could go back and re-write his world from book 5 or 6 on, in the same style. His most recent book, Crossroads of Twilight, I waited until it came out in paperback then I ... skimmed it... I SKIMMED a Jordan book! *sigh*. I just couldn't stand to slog through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finish off the story","review":"Please, Please, no one buy any more of this guys books until he finishes off his Wheel of time novels.

NO MORE RJ until he finishes what he started!@@&^(*#$^"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper pulp","review":"This book is a flimsy attempt at continuing RJ's one story career. Running out of delaying tactics, and facing the realization that the story must now be drawn to a close, Jordan stoops to writing a 'prequel'; delaying for yet another year the conclusion of what was once a great story. Its dull and adds very little to the story-that-will-never-die. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK - WAIT UNTIL IT HITS THE USED BOOK STORE. Its only worth the dollar you'll be charged for it there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful","review":"This book was just wonderful. The fact that it was SOMETHING that had to do with the world that I've grown to know and love made this book fantastic. I wish this story would go on forever. I don't want it to end. I always want there to be more waiting for me to read. I hesitate to even start other books because I long for more of Robert Jordan's genius and the characters I know and love so much. If I had to give one critisism, it is that the book wasn't long enough. If I could have it my way, each book would be five thousand pages long and there would be fifty books in the series. It is so precious to me. I am in agony waiting for the next book to be published."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Fenimore Cooper JR","review":"Having been thrilled with the Sword of Truth series I opted to read A Wheel of Time.This book was a disaster. I couldn't make it past chapter 3.

It was by Robert Jorden. QED it was pointless and endless. So why start?Fortunately I abandoned ship around book 8. I'm sorry I left it so long. You too can leave this hapless author behind.I sympathise with authors who do not have the skill to finish a book or series well: I despise this author who appears too scared to even try!PS. There is no other author alive whose book I would leave feedback on without reading it first.

Time to trade his books in and make room on the shelf for another author."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad...","review":"I read all of Robert Jordan's books, and even when he releases his next book, I will buy it and read it. But this book is just a reprinted story that they are charging more money for. If you want to read it, just buy Legends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good background that I appreciated.","review":"Well I think that RJ has not lost his magic and that people just don't like delayed gratification. There is a lot more going on than people seem to see. The calm before the storm as it were. Anyhow this book was fine read, it was interesting to find out more background on Siuan, Moiraine, and Lan. We got to see mroe inside their heads, to understand where they are coming from which I think was somewhat lacking in those characters in the WoT. You get a better understanding of the why and how they became the way they are in present WoT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment from RJ","review":"I swore that I was giving up on the WOT series after Crown of Swords and probably should have quit before that. I simply got tired of reading 500 pages where absolutely nothing happened. Two weekends ago I found hard covers of Winter's Heart and Crossroads of Twilight and an 11 CD audiobook of New Spring, The Novel in a discount store's cut rate discount bin. None was more than $5.95.That alone should tell you everything you need to know about where RJ belongs. All I can say is, \\"What a disappointment.\\" Unless you find these in a discount bin like I did, save your money. I am convinced that if his characters were real the wise women would take RJ out behind the shed and beat him silly.Very little entertainment value here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finish the Series First","review":"Mr. Jordan is off on another tangent again. I started to read the series right after the second book came out. This was over 10 years ago and still no end in sight. I suggest that readers find an alternative series to read, one which is complete or will be completed soon rather than committing to over 10,000 pages of rambling. The first book was one of the best fantasy books written, but they continued to loose steam until they became unreadable.If Mr. Jordan needs the cash, I suggest he writes a synopsis of the first dozen books, so people like me, who have complete lost the thread can catch up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again?!?","review":"I enjoyed this book, and I enjoy the Wheel of Time. I do agree with many that the last few books have been pretty bad, and don't move along at all.This book, however, explains many things I wanted to know (the test for Aes Sedai) and fills in details about things only hinted at.It's nice to see firsthand the search for the Dragon from Moiraine's point of view, to see how it all began and came to pass. Maybe it's just another marketing scheme, but at least this book was worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Spring","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviever Chuckyb.I so enjoyed this series for years. So much so that I went back and bought them all in hardcover and re-read them several times.That was until a couple of agonizing chapter-novels ago when I realized this would never end. What's with reborn-ing all the killed off Chosen? Who's who now? I bought the last one a year ago and never read it, the dissapointment would crush me. By the way if you had read them all Chuck... you would know Rand is a son of a runaway Andoran Queen and an Aiel buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP!!!! NO MORE PREQUELS","review":"What's the point of writing a prequel when half your fan base is clamoring for the Wheel of Time series to end.

Go read the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series by George R.R. Martin, they seem to actually be going somewhere and get better with each new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"It's hard to believe that after 10 progessively worse books, there are still people who will give a prequel novel a good rating. Despite the fact that there may be a change of pace in this book, it can't, in any way, redeem the fact that this so-called author has managed to waste thousands of pages with completely useless text. It is people such as him that cause the rest of the literary world to have little or no respect for the fantasy genre. The end could never justify the means of this series. Taking entire novels to supposedly build up the suspense is the mark of a charlatan. He's only after one thing at this point. Stop giving this man a chance. You'll simply find yourself having lost precious hours as well as your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here we are....","review":"I'm glad I get to read about the past, because little is known about Moiraine and Lan.It has all the elements that the previous books had and I really enjoyed it. I saw connections that told me some things about the future. The only problem is, this doesn't really get the story anywhere, and want to know the future as well, so that's why this has 4 stars.To the people who voted one star, they really shouldn't be complaining. If you're sick and tired, how did you even like him in the first place? Jordan writes this way, and I'm fine with it. Prepare yourselves, because it's going to be a long wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reccomended","review":"I read New Spring several years ago, and I remember enjoying it greatly. Same old complaints (and there are some complaints), but if you can get beyond them it really is a remarkable world and an excellent break from the extreme complications in the later books. I think this is why Robert Jordan wrote it; it is so complex, and this novel is a break from all that. It's short, too. If you like Robert Jordan's style, The Wheel of Time universe or anything else about WoT books, you'll love the prequel. I enjoy the fact that it focuses on Aes Sedai, and happy that the main character is Moiraine! Go for it, you won't be sorry. Check your library if you're worried that it will be a waste of money (which it certainly won't be)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but useless","review":"This is a good book, a nice little quick romp through...whatever the land is called. However, why a prequel?? All the fans care about is the continuing adventures of Rand and company. We want to see it end.

I found this Novel refreshing and captivating and enjoyed each chapter. The early lives of Lan, Moiraine and Siuan was a nice paced storyline. I found myself searching each chapter for persons I recognized from the WoT series. I was not aware of this book until I received it for my birthday last week. What a wonderful surprise, I look forward to Book 11 and any others Mr. Jordan would like to share at his own speed. This novel was a great filler and answered questions I didn't know I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"While I like the Moraine character, as I read this book I kept wondering when something would actually happen. It was nice to get a glimpse of the character's before they assumed the roles that we know them for, but we barely get any actual conflict until the end of the book. This is such a stark contrast to Jordan's earlier books which were action packed and yet still maintained the intrigue that got us hooked.I hope that he can manage to regain the passion he had for this series, because it's been harder and harder to get through the last couple of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"aes sedai are sooo boring","review":"the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more. i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem? why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"fyi","review":"Just for everyone's info the \\"reader from Washington\\" is actually Robert Jordan commenting on himself.

A great read! The short story version imo is a better starting point for new readers as the first 200 pages of this new version really caters to current fans more than new ones.A previous reader mentioned that there were inconsitances with characterization from the main books. What he has failed to realise is that the characters in A New Spring are twenty years younger and have not yet matured into the people we now know them as. To potray them as they are in the main series would be bad charterization.Also to all you people who gave this book a one star rating without actually having read the book...GET A LIFE! RJ is the author not you, and he will write the books when and how ever he wants. How about judging a book on its merits and not what you think of the author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my money, not my time","review":"Let me qualify my review with the fact that I did not, and will not read the book. I will explain. For years I have been reading this series, and for many of those years the series was good. Then Jordan started milking the story and dragging it on. There is now no end in site. He has shown that he can write a whole book that takes place in the last 5 minutes of the previous book. Ladies and Gentlemen Robert Jordan has sold out. To cash in even more on the story that people have to read to see how it all would end (the man is still a talented writer afterall), he has released a prequel. Jordan should have put this time and effort into finishing the series at hand. I think Jordan has lost a great many readers in the past few years, and I think this book will encourage more migration. Read Martin's Song of Fire and Ice series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop it!!","review":"Mr. Jordan, please stop writing the Wheel of Time! Its about time you rest and let us rest. Your novels are getting more and more boring, repetitive, totally absurd and without any interest. You have milked every drop of what was a wonderful series for the first three books. After that.....well, one has to be a masoquist to keep reading you."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've been holding off.... it worth reading!","review":"I have had the typical Robert Jordan experience.Read the first few books and absolutely loved them, read the next few and they were ok, kept on reading hoping something was going to happen but it's just dragged on slower and slower.I was holding off on buying New Spring for ages not wanted to get sucked in again, but finally relented a few weeks ago... and it was good.I should clarify that by saying given my low expectations after the last 4 or so books I was pleasantly suprised to see some action.So if you've read the rest but been holding off from New Spring then it's worth reading and will remind you of why you started reading the series in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!

This is one of the worst reads I can recall from a credited author. To start, it is a very boring plot. I could almost accept this as a prequel - *if* it was 4 pages long! It is painfully clear that over 200 pages of this are absolute filler.The value in character building you get from this work is moderate at best. The price you pay in reading it far exceeds the value."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Bites- boycott Jordan until he's finished","review":"I gave up on Crossroads and swore not to buy another Jordan snorer until Nynaeve yanks her braid for the last time.

Luckily I've redeemed myself by getting them into George R.R. Martin.There's not much more to say that hasn't already been written here. This series was at one time my favorite. It has fallen so low that I don't even think about it much anymore. I'm guessing that Mr. Jordan never comes to sites like this to see what his fans are saying. That's too bad because I'm sure he has lost quite a few with how the more recent books have been. Add to that the prequels and now I'm about ready to give up on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of ideas","review":"At one time the WOT series was my favorite series of all time. Now whenever I speak to a person who wants my opinion on a series they should begin I tell them to stay away from WOT. I beleive Jordan is out of ideas and he is dragging out the story. I will read his next books just as I read this book; sitting in a bookstore with my coffee by my side. I will no longer be fleeced by Mr. Jordan. \\"New Spring\\" is better than his latest two books, but I can not understand why Jordan refuses to finish WOT. The only thing I can think of is that he is out of ideas. His ship has run aground with this fantasy fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book reminded me why I keep reading the series","review":"I've been frustrated with books 7 through 10 and this book illustrated why! He's got too many characters and everyone seems to act going against what they should be doing.

After alittle on-line research, at least, 2 more presequels are due between conclusion of WOT series (estimating ~ 3 more books) Robert Jordan is averaging 2 years a book. Guess, there are ten more years to go. Really! My suggestion is to borrow it from the library like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why he's making a prequal you ask?","review":"The reason why he's making a prequal is because of the success of the LoTR movies. He realizes that there's no way he can make a movie out of the bloated, out of control storyline so he decides to make a prequal trilogy that can be told on the big screen.I think he's milking this cash cow as hard as he can... too bad, I used to think he was a great writer (well, he still is) but he doesn't have any of my respect. He doesn't care about the fans, he cares about the all powerful dollar. I can't believe at one point I wished the series never ends... now I want to see it buried and done with."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!!!","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book for any former fans of the series (which I know there are many of you). I also wouldn't recommend this book for any person looking to start the series either. This book will destroy the sense of mystery of the Aes Sedai which made the EOTW so enjoyable. Instead we get more of the same, bitchy, whiny, sniffing Aes Sedai. Heck, I'd say stay away from WOT period!!

Perhaps then he will get back on track with the actual series."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah blah blah...","review":"I stopped reading Jordan 3-4 books back and feel like I escaped some form of literary torture. Got milk? Read George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" and consider yourself liberated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than I Expected","review":"Like so many of the 1-star reviewers, I too was not thrilled that Robert Jordan had deviated from the main series to write a prequel. I've been engulfing The Wheel of Time Series since discovering it by accident several years ago, yet the last two novels have been major disappointments. That being said, New Spring was like a breath of fresh air. The novel takes us back to the early days of Moiraine Damodred and Siuan Sanche when they were just Accepted, not full Aes Sedai. In addition, we get a better understanding of Lan Mandragoran's past and how he became warder to Moiraine. Take this novel for what it is; that is, a peak at the past of very important charcters and what has motivated them to set in motion the return of the Dragon Reborn."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck was this?!","review":"I read the book. Mildly interesting but a completely unnecessary detour.I wish Jordan had applied the effort in writing this book to FINISHING THE SERIES!!Now he has passed away and someone else is \\"finishing\\" it. I anticipate disappointment. Who can match Jordan?I will try and forget this series exists.(heavy sigh)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable look at events before that fateful Bel Tine evening","review":"I really enjoyed this book as it does a fine job of painting the backdrop of happenings before \\"The Eye of the World.\\" Jordan does well here with developing the stories of Lan, Moiraine and the prophecy of the Dragon Reborn. This book is worth your time and not just filler. It is well-written, entertaining throughout and the pace never slackens. Also, it is nice to read something by Jordan that is less than 700 pages. Highly recommended to all WoT fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clothing and Landscapes.","review":"This is the last straw. Another book filled with landscapes and women's dresses. I am very disappointed with Jordan's efforts in his last few books. The series started out strong with wonderful characters and an interesting world and is now directionless. I can't believe there are good reviews of this book! If you have read the series it revealed very little that wasn't already in the previous books and really didn't give you an insight into Lan and Moiraine. The way that Lan becomes Moiraine's warder would have been very interesting but I thought that it was not developed well and was very weak. I could care less about the intricacies and intrigue of getting a dress made. What did that whole section add to the story?A prequel in a 10 book unfinished series? Ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I will admit that I saw this prequel as a shameless exercise in milking the cashcow that is WoT. It had already been published as a novella in Legends, and I didn't see the need for expansion. However, when I read it, I regretted my initial cynicism. I found the additional information about Moiraine's time as an Accepted fascinating, and thought the novella worked better for being expanded to full length.My only gripe was that I wanted more Lan! I felt that the account of his time at the Battle of Shining Walls/Blood Snows was very brief, and could have been a compelling story if Jordan had expanded it further."},{"rating":"1","title":"love Moraine, you will love the book","review":"While it was refreshing to avoid the deluge of new characters and sub-sub plotlines, the book forcibly reminded me that Jordan is still firmly in \\"stretch-mode,\\" milking this cash-cow for all it's worth.If you were hoping for something out of the Age of Legends or the Two Rivers characters... sorry. Jordan does throw in a couple of tidbits about al'Lan, but his part remains relatively small. However, if you like the women putting each other on pedestals and shopping... that remains a core element of this book, and you will be well satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting background for Moiraine and Lan","review":"It's short - which is rare for a Robert Jordan novel - and an interesting story. By following their travels through the Borderlands, we get to see more of the world of the Wheel of Time through the eyes of two of our favorite characters.The narrative isn't as compelling as the main Wheel of Time series, but it's a good read nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much pointless detail","review":"My theory is that Robert Jordan is an obsessive compulsive who stopped taking his meds about 10 years ago and needs to start again. Or perhaps it has just gotten out of control and he needs to go in for treatment. Mr. Jordan, get help. You were once a great story teller."},{"rating":"1","title":"a wheel of time prequel","review":"i admit i havent read the book. the number one reason i havent is that ive been reading the reviews and im starting to agree that i think jordan should finish the series before going off the track and starting the prequels. whats he waiting for? does anyone know? im a big fan but this is crazy. he should already be done with #11 - finish the series then start on the prequels. maybe we should boycott the prequels until he comes out with #11. well, at least i will. thanks for listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough is Enough Already","review":"Waiting 2 plus years for every new book is bad enough, but now instead of continuing the series he writes a prequel novel. Its bad enough trying to remember what happend 2 years prior when you read the last book. I can remember getting into the Wheel of Time series. It was book 4 of a expected 6 book series. Now there are 10 with no end in site. Jordan incredible skills for telling a story are now being wasted. The last couple of books have held alot of fluff and you find yourself on the edge of the seat saying \\"get on with already\\". If the prequel was released after he completed the main series I would have been piping a different toon. But for now I don't expect to spend my money or time on a prequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Hmm, a \\"prequel\\" even before he finished his current series. I hope the people reading this don't buy this book. I'm under the impression he doesn't know how to end his series. What a bunch of baloney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How 'bout you write an ending??!!!","review":"You know I agree with a previous reviewer - we're not really reviewers - we are merely folks who used to be happy passengers on the Wheel of Time train. Now though it becomes clear that Jordan's Wheel merely refers to this money factory that this series has become. He has no intention of finishing it but will keep grinding along until he drops. Want to know why Tolkein was such a genius? Because he FINISHED HIS STORY. For crying out loud even Donaldson finished in 6 books! This guy is ridiculous, this series is now ridiculous and I am out of here. Who's with me??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I bother??","review":"Jordan's latest in a series that seems destined simply to be rather than entertain has forced me to take a hiatus from him. I got this for Christmas but instead went with a newcomer, Brian S. Pratt who wrote an engrossing book called The Unsuspecting Mage.How can a new writer instill more intense feeling of excitement in me than a veteran such as Jordan? Maybe Mr. Jordan can take the time to remember what it means to be a reader instead of a writer and once again, write to entertain!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"El Dorado","review":"Jordan is a genius. 15 years ago he enthralled us all in with a strong opening to the only decent fantasty since Tolkien. Since then he has led us on the search for El Dorado, with us all hoping to find the city of gold, the fantasy story of epic proportions, as he wraps up the series. There were the early ones to discover the truth, but for many more of us it took until now to truly understand. Jordan has lost his way, and now the laborious journey of his latest books is far more costly than any reward to be found at the series end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, not what was wanted, but not bad.","review":"As a book, it's typical of Jordan's writing. The same cliches exist, the same problems with his writing style, the lengthy and unnessecary prose, but other than that it's a good book.It's not the NEXT in the series we are all waiting to finally read the end of, and it's not even the next book before the end, nor does it lay any new groundwork. All it does, is attempt to cash in further on the WOT series and milk more cash from the cow.Note to Robert Jordan. The cow is almost dry. Your readers are becoming irritated with the story and are turning elsewhere for entertainment, notice declining sales figures and read between the lines. You have alienated your readers, get back on track, and they MAY return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old same old","review":"As an entire novel, this is better than his last novel; however I would have given that one zero stars if I could.As an addition to his Legends short story, this is defiantly not worth the price. The back-end of this novel (the original New Spring) is fairly engaging; the additional pre-prequel is not.The politics are boring, the description of every object to minutia is mind0numbing and the characters are the same cookie-cutter characters that fill Jordan's other novels. I think I would have rather had the unemotional Aes Sedai where I could imagine their inner-thoughts then find out that they share the exact same emotional maturity as all of Jordan's other unimaginative female characters.Do not buy this novel. Buy Legends instead and enjoy the quick-read of the original New Spring along with some other excellent short stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This book is just more of the same pointless filler I have come to expect from RJ.It really is sad. I was a HUGE fan of the WoT after the first 6-7 books, but Jordan just lost it. I had a great deal of hope for this new book, but unfortunatly it didn't deliver.You could read 4 chapters from this book and come away with all the interesting and entertaining plot information.Dont waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best RJ book, but much better than book 10","review":"After having been burned by Crossroads of Twilight (book 10) where NOTHING HAPPENS, I decided I was not going to pre-order RJ books anymore.I was so disappointed with the last book, I did not even try to read this book until now (probably about a year after it was published). I finally borrowed it from the library to see where it takes the story.I have to say I am very encouraged with RJ. This books shows a lot more action and some of the spark from the original 3 books. Hopefully he can continue this in book 11 and get us some progress. I think it also shows RJ that he has a lot of books left after he finishes the intial story.And at 60% off the list price, this is a great deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To the Reader from TOLEDO, USA","review":"No Prob, a writer who gets quickly to the point is always a refreshing change of pace...1. Yes, Authority...you're right of course. Robert Jordan has the AUTHORITY to end his series at his own leisure...and in his own way. No argument about that. The problem, dear friend is another...Why should I stick around?I mean, yes, Robert Jordan reserves the right to himself to write WOT the way he does...but hey, i'dont like that way. And i\`am you know, the chief reason he CAN write this series is because i pay the bills.Crossroads was dreadful. And this Prequel is just another means to stretch the series...you know, Book eleven will not be due for another three years...and that's simply annoying.2. But you're right on another point: We, who don't like the series anymore, should stop whining all the time. We should get our butts off here, and start reading other stuff.

I'm still not sure it was worth the $12 I paid for it. But then, books 7-10 havent been either. If you have read the short story as it was published in the Legends book, then you have already read this. Oh a little tidbit here and there, but nothing of use or substance. Its an ok book if you have a couple days to kill and nothing else to read. But if you read it and are disappointed, you have been forewarned.

Bujones was quite good, but I felt that the rest of the cast were second rate. However, my biggest irritation was the audience. They were intrusive and very loud, wild applause as soon as one of the principals appeared which continued during the dancing, usually culminating in whistles and much stomping of feet completely drowning out the music. Why couldn't the DVD production people at least reduce the noise, or wait until the dancing had finished? I doubt that I will watch this DVD again.

The hottest setting is usually too hot for me, but if you want that option it's there. I usually use one of the two middle settings.The size is also very good, it would probably cover all or most of an average sized back. However, in spite of the larger size, it still wraps easily around limbs, feet, etc. so this heating pad is quite versatile. The adjustment lever is easy to use, 2 hour shutoff works consistently and gives plenty of time for the heating pad to be effective.

Makes me believe the book was written by a 12-year-old, unless the teleplay was just butchered. The pacing was too slow, the characters were ridiculous (the main character cannot seem to focus on getting out of a \\"fire maze\\" alive ... what an idiot; her love interest, Goodnight, follows a ridiculously puerile fairy tale arc; and so on).

She goes through a fire maze and Bakula tells her that they are \\"going in\\". She says no, it is my call, to which his reply is, \\"okay\\" but made in a stupidly childish voice. That is how this movie begins and it didn't get any better.Her first boyfriend dies in a fire but don't worry, he was asleep and didn't feel a thing. Yeah right, not even being on fire woke him up? Give me a break. The acting was so so bad. I was hoping the movie would get better but it never did.

For my money this glib overview is far too generalised - if you've picked up this book, then you've probably already got quite some developed ideas of your own on using ICT for training. Then when it comes to the nitty-gritty like 'How might I go about using some of these ideas? , the book turns out to be very US-corporation centered in its choice of examples with lots of buzz-words, lashings of really neat little acronyms, but nothing that you'd want to bookmark and come back to as inspiration to develop your own ideas further.

It is seemingly written by a \`regular Joe,' (because of the easy to read, straightforward language choices and real-life anecdotes peppered within) who also employees a keen sense of observation and innate ability to make explicit the simmering trends of American life. The most valuable part of this book lies in the best practices and actual templates that can be customized for use in any organization.

I'm buying a copy of this book today less for myself and more so I can lend it out to others who get an injury.I'm seeing the physical therapist on a weekly basis so as with anything like this I'd definetly recommend seeing a professional but this would definitely help relieve a great deal of pain and get you on the right track before you get to your first appointment.

For a while I did hatha yoga and that helped, but if I lapsed in my practice, the back troubles returned. Then a fellow back sufferer gave me a copy of Treat Your Own Back, her last of 12 after having already given away 11. Reading it showed me clearly the cause of my back troubles, and I took corrective action. That was ten years ago, and even though I no longer do yoga, I've had only a few minor episodes since, always due to some recognizable negligent abuse.

This book was really no help at all, even less so since I'd already booked our travel & accomodations (which probably half the book is dedicated to). Also the breakdown of South Strip/Mid Strip/North Strip was confusing to me. The entire organization of the book (to me) made it difficult to glean much useful information from, and for the most part they didn't really delve into anything, nor even give a broad overview. They picked what they liked and talked about it, leaving out most of Vegas, much less most of the strip."},{"rating":"1","title":"If all you want is a brief overview, this is fine.... but...","review":"I was disappointed in this book.

Lots of fun to read and plan the next trip - great photos.The descriptions are generally complete and describe the key points about the accomodations, dining, and activities. However, they tend to read as if they were authored by the owners of the ranches - there are very few, if any, critical comments that might be helpful to guide the reader in their selection (quality of the horses, the accomodations, etc.). Although almost all of these facilities offer horseback rides for the beginning rider, I would like to see more explanation (where applicable) of the rides offered to the more experienced rider who may be looking for something more than the typical nose-to-tail trail ride.But overall this is a very nice book and a greating starting point for researching a horseback vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I was disappointed in this book and it did not meet my expectations after reading the previous reviews and the details about the book.

The author does not go into depth on any particular design-related topic. IMHO, the title is misleading. If I was naming this book, I would call something like \\"Brief Introduction to PSoC Architecture and Development Tools\\". As another reviewer mentioned, all information in this book can be found on the Cypress website and in the PSoC Designer help index as well as user module datasheets. There is almost no tips, tricks or examples to help a designer such as myself that understands the basics. I'd say the only thing that this book could be good for is to help make a quick decision whether to use a PSoC for a particular project or not. Once you've decided to go with PSoC and you actually have to make it work, you are better off reading the datasheets, application notes and technical reference manuals because this book is more of a 'getting started with PSoC' rather than a 'designer's guide'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to Have","review":"This book is essential for engineers and serious hobbyists who design with PSoC 1 chips. It contains many hints, work-arounds, and enhancement tricks that would take hundreds of hours of trial-and-error experimentation to discover yourself. This book is not a replacement for the hundreds of PSoC 1 ap notes and datasheets available online. Because to fully describe the PSoC 1 feature set, assembler, and ICE environment, it would take an encyclopedia-size work. But there are many good ideas for working with the instruction set, assembler, analog subsections, and the limited RAM and codespace. It will also help a developer to avoid a number of pitfalls that otherwise they'd probably trip over. Reading this book is like gaining the experience from listening to a veteran PSoC 1 developer with a particular experience set for a couple of days.

(I don't think it was origionally intended as \\"Christian\\" Sci-Fi, but was re-edited to become one after the \\"conversion\\" of the author)This book (first edition) really caught my attention, besides being good sci-fi, it is well written and has excellent characterization. It also includes telepathy and a wonderful romance. The villains, however, are rather two dimensional and stereotypically overly sensual, self-important and greedy.While in many ways is is rather typical of the Sci-Fi Romance genre, it is one of the better examples. I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone who prefers \\"hard\\" sci-fi.If you are looking for \\"Christian\\" fiction, buy a second edition copy of this book, but if you just want good sci-fi romance, look for a first edition copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding science fiction","review":"This is outstanding science fiction, clever and imaginative, well-paced, and thoroughly enjoyable.

The action is ruined by too much comedy relief, in the character \\"Ozark,\\" who renders what should be serious material into a one-man vaudeville act.In it's defense, the movie does have some good action scenes, but overall they are depicted so unrealistically and campy that these small benefits are lost. It's a shame, because the movie had the potential to exploit the Dalton legend and deliver a noteworthy film. Instead, the end result is a wacky, schizophrenic yuk-fest complimented by some furious action sequences and forgettable dialogue.For a better movie in the \\"Universal Western\\" series, try \\"No Name On The Bullett,\\" \\"Whispering Smith,\\" or any of the three recent Jimmy Stewart/Anthony Mann releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book for the small homesteader.","review":"I have picked up this book over and over to learn more about raising rabbits for the small backyard rabbitery.

Michael Nyman makes a good stab at the music, but it is too dominant in the sound mix, and not subtle enough to complement the occasionally good photography.

Had they put a more chronologically accurate picture on the cover, it might have helped many people to avoid purchasing a CD that is not what it appears to be. This is truly false advertising for the sake of profits. If you're an Englebert Humperdinck aficionado, and already have the original recordings of all his hits, you may appreciate these alternate versions.

I still own and use my GT 2110 which has no wear and tear although it has had more mileage put on it. My advice is to wait for the GT 2130 and hope that Asics made the necessary improvements to make that a comparable model to the GT 2110. Chances are if you aren't going to put that many miles on the shoe that it might meet your running need but for that price, why settle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I have been running for a few years and loved my asics 2110's.

The knee is much better between PT and these shoes. I would not have believed it. But the proof is in the pain. It is also such a light shoe; also relieving a tired foot at the end of the day.

Well, let me tell you - I haven't had a pair of sneakers fit me the way these do, I don't think ever. They feel like they were custom made for my feet. I would recommend these to anyone !

We searched the Internet for some help as we couldn't even figure out which way the hinge was supposed to bend from reading the directions!

The nozzle's not that heavy, the dial is not tough to turn and the swivel mechanism is pretty cool. But the lock for the squeeze trigger is just terrible. If you push the trigger all the way in, you get full water pressure, but if you try and lock the thing, the pressure will drop... a lot... So what's the use of having the lock if it won't hold the highest pressure??? The trigger's kind of tough to hold, after a while I got some wrist discomfort.

Anyway, my favorite songs are as follows: \\"I Am Your Man\\" (neat little jazz number), \\"Song 9\\" (nonsense makes for an interesting groove), the title track (just a great song in general), and probably the most underrated track on the whole thing, \\"Hold Out For Christmas.\\" When I listen to it now, it really gets to me better than 5 years ago.

I would never of been a fan if it weren't for my choir teacher back in JR.High if he hadn't introduced them to me. Later in life,I never would of have had a mental life change in me, if it weren't for the group either. I am forever in debt to them all.

I wouldn't have a problem with it(there's vocal percussion on \\"Two\\"), but he's just two loud! And he's on every song. They destroyed A Change In my Life by adding him.

After about a year, our original supply ran out and we ordered more. My son would start fussing when I applied it to his face. He never liked people messing with his nose or his face, so I didn't immediately catch on that it was causing discomfort. It wasn't until I applied it to my own face and it burned that I realized what was happening. Needless to say, I felt very guilty about putting this lotion on my son.I found out that the creator of California Baby sold her company, and this new company has replaced several of the natural, safe ingredients with artificial ingredients. As others have mentioned, one of the new ingredients is sodium benzoate, a salt of benzoic acid (benzene) that is used as a preservative.

Sodium benzoate is a known carcinogenic additive which, when eaten or applied to the skin, gets transported to the liver, where it is supposed to be filtered, and expelled in urine, but the damage gets done before that process is completed.Sodium benzoate chokes out your body's nutrients at the DNA cellular level by depriving mitochondria cells of oxygen, sometimes completely shutting them down. Just as humans need oxygen to breathe, cells need oxygen to function properly and to fight off infection, including cancer.\\"Learn more: http://www.naturalnews.com/033726_sodium_benzoate_cancer.html#ixzz1k3hUQkWZEven outside of that article there is great concern about the ingredient and cancer links.

This was by far one of the worst. The writing itself was ok, but the plot was pretty much a joke from the very beginning. I read the whole thing, hoping it would get better, but it never did. Many of the things that occur in this book are so beyond the realm of possible or probable that I couldn't buy into it at all. It felt a lot like a romance written by a man who has no concept of what women think or want...combined with a medical thriller situated around a facility that could never, ever exist for so many logistical reasons that I don't care to type them all out. It just doesn't work. It is written as a present-day thriller set in the real world, but the plot lines are pure fantasy - and not interesting enough to make me want to ignore the impossibility of it all.

The synths are boring compared even to those on 'Abbey Road', there's no sense of stretching the forms of music as with 'Ummagumma', or the chaos trance of the 'Third Ear Band', As a concept album it falls way behind Spooky Tooth and Pierre Henry's 'Ceremony' which combines early metal with concrete music and the Catholic Mass. Come to think of it even the Monkees were more adventurous than this. This is classic US pop-rock with a taste of horns.Ok. I would have been WRONG to dismiss it - this is a hugely enjoyable album, a summation of a particular style of music which has probably never been bettered.

McClinton's raunchy voice and energetic style prove that he sets the standard for live perfomances.

WIth the help of Mr. Link, a former spy who is now an invalid, they are able to decode the message, and Link teaches them about a number of different codes. Alvin's and Shoie's characters are engaging, their adventures exciting, and, best of all from my point of view, the book has an appendix with a number of cryptological methods and messages for children to play with. These are wonderful brain-stretchers, and they have good practical applications even for children who don't particularly love numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son Isn't Feeling It","review":"Shipping speed was awesome but the actual product itself was very disappointing.

I recently acquired a copy of it because I was curious to hear their music. It goes without saying VISCERA is one of the best albums in the industrial/EBM genre I have ever heard. God Module successfully weaves addictively infectious pop hooks with their in your face, aggressive industrial beats and vocals. Jasyn Bangert reminded me a lot like Johan from Suicide Commando and Bryan Erickson of Velvet Acid Christ with his distorted vocals. VISCERA starts off with a massive amount of energy with \\"The Source\\" and never slows down through out the album. All eleven tracks kicks major tail. They are full of energy and aggression as well as melodies to keep the listener engaged. There is not one single song on the album that I did not like. After hearing VISCERA, I am definitely plan on checking out the band's other albums. They made a new fan out of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GOD MODULE ALBUM.","review":"This is the best album thus far by God Module.

One of the most important jazz albums ever, probably the best one in fusing jazz with rock. Ok, so everyone knows 'Birdland' but the rest of the album is also fascinating. Amazing solos by Zawinul and Shorter, which by the way is one of the most lyrical and emotional sax players out there. And of course, there's Jaco, the indisputable master of the fretless bass. Why? Hear for your self.A lot of people seem to dislike this album, considering it a jazz sellout, but don't listen to them. Not everyone can make such great fusion. The production is also pretty slick and done nicely. 'Heavy Weather' is fun and interesting. Also a good place to start with the music of Weather Report."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bassist's Dream","review":"If you are a bassist and want to listen to a recording that you may learn something from, this is it.

Jaco Pastorius adds some captivating bass runs and Joe Zawinul contributes plenty of pretty piano passages as well. Wayne Shorter makes some good contributions on several tracks.Songwise, the lead off track, Birdland, has an extremely memorable melody coupled with awesome instrumental passages and soothing background vocals. It is clearly head and shoulders above the rest.A Remark You Made is quite pretty and soothing and The Juggler has a delightful instrumental blend. The remaining tracks certainly suffices as good background music with special arrangements.

As evidence, check out the set list -- mostly songs from songs from albums OTHER than the Fragile. The commercial \\"failure\\" of the Fragile prompted Trent to do a greatest hits show to draw the biggest audiences possible; not exactly the kind of cutting edge show we've come to expect from Reznor. And for those NIN fans who are actually paying attention, the live versions of these old songs sound tired and angst-less in comparison to TDS-era bootleg versions (see \\"Coming Down Fast\\").

Shut up!The extortionate price is unjustifiable for this 'limited' edition, every music store I have walked into has this - not very limited except for poor wee Trents wailings on the 2nd disc. Perhaps they should give away some free tissues to weep at Trents misfortune at being able to sell this at this price.Seems kind of incredulous that record companies wonder why people burn CDs...glad I did.Oh well, at least Trent will never be able to bleat about commercialisation in the music industry.

Disk 1 is live and no new ground is broken here. Trent has the unfortunate tendancy to record the same stuff over and over again. It may be live, it may be well-recorded, but you've heard all this before. Disk 2 is simply nothing special. Generally quiet, generally piano driven and gnerally boring. Anyone who collects all of NIN will want this to complete their collection but I predict that most people will listen to the studio albums and leave this on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bonus disc is worth far more than the extra $15","review":"While the live CD is excellent and provides a fresh (and more energetic) take on many of NIN's past songs, the bonus disc is heads and shoulders above it. One might call it \\"NIN: Unplugged.\\" Performed primarily with piano and acoustic guitar, it takes the softness of \\"The Fragile\\" to new levels. Reznor has lost none of his edge (as is proved by the reinterpretation of \\"The Becoming\\"), but he wields that edge with far greater subtlety than he did on \\"The Downward Spiral.\\"In conclusion, die-hard NIN-aficionados and fans of \\"The Fragile\\" should definitely spend the extra $15 for the extra disc. It is the best work that Trent Reznor has ever done, by far, and it alone is worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow ! f#!king awesome!!!!","review":"what can i say that hasnt already been said, this double album kicks serious fking ass. this is without a doubt the best live album ever. trent reznor is god of sonics and there manipulation in this realm! somehow this album with an angry/frustrated edge transcends this (becomes sublime) and become suggestive of so much more possibility. dont accept conscensus reality, whatever u dream can be somewhere in a different space time. be determined not to give up on your dreams, as austin osman spare said \\"embrace reality by imagination\\" someday dreams shall become reality.

He has none. He can only be compared to the great masters of the past. Brahms, Beethoven, Mahler, Wagner, etc....As for the band, they are spellbinding, majestic, awesome, possessed...It's as if Trent has imbued them with almost inhuman powers of expression.

Characters and details are elaborately introduced and then dropped.All that being said, what a great read! Beside wonderful set pieces like the Battle of Waterloo, there is an endlessly surprising and romantic plot hammered to reality with perceptive insights into personal and political motivation. The book is bursting with characters to take to the heart, some \\"rounded\\" like Gina and Count Mosca, some \\"flatter\\" like Fabrizio and Clelia, all vivid and unpredictable.This is not a neat, well-structured book.

I recently bought a resonator guitar, and this CD is a real motivator for me to learn to play and sing like Corey."},{"rating":"1","title":"goofy uninspired and uninspiring first-effort","review":"Skip this 'un and go directly to Fish Ain't Bitin', a vastly superior CD and some great acoustic blues. idon't know where his head was at with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't taste good.","review":"I don't know what I was thinking.

Additionally, there is a basic explanation on Okinawan grammar in the introduction of the book,however, it is brief.The book outlines only the Shuri/Naha dialect - which is enough for the average sojourner through the main island of Ryukyu.The reason I have given the book a 4 star review is that, this lexicon could have been of more benefit if it included more English to Okinawan words in it's glossary.Aside from that fact, its a basic enough dictionary which gives readers an insight into Okinawan culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest books I have ever read","review":"I worked teaching English in Japan for 8 years.

While this is great, I expected more equations and drills.

Some sections are better than others. For instance, although the book notes that Office and Industrial makes up 62% of the commercial real estate market, it doesn't explain how to conduct a specific demand anlaysis for these property types. You would think office and industrial properties would be addressed seperately, but the book groups the discussion of both property types, noting that the trend is toward combining the uses. Also, everything is explained with development projects in mind, rather than from the perspective of purchasing existing real estate assets. Basically the book is mostly fluff with little substance or explanation of how to gather and analyze the appropriate data."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I am an avid reader of investment books, especially real estate.

I have found myself reading 5 pages and saying what the hell is this guy saying and waiting for his point or gem but it never happens. This book is way overpriced for what it is, this should be a clearance special for 5.99.

Consequently, my friends and I nicknamed it \\"Let's Lie.\\"Since each section is written by one writer/researcher, the quality and accuracy was very variable. One city might have useful information on lodging but be wildly inaccurate on restaurants or visa versa. For example, the hostel section in Granada was percectly fine, but all the info on neighborhood character and tourist sites was poorly researched, completely off-base and usually wrong. Addresses didn't exist, The Allhambra was actually open when the book said it would be closed and the \\"hip young neighborhood with a gay scene\\" was filled with fast food, families and churches."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST guide to Spain","review":"I used this book on my trip to Spain (Galicia and Asturias, Madrid) last summer, and it was an invaluable resource.The Let's Go guide for Spain was incredible--it pointed out sites and places that weren't the usual tourist traps. I was very impressed with the accommodations listings as well--every hotel and hostel recommended by the book was excellent, clean and a great value. Listings were accurate, with correct, up-to-date contact information.All in all, I strongly recommend buying this book--you won't regret it for your trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better name would be Weakly Blunders","review":"This book is just plain schlock. Unimaginitive junk I wouldn't feed my dog. Here's one: Nice Chicken and Rice. the recipe calls for chicken, two cans of soup, some minute rice and a package of onion soup mix. I don't need to recite any others, but they are of the same caliber.The one saving grace of this book is that the author admits that she's the queen of incapable cooking and this book certainly proves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring","review":"I bought this cookbook because I liked the idea of having a week's worth of recipes. I was disappointed when it arrived because most of the menus seemed more like 'kiddie meals\\" instead of family fare. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I don't usually eat chicken nuggets for dinner. Anyway, another complaint is that Brook Noel relies heavily on dijon mustard, which I like but don't usually use to the excess that she does. Her mainstay dish seems to be chicken spread with mustard, dipped in breadcrumbs, and then cooked in a skillet. This recipe appears several times in the cookbook under different names. She adds dijon mustard to just about any dish including pasta and sauces. My last complaint is that I often add a vegetable to her menus, since they are not always part of the meal. I think if you want to have dinner on the table quickly, the Rachael Ray books are better tasting, more wholesome, and a better buy for your money. Don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Least Favorite Penguin Book","review":"Being an avid penguin collector, I have many, many penguin books, but this is definitely my least favorite. The story is about a grown-up penguin telling a group of little penguins what will happen if they do things they shouldn't. In the meantime, one of the little penguins is doing all these things. Even though the story the Nanny penguin tells is supposed to be exciting, I found it a little on the boring side. I do like the pictures; they are bright and pleasant to look at. However, the rest of the story is, in my opinion, somewhat lacking. True, it does have a well-developed plot line, but it just did not seem very thrilling at all. Younger children might like it, say maybe through kindergarten, but the rest would probably not."},{"rating":"2","title":"doing it with integrity","review":"With Fraud, David Rakoff emerges as a real voice of truth and humor. The essays here are hillarious, shedding brutal honesty on some of the many intricacies of everyday life. The Christmas Freud piece, for instance, shines a bright light on New York City holiday mayhem. The narrator, Jewish, is playing Freud on 5th Avenue, observing the crowds observing him. I made my way to this book via David Sedaris, Dave Eggers, Nick Hornby, but David Rackoff, in the end, writes more sharply I feel. He does what they're trying to do. He writes with spirit and tells a good joke or two in the process. Read it. (And also read So Is This Wilderness and Other Stories.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"The essays in David Rakoff's collection, \\"Fraud\\", are priceless! I did not find them arrogant, self-indulgent or mediocre like several other readers who reviewed the book. Rather, I felt like I had discovered a writer who doesn't condescend to some uncomplimentary idea of a general public. Rakoff speaks as if to a close friend, sharing thoughts and stories and observations from his corner of the world in tones ranging from bitingly critical to unabashedly sentimental. Perhaps some objections stem from a lack of obligation on his part to explain or excuse himself, but it's a quality that I found refreshing, honest and immensely entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much work","review":"I purchased this book because as a David Sedaris fan it was recommended to me by Amazon (\\"if you like this book, you'll like...\\"). After reading a few pages I realized that the only thing David Sedaris and Rakoff have in common is their first name. Sedaris engages his readers and accompanies them on the journey he puts forth in print. Rakoff however, throws his words at the reader and runs away, abandoning the reader in a quagmire of over-thought words and phrases. I'm an educated person, but Rakoff uses words that I've never heard before. You need to read this book with an accompanying dictionary. There is at least one word per page that you'll have to lookup, even if you're a college professor. I tried to finish this book, but only made it about way through. It was too much work, and I like to read for pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"not an enjoyable read........","review":"I have a broad vocabulary, but when I read and write my goal is clarity of expression, communicating with my audience.The author's labored and awkward use of remote words is overly self-conscious, sophomoric, forced and downright embarassing.His choice of words comes off as desperately insecure-- and rather than aid in communication/expression, the overall effect is dilution and loss of impact. Why say \\"coital relations\\" when \\"knocking boots\\" creates a better image?Honestly, this book was torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick...","review":"Like other reviewers, I bought this book based on Amazon's 'if you like David Sedaris,...' Wrong! Rakoff depressed and bored me. I read most books in 2 to 3 days, but it took me two weeks to get through Fraud. Sedaris made me laugh out loud - I never even cracked a smile with this guy. Some of the stories could be really interesting, but he takes the fun out of a dry sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Sedaris Where are you?","review":"I hate to dissagree with those who've gone before me in writing these reviews but I was dissappointed in Fraud. Rather than being bitting, sharp and witty, I found it to be self indulgent to a point that I found myself wishing that the authors teacher in 3rd grade had sat him down and explained that 1. the world doesn't revolve around him and 2. false supreriority used as a defense mechanism might work in your own psyche but please down write it down and trick others into buying it by comparing it to David Sedaris.I haven't seen any book in which an author overestimates our interest in his angst since Brett Easton Ellis' Less than Zero. While I read Bretts books when they came out....the 80's are over, black turtlenecks are gone, Molly Ringwald is wallowing in obscurity, and the lead singer of the Cure has even cheered up a bit.

Sounds like David Sedaris. Knowing how much I enjoyed Naked, Me Talk Pretty One Day, and Barrel Fever, I shall give Mr. Rackoff a shot.\\"No, no, no. Not good. I feel sorry for David Rackoff. I mean, here's his good friend David Sedaris achieving cult status with these hilarious stories, and he probably said to himself, \\"Why not? If he can do it, I can do it.\\" HE CAN'T DO IT. Unfortunately for David Rackoff, David Sedaris has raised the \\"humorist essay\\" bar too high. Nothing in Fraud comes close to Sedaris. Sedaris is the only author who has ever made me laugh out loud. Fraud didn't even force a giggle.Fraud definitely smacks of \\"I think I can, I think I can\\", and ends up offering nothing more than bland, uninteresting stories. If you want a few good essays, I suggest re-reading \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\". The experience will be far more satisfying than anything Fraud has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst bitchy queen you know and avoid","review":"I'm gay so I can say this, this guy is like the worst stereotype of a prissy arrogant condescending queen. If it wasn't written in 1st person I'd say the writer was homophobic. his obscure references and overly flowery language is either an attempt to make himself feel smarter or distractions to cover his weak storytelling. it reminds me of school reports that have to be a certain amount of words. he makes up adjectives by adding a y to nouns and verbs. One of the more cringe inducing phrases was \\"instead of succumbing to the decapitory charms of the guillotine\\". blech! very rarely am I annoyed enough to complain but this type of putting on airs (have I mentioned his frequent use of French \\"sans\\" translation?) trying to pass for good writing just burns me up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is NOT a keeper!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I was disappointed enough to return it immediately. I hate to be like everyone else and use David Sedaris as a benchmark but I believe that is the audience this author is trying to capture.

They do have the same first name. That's where the similarity ends. Though Rakoff does give you good leads for stories, he weighs them down with his wordy descriptions of everything around him. He finds places to used fifty cent words that baffles the mind. I began to feel as if I were listening to a fiction novel with no plot. Eventually it became mindless babble. After listening to all four discs, I am sorry but he bored me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Part Smart + One Part Self-Deprecating = An Amusing Read","review":"Never heard of David Rakoff until I saw him on a recent talk show, and as I'm always in the mood for observations on society, etc. by a smart gay man, spent a warm afternoon or two with this often amusing book of essays. Subjects include a trip to Iceland, a wildnerness survival/tracking course, a visit to a New Age mecca, and climbing a mountain somewhere in New England. Mr. Rakoff isn't as funny as David Sedaris, there is a strong undertone of melancholy, and he is self-deprecating in the extreme. He actually admits - twice! - to wearing black plastic shoes, which information astonishes me. I plan to look up his previous work on the internet, and look forward to any future books with great anticipation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired and sidetracked","review":"Bands that were asked to contribute to soundtracks would offer the tune on their own version of the lp-the Byrds also did the title track for Candy, another late 60's....classic?

In addition to the title track is their great version of the Gospel song, \\"Jesus is Just alright\\". A few years later it would become a hit for the Doobie Brothers (who would copy The Byrds version almost note for note). The rest of the album is soft Country. It's not bad but it's not the best album they ever did.

The tracks are short, the handling falls under decent, except for the handbrake which when lightly tapped spins the car out in a 360 (umm, physics?) and the poor attempt at simulating the street racing culture is, well, cheesy and pointless considering it's not a street racing type of game.

You have to struggle a bit to even get the zipper around and past the scope! A tight fit can cause the scope to be jarred and set off alignment, way too easily.This is poorly designed..an extra inch or so of room would make this a very doable and functional case.The carry strap is flimsy and simply not padded enough. Once again, a dollar more worth of material and padding on the sling would make this a higher class and grade of case for carrying a $1,800 rifle and scope around.Want to buy mine?

Then, that nice case that lets you attach it to a headrest, well, it fits great without the battery, but with the battery on there is no way to fit it (believe me, I tried). There is a nice built in \\"stand\\", it is designed to only be effective when the battery is not installed. The screen quality and external sounds are a bit worse then other units, though not horrible (especially as most of us will use the unit with headphones).

It is difficult to find a production of Othello that is not rated R because so many directors focus on the sex between Othello and Desdemona to engage audiences. So I was hoping to see a version that focused more on Iago's evil manipulative schemes. However, I was quite disappointed by the performances, which were either too subtle or too over the top throughout. Ian McKellen's performance was lacking, but I feel that is due in part to the awful direction by Trevor Nunn. Othello is one of the most gripping stories as we are exposed to the depth of love, hate, jealously and fear that we all carry within us, yet this particular production was so immensly boring. I will not use it again to teach Othello in my classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhythmic prose - evocative illustrations","review":"My 2 1/2-year-old daughter loves this book.

Trevor-Roper introduces each chapter with explanatory notes that give the selections some continuity of narrative.As a bonus, you'll find a quick sketch of Lord Macaulay in the introduction.Overall, this book is the best way to understand Macaulay's unique view of history, without having to wade through his somewhat monotonous five volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best acid jazz I can think of","review":"The first time I heard anything from this album was \\"Watermelon Man\\".

Just as no collection is complete without Coltraine's Giant Steps, Miles' Kind of Blue and Brubeck's Time Out, it is equally lacking without this essential offering from Herbie.To say the music is good is an understatement. The music is genius. One of the main goals of Head Hunters was minimalism; that is, how to produce a great groove using only the fewest components. That goal has been met with great success.Chameleon, the first track of the album, was so good it was reworked and performed by dozens of other artists from Buddy Rich to Maynard Ferguson. Each version is exciting and powerful on its own merits, but the original is still a marvelous thing to behold.Herbie follows up with a trio of excellent offerings including a reworking of his previous Watermellon Man and adding tracks Sly and Vein Melter to round out the mix. The result is simply magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for general reader","review":"I think this book is a first-rate primer fo those persons wanting a good, not-too-intense look at our most successful Presidents and how they made their second-terms memorable.To give it 5 stars, for me, would require a longer, more detailed book, but Mr. Zacher's breezy style, succinctness and eye for the most important facts, will serve most readers well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl just want to have fun!","review":"If she had as much fun recording FEVER as I did listening to FEVER, we are all in good track.

One of my best buys so far this year, and definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eurotrash Pop at its best","review":"When I first heard CGYOOMH, I instantly loved it. For me the surprise is that it's playing on US radio. Bought the album, love every song, which is rare. While Madonna delivers product with more depth, the only albums she has that I like this consistently are greatest hits sets. \\"Fever\\" may have less lyrical substance (though it has enough for me), but stylistically, it is one absolutely fabulous ensemble.

The 14 tracks on this US version are so much fun to listen to, I found myself putting the CD player on repeat, especially to the songs, \\"Fever\\" and \\"Boy\\"! It's a shame that her earlier albums aren't available in the US. I totally want more!

Perhaps you should go listen to the latest coming-of-age pop sensation rolling off the American assembly line.

There is also the awesome worldwide smash single \\"In Your Eyes.\\"I hear the next single for the US is \\"Love At First Sight\\" which is yet another great track. I really hope it's as big of a hit as \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head.\\" Radio is desperate for some good pop tunes right now. I'm sick to death of rap and people that can't sing.

The album disc actually contains a re-recorded version of her current single 'Come Into My World'--the fact is that no amount of re-recording can help what is ultimately just a subpar retake on the far superior 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head'. That's the sole weak spot in an otherwise seamless set. The remix disc, however, is pretty flawless. Among the highlights is the 'Blue Monday' remix of 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head', which doesn't add or detract much from the original. There's also an excellent remix of the aforementioned '..World', the sterling U.S. radio mix of the already fab 'Love At First Sight'(which is apparently exclusive to this set), as well as the superb soundtrack cut 'Whenever You Feel Like It'.

Then, one day, I finally bought her new album \\"Fever\\" and I LOVED listening to all the tracks in the album!!The album starts off with the groovy disco track \\"More More More\\", and continues with inspiring dico tracks such as \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" ( which was the only single to hit #1 in the U.S charts! ), \\"Fever\\" ( kinda slow but very catchy ), \\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Dancefloor\\", \\"Fragile\\", and \\"Come Into My World\\".All in all, whether you are a Kylie fan or not, if you like listening to pop or disco songs, then listen to this album and you will be singing the songs for months!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Get You Out Of My CD Player!!","review":"This CD is awesome! I got it yesterday and the first time that I listened to it, I was truly hooked. Kylie has a beautiful voice and the songs are just phenomenal. What is Kylie waiting for to release her 2nd. album? There isn't one song on this CD that I don't like. I bought it and I loved it and if you buy it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kylie Fever","review":"This is an excellent CD by Kylie all the songs sound great,it's a great CD with great sound to buy for your collection great for fans of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest dance album of the year!!!!","review":"Having been a long time fan of Kylie, I was thrilled to finally see U.S. audiences take notice of La Diva's stunning brand of dance music. Each song on this album is a dance-pop confection, deliciously vibrant, exceptionally written, immaculately performed by Ms. Minogue. I purchased this cd months ago, when it first came out as an import, and it has been in my cd player ever since. My favorite tracks here are \\"Fragile\\", \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\", and \\"Love at First Sight\\". Congrats, Kylie on your recent success in the U.S. and certainly on your flawless new cd!!! I can't get your music out of my head!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"KYLIE FINALLY GETTING DESERVED ATTENTION IN THE STATES!!!!!","review":"THIS IS A FABULOUS CD,KYLIE IS SOUNDING AS HOT AS EVER,GREAT MUSIC,GREAT SINGER,GREAT ACTRESS,,THIS GIRL HAS IT ALL,,,NOW SHE IS FINALLY GETTING THE DESERVED ATTENTION IN THE UNITED STATES,SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERS FOR THE PAST DECADE AS IT HAS BEEN WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD........THIS IS A MUST FOR ANY MUSIC FAN!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Disco Needs Her","review":"I remember hearing Kylie's first hit way back in 1997 with \\" I Should Be So Lucky\\" and Kylie's style of bubble gum pop has been my teenage years music staple diet ever since. Then in the early nineties she sort of disappered as Kylie dabbled with alternative and punk rock music which is not too bad though I prefer her bubble gum radio friendly pop stuff except Did It Again from impossible Princess album. In 2001 I remember seeing the video of Spinning Around from the CD- Light Years and that signals to me Kylie's long awaited return to pop. Light Years have 3 great tracks- Spinning Around, Your Disco Needs You (A great cross between Village People and Pet Shop Boys) and Kids with Robbie Williams. With Fever, I screamed when I first heard CGYOOMH because it is so cool- musically and stylistically. It is like an updated retro disco track. Love Fever aboslutely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it now!","review":"I love every song on this CD. \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" is, of course, one of the best songs ever, and while the others are a little different (less bass, more lyrics), they're still fantastic. Kylie just keeps getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neodisco Offering Takes the Cake","review":"Finally! Dance/pop music that isn't offered on the silicone chest of an untalented teenybopper! I had all but forgotten about Minogue until her release of \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head.\\" Since I couldn't get it out of mine, I picked up the CD, and actually listened to it all the way through on the first spin. I was blown away by this sexy, classy Aussie with her breathy voice and delicious beats. It instantly became THE disc to have playing 24/7. I soon began snatching up any of Kylie's records I could get my hands on, and they all have one defining trait. They're all fabulous with great songs. How many times have you bought a CD for one song and the rest was awful? You won't find that here or on any of Minogue's previous releases.Bottom line? Fun pop, great beats and a rewarding sense of unabashed fun. Couldn't recommend it more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this music gets into your head","review":"Although I am quite partial to the disco sound of her previous album \\"Light Years,\\" Kylie Minogue does it again with this kick-butt album. The single \\"Can't get you out of my Head,\\" is not even one of the better tracks. Watch out for \\"love affair\\" and \\"fragile.\\" These are outstanding examples of why Kylie Minogue is as great as she is. Each album since 1994's \\"Kylie Minogue\\" has a individual sound and that is a rare phenomena in mainstream pop music today. The remix of \\"Butterfly\\" is also wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Kylie","review":"This is an incredible CD. I love Kylie's new, breathy, girlish voice - she's the post-modern Marilyn Monroe. CGYOOMH is incredibly catchy, and I love the 'La, la, la' chorus. 'Come Into My World' is great, too. But for me the standout track is 'Fever', which is poppy and fun, but has a strange melancholy, especially when Kylie sings 'Don't you feel the fever like I do?' People are hung up on comparing Kylie to Madonna, but Kylie is very different from La Ciccone; Kylie is both campier and more down to earth. American audiences may have caught Miss Minogue's cameo as the Green Fairy in 'Moulin Rouge'; for me, those few minutes of film sum her up - campy, sexy and cute as a bug's ear! I HEART KM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best dance and pop album this year","review":"finally, here is the song called, 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head' which was played all night long at Madonna's party and which is currently her most favourite song...that's how i got this album and listen to...the most refreshing and cool british dance and pop music i've ever listened to in a while. My favorite is In Your Eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake Up America","review":"Kylie has surpassed herself. I can not stop listening to this CD 24/7. She has given her fans an all dance CD ala Cher and Gloria Estafan marking her greatest artistic achievement, and she has put out impressive CDs in the past. Do yourself a favor a put this CD in your player, you will NEVER want to take it out. I can't even choose a favorite song, because it just depends on my mood. This CD deserves to be HUGE."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone needs to experience the aussie release!","review":"well, kylie's new album, fever, is already everything we fans could want and more...it successfully reflects kylie's increasing maturity as a talented artist while still giving us every reason to want to shake it like nobody's business. but the australian release of the album dominates in doing it one better. how's that? this version contains the special track \\"tightrope\\" that is not available outside australia. too bad for the rest of us 'cause \\"tightrope\\" is easily one of the best songs on the album. it has the kylie pop that we all know and love and an exemplary expression of something deeper behind it as well. good beats as always, and it's also evident that kylie puts every bit of effort into it. the lyrics are clever and catchy without forgetting to be satisfyingly substantial. kylie's the bomb...undisputed! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kylie triumphs again","review":"Kylie's career has had extreme highs and lows but the last few albums have seen her come into her own as a formidable musical force. Both Fever and Light Years have received amazing success and rightly so. Can't Get You Out Of My Head has been a hit single in all European countries, except one, plus in Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The song is simple and yet a shinning example of Kylie's new found musical maturity.Fever as a whole is an upbeat exciting album. The next single, In Your Eyes, is a personal favourite and pulls refference from her previous album's huge hit, Spinning Around. Fever is another track that stands out among this collection of top material. Burning Up finishes this album superbly with a mix of cool sultry vocals and bouncy retro disco.Kylie, as a performer, is outstanding always trying to come up with shows and music designed to thrill and excite, on this album she succeeds yet again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kylie Minogue: 1 of the FEW Dancefloor Queens!!","review":"1st off, i'd like to tell you all to ignore the person who left that b.s. comment before me.But anyways, this album is fantastic. I've owned it since the day it came out, and I have yet to get sick of it. Everybody pretty much summed the album up though in the other reviews.I hope to hear another good album like this from Kylie (I hope she is getting better from her breast cancer!) in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album Rocks!!! I Love Kylie","review":"This Album Is The Best Dance Album Ever! All The Songs On It Are Great! She Has This Dance/Disco Beat To Her Songs. It Is So Cool! I Love Kylie! My Favorite Songs On The Album Is \\"Come Into My World\\" & \\"Butterfly.\\" I Love Every Song, With The Exception Of \\"More,More,More\\" \\"Fragile\\" And \\"Love Affair.\\" The Songs Are OK, But Not As Good As The Other Ones. This CD Is Cool Cause It Has 2 Hidden Bonus Tracks: \\"Boy\\" & \\"Butterfly.\\" I Could Listen To The Album All The Time And NEVER Get Bored Of It! This Album Is A Must For Every Dance Fan, Like Myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I listen to it again and again","review":"This is one of those albums that I immediately fell in love with and now listen to again and again. Every song is excellent. This is easily Kylie's best album. It has a mature sophisticated feel, not the simple pop she used to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"sexy","review":"i can't help dancing to her music,i love it!!!have you watched her ad ??not yet?check out kylie.com and you will know why i like her and her music.i can't get her and her songs out of my mind!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Good as \\"Light Years\\", but Still Great!","review":"I became a huge Kylie Minogue fan last year. Her 2000 album, \\"Light Years\\", blew me away. It was the perfect blend of dance pop and disco, and quickly became one of my favorite CDs in my collection. Kylie hasn't had a hit in the U.S. for a very long time, and, with the release of \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\", she has re-established herself and snuck past the velvet rope of America.I was very much looking forward to the release of \\"Fever\\". I wasn't disappointed by any means, but the album is a small step down from \\"Light Years\\". \\"Fever\\" is very similar to \\"Light Years\\" in the dance pop and disco sense, but the material is less substantial. Don't get me wrong, because the album is still a blast. The best tracks it's got going for it are \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\", the title track, \\"Give It To Me\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\", and \\"Burning Up\\".A very good CD for dance pop and disco fans alike! Kylie Minogue is spectacular!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"Well, I already owned a copy of Fever, but I'm a collector of Kylie. I think this was well worth the cost. The rare tracks, \\"Good Like That, Baby, Whenever You Feel Like It, and Tightrope,\\" are great, and I have no idea why they weren't included on the album, rather than the two tracks that I hate. And tho I'm NOT complaining, I don't understand why \\"Butterfly\\" was included, as its from Light Years. The remixes are also a plus, as its nice to get some variety and a new spin on the widely recognized \\"CGYOOMH.\\" (And its true, the slipcase actually says \\"ButterFRY,\\" not \\"ButterFLY.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great techno / dance mix! :-D","review":"I own six Kylie Minogue albums, but I have to say that this is definitely her best effort thus far. \\"Fever\\" is fun, enjoyable, and just makes you want to dance!\\"Love At First Sight\\" is probably my favorite track, although I prefer the US radio mix over the original. \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" really put this album on the map in the US, and it's easy to see why. Its lyrics are catchy, and the beat is amazing. \\"Fragile\\", the grammy-winning \\"Come Into My World\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Dancefloor\\", and \\"Love Affair\\" are very enjoyable tracks, too. Finally, I think \\"Burning Up\\" is an excellent closing song. I totally enjoy the sexy, mellow verses compiled with the upbeat, top-tapping chorus!Great job, Kylie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A dance floor masterpiece...","review":"This is easily Kylie Minogue's strongest album to date, and definitely one of the top 5 Dance albums of the last 10 years.Every single track is infused with the right combination of danceability, technical energy and smooth vocals. If this one doesn't get you off your butt and up on the dance floor, nothing will.At her best, Kylie reminds us of a mid-80's Madonna. It's impossible not to get up and dance to \\"More More More\\" or \\"Love at First Sight\\". The joy, the energy is so palpable it can't help but move the listener to get up and shake it.An excellent dance album that should be in everyone's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Girl present","review":"I got this for my wife right after it came out and she really liked it. This is a great gift for a woman/girl between 16 and 25. We heard all of these tracks about 6 mos before they came out in the US when we were in Amsterdam. They are crazy for this stuff there. It may be played out now, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of the last ten years.","review":"This is one of the most catchy albums of the last ten years. More often than not, my purchases of albums are like purchases of singles; only one or two songs make the cut into my regular listening rotation. However, this album has gotten into my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent dance album","review":"just a quick review... this is a great album! nearly all the songs are catchy and dont get old, in fact they grow on you... the quality of the mixes are excellent as well. its a good buy if you like dance/pop.-L8"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Who likes cheesy europop?? Not me- but for some incredibly strange reason I love this album!Kylie can't really sing that well, but the album is filled with catchy dancy records that just \\"can't get outta your head\\".If you want slow, this isn't for you. All of Kylie's emotions are portrayed in dance beats which is in some ways a lot better.I live in UK and I do feel Kylie is slightly overated here, but I still love her music. \\"Love At First Sight\\" is by far the best track, and the only song I dislike is \\"Burning Up\\" because it feels a bit out of place.The music is heavily based upon a 70s theme and the track \\"Fever\\" is very Europop (not in a bad way, though).So if you like pop or light dance, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is HoT!","review":"No lie, this morning I heard \\"Love at First Sight\\" on TRL, LOVED that song with the first listen, came to amazon.com, listened to the audio clips of the rest of the CD, and went out and bought it! I honestly love every song on this album, even though I was never really into dance/club songs. FEVER is mostly upbeat music, which can make you feel better about something, or just enhance your good mood. Its going to be in my cd player for a long time!I really hope Kylie gets some recognition in the US. All the singles so far I think have lots of radio potential, \\"Cant Get you Outta My HeaD\\", \\"In your eyes\\", and \\"love at first sight\\". Also \\"more more more\\", \\"fever\\", and \\"love affair\\" are all great... but for real, the whole thing is just great club music that I think lots of people will like to listen and dance to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kylie's Fever","review":"Join the fever! Kylie's newest album FEVER is one of the catchiest albums I've heard in a long while! It's a combination of 80s pop mixed with techno and other genres, which creates and irresistible mix of pop and dance, and will make you want to head out on the dancefloor. FEVER is the album which brought Kylie back to the US, after 14 years, with the worldwide smash Cant Get You Out Of My Head. However, that is just the beginning of the best. More More More, Love At First Sight, Give It To me, Burning Up and Fever are all great songs. Overall its a great fun album to listen to, so go out and get it, and get ready to party!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Of The Dancefloor...","review":"that's exactly what Kylie is now.Fever is the first Kylie album I got and I think it's a fabulous album with fabulous songs.I merely bought it out of my adoration for the lead single,Can't Get You Out Of My Head.But i soon grew to enjoy my personal faves,More MOre More,Fever,Fragile and Burning Up.Whenever I feel like dancing for a while,I have absolutely no hesitation to give this CD a spin and head on down to the dancefloor. Ironically, there's a track on this CD titled Dacefloor. This album certainly cements Kylie's status as Queen Of The Dancefloor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one Fever You Need!!!!!!!!","review":"I must be the first to say before this disc i had never heard of Kylie.But this Cd put her on the map it is hot from start to finish and I highly recommend that you get the fever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance is Back, Jack!","review":"Kylie Minogue is the queen of dance of the new millenium. The combination of songs are incredible! With a beautiful body to go with the ..., sultry voice... \\"Love at first sight,\\" to me, is hands down the best dance song of the year.

If you feel alright now, get the cd and you'll get a \\"fever\\" like that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done :)","review":"Kylie's Fever is a great album if you want pop-py, dance music.

Hopefully Kylie will stun us again with another great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great to dance to","review":"What I love about this cd is that every song is upbeat. If I feel like dancing this is what I listen to. My only problem with it is the songs with sexual conotations. To me, that's [needless]. It makes me think of singers like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera and I hate them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kylie's Album","review":"I don't think that this is the best album that she has done. But, I think as her next single, she should put out the songFraglie. That song is cool on her new album. I hope that it gets out as a single on the radio someday. Plus if any of Kylie fans are looking for a new pen pal, you can write to me. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Over-Rated","review":"Kylie Minogue has no problem blending in with America's pop scene, simply shaking her can and taking her clothes off for money (yes, I am implying that). Granted, that can be appropriate for an 'artistic vision' (re: Fiona Apple's \\"Criminal\\" video), but mixed with provocative dancing, her music gives as brief a payoff as a strip joint. Her music, though good for the first few listens, melts into pop drivel, as if the CD itself was made of ice. She also adds to misrepresentation of the electronic music scene, by simply taking rock and putting in synths instead of guitars (re: Prodigy's \\"Fat of the Land\\"). Basically, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good as Her Geffen Efforts","review":"I am one of the few diehard U.S. fans of Kylie who bought and loved her two Geffen records; both are upbeat pop music at its finest, with lyrics of some depth. I was really looking forward to this new record, but am very disappointed. I knew to expect a dance record, rather than pop, but lyrically, these songs are weak, and the melodies and dance beats of many of the songs are indistinguishable. The first single is great, but it is definitely the album's only high point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kyile's New Album!","review":"I don't think that this is her best album over the years.Her best songs I think are Especially For You and songs in the past.But I still listen to all her albums anyways even the new one since I am fan of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passing Clouds","review":"The first time when u listen to her first hit \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\", it will stick in your head with her catchy chorus line of LA LA LA. You may even like it for a start. But it won't be long that you get sick of the LA LA LA as well. This song has no exceptional lyrics too.The rest of the album sounded the same, the same catchy beat, that you will probably not listen to it after a few plays.Though Kylie has made a break through after a long break but her vocals is not something that you would give credit for. You may like to give credit only to her catchy tune of her songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Fever\\" is the greatest comedy recording of this millenium","review":"I cry, I mean really, really, cry every time I hear Kylie sing \\"Fever.\\" But it's tears of laughter. No matter how bad the day has been, I'm ROTFLMAO within fifteen seconds after I play this cut. It's just so TOTALLY AWESOME that I've never had to try the others.If the whole world would just listen to this song every minute of every day all the time there would never be any wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"cold disco","review":"cheeky and cheesy disco-popmeant to sound sexy and fullbut actually sounds hollow and colddisco in a can: ...shaken not stirred"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dance album!","review":"Kylie's FEVER has remained as one of my favorite dance albums. The songs are infectuous and have me singing along and dancing. From the first single \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" (which you couldn't if you tried) to the bubbly and energetic title track, there's dance written all over this fine album. My only complaint is near the end there are some songs that aren't as strong, like \\"Dancefloor\\", \\"Your Love\\" and \\"Love Affair\\", but the rest of the tracks are fab! The ballad \\"Fragile\\" is one of her best. \\"Love At First Sight\\" is another classic that has a catchy chorus that stays in your head. Other highlights include \\"Burning Up\\", \\"Give It To Me\\" and \\"In Your Eyes\\". A great album from Kylie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All hail Queen Kylie!!!!","review":"Kylie Minougue is a massive artist!! Her new albulm 'Fever' is only a tiny piece of Kylie's extenssive back catalougue. I am a huge Kylie fan who hails from Scotland and have been a fan ever since I went to see her in concert in 1988!!! (admitedly I was only 8 at the time- but hey)Her smash hit single 'can't get you out of my head' is a classic, but believe me if you think that is good check out Kylie's older hits such as 'Breathe', 'Shocked','Better the devil you know', 'Spinning around' etc etc!! I am so glad that Kylie is finally starting to break through in America- believe me you guys don't know what you've been missing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch Kylie's \\"Fever\\"","review":"It's great to see Kylie hitting it big in the USA again since her \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\"/\\"Locomotion\\" days of the late 80s. And at age 33, she still sounds (and looks) as good as she did when she was 20, if not better!I purchased \\"Fever\\" days after its official USA release date knowing that the album had already been #1 on the album charts in the UK, Ireland and Australia. What I didn't know was to expect besides \\"CGYOOMH\\" (#1 on the singles chart in the UK, Ireland and Australia) and \\"In Your Eyes\\", already out in Europe and Australia as the follow-up single. Three weeks later, I'm still playing that CD at home and in my car with a passion. Fun catchy lyrics (besides the la, la, las of \\"CGYOOMH\\"), a great Euro-pop dance sound (no ballads here) and Kylie's sensuous voice are all neatly wrapped up and tied into this package of an album.It's a \\"Fever\\" you'll definitely want!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!

It is, as may gather from the header, unbearably thin, bright & shrill. I guess that if you audition it in your car you can turn the treble all the way down & the bass all the way up & this will get you within the ballpark of the frequency balance of the original recordings. If alas you only get to listen on audiophile gear without tone controls then you've bought yourself an expensive coaster.Since this same scenario played out recently with two other Sony Legacy cds [Duke's Anatomy of a Murder & Billie's Lady in Satin], I checked for info on the remastering. No surprise -the same man is responsible for vandalizing all three. Mr Schaap, please call your audiologist."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last - Although not quite there yet","review":"At last somebody who actually cares about the series made a film of it. My only criticism is that it was a bit too low budget. Ms Staden was excellent as Modesty, though I agree that she is going to have to work out a bit if she is going to play the older Blaise in a later film.One point about the secret agent issue: I suggest that some people read/reread the books. It is very clear that Modesty worked with (although not \\"for\\" as she herself underlines on a couple of occasions ) British Intelligence more than once. Indeed two of her closest friends are senior intelligence officers - remember the name Sir Gerald Tarrant anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good--for Modesty fans","review":"I just finished watching the Miramax \\"My Name is Modesty\\", and, I'm afraid, actually enjoyed it. Understand something--it's not a full blown, big-budget action blowout. But it tells the story of fiction's most spectacular female agent, one rendered for thirty years in comic strips and more than ten novels. Peter O'Donnell's creation is brought more fully to life here than in previous live-action incarnations, but it's a small film, made so that Miramax could keep their movie rights. That said, I loved it, and real Modesty fans will as well. More to the point, I now have hope that someone might make a \\"real\\" full out Blaise film one day. This isn't a bad start at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Case, Not a Bad Movie....","review":"As previous reviewers point out, the DVD case is completely misleading. Whoever designed the front cover and wrote the back copy clearly had never seen the movie.* There are no car chases in this movie* \\"most lethal secret agent\\"?!? (She's not a secret agent)* \\"sexy spy\\" (She's not a spy.)* \\"revenge ... payback...\\" (C'mon ... the women is trying to get out of a hostage situation ...)In addition to...* While the female lead had her moments, she looks anorexic (not very attractive). There are SO many beautiful women out there ... where do they producer/directors find these boney women?!?* The overall acting is stilted at times.If you can get past the lies on the front cover and the low budget production feel, this movie provides a fairly good story.I'd give it a higher rating, but the unethical false advertising of the cover is something I find very disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"After disastrous 60's movie and TV shows, this one shines","review":"For a prequel, this was surprisingly good, expecially when compared with previous attempts. As other reviewers noted, production values are not what they could be and Modesty is too flabby to be the fighting machine she is supposed to be. But the director and actors and the writers actually seemed to understand who and what Modesty Blaise is supposed to be about. As for flab, the TV blonde Modesty played by Diana Crosby (I think that was the name) was flabbier and much more of a weakling and the later dark-haired one on TV smiled too much. Except for the flabbiness, I could almost believe this Modesty. I wish they would start making the Modesty Blaise movies. The public is now ready to accept a strong physical woman such as Modesty. If you are a Modesty Blaise fan, the DVD is worth having.

I called Sunbeam, and they said the control was defective and they'd send a replacement the following day. The replacement arrived on February 6th! I plugged it in and guess what? It was even more useless than the other! Some people on here have good functioning pads, so I suspect there are a number of bad ones, or they've been reconditioned or returned and Sunbeam is just playing Russian Roulette with the orders. I had a similar Sunbeam pad for years and I loved it -- it died after much use and I was trying to replace a really great heating pad.

Maybe some people's do, and maybe some others just like the pad cooler. But on the highest setting, I don't think this got as hot as the low setting on my 30-year-old pad.In addition:1. It has a digital display with no backlight. You have to have the light on to see to set it.2. Only the quilted part heats up, and that's about the size of a standard pad.

It's very disappointing, actually. I don't know if it's a defect, or if there are variations between individual items in this regard, but it's hard for me to imagine how anyone could possibly say that MY pad gets \\"really hot.\\" I'd describe it more as \\"luke-warm\\"--and that's at the HIGHEST setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"SunBeam keeps bringing you the Best Products","review":"The new SunBeam Heating pads have come a long way fromtheir past!

I wanted one exactly like my old one. So I began to look on line and found one on your site with the same model #. I am very pleased with it and also it was a few $ less than the one I took back to WM.

She wanted one that was soft and flexible, that attained sufficient heat, and that was easy to clean. This heating pad fulfills all of her desires. We especially like the fact that the entire pad is machine washable. The controls are simple to use. Overall, she is very happy with this heating pad. (And, you can't beat the price, either.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the trick","review":"I found it a little strange that in order to get wet heat you have to sprinkle the outside covering (my old heating pad had a thin, removable inside sponge).

Good size too."},{"rating":"2","title":"warmth where you need it","review":"After using an old heating pad of my grandmother's for 30 years I was delighted to find an updated and improved version from the same company.This pad is much improved with a detachable control and machine wash capability.

I have chronic migraines and neck pain and I cannot describe how invaluable this heating pad has been! I got one and used it nearly every day for almost two and a half years before it died. I have ordered another one and am using it now. The control allows you to set the heat level from 1 to 5/H and it will auto shut off after two hours but you can set it to shut off after a longer period or to stay on indefinitely if desired. It's flexible quality makes it ideal for a number of injuries (back, neck, knees, ankles, shoulder, etc). I really like the pad itself because the surface is a quilted texture which the heat comes from directly not two pieces - a pad and a the heavy outer coating you see with a number of heating pads. I would highly recommend this heating pad to anyone in the market - the price is reasonable and it's features make it worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAVE TO GIVE IT FIVE STARS","review":"This is the first album in which McGuinn and Clarence White were the main shapers of the Byrds sound.

Silly questions are the \\"How do you put the toliet paper on\\" type of questions.

I would recommend these to any baseball team looking for leather balls for their practice needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality for the money","review":"Coming from 17 years of playing baseball and several more years of coaching, these baseballs are great for any form of practice. They beat hands down the cheap vinyl balls, which a lot of Little League coaches use because of the low cost. These balls have slight blemishes that keep them from being sold as game ball quality (i.e. some string hanging off the stitching, some places where the leather doesn't quite sit right, the printing might be off, or leather might have a spot of discoloration, etc). But like I said, you can't beat these for practice balls. For a great cost you get 5 dozen balls that will last you a couple of years use if taken care of.

After all, for goodness sake, how bad can it be?The answer is, very, very bad. I really, REALLY resent having to install this kind of adware on my machine, just so I can pay a game that I paid good cash for.

Though it concerns the song-of-experience theme of betrayal and infidelity, it's a PG-13 song of innocence about a woolly-haired young man whose hero is a national darts champion. His journey to a getting-of-wisdom takes him on a moped along narrow two-lane roads and across rolling countryside, where the people he encounters open a world to him he never knew existed.Almost lost among the oafish, inconsiderate and embittered people, young and old, who surround him, he finds good reason to be touched by those capable of appreciating him. Instead of spoiling his innocence, his experience of this world only seems to deepen it. Michael Sheen as Colin is wonderful, his smile beatific, and his face registering a remarkable range of emotions. If it's possible to put a lump in your throat, this feel-good movie will do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SS Power Outlet","review":"The Stainless Steel finish is great.

Once again he includes the same songs, virtually identical versions, of songs we've heard too many times. Some of the more obscure material here is excellent, but to include a over 10 minute version of tenth ave. freezeout, with the ridiculous introductions of the band, was too much. Then to include the worst song he's ever continued playing live, Murder Inc., is incredible. I say his having seen him many times, and owning many boots that put this to shame. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"I saw Springsteen in the Meadowlands at the beginning of his tour August 7, 1999, and he was teriffic. By the time he got to Madison Square Garden he was bored. He tweaks the numbers and tries to stylize them to be artistic. All he succeeds in doing is providing second class entertainment.

The guitar solo from Nils on Youngstown brings back the memories from the concerts I saw. It will send chills up your spine.All the music is great, but I have to agree, the editing could have been better on the second disk. But The Boss could only choose from the two shows he recorded, so choices were limited. But, hey, I can't complain...awesome disk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We need some quite","review":"Live in NYC is a great CD and just another reminder of why Bruce has been so good and popular for so long. It's because his music and lyrics were writtin for a reason. The sound and the soul is very powerfull. American Skin is an incredible song with a unusual arrangment for Bruce. The lyrics are down write scary, it this song dosent make you think about purpose, reality and the fragil state of life nothing will. It is a masterpiece. Overall the CD is great very telling of the shows and the band sounds great. American Skin, though, has me yearning for a new CD from The Man and The Band. I'll be waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of emotion","review":"I admit it, this is my first Springsteen CD.

Not that Bruce has totally lost touch with his roots, but his new accent...the country-western twang thing, I mean, where did the Jersey accent go? \\"The Rangers had a homecoming in Hawwlum late last night\\"??Get a hold of some of the popular live stuff from '78 (or earlier!) and you won't believe your ears!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The same old stuff again!!","review":"How many more 'greatest' hits albums can one artist produce before his fans start crying foul? The absurdity here is almost reaching Jimi Hendrix levels.

Hey, if I want to meet the band, I will look at and then read the inside of the CD cover!

And for one simple reason. I never saw a concert of The Boss and his E-Street Band. They never came to Brazil to play. \\"Oh, they are too americans\\" people say here. Oh, what a shame. Music is an universal language and, listening to Bruce's live albums (I have all the four) and watching his dance with The Big Man Clarence Clemmons, the raising of hands of all the little preeties from coastline to the city, I was really able to understand the meaning of lots of things like companionship, musicianship, harmony, communion.

I think there are many people like Paul who felt like the government wasn't doing enough to protect its citizens and took on a guardian angel approach. There are other people like Lana who have a different perspective on it, maybe due to her travels and living abroad as an expat which helps her see things from a different perspective, but she is still deeply affected. I think this movie helps us see these two perspectives and therefore helps us deal with our personal grief and feelings about the terrorist attack. It is so important that Wenders has put the issue of 9/11 which was so publicised and hyped in the context of the homeless problem which is so completely ignored. This film is simple, but insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree with Mr. Barton's review in finding this movie established upon simply too many overly raw cliches in its heavyhanded treatment of the subject matter.

After wading through mounds of trivialities, I was sorely disappointed. It doesn't provide any maps that actually tell you anything but the basic buildings and road paths in a given city --not even what the buildings are. Add to that the fact that every class section is about 1-2 page summary that glosses over the class. No indication what spells really do except whether they are a buff, direct damage, area effect, etc. Overall, I think I get better information from some of the worst Dark Age of Camelot websites on the internet. The most useful things I found was a little bit of generic flavor and a couple of the listed websites (which you can find with any decent search engine)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless, outdated, incorrect","review":"If you are newbie, this guide is not for you.

While a worthy reference at the time, subsequent changes have rendered much of the information in it useless. New spell lines were added, classes were rebuilt, entirely new zones and features were added.

Any other smaller sized footballs will just sit on the two lower arms leaving a gap between the ball and the upper arm.

I enjoyed the great character development, however, there were at least 1/2 dozen characters that were completely left hanging when the end came.

I have visited most of the places he talks about, I was even married in the \\"Our Lady of Plillar\\" in Recoletta. I thought Griffen's Marine Corps series was his best work and perhaps it is because of how many books there are in it.

Joe Henderson's Coltranesque sounds add heat to the already hot mix. Herbie Hancock contributes cool dissonant and abstract tones and George Benson adds darker colors and a distinctive rock feel.If you can dig this, check out Donald Byrd's Electric Byrd and Bobby Hutcherson's San Francisco, from the same year. These are great but neglected albums, vilified by jazz purists but unnoticed by fusion fans. What a shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddie at his best!","review":"This album is hot! There is an incredible group of musicians on this album and they outdo themselves! George Benson is never better, in my opinion, than on Freddie's CTI recordings of this time. I think Straight Life and Sky Dive are Benson's best. This album is soo cool it sounds very new and inovative even today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor finishing","review":"This set of knifes is of so poor quality that cut my finger even using properly.

Each music business author has a unique approach, and Whitsett proves to be unusually well qualified to advise publishers, thanks to his wealth of domestic and foreign experience working with major publishers. The mouth-watering chapter in Whitsett's book, which echoes most young songwriters' first question, is \\"How Much Can I Really Earn from a Hit Song?\\" For anyone contemplating a venture into publishing, I strongly recommend Tim Whitsett's guidebook.

The whole book is just the practice exam with the last few pages having contact info for the board (which I could have gotten online). The contact info is out of date (I know at least one of the states is now governed by a different board) and doesn't list all 50 states.

I love Kevin Leman so I knew this would be a great series of books. It's based on generalizations, though, so while most of it was good and true, some of it was a little off for our family and situation. But overall the book is great and it's neat to have a book for each child letting them know they are a special part of the family.

Teena Marie is one of the most talented performers there is, and this album showcases some of her brightest moments from her Epic affiliation. \\"Just Us Two\\" gets you into the album, and the sweeping, operatic vocal stylings of \\"Ooh La La La\\" show Marie's incredible range. Particularly engaging songs include the soulful tribute to Marvin Gaye \\"My Dear Mr. Gaye,\\" the classic-soul sound of ballad \\"Dear Lover,\\" and, as a fitting conclusion to the album, the beautiful jazzy torch song \\"Casanova Brown.\\" As the last note of this song fades away, you feel like you have come back to reality from some other dimension. This album is definitely worth it, whether you are a curious listener (like I was) or a diehard fan (like I am now).

The ISMH is designed to give the reader an introduction to specific basic material in a domain format under the CISSP program. It was never designed to be a brain-dump or all inclusive study guide to pass the exam. Subsequent volumes of this series either updates or introduces other topics in each domain.If you are looking for an all inclusive study-guide for the CISSP cert then this book is not for you. However, it is easily arguable that no book can be an all inclusive tome of the expansive subject matter the certification covers.

So far I have read thru chapter 8 and feel really sorry for anyone relying on this for accurate information. The chapter on extranets was complete rubbish, the chapter on SSO went on about specific vendor solutions and seemed out of place, the whole thing is disorganized and inconsistent, and I have since ordered the CISSP Prep Guide instead.

It is without a doubt the worst conversion to DVD that I have seen. It is blurry,and washed out in most of the film with lots of scratches running down the picture.

But I picked the wrong version. The thumbnail cover picture showed \\"Cinemascope\\" so I figured this was a good bet. Wrong. First, it is in widescreen, but it's 4:3 Letterbox, not 16:9 anamorphic. You can still zoom in to fill your screen, but the resolution is very poor. In fact it's poor even before zooming. And, oh yes, the letters \\"RE\\" are displayed in great big letters in the lower right hand corner of the screen -- for the entire movie! Maybe I should thank Reel Enterprises for doing that to remind me to never purchase any of their DVD products again. Guess I should have bought the remastered edition advertised further up the page, but this one had a later release date (2006) so I figured it would be okay.

What a way to start! After a year of listening to \\"cross-over\\" fusion, this album is definitely what pulled me across!!I was fortunate enough to see Paul Desmond perform with Dave Brubeck just a few years later on their 25th Anniversary Tour, and I still consider this album's performance to be his finest epitath. Sir Roland Hanna is amazing, as is the young Steve Gadd. Several well-conceived solos by Chet Baker helped fuel his mid-'70's comeback. Ron Carter was simply born to play with Jim Hall. If you don't own this CD yet, you are in for a long overdue treat. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hall, Desmond, Baker = awesome.","review":"This is a great album. Chet Baker is really good and with his reputation for excessive behavior it is more remarkable. Chet is on his game as is Desmond. Jim Hall is good as expected, but it is the ensemble work with the 2 horn players that makes this exceptional. I like this album much more than Bill Evans' Interplay which is also an ensemble album with Jim Hall. Stereophile magazine has used this album to test speakers and I understand why. It is well recorded and has fine performances. I recommend higly for any fan of Paul Desmond who would like to hear Paul in a group other than the Brubeck quartet. That being said, this is a Jim Hall feature and he is also in great but understated form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Fluff","review":"This is probably Jim Hall's most famous recording. One reviewer dismissed it as vile fluff. No accounting for taste. Depends on what your preferences are. One of my friends turned me on to this recording and she vastly prefers this to Miles Davis account of Rodrigo's concerto for guitar which I love but gosh I really like this too. One might call this WHITE Jazz. The piano solo ROCKS with deep beauty. There is a very good reason why super models should be walking down a runway to this kind of music.

No one is doing it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A typical Ken Burns Production","review":"I've never been a big fan of Mark Twain, nor Ken Burns. Twain's work becomes tiresome and the same holds true for Burn's productions. While the basic idea of using period photographs and quoting actual documents is a good one, having actors and comedians give their views adds nothing to the picture. True, Hal Holbrook \\"potrayed\\" Twain on stage, but his interview was rambling and incoherant. And why was Dick Gregory interviewed ?Really, the PBS special could have been better. The book is a \\"must have for Twain fans\\", but otherwise I would ignore it.I ended up disliking Twain more after reading the book and seeing the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burns does it again","review":"After having the privilege to listen to Ken Burns introduce his new documentary on Mark Twain, I am even more awed by Twain's humble greatness both as the pre-eminent American author and a contemplative human being. Through this biography I noticed how similar Mark Twain's own development was to that of maturing America. In most cases Twain was ahead of his time.I was moved by the story of his cook's experience as a slave and Twain's own progressive thoughts on race. The research thatthis groups did into Twain's life and all the wonderful photos make him even more real and timeless. Mark Twain's humor is asrelevant today as it was almost 100 years ago. And that he is probably the greatest American novelist just makes Twain evenappealing.I plan on staying glued to my TV during the two nights in January when the series is played on PBS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quality resource for performers","review":"Mastering the Art of Performance breaks down the aspects of performance in a way that gives you confidence that you'll cover all your bases as you prepare for a show.

I tried to like these chips, since based off the reviews on here, they're supposed to be superb, but I can't. The jalapeno taste is very mild as well, you'd have to eat a dozen of these puffs before you get the kick of the jalapeno, and even that kick never gets to the true spiciness level of a jalapeno. As for the cheddar and blue cheese flavors, I taste mostly cheddar and a light blue cheese smell... that's it.

This book has many positive qualities that can assist with testing comprehension: filling in answers like that on a public school test and many questions formated as state tests would by offering multiple choice. Although most of the questions are manageable I found some to be a bit confusing for myself as well as my son.

Jane Fonda cavorting with smiling North Vietnamese was a little hard to take.The classic VC female shots with weapon in hand were right off of Communist leaflets and similar portrayals can be found in North Vietnamese stamps of that era.I would take a look at this book in the library or in a bookstore but I would not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just.

Realesed in 1959 a year of great jazz albums including many of the greats, \\"Kind of Blue\\", \\"The Shape Of Jazz To Come\\", \\"Mingus Ah Um\\", and \\"Time Out\\", respectively. By 1959 jazz was stretching out in new forms and ideas and this album on proves this statement even more. Time Out is based upon the use of time signatures that were very unusaul for jazz at the time like, waltz, double waltz time etc. Even though Time Out was intended for an experiement the album has become one of the best selling greatest jazz albums of all time and in 2005 it was one of 50 recordings chosen for preservation in the Library Of Congress, so what are you waiting for? If you still havent heard this album than go out and buy it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential album - Brubeck's first (but not last) experiment with time.","review":"This is, as most other reviewers have already mentioned, a classic. It represents a brilliant fusion of jazz, blues and northern european classical music, while also exploring numerous difficult time signatures. Released in 1959, this album was certainly cutting edge in terms of its ambitious aspirations. It still sounds fresh. Dave Brubeck's classical training shines through, while Paul Desmond's sweet saxophone tone complements Dave's playing brilliantly. This album was a jumping off point, and the quartet's time experiments continued over the next handful of years, with \\"Time Further Out\\", \\"Time Changes\\", \\"Countdown: Time In Outer Space\\", and \\"Time In\\", all of which are also exceptional albums. A fantastic album that serves as a great starting point for those experiencing Brubeck, or jazz for that matter, for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This is a classic recording from the Dave Brubeck group. The alto saxophone Paul Desmond plays beautiful lines with clean improvisations. After you listen to this recording will understand why it is one of the bestseller in the jazz history.

Delighted to have this CD. Not quite the fidelity of the original but still very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take Five...","review":"released in 1959 this album was originally intended as an experiment using time signatures which break out the beats in a bar of music which was unorthodox for jazz at that time. This experimental album turned out one of the best known and biggest selling jazz albums of all time. Dave Brubeck on piano, Paul Desmond on alto sax, Eugen Wright on double bass and Joe Morello on drums. The venerable classic TAKE FIVE is on the album and everyone seems to have their own take and memories of that song. A jazz classic, give it a listen, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic..","review":"If I said to get this album for \\"Take Five\\" only, it'd be a huge disservice to one of the best jazz albums I've ever heard. This is a classic and deserves to be in everyone's music collection.Brubeck is on fire on the piano and Desmond is silky and smooth on the saxophone. Wright works the bass to excellence and Morello shines on the drums.From the beginning notes of \\"Blue Rondo A La Turk\\", to the last cut \\"Pick Up Sticks\\", it's a mesmerizing experience. \\"Strange Meadow Lark\\" is beautiful. Then there is \\"Take Five\\", heard countless times everwhere, but still sounds as fresh as ever.A timeless album that will give years of listening pleasure.

I have a friend who wore out his vinyl version of this. There's some great stuff here, and if you are a huge fan of the quarteet, then I recommend this. However, I think the Carnegie Hall concert recording is superior - so if you are only going to get one DB CD, get that one instead. On this CD, the quartet is still just getting used to the unusual time signatures, whereas by the time they get to Carnegie Hall, 9/8, 11/4, 5/4, whatever, it's in their DNA and it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Buy Just Two Jazz CD's","review":"\\"Time Out\\" by Brubeck is one of them and \\"Kind of Blue\\" by Miles Davis is the other. You will then be the proud owner of the two best selling Jazz albums of alltime. Both take a couple of lstenings before they start making an impact. But when they do you'll never put them down. When Time out hit the stores in the 60's every teen who was in to building/configuring his own Stereo equipment purchased that album as it was the ultimate recording for testing your new toys. When the CD finally came out i was disappointed as it lacked the brillance the Columbia 33 1/3 album had. Most notable was the 1st song \\"Blue Rondo A La Turk \\" The drum's symbols use to blow you across the room. They were so clear and distinct, unlike the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Word on a Classic","review":"The reason I write a review for a record like this - which has had so many sensitive and eloquent remaks made about it - is because no real love for great art should go unexpressed. The magic of this record is not really in the tricky time signatures; it is in the fact that Brubeck overlays 4/4 melodies over 5/4 rythems; and 4/4 melodies over 3/4 rythem, and 3/4 melodies over 4/4 and 5/4 rythems. He is very clever and inspired when it comes to altering the rythmeic character beneath an understandable 4/4 or 3/4 melody and then bringing back the rythemic regularity to end the melodic phrase.This is why this record is so enjoyable. It is a playful record. It ought not be compared to records that Davis and his imitators were making at about the same time. Such comparisons are like comparing Dr. Strangelove to Dr. Zhivago. To comapre them is to insult them both, and we should love all of these artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable - The absolute standard for popular Jazz","review":"I have been hooked on Jazz ever since finding my Dad's Jazz LPs in the basement 40 years ago.

Unreserved rocomendation of one the greatest Jazz alblums ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic","review":"This CD brought back great memories. This was one of the few early crossover hits from Jazz to popular music. (back in the day when an instrumental could be a best seller). Musically it is complex, a collection of unusual time signatures (for instance, Take Five is written in 5/4 time). But it's also just good listening for upbeat daydreaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jazz landmark","review":"A lot of people must have approached \\"Time Out\\" with great suspicion on its release: a \\"cold\\" jazz pianist leading a quartet in odd tempos. What could be more squaresville than that? But Dave Brubeck was so inspired in the conception that it could not fail; if breaking jazz out of the 4-4 trap ultimately led the music down cul-de-sacs it was worth it for the sublime melodies and brilliant use of rhythm. It didn't hurt to have first-rank players, especially Paul Desmond, who if he owed a lot to Stan Getz made his own mark with his understated, smooth, supremely eloquent approach to the sax.One of the all time great recordings, excellently remastered, and a must for any music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Miracle!","review":"To me, the original Dave Brubeck Quartet, with Paul Desmond present as sax player, is so unusual in that my adored saxophonist and my detested pianist coexisted and stayed together for 17 years. It's a bit like John Lennon and Ono Yoko performing and producing albums together after The Beatles broke out. Listening to the original Bruebeck Quartet albums, for the most part, has always been the mixture of thorough admiration wherever Desmond plays and perseverance wherever Brubeck takes the solo, thus making me long for Desmond's play even more with greater appreciation. It's like Double Fantasy album by John and Yoko.Take Five is exceptional in that it is the only album that Brubeck does not bother me with his play. In fact, it is this sharp contrast exhibited by lylical Paul and choppy Dave that makes this album so special and enjoyable. I even like Dave's solo in Kathy's Waltz, a miracle indeed. No wonder Take Five has become a masterpiece of the truest kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Jazz Album.","review":"This is it.If you only have the most peripheral sense of what jazz is, this is the only album you should own.Not just Brubeck, but jazz as an art is judged, benchmarked, and reviewed against this ablum - and why not?These flawless studio cuts of \\"Strange Meadowlark,\\" Blue Rondo A La Turk,\\" and \\"Take Five\\" are among the most recognizable cuts in the history of recorded music, and there is a reason for it - they are fabulous.Is \\"Take Five\\" about the coolest, birth of modern jazz slickest, tune ever? Probably.I have little understanding of the remarkable and unconvetional time signitures explored here, though they are known to be ground breaking. I only recognize this as one of the coolest collections of jazz tunes ever. Not beautiful, not emotional, but: cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Deep","review":"Completely fun jazz from maestro Brubeck and company, this will appease any enthusiast of the genre.

Melody on 3 of the songs is fantastic: \\"Take Five\\", \\"Three to get ready\\" and \\"Kathy's Waltz\\". You can really tap your way through a mundane chore listening to it.The length of time for this album is short though, but considering this a Classic Jazz album, I feel it's sufficient for the money I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, Masterpiece","review":"Best cd to buy to get you introduced to the world of Jazz. I bought this cd cause I liked the the 3rd track, Take Five. It has been used in countless movies and also a few commmercials, once you hear it you will recognize it immediately. If you buy it for that one song, you will keep on listening to it for the other songs on the album. If you are interested in Jazz then try this album for a spin, 85-90 percent of the people who listen to this album will start buying other Jazz albums and other Brubeck albums.Sound Quality is more of a 4, it is really good(HDCD) but not the best.

The rest of us punters should buy this album, immediately! Yes, Take Five is overplayed, but who cares? Some obnoxiously catchy tunes are clever enough to deserve being listened to over and over again. Obey your tastes with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandpas Don't Want to Have Fun","review":"I steered clear from this album for a long time because I was afraid it would sound like white dudes playing jazz. I was wrong. It sounds like OLD white dudes playing jazz. The only worthwhile song is \\"Take Five\\" and it's likely due to the fact that it's the one tune not composed by Brubeck. Simple, over-polished Snoresville. Music as toothless as the denture-wearing men performing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re: If Jesus Liked Jazz","review":"A fine jazz album for people who are not sure if they like jazz. The music is pleasing without being offensive, or particularly moving. Sure it is a fine place to start, but one would hope that a person's tastes would deepen quickly. I always had a suspicion that this album was rediculously over-rated, and seeing the reviews here confirm my feelings. It's a good pop jazz album, not as swinging or interesting as anything else back then, and a bit dated now. One reviewer said \\"take out your Kenny G and put this in,\\" I am sure it was meant as some kind of slam on Kenny G, but it seems like a fair estimation on the impact this record has had on jazz. I am sure that Jesus likes Mingus more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: Format","review":"I know this album very well since I have the original which was released in the early 60s, but I don't want to play it and accelerate it's deterioration. In my current state of techno ignorance, however, I did not realize this format (SACD) was not compatible with my CD player.

The heroine, Amy, is a realistically unpleasant little girl whose behavior is not justified or explained even by her dad's irresponsibility which impoverishes the family.. it's just laid out for you to see. Amy ingratiates herself with people she admires even after she sees they're racist bullies. She has to find her own answers; there weren't any kindly \\"counselors\\" back then. As for the idea that the boys seem \\"superior\\" to girls, face it; physically, at that age, they are. What Amy goes through with the boys in the park is an everyday reality that can't be changed by all the politically correct girls-can-do-anything wishful thinking in the world. There's more to identify with in the Amy stories than with all the unrelentingly cheerful Sweet Valley books in the world. Besides, I just love Rosa and I'd like to have a ball like that, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite. See what you think.","review":"I didn't care for this book.

Will usually has a firm grasp of the facts, and his columns remind us of the themes of the early 1990's (George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, Ross Perot, Gulf War, etc.). For these reasons this book is clearly worth reading. But Will loses some of his edge with his relentless knocks against President Clinton, and by endorsing fads like term limits. Still, these are informative columns, written by one not afraid to criticize friends or praise opponents. As a thinking conservative, Will is no screeching fool like Coulter, Limbaugh, or others that that twist facts, invent statistics, and slander dissenters. Thoughtful readers may often disagree with Will, but they'll usually learn something from his columns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle mellow story and illustrations","review":"This story is about a poor woodcutter who saves a faerie (also known as a fairy) from a circling hawk. In return the fairy grants him one wish. It is a difficult decision for the man because his wife wants a child, his mother wants her eyesight restored, and his father wants gold so they will no longer go hungry. He stares up to the sky for inspiration, and a falling star helps him make his choice. It is a clever choice because he has considered all the compelling requests and comes up with one wish that answers all.The book has beautiful illustrations and aligns well with the mellow story.We have found that the book is more suitable for children who are happy just to listen - it is not a book where the children get excited about what is going to happen next and attempt to guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a rehearsal","review":"I ordered this disc and before opening it realized it is a rehearsal of the 7th, not simply a recording of it so decided to return it.

First, I plugged it into my PC (Windows XP Pro) and it did show up as an external drive, but I was unable to drag and drop songs onto it. I only received an error notice. I then installed the software and suddenly my computer would no longer even recognize the player was attached to it. Then the LCD started freaking out and displaying weird gray lines instead of what it is supposed to show when it is connecting to the PC.I had also tried the radio before doing all this and it was very poor as most of the ones that come built into an mp3 player are.Bottom line: I'll be taking it back today and getting a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal for all the features you get.","review":"I loved this baby since day one. Everyone who couldn't get theres to work has to be a computer dummy. All you had to do was plug it into your computer and drag the songs into the new drive that popped up. Most people that wrote bad reviews already had the notion that its not a &quot;Sony&quot; or a &quot;Rio&quot; so it won't work. As for all you smart ones out there, this thing is great. It works as good as a &quot;Sony&quot; or a &quot;Rio&quot; would. The only downfall to this player is the case is plastic so it looks like it will break easily but it won't. I dropped mine while running on the treadmill and it still works like new (a little scratched though)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good MP3 player.","review":"I totally disagree with the other consumer. A year ago (Christmas 02) I got one, and it costed $200. It was a Rio Sport and contained 128MB with an FM Tuner, and a MMC Card Slot (MMC Cards are those little disks that give the MP3 player more MB for more music). This October (2003), i purchased one for my sister's birthday and I came across this one. Over $100 less than the one I got last year, with the exact same insides. The sound quality is good. For people on a budget or dont want to spend alot of money, this, I recommend.

According to the packaging it is no different from more expensive models, but it is. If the backlight wasn't on, there was only a black screen. I assumed this was a defect, so I returned it. The new one was the same. There is a marked delay when changing songs. Navigating the radio controls is very confusing. I only had the unit for a few hours before I returned it and got a more expensive MP3 player. If your going to spend the money, spend a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this product!!!!","review":"This product is a rip-off!! The radio does not work at all hardly- and when it does you have to keep moving it torward the direction of a radio tower! This means that you can not put it in your pocket while listening to it! The directions to working this mp3 suck! They tell you to do something and it doesn't work, when I finally got into the file and put a song on my mp3, it wouldn't play. I have yet to get this to work and I plan on returning it and getting the RIO 128MB instead. Not to mention the support that you call in for is not toll free, and costs a buncle to get help, it would be easier just to return the stupid thing and get a better product!

I took it back after a failed attempt to set the radio presets. I spent over a half an hour trying to touch the buttons just right in order to set the presets for the FM. This is in contrast to the radio-only Sony SRF-M35 that I own takes a split second in order to preset a station. I am a technical person and found it impossible with the Memorex biomorph to set more than one radio preset without the \\"feature\\" kicking in that sets all of the presets randomly for you. If you don't care about the radio it might be all right, but then the RCA Lyra 128MB is probably a better option in that case. If you ever planned on using the radio, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with Napster","review":"I purchased this to use with Napster and was told by the sales man that there would be now problem with it.

It was very small, and I wanted to use it for running. When I got it and read the directions they were completely different from what my computer was offering. They leave out quite a bit of instructions. I was unsuccessful in installing all the software and putting mp3's into my player. They're online website was just the same. They had different instructions for installing than the manual I got, but the instructions didn't work anyway. I can't say It works bad, because I never got that far. But I'm not going to waste my time on a product where the company won't get back to you promptly on your questions and has 3 different set of installation directions, which none of them work."},{"rating":"1","title":"good if you like disposable players","review":"I read the reviews and decided to try this player since it was on sale for $88. At first it worked out fine, although I would have to agree that setting FM station presets is a pain. The sound was just as good as my previous Rio 600. However, I found that it had problems randomly playing WMA files--it seemed to choose about six songs and just play those. Once I switched to mp3's I had no problems. But that lasted only another 4 or 5 excercise sessions--the last two times I used it, it wouldn't turn off, and I had to release the battery to get it to shut off. Now it doesn't start at all (and yes, I did have fresh batteries).

No problem at all loading the software with XP. I was in love with this little device and literally used it 2 times while running 45 minutes each time. This unit now reboots itself and will not turn on no matter how many times i go through the troubleshooting part of the manual and reset the unit. So...for 100 bucks, I got 1.5 hours out of this piece of crap.

Tried customer service phone number and you sit on hold, then leave a message. Wrote an e-mail to technical support and never received a response. Took back to store, got a Phillips 128mb Rush player and it works great! Also, their customer service reps were standing by just in case but, it was so user friendly that I didn't even need it. If you have this player, take it back to the store and spend the extra $20 to get a Phillips.

I have had these issues with this player:- Select switch broke off.- Specs say upgradeable to 512MB, but if you use a 256MB SD or MMC card, you only have about 10 minutes of battery life. They don't tell you this before you buy.- Battery connection is not secure. If the player is jostled a bit, it will loose power.- Poor quality earphones.- This player has destroyed two memory cards. Memorex technical support denies that there are problems with this player that can destroy memory cards and refuses to replace them.I have stuck with this player because I didn't want to sink more money into MP3 players. This was my first mistake - this player was cheaper than other players and I got what I paid for. I will be in the market for a new MP3 soon and I think I will invest more for a decent player. Memorex won't be considered."},{"rating":"1","title":"No DRM compatibility?? Give Me a Break","review":"I purchased my Memorex player a few days ago. First the pros to the item. The quality of the music is very good. That's it. Now the cons. The absolute worst thing about this item is that it does not play DRM wma files. In other words it doesn't play songs that you download legally from Napster, I-tunes, etc. This is absolutely ridiculous. Another is that the loading of the songs takes too long. Also the earphones are very ackward and cause pain to the ears if kept in to long. I took it back after having it for 2 days. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this player.

It tries to be witty, but really comes of as cheesy/corny- I found myself constantly rewinding. The material just doesn't sink in. The stories and dialogue aren't memorable. Perhaps this is so because of the pace. I'd rather have fewer words and actually learn those words, than sweep through many words and have to backtrack.

Also vocals only appear on two tracks, but they add a nice element for those who think this is machine music. The music never sounds looped (it sounds live actually). Most of the tracks are propulsive, instrumental pieces and repeated listens prove their staying power. The vox populi has spoken (can I be the voice of an entire people??)--this is recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"durable","review":"I've had this case for over a year, and I have been taking it everywhere I travel (with only one lens on my Nikon D90 of course). The side pockets are great for extra lens filter and remote control, or a USB cord. It's easy to carry, or put in a bigger bag/case/backpack if you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice little caase, to bad about the strap","review":"This is a handy case for small digital slrs with medium to short lens. Nice pockets and zippers.Too bad that the strap is not beefier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very functional & attractive","review":"Nice case. You obviously need more space than this for traveling, to store a flash, lenses etc. But is great for day trips with 1 Adorama Slinger lens case. I put some extra padding at the bottom just for more safety - it looked inadequate there.Wish the strap were a little sturdier and longer - but hey, for $20 this is great. Now I can take my DSLR to socials/parties without lugging the heavy case."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not leather, just nylon ...","review":"It's a nice nylon camera bag for a big Point and Shoot camera or a basic SLR camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michele CSX 33 DiamondWatch","review":"Beautiful watch. Authentic and priced below msrp. Although I ordered the CSX Petite and received the CSX 33, I am still very pleased. When I brought this to the attention of the seller, they insisted I ordered the CSX 33, which was incorrect, but I am happy nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I thought this would be a whole lot thicker. It's just a short sermon on prayer and not worth the money. I feel really disappointed and feel absolutely duped. The society who print it should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"a pamphlet - not a book","review":"The illustration gives the impression that a book is being offered. It turned out to be a very small and short pamphlet. It's not worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meaniful and Timely","review":"Even though Mertons work is 44 years old it is very for today. This book helps you focus and understand the Psalms and outs them in a today view. I highly recommend this book for focusing on the Psalms and relating themt o today. In addition I have found all of Mertons work to be very realastic and one the layperson can put into daily use."},{"rating":"2","title":"An answered prayer!","review":"This book answered many questions I had for years about the Psalms and difficulties I had in praying the Psalms. It was a real eye-opener for me! I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil the beauty of the surprise awaiting the readers of this wonderful little book. It is a short and easy read and opens the beautiful world of the Psalms to those seeking a deeper understanding. I discovered it when my spiritual director loaned me his copy to read, and I am ever grateful for the revelations gained from this little book. So when I found it at amazon.com, I had to purchase a copy to share when the occasion arises...and it has!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This product is nothing but a block of wood, a t-bolt and a leveler along with screws that are too short. Save your money and go to the hardware store and buy a t-bolt and leveler, drill a hole and install.I bought this product and wound up tossing the wood and screws and using the t-bold and leveler only. I would have saved time and money if I had done the above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes but...","review":"it had great potential but in the end it was just disappointing. Too bad could have been a good thriller but it just didn't come together."},{"rating":"1","title":"the good doctor","review":"this movie is burring, it's just keep dragging on and you'll think maybe it'll get better soon. Hell no, the end makes no sense. Total waist of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Humdrum and Morbidly Depressing\\"","review":"There really doesn't seem to be enough \\"meat\\" on this movie to generate much viewer excitement. To the contrary, it is by-and-large a humdrum production, and its main claim to fame may be that the plot is morbidly depressing. Difficult to say why the \\"Doctor\\" in the story was give such a bad haircut--which was truly distracting. All-in-all, this film would have done better as an okay \\"made for TV\\" film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Prime Froze","review":"I honestly can't rate this movie for its worth because we could not watch it. A few minutes into the movie, the screen froze. We could not even get back to the main menu. After about 7 minutes, it started again, only to freeze again within a few minutes. After the third \\"freeze\\", I told my husband to get out of Amazon and back to Netflix where in the past several years, I have had few problems like this. I am a recent customer for Amazon Prime, and so far, not a happy one. So, Good Doctor, accept my apologies for associating you with the lousy service rendering our viewing of you impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense.","review":"It was hard for me to believe what was happening with him, every step of the way thinking he will get caught. It keeps you in suspense and wanting to see where he is going with this. Great acting too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot, but could do without the political diatribe.","review":"After reading this novel I could not escape the feeling that this was several hours I would never get back. The writing was hokey and formulaic. The plot had potential, but with all of the political prosthelitizing garbage that was thrown in, the total effect was ruined. I suppose this would appeal to the average Texan, as this baloney usually does, but to someone with a little bit of intellectual curiosity, it just seems like so much unnecessary crap. To be fair though, I did read this immediately after finishing The Davinci Code, which is somewhat akin to listening to Roseanne Barr's rendition of the Star Spangled Banner immediately after hearing it performed by the New York Philharmonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imrpovising Jazz Piano","review":"Another highly recommended book by John Mehegan. Just loaded with details and chord combinations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a delightful book which you will definitely enjoyreading to your child. My second grader read this book to me and heloved it and was laughing and commenting on the pictures throughoutthe book!The story is cute and nonsensical about fungus taking over and eating the school! The author, David Catrow did a wonderful job as his illustrations are most colorful, exagerrated and funny! They will sure keep your interest as you explore each and every page.As a parent I loved this book!This book is a winner and I thoroughly recommend it! ! It is sure to capture your child's imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Winner!","review":"After reading this book, you want to know why more publishers haven't used this format. You can not only find hundreds of things with computer-like speed, but it's about the most detailed and interesting travel guide I've read. If you're someone who gets lost walking around the living room, you'll have no problem getting around Toronto with this gem. What's more, you get a real restaurant guide thrown in (including 99 establishments with complete reviews), plus more local Web sites than you can handle. This is the best value you can imagine. When do we see a similar book about Montreal - or any other city for that matter?"},{"rating":"2","title":"LGA-YYZ Commuter","review":"What a great book! I can't think of anything they've left out. Five stars all round, but especially for being the most Web-savvy guide on the market. If you want an idiot-proof reference for Toronto in your pocket, go no further than this one. The others just don't come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trustworthy and well-creased","review":"I am sad to see there are some quite unfriendly reviews of this book. I used it every day when I first came to this city and still consult it with pleasure and in confidence. I have found it always useful and while I have learned much more about what is in Toronto I have not needed to buy a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I've purchased dozens of travel guides for many different cities/countries over the years and this is the worst one I've ever seen. I bought it based on the reviews, but am very disappointed. I'm going to ditch it and try a more familiar publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The SAS Learner edition is virtually useless for most purposes. There doesn't appear to be a way to code it directly (you have to use the \\"Enterprise Guide\\"), the output is not in the same format as the regular version, it's very picky about printers (the graphs won't print on my printer and will not \\"print to file\\" to be printed from there either), and it does NOT come with a useful manual even though the product description implies that it does. And worst of all, it does not help you to learn how to really use SAS software. This is a total waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamentally flawed","review":"This piece of software will prove useful to those looking to get a basic understanding of how the SAS system works. However, whilst the limit of 1000 records is perfectly acceptable for a learning tool, the ability to view your data tables has been REMOVED, therefore whilst you can the results of an analysis, you cannot see any of the data in your tables!! As a teacher, i cannot reccomend this software to my students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for experimenting with SAS 8.x programs","review":"When prompted to let SAS manage *.log and *.sc2 files, I had to decline or installation would hang. For other problems, consult their official website....The book and its on-line version that come with the software illustrate how to use the GUI-- but NOTHING MORE. The Help topics miss a lot of commands. And for those that are covered, examples are often not included. To really get started, you need help from other sources, such as SAS On-line Documentation. However, this product's price is still reasonable given the richness of its functionalities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice introduction","review":"I really enjoyed this film.I see that the other reviewers think it was biased. The point of the film was to introduce islam to people who don't know anything about it. I thought it was a wonderful film. It was not biased. The things ommitted had cause to be left out, because not all muslims share in the beliefs(Such as death penalty, that is not in the Quran!!!). The complexities can not be explained in one single film. I thought it was a very nice introduction, and quite accurate. I have been studying a lot on Islam and I definitely recommend this DVD. Very informative and captivating speakers! Beautiful footage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The best of the History Channel is still pretty bad","review":"This documentary has all the bad qualities of a typical History Channel production -- the same reenactment clips over and over, skipping interesting points, glib overview. Get the PBS version instead.Empires - Islam: Empire of Faith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomely informative","review":"I would recommend this video for anyone who would like to understand Islam. I actually watched this video while I was deployed to Iraq and vetted it through quite a few Iraqis. I let a few watch it and they had nothing but good things to say about it. I also shared waht I learned with other Iraqis and there were very impressed with what I learned from this video. This video is also very unbiased, a huge plus. This video also shows a great respect for the religion becaus it never shows or depicts the Prophet Mohammed in any way (it is forbidden in Islam to show any images of Muhammed). This video will take you on a journey from the very beginnings of Islam to today. This video is a worthwhile investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to the religion of Islam.","review":"This documentary does well to describe the history and tradition of the religion of Islam.A warning to those that purchase this video, if you are looking for information that has the purpose of just describing the religion and not having any political undertone, this documentary does poorly. There are three short segments in the video where a narrator takes time to remind the viewer of the events of September 11th.If I was purchasing a documentary on Christianity, I would not have the slightest interest in a subjective opinion of the personal faith and motivation behind certain groups or persons that claim Christianity as their religion(the 2006 president of the US for example).The video does offer a lot of useful information regarding the religion though, despite a small smudge here and there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I thought this was a good intro to Islam. I do agree with what a few of the others said tho, they do mention the whole 9/11 aspect and that it was Muslims who did it. I see it this way, the people behind the WTC attack and Pentagon attack \\"claim\\" to be Muslim, but they are not. A Moslem would not think to attack someone like that; they would not think to attack anyone at all. The Koran is pretty clear on what does and does not constitute acceptable actions. Starting a war simply because you are jealous of what someone else has is not a good way to influence people that your cause is just.Any rate, good show. The presentation was well done. They don't try to overwhelm you with the information, yet they try to tell you what you need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Correct Garbage...","review":"I was struck by how one-sided this oooh-sooo politically correct program was. It focuses almost exclusivly on the positive aspects of Islam without confronting the equally real--and very negative--side of this religion. There are two sides to Islam, just as their are two sides to most everything. However this video claims to \\"take you inside Islam\\". This implies OBJECTIVITY. Meaning a balancing of the negatives against the positives. I want my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toddler phone","review":"These phones are great. My toddler loves hers. We got fifty replacement batteries through amazon for $10, but have not needed them yet. My only complaint is that they cost so much online. We drove to Toys R Us and got three at 5.99 a piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry but informative, visuals worth the price of admission","review":"\\"The Atlas of Medieval Man\\" consists of text and a large number of photos, maps, and other visuals. While the text is well-rounded, covering each major area of civilization rather than just Europe, as is common, it is rather dryly written. Information is plentiful, but one can get bogged down; that's where the visuals come in. This book has a stunning array of artifact photos, architecture photos, manuscript reproductions, maps, etc. which outclass any other volume under $50. From the 11th century Hindu temple carvings to the stained glass of 14th century Europe, to the Aztec crystal skull of the 15th century, this book is a feast for the eyes as well as mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes older is better...","review":"Charlie is pretty traditional blues but they write some great music and I think any blues fan would love this CD. I compare him with William Clarke which is a compliment to Charlie. Keep it up Charlie...sometimes older is better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mean, Tight, & Funky","review":"I've listened to Charlie for over forty years; this is one of his best albums. Why? He wrote all the songs, he's backed by the funkiest band I've heard on any of his records, he doubles on slide--excellently--his writing has never been better, and there is a great diversity in the songs, something that is difficult to achieve on a blues recording.In \\"She May Be Your Woman\\", the boastful Charlie taunts a husband by telling him how he--and not the husband--has kept that gal happy. \\"When she comes in about three o'clock in the morning, you can only wonder where that woman's been (she's been with me, that's where she's been!)\\" The harp blowing is just as swaggering and lowdown as the lyrics. \\"River Hip Woman\\" is more of an uptempo number but contains fabulous harp and tight support from the band.\\"My Road Lies In Darkness\\" features Charlie on solo guitar, and he's GOOD!You could do far worse if you wanted to pick this up as your first Musselwhite album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge waste of money","review":"The Carol Burnett videos are vastly overpriced, especially compared to what you can buy for other shows. Huge disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensuality Massage Oil","review":"The product arrived on time. It is a bit stronger than the body spray I was intending on getting, but it works nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calming and seems authentic","review":"I read this book while commuting on the bus and it was like going into a peaceful bubble amidst the chaos of traffic and noise. It was very refreshing and the translated version has free-flowing verbage that recalls meditation. The best part of the book is the end when the author tells of his reintegration into \\"normal\\" society and his problems adjusting leading to eventual overcoming of these problems. This made the ideas in the book less unattainable by people who cannot seem to get enough vacation time from life to travel to Tibet and become enlightened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed !","review":"This book, a personal narrative, begins with promise but quickly falls short. The author's experiences with his beautiful female Guru are clearly sexual with liberal doses of spiritual concepts thrown in while they were engaging in the \\"divine play\\".I am not debating the authenticity of the central concepts in this book, they have been talked about in other books as well - but I did not see where sex ended and spirituality began. I found this book hollow!Let the spiritually excited nave reader who is now packing his bags for a trip to India be warned! India does not abound in youthful, beautiful women gurus who would drop their robes to teach you sacred sexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book on the Subject I've Read Yet!","review":"To refer to this mini-book as a PI School, referencing it as a course is ludicrous. There is almost no information on how to really become a PI. There is some information on the industry, and the writing style is good and straight forward, but just no real meat. If you're looking for a BRIEF overview then this little book is excellent. But if you want real USABLE information that can help you acquire at least a basic WORKING knowledge, forget it. I've read several books on this subject and most are inadequate, but some at least offer some usable real world information. This work is greatly lacking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"bullmoose1","review":"these two are part of the heart and sole of bluegrass, and the best duo ever, Now if there is ever any doubt, listen to their \\"when I stop dreaming\\" It almost sounds like one voice. And \\"nine pound hammer\\" ain't bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Essential Jim & Jesse","review":"If you like old-time country music as I do, this is a very good CD. I especially liked \\"Stormy Horizons\\".Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this book!","review":"A friend sent me a review of Cooking the Roman Way. The reviewer made it sound too good to be true, so I ordered a copy to find out. Even for a passionate but untrained foodie like me, I've got to say that this is a great piece of work -- it's funny and articulate -- a literate cookbook that reads like a cross between fine travel writing and memoir. I have also found a bunch of classic Roman recipes that anyone can do -- bruschetta, spaghetti with garlic and hot pepper, Carbonara, Amatriciana, crostini with anchovies (my girlfriend loved that one in particular). I have been to Rome a couple of times and everything in the book rang true -- the atmosphere, the cooking style, the sites, the sensuality. Now I'm recommending the book to everyone I know, both for their own use and as gifts. What a find. Kudos (or however you say it in Italian) to the the author and photographer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Italian food as I do, you must buy this book.","review":"The recipes are great. I especially loved the carbonara and the spicy Amatriciana tomato sauce. Finally I have a cookbook with my favorite recipes! I own many Italian cookbooks but I wasn't aware that some of the classics I love are from Rome. A friend gave this book to me as a gift. It's a beautiful book with lavish color photos. I like it so much I'm going to give it to everyone on my Christmas list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"Bravo to Downie and Harris for a mouth-watering book that is not only great for cooking (try the spaghetti alla gricia on a night you don't have time to cook), reading for pleasure, knowledge and travel advice, and giving as a gift (vegetarians would love it for the many meatless pasta and side dishes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Collection of Mainstays","review":"Everything I eat comes almost exclusively from this book. Downie does an excellent job in presenting an unbiased, uncompromising view.I would be very pleased to read a book on the raising, selection, and slaughtering of swine detailing the curing processes used in rural America for Italian-style deli meats.I think David Downie is just the man for this task."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny stories","review":"my friend David wrote this book, and he is a funny, witty guy. the story about how his italian mom tried serving cow stomach by calling it \\"trippa\\" is GREAT ! and i have repeated it to lots of folks. this book is good because it is not overwhelming for a non-cook like myself. i mean, there is a recipe for spaghetti with black pepper and cheese on it, how easy is that ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Gifted Artist","review":"Tamia is truly gifted artist. Her voice is incredible, and unlike any other. Unfortunately, she's not as appreciated or recognized for her talent, due to, I think, bad marketing and lack of airplay. \\"Loving You Still\\" is one of my favorite songs off of her debut, and the debut is in my car right now in fact! I can't stop listening to it. I beg of anyone who reads this: if you listen to the sound samples and agree with me about the incredible sound of Tamia's undeniable talent, buy the DEBUT album first! I think it's better than the sophomore album, \\" A Nu Day.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I have heard better songs by Tamia","review":"This is NOT one of the best songs on the album, but it was decently done"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strategic thinking for the New E.conomy","review":"Very thought provoking and insightful, this captivating book forces you to re-think the rules of corporate and competitive strategy. It is becoming more essential for organisations to differentiate their offerings, everything from long distance telephone calls to soft drinks are turning into a commodity. The authors present various methods that organisations can use to differentiate their offerings, the very simple but powerful service/merchandise matrix is a good way to start thinking about product, service and brand positioning. I would thoroughly recommend this, sometimes controversial yet challenging customer focused book, it helps you to look beyond the constraints of conventional wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clinical language and a real framework","review":"Unlike most strategy books, Creating Value does not simply fill the pages with what often appears to inconclusive discussion supported by case studies. This formula popular with what might be the 'Airport bookshop school of management is the antithesis of Creating Value. Mathur and Kenyon seek first to carlify terminology, and subsequently, establish a workable framework. Their views are quickly seductive and clear. The final impression is a well researched and and thoughtful book, that aims to address the real problems of strategy rather than simply debate them.
