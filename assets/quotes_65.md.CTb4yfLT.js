Biblical passages have been shortened, lengthened, and generally rewritten, without any citations to tell you what parts are Biblical, what has been deleted, and what has been added.

This rendering leads people to conclude that only believers will be saved. But this is clearly not the case in the overwhelming majority of Bible versions (including the venerable King James). To use the King James Version, \\"For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour OF ALL MEN, SPECIALLY OF THOSE THAT BELIEVE\\".1 Timothy 4:10 is the ultimate prooftext FOR universal reconciliation (also called universal salvation), and to try to alter this verse in this manner is not good.

The product itself seems sturdy - however if you use the feet things for the purpose of being footpads; they do not snap in place on the bottom side; which could be a pain if you have to move the tray - especially with full hands.

I was not able to grasp everything that the author had to say about blackface minstrelsy but what I did find was an interesting perspective. I don't necessarily agree with the whole phallic aspect and the need to \\"size up\\" to the African-American race, but I do want to agree with the fact that there was a fascination in the race and I think that is what Lott is trying to get across to the readers.

Scritti Politti is a very precious thing in this world.Wotz it like?

On first read it appears simplistic, but this is both its charm and power. Phenomenology is not complex - it is very simple. It is seeing (or hearing etc) what is there - before any interpretation. And this is perhaps the difficult part - engaging with things without intepreting them.This book must be re-read and then it can be mindblowing.

Gaia is not supposed to feel fear. It makes her different from the characters of every other YA book. Gaia as an insecure, scared teenager makes this book the absolute worst of the Fearless series. It reminds me of when Gaia was delusional in the SuperEdition: Gaia Abducted. She is that different.

You'll be extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIGHLY ANNOYING!","review":"Gaia just wasn't meant to feel fear! Why doesn't she see that? Throughout the whole of this book Gaia's a silly, timid and shy girl with no trace of the real her. She seems to have gone through a complete transformation by getting those unnecessary fear genes!! Even Jake's confused now about whether he likes Gaia like before or not! And Gaia can't beat the crap out of one single being on the streets in this book! Terror is definitely not for anyone who got hooked to the series for Gaia's toughness and fighting skills. In simple words, this book is not for any real Fearless fan at all. And if Gaia doesn't get back to being Fearless again somehow, the rest of the books in the series will be equally irritating. And sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for a non-expert!","review":"Well, I am not an academic, and certainly not a biblical studies scholar, but I really enjoyed reading this book.For anyone with more than a passing interest in the forms of language (narrative, story-telling, and so on) found in the Tanach, this is a remarkably accessable treatment, putting these long-studied texts in context with other forms from antiquity. In the later chapters, there was much that I could not fully appreciate with my amature background, but that didn't detract from the overall trajectory of the work, or my enjoyment of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie...Annoying Subtitles.","review":"None But The Brave is a fun & entertaining movie, and i'm so happy it was finally released to DVD. But what's the deal with the subtitles? If you choose to turn them off, you can't see what the Japanese are saying, and my Japanese is pretty rusty to say the least. If you turn the subtitles on however, you can see what the Japanese are saying, but then are forced to read what the Americans are saying as well. It's basically an 'all-or-nothing' deal, and it's somewhat distracting to the movie itself. I own the VHS version of this movie, and there's only subtitles when the Japanese are speaking, which is the way it should be on DVD too. I suppose I can keep switching the subtitles off/on between the American and Japanese scenes? But why should I have to?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry, I Don't Understand Japanese!","review":"I'm not sure if it was shown this way in the theater, but how could you listen to so much Japanese talk with no subtitles?

B states Cartier-Bension is NOT confrontational (and is the basis for their answer), where D states his relationship WAS confrontational! Huh?

Not only are some of the logic problems so poorly written that there is no correct answer, the solutions to these questions must blatantly ignore the rules of the problem or \\"solve\\" them incorrectly to arrive at any answer. (In one problem that asks you to select the answer that cannot exist, the solution finds that four of the answers are rule violations (and therefore not permissible within the context of the problem) and then picks the last one as the correct answer.

You won't go wrong here.If you're measuring, this bowl holds 5-quarts of liquid volume, which is about 4.3 quarts of dry volume. That's accurate.

I have a matched pair of these, and one about 3 or 4 times its size - they work great on chicken and burgers. I use them on steaks, but still finding the right groove there for timing.This cooks chicken about twice as fast it seems - keeps the juices in too - and carmelizes any marinade added to it. Basically adds flavor and reduces cooking time. Whats not to like?I keep this on the grill as the grill warms up, slide it over, add chicken - drop the press on top. I wouldn't recommend grilling without these...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bacon press","review":"I use my grill press with bacon and I love it.

We loved QB and it has worked well for us. Until 2006. This software has been one bug, glitch, or problem after another. Many of the customer/vendor search options are gone. But mostly there are so many bugs. Every time we sign in we are always told we have paychecks to send, EVERY TIME-even when we don't which is 90% of the time. Our friendly reminders (i.e. Don't forget your W-2s) never go away, even when we say it is done. We can not create an accountants copy from our computers anymore- now it is only from the server.

We re-threaded the needle (which is nearly impossible using the provided tool and given the fact that the needle doesn't come up high enough to have a straight shot through), and tried to re-thread the bobbin, but the bobbin thread would not go where it was supposed to (the directions seem vaguely clear, if not contradictory, but following them does not produce the results they promise).

Don't be fooled by the photo of the large dog laying comfortably on its bed - the new ones are completely different to the one shown (which is more like the beds I had before).The cover is made of really cheap, thin, man-made material; there is a zip but no inner cover so it can't be washed (when it is unzipped, you just get a look at the cheap stuffing).I phoned the company and went through the return authorization process only to find that it would cost me nearly as much to return the beds as it did to buy them.I have decided to make outer covers from decent material and then donate the beds to an animal rescue group as cat beds (I don't think they would last very long with a dog). I will be looking elsewhere for dog beds from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as depicted","review":"This is not a large bed.

I assumed for the price, it wouldn't last for a very long time, but since my puppy is still growing, I was only really hoping for a few months use before getting her a \\"big girl bed\\". This one lasted all of 2 hours. For the first 1.5 hours, my 5 month old boxer mix loved it, slept on it right away. Then I left her for about 30 minutes and returned to find she had the zipper chewed off and stuffing ripped out and the bed completely ruined. If your dog is NOT a chewer, this may work for you because she did find it very comfy, but for dogs that are chewers, don't waste your money. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, a must read for everyone","review":"Once in a while you come across a movie, a place, or a book that takes you in and makes you part of it.

It could've been a terrific movie, but the writers/producers/director decided to make it center around gore. They forgot that it should've had great content instead of having things that make a person sick watching the movie. The acting could've been better.

The plot has something to do with teenagers falling under the evil spell of He Who Walks Behind The Rows. Along with the dreadful symbols of cornstalks and gleaming scythes is a repellant scene of a churchgoer getting the voodoo doll treatment by some sly young highschooler undoubtedly belonging to the cult of He Who Snoozes Behind The Rows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This was a pretty good Horror movie , but it doesn't really link to COTC part 2.

The acting was decent, the killing were decent (except for when the woman gets her face burned and the kid looks at her laughing mercifully, that was corny). Charlize Theron appears for like 2 minutes (gets killed somehow similar to Evil Dead in that she gets tangled with vines and the monster sticks his branch down her....you know where). The movie is lame, has some moments of goodness but still...after this sequel the rest of the series really is a wash and total waste of time, it started here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of The Series!","review":"This children of the corn is deffinatally the best of the series. it has great acting, a great plot and all of the rest.I really enjoyed watching this movie cause it actually makes sense.Most of the movie makes sense anyways. the only two parts that didnt make sense were the seen were Joshua and malcolm were driving in the car. They drove from Chicago, illinois to ???,Nebraska spent time there and drove back all in the same night??? Thats a long drive! it would take atleast 2 to 4 days to do all of that! come on that doesnt make any sense and the other part that did'nt make any sense was at the end where that big monster comes up from beneath the ground.now come on guys,does that have anything to do with \\"Children of The Corn\\"? now, on the other hand if it was called monsters of the corn, then it would make complete sense! But overall,this was a really enjoyable movie, and it is deffinatally worth the time, so you should tottaly check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful junk","review":"I can't believe anyone would think about putting the third Children of the Corn movie on the same level as the original and part 2. Come on, the original was the best, and the second one was really good as well. Part 3 contains cheap, ugly-looking production that doesn't have any scare factor whatsoever. The corn field is inside the city, for crying out loud. How scary can that be?At least the fourth movie was a bit of an improvement. I would strongly recommend looking into the first two Children of the Corn movies before spending money on this low budget film. That's just my opinion though, and usually I'm wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY bad.","review":"This movie is horrid.

Its an 80's movie people! It was bound to look poor, but this movie is another matter. The gore scenes were alright, but once again the people who made the series screwed up. They are so into killing in all of these sequals that they never acually have the chance to make it better. Another King classic shutting down, thats what. But lets go back to the movie. What the hell happened at the end? And that POTATO was He Who Walks Behind The Rows? Damn it to hell! The one chance of a good COTC movie and all of us beg for one, RIGHT? But no.

The series will never recover","review":"Nearly RIGHT after I saw Children of the Corn II on Cinemax, I saw a commercial for Part III. Before I saw part II, this movie was out. I said \\"Who makes these movies! \\" They both looked really stupid. But I saw Part II on Cinemax and really liked it. So, I thought nothing about renting Part III. I saw it and thought it was going to be good based on the fact alone that the kid from Demonic Toys was in it. But I hated it. The whole thing was stupid and then the ending. I can't say enough bad things about that ending. I rented it again after I got sorround sound and I like it better now. But the kid is a poor actor and the ending ruins the WHOLE movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPARE ME THIS CRAPPY GARBEAGE!","review":"I repeat, the original had no room for a sequel.

It wasn't. This was the last COTC to be released in theaters. It was also, in my opinion, the last good one, until maybe 6. After this, IV just made no sense at all, and Ezeekial totally annoyed me in V. Eli was a good leader, in the grand tradition of Isaac and Micah(my absolute fave) before him. I liked the whole \\"urban harvest\\" thing, too. I was loving this movie until the end, when they broke out the *stupidest* thing ever. When Eli turns into that worm, this movie's stock rating just plummetted for me. Without a big budget for effects it looked like the goofiest, cheesiest thing ever(think Evil Dead but serious about it). See it if you liked the first 2, and have a great laugh at the cheesy death scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for teachers","review":"Okay - so you got your duct tape. Now what? If you're one of the many that don't understand chemical or biological terrorism, chances are that you're over-reacting over the threat.

He has developed this guide to explain the terms that police, firefighters, and the military might use in a response situation, the threats that you might face, and simple measures to be prepared. This book can be read by nearly everyone without \\"dumbing down\\" the serious nature of the threat, and, unlike other books for the public on this issue, Strother does not merely repeat what is in military manuals.

I miss them sampling 'Reservoir Dogs'. I miss the rebelliousness and the overall \\"F*** you!\\" attitude. I miss the days when it was hard to understand the lyrics. If you enjoy punk, and I mean REAL punk (not Good Charlotte), then you should buy this album. It's just awesome overall. Fast, crazy, chaotic. What punk should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Stuff","review":"Wow, Davey really grows on you. When I first listened to this, it sounded like alvin and the Chipmunks go hardcore, but I've gotten used to it. This disc is also easily the peak of bassit Geoff's songwriting career, which couple perfectly with Davey's insightful lyrics. For Tarintino fans, the cover is a take-off of the Reservoir Dogs soundtrack album cover, and most of the music could have fit seamlessly into the movie. A perfect buy for those who are first-time AFI listeners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun in Small Doses","review":"AFI's debut album is a great deal different from their last few CDs. There is no traces of Goth or pop punk here, just straight up old school punk with some truly hilarious lyrics. The problem with this album is it's all the same, there's almost no variation, so it's good when you listen to just a few tracks (all of which are good) but put back to back it's impossible to get through the entire CD without a headache. The two standout tracks for me are \\"High School Football Hero\\" and the Classic \\"I Want a Mohawk but My Mom Won't Let Me Get One\\".The music reminds me alot of MxPx's debut CD \\"Pokinatcha\\", but the lyrics are alot more similar to the Offspring. Definitely a good CD if you wanna see where the band started and you're already a fan, but if you're new to AFI and want to backtrack from Sing the Sorrow or Decemberunderground I recomend either Black Sails in the Sunset or the All Hallows EP instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album!","review":"This is not an album a recent addition to the AFI fan base will apreciate. In other words, pre Psudo Goth Emo Davey. Sing the Sorrow providing an exelent example of what selling out will do for you. This album is awesome, a solid production of pounding 2 and a half minute East Bay Punk anthems. And none of the whiny slowed down gothic BS that some of us have come to except as AFI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"Yeah, I'm a die-hard AFI fan(of everything BEFORE Sing the Sorrow, mind), and this album is great, but there's a bit wrong with it. For one, it all sounds the same. I could hardly tell when it changed songs unless I was paying attention strictly to the music. Another, the lyrics were a bit juvenile. I'm sorry, but I hope Davey was trying to be humorous with this album's lyrics. If not, I'm glad he matured. If you want a REALLY good AFI album, get The Art of Drowning. It's probably one of their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best afi cd","review":"this is afi's best cd. when tehy used to be a real hardcore band. i like very song on this cd. some realy good songs are rizzo in the box,your name here, i wanna mohawk, cereal wars but i think all teh songs are good but those are my favorites. this cd is definently worth buying if your a fan of hardcore punk or punk or afi.buy this cd now."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't top the original","review":"This obviously the original \\"Answer That...\\" and it is better than the re-release that nitro put out in '97. This album lacks \\"Open Your Eyes\\" but it has the most amazing cover i've ever heard in my life, \\"Man In A Suitcase\\" originally sting/the police. It's a hidden track and takes 20 minutes to get to but it's well worth the wait. This is one of AFI's best albums if not THE BEST they put out next to \\"VERY PROUD OF YA\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop hating on Davey","review":"Davey \\"evolved\\" get over it. His newer emo stuff is different, it would have been hard for AFI to keep pounding out skater punk athems on every CD. I think this CD shows just how amazing they were at old school punk music, and their newer stuff shows they can still put out an amazing CD today with their new sound. Either way you look at it you can't deny that AFI is one of the most original and best bands of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled","review":"Do not be fooled by the purists out there who tell you need to go and get this record. The only word to describe this awful, painful debut is MISTAKE!!! This is good only that it shows an Offspring cover band that would eventully grow up and become a truly great band. By pass this, \\"Very Proud of Ya\\" and \\"Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes\\" and go to when Jade joined the band. Thats when it gets good. AVOID!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AFI at it's best","review":"This is by far the best AFI CD to date. But it is not all sell-out and MTV-pop like Sing the Sorrow, (still good CD),if you liked that sort of thing. It has all amazing songs and some genuine punk rock. For all AFI fans, this album is for you, I love it, you will love it too. For all of the other AFI lovers that just joined the crowd because Hot Topic made them so very popular overnight, and you want to be a REAL fan, check this one out. It will not dissapoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT OLD INGER","review":"Very popular singer in 1960 and still my favorite. All the melodies are singing in a romantic style unique of his voice. This album is very lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it did cure my insomnia","review":"The heroine is kind, practical, and pretty boring, really. Just about any other character that cares to walk onto the page outshines the hero. To tell the truth the romance between Lillis's jilted intended and Alexander's jilted intended was far more interesting. Too bad it only gets about 12 pages. I wonder why the author named the brothers Willem and Alex Baldwin. At least she didn't name the rest of the family Daniel and Stephen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! Hard to put down.","review":"Lillis of Wellewyn was the most beautiful woman Alexander had ever seen. A bride out of legend. Yet never could he claim her as his own, for he had vowed to let her to when the last of his people were free from her father's tyranny.Alexander Baldwin was known as an honorable knight, yet to Lillis he was nothing more than a bully who had married her for her dowered lands.

No showing off, just excellent playing and beautiful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great background of an important company -- and a good read!","review":"Meissner presents an interesting and balanced history of SAP. While this book will teach you little about the R/3 software, it will provide great insight into the people and culture that created and support R/3.The history of the 5 co-founders and the interplay of the 5 throughout the initial stages of the company and the development of R/2 and R/3 are fascinating.Meissner provides insight into the ever-changing relationships of SAP with the press and the industry analysts. He also explains the role of major, influential customers in the ongoing development of SAP's products.My only disappointment with the book was the relatively little information about SAP developments since late 1996, early 1997 when the book was originally written.Otherwise, a smart investment for anyone involved with SAP R/3, contemplating an SAP implementation, and for anyone who simply likes a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hundred Years From Now","review":"More great music from the King.

It definitely has some \\"bling\\" to it. The heart shape is a little hard to see, but it can be told from holding it at the right angle. It does have a distinct aquamarine look to it though. The chain is quite thin and looks as though it would break easily if someone was not careful. The packaging was well put together. Overall my sister was very excited to receive it and has worn it plenty of times since she got it. Definitely would buy from the manufacturer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set -will be nicer if","review":"This set will be nicer if it is sold without the mugs or mugs with a better shape and size. The dinner plates and salad plates are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty and practical","review":"The cups are actually big enough to use!I have no idea why, but I decided I wanted a bit of English Garden and these fit the bill. These are just frilly enough to satisfy the girl in me and just simple enough to not overwhelm the practical in me. The scalloped edges were a surprise but they do just fine in my dishwasher. I use the desert plates for most of my meals because they are the perfect size for smaller meals. I'm accustomed to everything coming in place settings of 4 or 8 so having a place setting for 6 is a big plus.I love that I can mix these with my white dishes if I need more place settings. They are heavy enough I feel secure handling them.If you have a yearning for something a little pretty but are afraid a man would be put out be these, don't be. They look delicate but they are not. This is a sturdy set of dishes and can be used day in and day out. They aren't so frilly a man would be embarrassed to be seen using them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set","review":"The set it nice and we use it all the time.

I read The Girl Who Walked Home Alone today and it is excellent, but it is more about her career and films than a real picture of the woman. Someone should make a film about this story. How she ended up staying with this couple is amazing. You have dialog between two women not between a super star and a housewife. Since Ms. Davis was not all that fond of women, preferring men, I guess she mellowed in old age and allowed a younger woman to get to know her. Even briefly. It is an entertaining insight into the daily life of someone we all loved and miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't believe the ratings","review":"I bought this book based on other reader's reviews and couldn't believe such a hackneyed plot and poor writing would merit this kind of praise. One gets the sense that author Elliot wished he were his own creation in that virtually every female on the planet is instantly attracted to \\"Touch\\" Benson (of course he's both attractive AND intelligent...).The book reads like a bad movie, and the ending is not especially surprising given the fact that such twists have been better explored by writers like Margaret Millar and Stanley Ellin - far superior writers with a real gift for the language. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider yourself warned!","review":"If you want to read a book in which the hero-detective is so stupid he not only TOUCHES a wet, red stain on a carpet, but then goes on to actually TASTE it to determine if it's blood or who knows what, then go right ahead. But do yourself a favor and read Shane Stevens's \\"By Reason of Insanity,\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit too much of everything, but a promising author","review":"I was not crazy about this book.

The characters are amazingly complex, and the 'hero' is a real guy, with flaws, who can't help falling in love with smart, beautiful women that seem to hide a dark past. I really liked Touch Benson, the LA cop. Hope Elliot writes more about him.I read the review that said something about 'clunky prose'. Didn't understand that--this is a beautifully written book, especially for the genre. This guy can really write--it's pretty neat the way he gets into his character's heads.Also I live in Los Angeles and I could practically taste the streets on every page. I'm looking forward to more work by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and intelligent, although a bit repetitive...","review":"Kierkaagard's Attack Upon \\"Christendom\\" was written, not as an attack upon Christianity as a whole, as many believe, but as an attack upon the Lutheran state religion present during his lifetime. He offers a great deal of evidence showing how the priests in his native Denmark are not, as they believe, \\"Witnesses to the Truth\\", but are in fact liars who mislead the masses and merchants who have their careers (which is, in K.'s view, the wrong way to look at it) only to make money and have a royally subsidized position.All of this does, however, become somewhat prolix, as this book is actually just a series of articles and pamphlets that he wrote in a 2-year span, which were then combined into the present work. Still, though, this book is an enjoyable read, due to the satirical style of K.'s writing and the, however arguable, relevance of the subject. I recommend reading \\"Training in Christianity\\", though, as an introduction to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympia...All versions are created equal","review":"Olympia is a movie that resides in the Public Domain. Every version I have ever found is of the same quality and this version is no different. The DVD offers no frills but when you buy this movie, it is not for the frills, it is for the movie.It was the 1936 Berlin Games that introduced the opening ceremony, the torch relay, the three-tiered presentation ceremony, and the overall sense of lavish, religious spectacle. In a way these are the first modern games. Does it worry you that most of the stuff we most fondly associate with the Olympics originated with the Nazis? It doesn't worry me: the Nazis' moral sense may have been deplorable, but their aesthetic sense was not nearly so bad as people like to pretend.The greatest thing about this movie is that even though the subject matter is repugnant, the film is done in great taste and Leni Riefenstahl is a genious."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest ever!!","review":"I've been a huge Tim McGraw fan since he started, but I have to admit that this could be the best song that he has ever recorded.

Trust me it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Remember Me....simply awesome","review":"simply put, this song is awesome. so powerful, and moving, i fell in love with the song the first time i heard it. if you havent heard this song, get the single, listen to the radio for it, call in and request it, its simply that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"deserved song of the year at cma awards","review":"Composer Rodney Crowell should have received some recognition at the CMA awards on Sept 22 for writing this song.

You sang this one well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most beautiful songs ever recorded!!!","review":"I was not a fan of Tim McGraw until I heard this amazing song. I'm not even a fan of country music, but this song is special. I first heard this song at work and was amazed by its beautiful melody. I sing along this song every time I hear it at work.

Across The Field, in case you didn't know, is the school song of The Ohio State University, and this is a brilliant performance of it.The reason for my 4-star rating is that Across The Field is the only song on the disc. Although it is a great price, I'd rather have a full disc of the band featuring some of the staples of OSU games, such as (in addition to Across The Field) Carmen Ohio, The Hey Song, and Hang On Sloopy.All in all, a good purchase for an Ohio State fan or somebody who is into marching bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic perhaps but for good reason","review":"This video is espcially well recieved by me due to it containing \\"A Blast from the Past and Present\\" a video Thrasher had put together from the 80s. It captures well the times of skateboarding in that era but in-of-itself is a nice chunk of content.I would not recommend this to someone who is used to or dependent on the video styling or editing of the current videos.But, if you appreciate skateboarding in general, then this would be a good addition to your collection or to at least view once and add to that swirl of skate in your brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"It feels like a connect the dots with some missing dots","review":"Four chapters in and I am ready to ditch the book. It lacks quality conceptual explanation paired with questionable content organization. Learning how to construct a circuit diagram is interesting but the information does not touchdown to earth nearly enough to make it practical for novice conceptual understanding. Throughout the book are streams of rambling facts instead of concise and articulate summarizing of pertinent points. I am constantly pulling from other sources to gain understanding. Once I do have working understanding of the chapters, I am left scratching my head as to the lack-luster or sometimes backwards approach from the book. The material is obviously introductory and perfectly suitable for beginners but, it lacks a sensitivity to the level of exposure students reading it may have. It kind of feels like a connect the dots with some missing dots."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT RADIO BUT...","review":"Overall a very nice radio w/good sound and looks but it didn't do what I wanted: I wanted to use it w/a timer so it would go on/off automatically.

Both in Seattle, both involve a single mother being given clues to multiple murders that dont happen yet, both encouter break ins where the killers leave hints to the crimes in the house, both of the main characters have a healthy craving for wine and they confide in a close male friend or relative of some kind. Among many more similarities, I have decided that this will be the last book that I get from O'Brien. The only redundant detail that I appreciate in his books are the location, being from Seattle.

I found them years ago at Sam's and they quit selling them, then I sound them at Big Lots, they quit selling them, then found them at Target. Very expensive if you buy them individually.

I don't know why Quaker doesn't have this flavor in packets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great breakfast product that is hard to find.","review":"Quaker Instant oatmeal is hard to find in many stores out west. Typically, the single packaged cups are available and who wants to purchase one at a time? By buying them in bulk quantities, you can save a few shopping trips and the gasoline by having them shipped direct to your home. I bought a 24 pack for about a $1.00 a cup!

Moore is able to interweave Rapunzel, Rumpeltstiltskin, The Frog Prince, and a few other fairy tales into an entertaining laugh-out-loud narrative that's sure to have you smiling and wishing Moore would hurry up and get his third novel out already.I finished this book in less than a day (even hiding in my office so I could finish the last 20 pages without being disturbed), and heartily recommend that anyone in the mood for a Princess Bride type fix get a copy immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible anti-semitic trash","review":"This book began wonderfully enough. It's fun and silly and parodies the fairy tale genre that I love. But then all of sudden it took a terrible turn. The underlying premise of the book is for the kingdom to expel the Jews to make money.There is nothing funny about this, and it seemed to have no place in such a light-hearted fantasy. It just made me sad, and I'm not even Jewish. I think the author was seriously misguided in his judgment to use this as a subplot. I wouldn't read another book by this author if you paid me to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Starts out whimsical and ends up self conscious and dull. Found myself skimming at the end to get through it. The subplot about expelling the Jews is out of place and made me uncomfortable. Very disappointed after reading the five star reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Modern Fairy Tale","review":"This book contains too much sex for my younger teens. Some might be overlooked by the naive but as the parent pre-screening for my kids I was totally disappointed in this aspect of the book. As an adult I found it delightful and engaging. Perhaps another Princess Bride if Moore had kept it clean. I just don't see how they could make it into a Clean Flick with sex saving the day. Clever and beautiful, the delight of the village, Caroline is headed for big things. Having a not so perfect royal family that is so totally dysfunctional is something Prince Hal has learned to deal with and then there's the whole Rapunzel and Rumpelstiltskin issues. Lots of twists on the standard fairy tale remade into a modern read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"I had an ATI card in my old computer that included a TV tuner.

The ATI website Vista driver did not work for me. Customer support was snotty. The first hung up on me, and the second cut me off, telling me to return the item and buy a more expensive product they sell. Also, there is no FM with Vista.See other reviews.

I love that card but since my new motherboard is PCI-E I can't use it anymore. The 550 was a total disappointment.The auto-install on the CD only completely installs the Remote Wonder software, an accessory that's not even in the box. You have to get the \\"working\\" drivers off ATI's site and if you want to use Catalyst Media Center, you need to dig through the install CD and run it manually (...CMC/CMC/install.exe). The real annoyance is that after doing all that, CMC can't even connect to the card when you choose to watch TV. It just keeps looking for it and eventually crashes. I've tried using three other programs that work with WDM cards but none of them will connect to the card using cable or composite/s-video.After two days of this nonsense I've decided to return it and research the other capture cards.

I experience this when trying to load my 3rd Tiger Challenge and during season mode. Also, when playing St. Andrew's, when Hole #2 is trying to load, I get a black screen and am not even able to access my dashboard or shutdown the console via the controller.

Instead of making a better golf game, they just made it more difficult. I'd learn to play real golf if I wanted to try this hard.They HAD a chance to shock and put Mickelson in as a playable golfer, besides a name on the leaderboard.They might NOT have made your golfer's improvement worse than VCR instructions.They COULD have realized a smaller hole legend is just annoying.They MAY have recognized that Tiger Woods is a golf game made to be fun, not homework.If you have '06, take a pass and pray for next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"In order to give you the \\"experience\\" of becoming a better golfer, this game severely handicaps you when you start out.

The game itself playcs very well and it feels very much like a sim, but the learning curve feels a bit steep if you're new to the genre. The graphics are were we could see the most uprade potenital. The grass looks too much like a flat texture with no detail and too little volume and the trees can go from wonderful to terrible on the same course. Repeated tree models placed side by side by side really make the product itself feel cheap. I'm still happy to have it- but not terribly impressed yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game; Great Response","review":"EA has created a great response to last years utter failure of a 360 game with the same name. They have listened to the letters I'm sure they recieved along with the poor reviews it was given by IGN and Gamespot. The introduction of the PGA Tour Game Mode along with the Driving Range have been amazing. The amount of work you have to do with your golfer to make progress is immense. The new aiming zone is a far better improvement over the arrows of the past and putting still seems to pose a tremendous challenge. Overall, this years chapter in the Tiger Woods Series is a great shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game","review":"One of the best games I've ever played. Graphics are superb with its moving galleries and lifelike player models. Love the game face option. Only criticism is the fact there aren't more golf courses. Still the many gameplay options more than make up for that; from skills competitions to playing the actual tour schedule to the many ways you can improve your golfer.

Well, he could as long as he got rid of the ridiculous chorus. \\"It's all 'bout the money. It's all 'bout the dum dum diddy dum dum\\". What is that? It drives me nuts! The verses are ok, and so are Meja's vocals, but this song is ridiculous.

I eagerly purchased it as a great many recordings from the 30's - 50's of Coates conducting his own music have been released on CD as of late. This recording, however, is of Coates' orchestral music arranged for band and actually performed by The Royal Yeomanry Band. The performances and the recording are certainly nowhere near as distinguished as the recent Naxos release of Coates' music for band (part one.) Nowhere is recording info divulged; it sounds ADD if not AAD.

Voice-wise? Eh. Nothing special. Lyrics? Hah! Music? umm... bland? it's all the same! Maybe I'm missing something?If you like one of Dave's songs, then by all means, buy this!

Everyone i have ever known to like this music spends most of their time drinking Molson canadian and talking about their new Ski-doo they just dropped 6 g's on. Thank you Dave Matthews for bringing the world of idiots together. as for the music? Dave Matthews is one of the worst singers i have ever heard. The music is simple and cheap.

While this CD does have a few slow points like \\"Cry Freedom\\" which wasn't like I expected, it has several wonderful songs such as \\"Tripping Billies\\" a personal DMB favorite, \\"Crash into Me\\" \\"Drive in, Drive Out\\", \\"Too Much\\" amongst others. It seems that on this CD they found the balance of lyrics and music. On \\"Before...\\" the music was good and for the most part so were the lyrics but on \\"Under the Table...\\" it was a mixed bag at some points. They've taken basically the high point on this second outing and it shows they've learned a lot since their debut on \\"Remember Two Things\\"While this isn't anything compared to a live concert performance, it's still highly reccomend to any DMB fan. And a non DMB fan should try this too, there's a good chance they'll start liking the band after listening to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD ever","review":"Dave Matthews Band shows their greatness more on this CD than on any other. Such upbeat songs like \\"Too Much\\", \\"So Much to Say\\", and \\"Tripping Billies\\" give the album great intensity. But don't forget songs like \\"Two Step\\", \\"Say Goodbye\\",(I prefer the acoustic version on Live at Luther College) and \\"Crash Into Me\\". Dave Matthews writes, plays, and sings the best songs. But Boyd Tinsley, Carter Beauford, Steffan Leassaurd, and Leroi Moore bring the band it's greatest sound. The most talented and original band ever. Buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate Dave.","review":"Who's with me? I don't care if you are not, Dave is horrible. Too much makes me want to cry, it is sooooo bad. I didn't mind #41 and Two Step, but now they just add to the agony. Dave is regretably a \\"college sound\\" so you have to endure his gnarled, head-spliting, gruesomely over-accentuated voice. Someone needs to put him to sleep, the poor thing. I'm glad not many people liked \\"Everyday\\", even hardcore Dave fans... hopefully he will keep this trash up and I will only find his music in the bargan bins, his name under the \\"where are they now?\\" files...."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?","review":"There was a time when songwriting giants walked the earth. I can count on one hand how many have inherited the true craft. This guy is not one of them, contrary to the belief held by his musically-challenged following.

I dont like the number of instruments incorporated into Dave's music lately but it's still pretty pure jam music.

It's the best pop-jazz I've heard for a long time. I first heard the DMB's \\"Jimi Thing\\" in a compilation and it jumped out as fresh and interesting the first time I heard it. Being upper-mid-40's myself and a former member in the 70's of the Mahavishnu Orchestra, I was surprised that the DMB's main following appears to be in their 20's.

I HATE \\"Crash Into Me\\" with a fiery passion, but I decided to give the rest of this CD a chance. Boy am I sorry! It has scarred me for life. The nice guitar licks are the only thing that kept me from rating this one star. Dave Matthews's lyrics and singing are an abomination on the music industry. My six cats were in the room while I was listening to this, and they all started crying at the door to be let out! He's a good guitarist, but someone ought to go up to him and say \\"STRUM IT AND SHUT IT!\\" and hand him a copy of Barenaked Ladies' Stunt CD, which is what REAL music sounds like.

DONT!! now, REAL music is bands like Everclear, Nirvana, Green Day, Weezer, The Living End, Collective Soul....... and on and on.....pretty much every band except DMB. except for rap. Rappers like Jay-Z and Snoop dog, and Sisquo should all be sentanced to death. they make me want to vomit all over my dog.

The only thing that could make some of these songs worse actually occured - HORNS!

The saxophone in Lie in Our Graves is wonderful (LeRoi Moore is extremely cool), and I love the drums in Tripping Billies. Lyrics in Crash Into Me and Cry Freedom are beautiful and deep.

This album could have been the next Dark Side of the Moon...it's really a crime.BTCS saved them for me.

Matthews has such an incredible voice and is one of the best guitar players out there. If you are someone who only knows DMB from, What Would You Say, Ants Marching, and Crash Into Me, buy this CD. You will respect this band 100% more. The best part of this CD is #41 and Say Goodbye which is basically two songs put into one. Good job Dave!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Start of their climbing career","review":"\\"Crash\\" is and will always be my all-time favorite chill album. I always sit and put this one on when its time to study for an exam or even read. Just listen to the segue from \\"#41\\" to \\"Say Goodbye,\\" that is one of the most beautiful moments in music. And the jam in the middle of \\"Lie in Our Graves\\" is terrific. Then there is the song that will always be mentioned in the same breath as Dave Matthews Band, \\"Crash into Me\\" one of the best songs in the last decade of music. For fans looking to get into the Dave Matthews Band I would recommend this as the first album you purchase regarding Dave Matthews Band, then probably Under the Table and Dreaming, either way you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"crash into the best dmb cd since uttad","review":"I don't think there could ever be a \\"bad\\" DMB song.

She complained that it was very confusing and difficult to follow. I began reading the book and absolutley agree! The author weaves and rambles through several different paths before arriving at her point. Along the way there are several side bars, barely related facts, and discussions centered on topics which only minimally correpsond to the material, all which confuse and complicate matters.

I have enjoyed reading this book. I love how she shares what the different cultures beliefs were regarding different areas of science, and of course with time some of their ideas were proven wrong. I really learned through this book to appreciate Science for what it is . . . . a way of thinking, questioning, and testing. Its trying to understand ideas and concepts bigger than oneself. I've enjoyed the sidenotes- yes it does mean you have to turn the pages back on occasion to read it all but it is great. It's kind of like reading a magazine in that respect, with more than one story on a page. You read one and go back to the other.

I thought the female singer was Harriet Wheeler from The Sundays, alas it wasn't. There isn't a solid track on this cd. The whole thing is weak. I don't know for certain, but I'm guessing this is a band that was shepherded along by a A&R neophyte trying to cut his or her teeth \\"discovering\\" this \\"unique\\" outfit. This album reeks of preciousness, one that has no inspiration. See, in my estimation when a band puts out a record they need to be able to look each other in the eye and feel chills at what they've assembled. With this album, I envision everyone involved pretending (or just not knowing any better) that they'd created something \\"transcendent\\" or \\"beautiful\\". I would hate to have sat behind the mixing boards listening to this pap over and over and over again.

First of all, in some parts it has kind of a cool (non-stale) 80's retro thing going on. Second, possibly partly because of the 80's tint on some of the material, it WILL make you reminisce. Third, It does the male-female voice interchange thing well... very pleasing and well placed female vocals (reminds me of Kim Deal). Third, there's some very clever songwriting (e.g. Your Ex-Lover is Dead)...Can't speak for you...but, these days good songwriting goes a very long way in my book.There are a couple of throw aways...but overall a strong album that I'm glad I purchased...If nothing else, you will have some KILLER songs for mixes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Album So Far","review":"\\"Set Yourself On Fire\\" is their best album so far. Plus it's one of the top albums of 2005 - that says a lot right there. They are also part of the Broken Social Scene group, along with Feist, Jason Collett, etc. The album has a good mix of slow and fast tracks (favourite ones including \\"Sleep Tonight\\", \\"The Big Fight\\" and \\"Celebration Guns\\"). Also great to crank up on a cold night and sing along to. Something that is unique is that there are both female and male vocals which adds that special oomf to the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic from Montreal","review":"Let me put it plainly: 'Ageless Beauty' is the best song I have heard all year. Sydney radio station FBI made this CD album of the week in early July and I used to listen to tracks from it before going to work in the morning. 'Ageless beauty' *made* me buy this album.Overall the album is a bunch of solid and eccentric tunes: almost every one has a kind of evocative warmth, sonorously appealing to lost innocence or lost eras. These guys remind me of Cocteau Twins crossed with something like the White Stripes.Bad points? There's some pointless foul-mouthedness on two of the tracks; the band's choice of name seems bland (unless there's a good anecdote behind it); and nothing quite matches the impact of 'Ageless Beauty'. However, give them a listen: if these guys can refine their style to produce more tracks like that, they're well on their way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great second album from STARS....","review":"There are so many bands that release a good first album and disappoint their fans on the second shot. Set Yourself on Fire is NOT one of these second albums. It met and surpassed my expectations. Heart was good; Set Yourself on Fire is great. The maturity of lyrics and quality production illustrates that STARS has matured as a band and deserve to be taken more seriously. Each song on this album has its own sound, mood, and story. Not only would I recommend Set Yourself on Fire to my music snob friends, but many of them will be getting it in their Christmas stockings this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bodysuit","review":"The bodysuit is quite comfortable. As others have noted, it is a more relaxed garment but exactly what I was looking for. I have ordered two more....one without underwire and one with. Can't wait to get them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quantity of repertoire is appreciated.","review":"This book is quite good. The amount of repertoire is great. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I was hoping it would have more children's songs that were suited for today's 21st Century youth. Many of the songs are appropriate, however, I believe there could have been some replacement songs, rather than such a huge supply of classical pieces (not that there's anything wrong with supplying a few classical pieces). All in all, I was glad that it had multiple levels of progress inside the book. If I had any suggestions to the authors of this book w/ all of its arrangements, I would have used more songs in C Major (to gear the beginning student for the absolute beginning pieces).Don't get me wrong, I WOULD recommend this book for students / teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"work station","review":"It was a little tough to build but it was very functional for what I needed it for.the drawers are solid and its nice to be able to lock it up when neededoverall, a great workbench"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as its rating","review":"Garbage. Directions look as if they are for a previous model. Poor powdercoating is peeling off. Two different sizes of locking nuts - metric and sae. Not that surdy. Decent wheels and drawers. I would not recommend this product to anyone. When are we going to wise up and start making decent products in America again! Many screws are bad and metal frames are bent on tips.

Price was least expensive one I found on the internet and it was a genuine AC/Delco part not an aftermarket replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, hello there!","review":"Obviously, this is a collection of country songs recorded by Elvis Presley. Elvis had a great affinity for country music, having grown up in Memphis. These 24 songs are fine examples of Elvis' love for country music. The main attractions here, from a serious Elvis fan's standpoint, are the previously unreleased alternate takes of five songs. This album also marked the first appearance on CD of the 1980 remix of \\"Guitar Man\\". The story behind the remix is: producer Felton Jarvis erased the backing track to the song, and gave it a new backing track to make it sound like an '80s country song, which ironically makes it sound more dated than the original version. Anyway, this is a solid collection of songs that Elvis fans will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"SONGS HE GREW UP ON","review":"ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE FIRST FEW SONGS ARE A BIT HOKIE FOR THIS GIRL, ELVIS'S RENDITIONS OF 'GENTLE ON MY MIND', 'PLEASE RELEASE ME',AND 'ALWAYS ON MY MIND' ARE ENOUGH TO BRING A TEAR TO YOUR EYE. HE SINGS TO YOUR COUNTRY SOUL."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collection of fine performances.","review":"This collection features some of the more country-oriented songs that Elvis recorded in his 20+ recording career. From \\"I Forgot to Remember to Forget\\" in 1954 to \\"He'll Have to Go\\" in 1976, Elvis puts a lot into these performances.Highlights on this collection include \\"Kentucky Rain\\", \\"Make the World Go Away\\", and \\"Always On My Mind\\".For the collectors, there are outtakes of \\"Your Cheatin' Heart\\", \\"Just Call Me Lonesome\\", \\"There Goes My Everything\\", \\"Green Green Grass of Home\\", \\"Fairytale\\", and \\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\\". Also included is the 1981 remix of \\"Guitar Man\\".Nice collection, considering some of the lesser compilations that RCA has put out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a good 'ol country boy at heart","review":"Before it was rock'n'roll, it was country. This is the first-ever documentation of Elvis' interpretation of the Southern musical backdrop he grew up in. In his first public appearance in 1945 at the age of ten, he sang Red Foley's sentimental 'Old Shep'; at his last recording in Graceland in October '76 the final number was 'He'll Have To Go'. Both songs are included here.Other tracks on the album feature compositions by Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and include some of \\"the greats\\"--'Your Cheatin' Heart','From A Jack To A King', 'Funny How Time Slips Away', 'Always On My Mind', 'Guitar Man', plus never before released recordings of 'There Goes My Everything', 'Green Green Grass of Home', 'Just Call Me Lonesome', 'Help Me Make It Through The Night' and 'Fairytale'. The combination here is irresistable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great adventure book","review":"The book I read was The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, by: C.S. Lewis. This book is fantasy because it probably won't happen because there are talking animals.This book was about Lucy, Edmund, and Eustace falling into a picture to get into Narnia. They fell into the ocean and got in a ship with Prince Caspian. They went to the 7 islands to save the Lords that Caspians dad sent away. When they got to the last island there were 3 Lords there frozen and they had to go to the Worlds End to free them.This book The Voyage of the Dawn Treader was a good book, but got boring at places. It was a good book because it took you to a made-up world. This book would be good for 5th-7th graders."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story for me and my mother!","review":"Although my mother complained about a too boring storyboard, I think it has an exciting story about the four kids and Prince Caspian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enhanced eBook","review":"The enhanced Kindle book is really neat, with embedded audio that goes along with each chapter. It's a good value for the price since you get an eBook and an audio book.

Dust cover okay. Don't bother buying the hardback from this publisher. I can't see it standing up to much more wear than a paperback, which this book will get no doubt. Totally disgruntled. I like the cover art though."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ ME!!!","review":"This was my favorite of the seven. There is always something happening, a new adventure at every island.

We took turns reading aloud. The various adventures provide moral lessons for discussion but the story still moves fast enough to stay interesting.

This book is a classic with class."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will make you want to read all of them","review":"When I first read this book it was a adventure at first sight this book would be great for children with a big imagination I would definitely reccomend this book it is worth reading!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the voyage of the dawn treader","review":"The Book the Voyage Dawn Treader is a book I wouldn't recommend. I didn't like the Voyage of the Dawn Treader because there wasn't enough action for me, but I did Iike the character Reepicheep he was courageous and brave. The main idea of the book was that Caspian wanted to find the seven lords. I think that there were many differences between the movie and the book. The main characters were Lucy, Edmund, Eustace, Caspian, Reepicheep, Drinian, and Aslan. I thought the Dawn Treader was a very boring book. I didn't think the characters were believable. There was a part of the book that I did like and that was when the monopods came to get Lucy to make them visible again. I did like the way the story ended. At the end I liked how Aslan told Lucy something that made her happy but the sad thing was that Aslan told Lucy something that upset her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third mystery in the series","review":"This is the third mystery in the series with Episcopalian priest Clare Fergusson and Sheriff Russ Van Alstyne set in the Adirondack community of Miller's Kill. Dr. Rouse, of the Ketchum free medical clinic, disappears shortly after a confrontation with a young mother protesting the clinic's vaccination policy. Debba blames Dr. Rouse for her son's autism, which he developed after being vaccinated at the clinic. The doctor's disappearance stirs up local memories and police interest in a cold case from the 1930s involving the disappearance of Mr. Ketchum. The attraction between Russ (who is married) and the Rev. Clare heats up while the two tackle the interwoven cases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off good, but fell apart","review":"This is actually a pretty good mystery, and the woman Episcopal priest is also pretty good. The problem I had was that she then threw in a romance novel, and it all fell apart. Maybe it sells books for her, but it didn't fit.And there was no redeeming writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clare and Russ are a great team","review":"I really enjoyed reading this tale which is the usual boy/girlconflict with some great twists.

It is 300 pages of her complaining about how horrible her life is. Being a Harvard and Yale Graduate, winning the Rolling Stone college journalism award, studying abroad in England, and having lots of friends would depress anyone. I doubt she is depressed, and is using her \\"disorder\\" to do be rude, and blow off her birthday parties, get drunk, and be a generally awful person.She is more a narrasistic self-asorbed attention seeker,then a suffering artist. The eplouge is the most offensive part of the whole book, where she compares herself to Kurt Cobain, and talks about how everyone else who is using Prozac is a \\"poser\\" and how she is the only one depressed enough to use is. What a load of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"be ready to be depressed","review":"at first glance the book Prozac Nation looks like it should be a faily good book- but I found this not to be true at all. I began the book and thought to myself, ok, maybe this is just an introduction type of thing and the story is soon to come. After making myself read almost all of the bookI finally gave up and put it away. In my opinion the book had no real story to it- all it was was a girl compliaing about her life and how bad it was, when to me, it seems like it wasn't that bad at all. The narriator tells of how depressing everything is, and for me, all this book accomplished was making me feel depressed myself. I would not recomend this book to anyone and if you're depressed and trying to find a book that will help you pull yourself together try The Greatest Miracle in the World- it's a great book, by Og Mandino"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I admit that I'm not a writer, nor have I ever claimed to be. To me, this book just seemed to drone on and on and on. One hundred pages into the book I basically felt the exact same need to slit my wrists as after the first paragraph. This girl had (or has) a mental illness. I understand that. I knew that going in, but geez! I didn't ever get to the plot, if there was one. Really, I don't understand why the book was as long as it was. Wurtzel drags the reader into the depression with her. Who wants that? If I wanted to be depressed, I'm positive I could find my own reasons. Books are something I read to take my mind off of everyday life - to get away from the ho hum. I couldn't finish reading this book. Eventually I dreaded opening it, to the end effect of altogether avoidance of this book (yes, like the plague). Thankfully, someone already purchased my used copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh grow up","review":"I'm Elizabeth Wurtzel's age, and I even went to school with her (though I didn't know her). I also suffered from depression for years, but I never behaved as badly as she did, or whined publicly about the unfairness of life. I think I learned how to get treatment for my illness and to grow up and take responsibility for my actions. Clearly, all she learned was to market her misery.Sylvia Plath took her experiences with mental illness and turned it into a funny and provocative novel that poked fun at the heroine's self-seriousness at the same time it questioned the conventions of that heroine's society. Wurtzel's book seems completely devoid of any such aesthetic distance or self-irony--it's as if someone were paid to whine on paper and thus make hundreds of thousands of dollars off young people identifying with her narcissistic romanticization of her privileged background and her sorrows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"After forcing myself to finish this book, it still didn't redeem itself. The book was self-indulgent and whiney. I felt very little pitty for the auther. I, too, am depressed. I am also a self-injurer. There is a plethora of better books on such subjects. The subtitle of this book should have been \\"Young, Depressed, and Whining.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"gag","review":"Summary: Wurtzel is very special.

It's the literary equivalent of masturbation. She has nothing insightful or meaningful to share, she just wanted to whine to the public. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Self Absorbed","review":"Elizabeth Wurtzel's book \\"Prozac Nation\\" could also be called \\"Oh Poor Me.\\" For the first half of the book, I was entranced in what this woman was dealing with. As a survivor of depression myself, I could really feel what she was going through. But page 300, I felt like curling up in the fetal position and crying. I understand that her depression was \\"atypical\\", but enough's enough. I just couldn't deal with what she was saying anymore, it felt so repetitive and self absorbed. She would have been better off taking out a couple chapters, so that maybe she could keep her readers better entranced. Like I said, Wurtzel's had a rough life....but no more rough than some people I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Adult Non Fiction!","review":"If you love New Adult Fiction and you have the cojones to read about a seriously depressed student not just the happy then you'll enjoy this college story.Really found it fascinating and enjoyable.

No Personality Disorder","review":"This person has no idea what depression is. What you will find is that Wutzel has a Narcissistic Personality Disorder. With severe depression you are completely socially isolated and have no desire to interact with anyone. Read the silly Book and saw the crap Movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Elizabeth Wurtzel!","review":"I read this novel during my worst period of depression when I was diagnosed and started taking Prozac. I was relieved to know that I wasn't alone in my loneliness and fright. Elizabeth Wurtzel had been there. Just seeing what I was going through in someone's autobiography took away some of my fright. I loved this novel and recommend it to young college girls suffering from depression especially if they go to school in Cambridge! The war on depression can be won especially with a great psychiatrist, medication, and a willingness to get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking, heartbreaking............yet exhilerating","review":"Being a recovered depressive I can truely empathise with this book. I can understand why Elizabeth Wurtzell wanted to write this in the fashion she did. No one who has't experienced such trauma can understand how harrowing it is. This book truely moved me and \\"Depressed\\" is truely an overused term in todays society. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excruciatingly Amazing","review":"This book is like a modern, more accessible version of The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. It is the most truthful description of what it feels like to be depressed that I have ever read. This should be read by everyone who is having to grow up in these times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly self-centered and unenlightening","review":"This book is a terrible reminder of how unbearable an untreated narcissist can be. Wurtzel uses her illness as a mask for horrendous behavior and self-centered acts that would be considered unconscionable without her diagnosis.She doesn't come up with any analysis of herself, and she manages to alienate not only the reader but it seems everyone else in her world, according to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"God - Quit Your Rantings!!!!","review":"I am so mad that I spent [the money] on this book, just to read about some self-absorbed girl and her irrationationalities. It didn't take me long to get irritated with the author and her ridiculous ramblings. Yeah, her parents are divorced, yeah, they put her in the middle of their disputes, yeah, she's enstranged from her father - stuff that millions of us have gone through, but most of us survive without having to resort to daily mantras of 'my life [is bad], my life [is bad]'. It's funny to me that throughout this book, this girl never seems short on cash or friends, even though she claims to be 'poor' and she constantly blows off her friends so she can make time to further wallow in her self-pity. Agh! I want my money back!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone who has ever struggled and needed to know there was an out...","review":"Believe me when I say I could NOT put this book down. You become Elizabeth Wurtzel's biggest fan, trying to make sure she gets through each hardship the book discusses. Despite her decades of depression, she still manages to have a wit that keeps the reader empathic of her situation. Not your typical Harvard University success story...but a beautifully raw confession of what it is really like battling with depression amidst the fast-paced New England backdrop."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fascinating read","review":"I suffered from depression for the last 2 yrs and went to a book shop to find some information when i stumbled across this book, it's a thoroughly addictive read describing very similar symtoms to my own, and i could really relate to the way Elizabeth was feeling, i managed to get through most of the book but had to leave out a chapter near the end as it was just too harrowing for me to read in my delicate state of mind.A brilliant book that i would recommend to other depression sufferers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A culture of disease epitomized","review":"This book was beautifully written and, I presume to say, relevant to everyone who might read it, not solely those suffering from a mental or mood disorder. That being said, though, it offers nothing for resolution or prescription. There is no process of self-improvement in the book only pitiful self-absorbtion and -lamenting. Wurtzel has truly brought the honesty about depression (and manic-depression, which is a wholy different beast) out of the proverbial closet but in doing so has contributed nothing to society at large.Where is the merit in a book so clearly didactic with nothing to teach? When did we begin worshipping at the altar of disease and dysfunction?"},{"rating":"1","title":"At first I thought it was just me...but this book really is CRAP!","review":"I had wanted to read this book for a long time (hoping to find something relating to my own troubles). I'm only a third of the way through the book and the nagging thought of \\"wow this girl is really spoiled? self absorbed? whiny?\\" was at first just a blip and now it is so apparent that I just am going to give up on this one. I hate giving up on a book but if I have to listen to any more of her dribble I think I will fall into another depression. (PS. A scathing review was posted by her very own Alma mater, Harvard. Google it!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and Slow","review":"I have recently been enjoying reading nonfiction including memoirs and biographies. This book was a little disappointing to me, but maybe I had the wrong expectations. The book is about the authors life, living with depression. Every page was the same as the page before. She was sad and depressed and couldn't get out of bed, and then would become manic and try to get better, then it was back to being sad and depressed. It was a very slow read. It took me a week and a half to read when I normally read a book in three to four days. I will say that if you want to read about the day to day life of a severly depressed girl this is the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure nihilistic beauty","review":"The cover image.

I am supposed to love other literature more: Joyce, Derrida, Olson, Jabes. Wurtzel's honesty wins a place in my heart that is unrivalled by the authors I have been taught to revere. For months, I carried the book with me wherever I went. It was my teddy bear and double-edged sword. If you can handle that kind of intensity and paradox, check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny, self-indulgent claptrap","review":"Oh for god's sake! As a recovering alcoholic, I wanted to read Wurtzel's latest, her \\"memoir of addiction\\", but thought I would begin with \\"Prozac Nation\\". Where on earth is the gratitude for all the natural gifts she has been given? Apparently she is unable to get over her father leaving her - I was on his side not long into the book.Garbage like this is the reason most of the world hates America. Elizabeth, get over thyself."},{"rating":"1","title":"As depressing as her story","review":"It helps to realize that this author wrote another book a few years later More, Now, Again: A Memoir of Addiction and that she became an addict after her anti-depressant failed to help her.Although I can appreciate the literary style of evoking the same emotions in your reader as the story itself conveys rather than shedding light on the real pain of depression this book feels like the emotional outbursts of someone living with a borderline personality disorder instead. BPD is equally painful and treatable via intensive therapy (or in many cases treating the underlying trauma) this book seems to lack the same inner connection to self and emotional abandonment she suffers from and lacks any empathetic connection to her readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you should know about Depression","review":"I don't know why Prozac Nation hasn't been a more notable book. Could be that this is a topic that so many wish not to hear of yet so many have their uneducated opinions on depression, what it is and how to treat and not treat it. This is Wurtzel's story. This is her story of the paralyzing effects of darkness that is inescapable. Depression creates depression and Wurtzel's world becomes more and more hopeless as she sees nothing she can do with what she is afflicted with. \\"Sometimes I wish I were an alcoholic so I could go to an AA meeting and I could do something about it.\\" says Wurtzel. A desperate story but there is hope. Wurtzel finds that hope and here in this book is her journey from darkness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah Blah - Blah!","review":"I was so conflicted over this book. I could relate to certain aspects and others were alienating - and thats ok - but this book is to be Wurtzel's 'Truth' yet it smacks of bullsh*t. Maybe this book was cathartic for her - but it was a waste of time for me. What's even more hilarious is that she is coming out with an advice book about life. Thanks but no thanks Ellie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing read","review":"But one you should be careful with. At times you may be reminded of a similar period in your life and sometimes that may not be too pleasant. In the end this book became Prozac for me - one chapter a day and one at night and for a while there it seemed like whenever my arms itched I wanted a razor to deal with them - but that should NEVER be encouraged - and well as I said this book really did become Prozac for me since you end up thinking crazy thoughts"},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"This book was so terrible. I am 15 years old and I am very suicidal and depressed. But Wurtzel wants everyone to feel sorry for her. She annoyed the hell out of me! The way she told everyone I'm so sad, I don't ever want to get out of bed, I must be hooked on drugs to keep me alive. I HATE people who talk like that. When you're really depressed you shouldn't whine about it like she did!!!! I'm warning anybody who picks this book. Throw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"prozac nation","review":"I saw the movie and thought the book must be even better...nope. It was like listening to a thirteen year old girl whine. It made me uncomfortable reading it she was trying so hard to be a good writer that I felt embarrassed for her. I stopped reading after chapter 1 and sold it to a book store for a dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and Fiery","review":"Wurtzel sure spoke to me in this memoir, not because I, personally, suffer from depression (at least not of this magnitude) but because, underneath all that depression she is a regular college kid trying to make it in the big, bad world. Out of all the memoirs concerning mental illness that my brain has consumed, this is the only one that doesn't contain one iota of self-pity. And yet, it is informative and illuminating. I don't think I've connected with somebody (especially someone I've never met) so much in years. A good, smart excursion into the harrowing world of depression. Oh yeah, and I'm not being coy... but this is not exactly a work for the emotionally unstable."},{"rating":"1","title":"why on earth?","review":"i cant really fathom why on earth Wurtzel would want to write this book. unfortunately she is so irritating that you get bored of her really quickly; shes not some friend of mine in trouble, shes a bint who wrote a book which sold very nicely. we may all slit our arms but we dont write a memoir in the blood. i felt sorry for those who were close to her and felt helpless, they couldnt put down this book and go do something more interesting instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The writing is unbearable!","review":"Though Wurtzel may have a story to tell and a few good points to make, I can't tell you all that much about it. Written in the tone of an adolescent girl gossiping with her friends, it is rambling and becomes irritating to read. It is filled with terrible metaphors, excessively long sentences, and reflective passages that completely miss the mark. There are times when I can almost hear Wurtzel speeding up and shrieking in the background... completely unenjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed feelings","review":"This is a book not for the light of heart. It contains a graphic portrayal of a women deppressed in america. I would recomend it to mature viewers of whom wish to understand the view of the deppressed graphic world inder a new light"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth reminded me a lot of myself","review":"A lot of people say that ant-depressant's cause suicide and I some how disbelieve that because of this book . If your going to committee suicide then your going to committee suicide the anti-depressants just give you the ambition to commit it.Even if your not depressed by reading this you get in the mind of a depressed women where actions are spontaneous and crying is frequently.I loved this book and i recommend it to everyone hopeless and to anyone who feels thier the only one going through depression this book helps...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful insight","review":"Wurtzel's book depicts a powerful insight into the chaotic state of depression so many people find themselves in. The beauty of the book does not lie in its literary grandeur or its potential to become a classic (I am not confident that it has either hence 4/5 stars); but in the priceless ability it has to speak personally to the reader. It has a nack for exploiting the gritty, tangled truth that is so difficult to pin-point. A tangible account which is an absolutely essential read for anyone trapped in the termoil of depression (or one involved with someone who is). The virile images the author indulges in are striking and at times grotesque, illustrating with horrific honesty the reality of an ellusive sickness. It will help you understand the logic of the depressed mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You're right there with her....","review":"Elizabeth Wurtzel's memoir of depression has been described as self-indulgent. I think people are missing the point. Wurtzel describes quite clearly how depression is about *you*. It's about looking out for number one, being so weighed down by that black cloud that it's impossible to care about anyone else. She describes feeling guilty for being depressed, pointing out that she can't blame her family life or circumstances, not knowing who or what or why is making her feel that way. Her helplessness and frustration and acute self-hatred are tangible in these pages. You know exactly how she feels, and you understand her. That's the beauty of this book, and that is why it's so utterly compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant -a modern classic.","review":"This is the book that defines a generation. A must-read for anyone who suffers from depression or knows somebody who does. Another must read: More, Now, Again, by the same author. Don't let the bad reviews of that book fool you!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant, thought provoking...","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who is suffering from depression or knows anyone who has. I thought that it really gave a clear picture of how someone who is depressed is feeling. Although I could not personally relate to Elizabeth Wurtzel, I knew someone close to me who was diagnosed with major depression and it is a difficult disease to understand if you have never suffered from it. I praise Elizabeth for having the courage to write about and share her painful experience with us. I also appreciated the authors note at the end of the book which gave some insight into depression and how it relates to popular culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating-Read It In One Sitting.","review":"I finished this book in one sitting--could not tear myself away from Wurtzel's stories about her travels into the abyss of depression. Good book for someone who has either experienced depression or needs to gain greater insight into the nature of depression. However, the title is somewhat inaccurate considering that Prozac is not even discussed until the last few chapters--so if the reader is looking for a book about Prozac/or an individual accounting of the effects of Prozac try another book. This book is about Wurtzel herself and her life in dealing with depression."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best book I've read!!!!","review":"I found this book to be amazing. I loved it! I couldn't put it down. It is a compelling tale of her life and how she fought depression and won. I would recomend it to anyone who has an intrest in depression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prozac Nation, I feel is a very excellent book!!!","review":"This book helps readers understand what depression is and what depressed people go through. It also helps some depressed people to relate to Elizabeth, and it shows them that you can get better, some with help. The only bad thing about this book is that it has some unappropriate parts that are very graphic.[This book many not be appropriate for some young adults.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"The end saves this book","review":"Though the beginning was really slow, I liked this book by the time I finished it. I picked it up because I have just started taking Prozac for depression. Wurtzel tells a good story, but I don't think the majority of it is particularly well-written. I do like the points she makes near the end about how the popularity of Prozac relates to early 90s anomie. Also, I was happy to see someone else found solace in Springsteen's \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I have to give this even one star??","review":"This book was a required read for a Sociology class I took in college. The worst part about this book, in my opinion, is that the author's bragadocious attitude, combined with her ceaseless whining, disabled me from understanding Elizabeth's depression or sympathizing with her in any way. Thus, the point of writing (or reading) it seems moot. I detested this book, and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on people...","review":"I just have to say to all the people complaining that she shouldn't be depressed because she went to Harvard and she's wealthy...IT DOESN'T MATTER!!!!! You obviously don't understand depression if you think that being rich and going to Harvard means you cannot or should not suffer from depression. My God...Anyhow, see the movie starring Christina Ricci. It's wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cult of whine","review":"Well Lizzie: Wonder what you would have done just a mere 60 years ago, when the nation had not been saved by WWII. What would you have done before the transcontinal RR was built, and if you wanted to get to San Francisco, one walked or if rich, rode on a horse or mule? The problem with today's younger generations is that they have no concept of history and what it took to stay alive, just a few years ago. This not the Age of Aqurius, but rather, The Age of Whine. The cult of someone did to me and it is not my fault, is in accendance. Don't waste time on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disjointed drivel","review":"Wurtzel can string a sentence together, but she cannot tell a story. Wurtzel's memoir of her own depression rambles so much that I had to force myself to finish half of it.It's hard to argue with a depressive. I know, I battled depression for many years, mostly in high school. No matter how smart, attractive and funny they may be, they just don't see it. However, I tired of the excuses when they came out of me, and I tired of them even quicker from Wurtzel.Wurtzel also launches into pointless, irrelevant tangents at random. I found it very hard to sympathize with her. Nothing she had to say was any more interesting than watching a dead houseplant. That is all I can bring myself to say about this one. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is an insult","review":"I was personally insulted and mystified by this book. I have had chronic depression for years and I did not see anything even remotely resembling my own experiences in this book. I did see a self-absorbed little brat who whined incessantly for a few hundred pages. In my amateur opinion Wurtzel does have a mental illness but it's a personality disorder, like borderline perhaps. It is not depression. For a good account of the true story of depression read William Styron's memoir Darkness Falls instead of this piece of self-indulgent tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"EW is so unimpressive...","review":"OK, so what's her deal? Why does she think she's SO different (special) from either other depressives, other New Yorkers, other women in general, other Ivy League graduates, etc.? What has she really written about that has any solid, concrete information? Prozac Nation has already been written in the diaries of like 3 billion other young women in America, but you don't see them publishing their diaries and glorifying their pathologies. She SO did not \\"expose depression as an epidemic in our country.\\" She merely published her diary and attempted to create an illusion of authority and superiority and heroism. The book should really be a case history not for depression, but for narcissistic and histrionic personality disorders. Get over yourself already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have Pity on Me","review":"That's about the only message Prozac Nation conveys. Elizabeth Wurtzel somehow deviates from the problems of depression vis a vis, and deviates to all sorts of tangents. Everything always leads back to her. I'm sorry, but she must have been PMSing something fierce to come up with this excrement. Sure she has a verbose lexicon, and knows how to arrange words fluidly to make it appear as if she's saying something meaningful, but as far as I'm concerned she fails miserably. I however am only reading this book because it's required for a college course. Would I recommend this for a peer? Simple and short, the answer is no. If you enjoy the mindless, self-indulgence of a rich Jewish girl who manages to hyperbolize every dramatic event in her life, then I recommend this book for you. If you have an IQ above that of an inanimate object, then don't even skim through the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe.","review":"Self-indulgent, self-pitying and overwritten. The cringe factor is extremely high in this book; I altenated between feeling embarrassment and utter contempt for the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get me outta here","review":"Gutsy and confronting, yeah, but I hated it. Elizabeth Wurtzel revealed herself as stuck in depression but also whiny, attention-seeking and spoilt. This makes it a very unenjoyable read. Her mother gets assaulted and her immediate thought is something like I can't believe this is happening to me! And sure, taking a minor overdose is worrying, but don't call it a suicide attempt if you know it's not going to kill you. She does admit that she doesn't know how to be a grown-up and that was how I saw it too: it was hard for me to feel for her or her depression when she revealed herself in an unsympathetic way.A good writer makes you feel things, good or bad, sure. But I read on WikiP that after her second book got poor reviews she became a drug addict ... so she could write another book about how hard things are. This gets little sympathy from me, which is a shame because these are topics we all need to be aware of and emotionally intouch with. 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try \\"Darkness Visible\\" or \\"The Beast\\" instead.","review":"While Wurtzel does provide a couple relatively decent insights, this is a long drawn-out memoir about a manipulative, deceitful and narcissistic individual. While depression may be one component of her disease, her psychological problems are (or were) many and varied. Other human beings are only useful to her when they can provide drugs, money, sex, and a shoulder to cry on (which is every minute of every day). If they couldn't provide these things they they weren't worth knowing. People interested in learning more about depression should check out \\"Darkness Visible\\" by William Styron and \\"The Beast\\" by Tracy Thompson."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disservice to depressed people","review":"Personally, I am not convinced that Elisabeth Wurtzel suffers from depression. I am not a mental health professional, but have have a degree in biology and have read extensively on the topic. Sure, she has depressive symptoms, but her main problem appears to be more in line with a personality disorder, borderline or narcissistic. That would best explain the superficial charm, grandiosity, self-senteredness and erratic projections of anger that are evident in the book, as well as her chaotic lifestyle choices over the years. She is doing disservice to bona fide depression by promoting a stereotype of depressed people being whiny and self-centered. I think it is pretty outrageous that she is now a poster child for this condition, and actively promotes exclusively pharma-based treatments to impressionable young adults. The writing itself is terrible, sloppy and pretentious. Don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice book","review":"i read this several years ago and enjoyed it much more than i did when i recently re-read it...maybe a good book while still a teen trying to find your way, but once the realities of life hit you, most of this seems insignificant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Please Slit My Wrists..","review":"A novel has to be really bad for me to not finish it. I just do not get why there seems to be a cult following for this snore of a book. Yeah, so you're depressed Wurtzel, get over it. Who really cares? I got the impression of a spoiled little brat, who thinks she's more wonderful than she is and is pissed off that the world doesn't bow down to her. Get over yourself. It was painful just to turn the page. It was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"On and on and on","review":"Im not making light of depression (have personal and professional expirience), but come on already. The entire book was a reiteration that she was a sick little brat. On and on and on. Thats it. One reviewer said she was obviously BPD, and I have to say I felt the same thing while reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I have depression, so I understand what she's going through. But even I haven't suffered as much as she has. I don't think she is a whiner. It's not an easy life going through depression, so I believe she has every right to her words. She had some of my thoughts right on target, I couldn't believe it. I would definately recommend this, I already have to some of my friends that also suffer from depression, but even if you don't, this book will help you have a better understanding of the way a depressed person views the world and their lifestyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"salvation","review":"I could probably have made it through the mess that I was without this book. I'm glad I didn't have to. It was one of the few things I had then that made me believe I could get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I rounded up from 3.5 stars.","review":"I'm kinda drawn between liking this book and thinking that it's spoiled girls account of what happens when she doesn't get what she wants. She's chemically imbalanced, intelligent, well-educated, has an addictive-personality, has parent issues, and is overall dysfunctional. It sounds like me and a million other middle-class people. But, maybe that's why I kinda liked it. She has had incredible opportunities handed to her on a silver platter, including the publication and popularity of her book. I'm stuck on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor me...Poor, poor, poor little me.","review":"Yikes. Someone needs to tell this woman that there's more to writing a story than producing a handful of cosmetically attractive sentences. There are plenty of lines in here, that if taken on their own might fool someone into thinking they came from a great book. But take them all together and the story comes up as empty and shallow as Ms. Wurtzel herself. I gave 'Bitch' a chance too, but it also failed to impress. Perhaps these books read better when you're thoroughly medicated, but to me they amounted to nothing more than an indignant whimper from a spoiled little girl. Boo hoo. Sorry Liz, but you're no Dorothy Parker."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read","review":"Eizabeth Wurtzel's memoir seemed very trivial to me at first. I am not a child of divorce so I have no idea what caused my depression. But as I read further, I found her putting words to feelings that I myself have had and have been unable to express to many people. I think that anyone who is living with, or knows someone suffering from depression needs to read this book. If only to get an idea of how it really feels when that black wave washes over you."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"i am only 15 years old, yet people tell me that when they talk to me, its more like im in my 30's. i found this confusing until i read Prozac Nation. i had just been looking at books when i was drawn to Elizabeth Wurtzel's interesting cover. i sat down on the floor in the middle of the store and began to read. i was immediately pulled into her truthful words. as a person that has lived through depression at a young age, its been hard for me to find someone else's experience in words that were similiar to my feelings. however, Prozac Nation explained depression and everything that comes with it in such a way that i felt as if i had written it myself. it was amazing how all of my feelings from the past 3 years were all in this book. thank you elizabeth wurtzel for that. i hope that everyone at some point in their life will read this great piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"yet they all want to talk","review":"as anyone who will read this review will know that this is my opinion and mine alone! personally, this was quite an eyeful for me to digest. i loved it and hated it all at the same time. true your personal depression may vary from the author but it is tragic none the less and that is something we all can relate to. i read 1 review that tried to deminish elizabeth wurtzel's experience to meer whining. i completely and undeniably disagree with their rantings. i also would like to add that if all she did was \\"complain\\" and \\"tell her story to anyone that would listen\\" to be a bad thing as you deem it then why are you posting your sorted life's issues here. wurtzel tells HER story! not yours or a generalized version of sociaty. ONLY HERS! some will identify and some will not. that is what makes us all so beautiful... unique. don't hate for what you can not understand! appreciate the diversity and then get over it! in closing........loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved it!","review":"This book was absolutely amazing.

It will make you have a new respect for that person or understand yourself better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pity me! Oh, please...","review":"Elizabeth Wurtzel's writing can, at best, be described as tragically poetic. At its worst, self-indulgent and obnoxious.While the book itself contains a reasonable amount of analysis of one woman's struggle with depression, one walks away with a bad taste in one's mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring the rating DOWN!","review":"I don't have much to add to the reviews of this book without heavily reiterating the same thoughts that every other review has shared. I just need to bring the rating of this book way down, so to feel there is justice in the universe. The book was well written, I enjoyed the vocabulary....but the book was repetitive. This book is a glaringly apparent display for attention and her flimsy attempt at pretend nihilism and blatent passive agressiveness was sickening. She had excellent vocabulary for describing her boring, commonplace neurosis. She goes on too long about her childhood which really had nothing to do with her depression, since it was biological. We too, were questioning the validity of her story due to her contradictory accomplishments (going to Harvard) along with her scorching case of debilitating depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prozac Nation is a Serious Disappointment!","review":"For anyone who is not majorly depressed and in need of validation, or if you like your books to have substance, this is not the book for you. Prozac Nation ends up being nothing more than a redundant piece of depression written by someone that you are glad that you don't have to deal with. The author does not merely chronicle her melancholia, she wallows in it until you can no longer read on and you simply add the book to the list of unreadables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prozac Nation","review":"I picked this book off a summer reading list and I thought it was going to be some type of a documentary on prozac, so I was a little surprised when I started to read this book. I only got through the first chapter \\"I Hate Myself and I Want to Die.\\" If you have dealt with depression, then this is a great book to read. Prozac Nation shows the reader the emptiness and lonesomeness someone with depression goes through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"The only reason I finished this book is because I have a weird thing about always reading books until the end no matter how bad they are (and this one was bad!). Wurtzel is a whiny, self-centered narrator and her writing style is completly annoying. \\"Poor Me\\" seems to be the theme of this book but you end up feeling more sorry for yourself than anyone else after reading this horrible, horrible book. Thank God I got it from the library and did not pay money for this torture. I would have given this book zero stars if that were an option. Hopefully, she'll do us all a favor and never publish anything again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please shut up","review":"Anyone who has experienced severe depression for decades will not be willing -or able, in some cases -to put up with Wurtzel's whiny memoir.Geez, wait'll she hits menopause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"A common response to this book from people who do not suffer from Clinical Depression is, \\"So what-get over it\\". The fact that non-depressive people don't understand that Ms. Wurtzel can't \\"get over it\\" is a good example of how depression is misunderstood in America. This book is a beautifully written description of what a Clinically Deppressed person goes through day to day, year to year. Wurtzel has a wonderful grasp of words and sentence structure. She says things in a way that makes you want to listen.

But this album is laced with unbelievable songs like, For heavens sake, itz yours, cash still rules, visions, as high as wu tang get, severe punishment, Unbelievable lyrics in a better tomorrow, triumph, MGM, hells wind staff, sick beat on impossible.

Disc one alone matches Enter..., offering the same swirling brew of rhymes, beats and loops with varying degrees of success from filler to fantastic (For Heaven's Sake and It's Yourz are my favorites). Disc two however is damn near perfect. From the bass boomin' Triumph to the chilling string lines of The City, it's a dense masterpiece from hip-hop's premier producer and a squadron of top-notch rappers whose combined pool of talent may be unparalled, not in hip-hop, but in mainstream music, period.

Yes, they do sell millions of records but that's cause they're largely purchased from foreign Commy's in China and what have you.

The problem is that when I play correspondence chess or internet chess it is not allowed to use a computer during the actual games.

He started putting it together at 16 months, and it was one of the easier ones for him to learn. There are drawings under each puzzle piece so that also helps.

After playing with it for two days she knew all of the shapes when they appeared in everyday encounters (like signs, tables, books, etc).

Instead of having it available for play every single day, I make it available once every two or three weeks to keep her excited about it.

Tonight I hear an occasional \\"octagon!\\", \\"square!\\" coming from my daughter's toy box because of settling toys and nightfall. The sensor thing was just a bad idea. The fact that any puzzle piece (heck, even a finger touching the sensors) can set this thing off is not only annoying but confusing for kids. I am taking the batteries out and sitting with my daughter so I can make sure she learns the correct names for the shapes. It is a decent puzzle, just leave it without the batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Educational value lacking","review":"I provide math professional development to preschool teachers and was excited to integrate this toy into the materials that I use for shape learning. I thought this could teach children about shape when they are playing without a teacher guiding the instruction and it would be helpful to children who speak English as a second language. The MAJOR educational drawback to this toy is that no matter where the pieces are placed it will call out the name of the shape. This is a BIG PROBLEM in terms of teaching children the correct names of shapes! For example, if you put the octagon over the triangle it will call out triangle because the magnet triggers the voice prompt, NOT the puzzle piece being correctly inserted. I DO NOT recommend this toy because of this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound does not work","review":"I got this puzzle for my 1 1/2 yr old.

It rambles on and on, with very little plot development or anything else to keep the reader's interest. It may be a \\"snapshot\\" of the time, but so many writers of the same era managed to do this within the parameters of books that are much more compelling and, yes, much shorter. Sometimes, less is, indeed, more. I recommend this book only to people who have nothing better to do than, say, read through the Oxford English Dictionary from front to back.

After less than 100 pages into it i realised i was in trouble and the only way i could finish was by setting myself the task of 20 pages a day. Even them, it turned into a journey through a barren wasteland, with little to relieve the senses from one page to the next.

The plot is stiff, the characters (except for Lovelace) are very 2 dimensional. The material is redundant and gets very boring. The end is far from satisfying. The only thing that saves this novel from being a complete disaster is Lovelace's animated character. And even he is poorly handled by Richardson. It would seem Richardson makes him out to be a villain, and yet he was Clarissa's only hope. He was the only one who showed any genuine concern for Clarissa. As much as I love literature, this is one book I literally threw so many times in frustration.

In several places, some of Richardson's very long sentences were \\"desecrated\\" and broken down into two or more sentences.He alsotampered with Richardson's punctuation.

This was really a wonderful book. Once I'd finished the book and knew the story, I wanted to start all over again to savor it's development. The novel really starts to pick up when Lovelace's letters begin. The characters of Lovelace and Anna Howe leap from the page. I would love to see an updated film version. I was continually struck with how contemporary the psychology seemed. It just goes to show you, that human nature is constant. I read Pamela in college and now want to re-read it and also Sir Charles Grandison, which I've never read. Also, I started this novel w/the Penguin Classics edition and halfway through, having purchased the new Kindle Paperwhite, downloaded the last five volumes, for free, on to it.

Some of the worst episodes of the series are found in the embarassing \\"Spock's Brain\\" and the unintentionally hilariously bad episode of the space hippies search for a nonexistent galactic Eden. There are far more disasters than Picassos in this season. It was evident that the writers and other creative people were running on fumes and the series clearly had jumped the shark.

The main reason I bought this season was because I planned on seing every episode of the original Trek. In my opinion, the worst episode is \\"the way to eden\\", because of the space hippies who put on a concert to destract the crew while their cronies hijack the Enterprise. Anyway, \\"The tholian Web\\", \\"Day of the dove\\" ,\\"Plato's stepchildren\\", \\"Elaan of troyius\\", \\"specter of the gun\\" and \\"Turnabout intruder\\" stand out from the rest. If you want the third season I suggest you get it used because $100 is too much for this season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally-our 3 year mission-to have ALL the episodes of Star Trek!","review":"What is there to say about Star Trek?

Why? Because it has the episode where Sulu is fighting with his shirt off. This was groundbreaking. It was the first time the American public was able to realize how sexy the Japanese culture really is. Nowadays, you have teenagers with numerous Japanese writings on their shirts and many people getting tattoos with Japanese characters. For instance, my friend went to a tattoo parlor a few years ago and got into the trend. He saw a cool looking set of Japanese characters and told the tattoo artist to put it on his bicep. My friend had no idea what it meant until a waiter at a sushi restaurant translated the characters for him. Turns out he had the words, \\"Turtle Wax\\" in Japanese on his bicep. Anyway Sulu is a Japanese icon. His contribution and acting skills to the science-fiction community has made me make peace with the Japanese for bombing Pearl Harbor.

And at first, it is somewhat interesting. Unfortunately, the only two characters I wanted to read more about were True, the guy who liked hairy men, and Parker, the hot, beefy blond guy assigned to guard the President's son. All the other characters were flat archetypes. The story isn't ludicrous or anything like that, but the ending is SO unfulfilling. Granted, not all stories have a happy ending, but without a character to root for, a story just won't work. Sorry, Mr. Kraus, but this really could have been written better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love! Sex! Political backstabbing! Intrigue!

A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"I realize some of the reviews weren't very flattering, and I must confess I bought the book only because I thought the guy on the cover was gorgeous. But, if you are the type of person who found the movie \\"The American President\\" (Michael Douglas) or the TV series, \\"West Wing\\" to be even marginally interesting, then you will definitely like this book. It definitely is a bit more intense than the above mentioned dramas, but it's definitely worth the read. I, typically, like Gordon Merrick and Felice Picano and some of the newer vampire novel writers, but I started reading this book last night at work and only took a break to drive home after work and then finished reading.

Although it comes in an usually high key (well, this is how the High G is supposed to be! :) it can say a lot about this model of harp generally. It seems to be air tight, responsive, well built and tuned. The only unusual thing that I kind of had to get used to is feeling the letters and digits imprinted on the covers, but that's manageable. Overall good harp and I plan to buy more of those in different keys. Oh, and I just recently discovered that Junior Wells in 80s played the very same model of harp, and high G was one of his favorite! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Micheal Lewis can do much better","review":"I bought this book because I liked other book I had read by Michael Lewis and I thought the subject matter would make for an interesting story. This book is nothing like Michael Lewis' other books. The story telling is just not there. Just because you liked The Blind Side, Moneyball, or Liar's Poker does not mean that you will enjoy this book. In my opinion it pales in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and Entertaining","review":"Entertaining book following the Republican Primaries of 1996. You learn a lot about the candidates that you may have never known, and even more so about the candidates you never even knew. There is a lot of focus on Morey Taylor. For some reason, I never remembered him, but liked a lot about him after reading this book. Good entertaining read. Primarily for political junkies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great peek into the nitty gritty of politics","review":"This book answers the question, \\"Why are some campaigns so uninspired?\\" Michael Lewis chronicles Bob Dole's campaign as run by \\"rented strangers\\" and contrasts it with the inspiring but unsuccessful campaigns of the candidates for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination. The anecdotes are funny and provide a perspective that is sorely lacking in political books: the perspective of the people who lost elections."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cynics view of politics","review":"This is Michael Lewis' worst book. It has moment of excellent prose because it is Michael Lewis, but he becomes a victim of his own cynical beliefs. At the end of this book the only clear take away is that you have full understanding of all Lewis' political beliefs. It is sad. He condemns those he disagrees with and praises those who are \\"enlightened.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing book.","review":"You'd hardly know that Bill Clinton ran against Bob Dole from reading this book. Lewis spends far too much time and energy focused on Morry Taylor, who was irrelevant in 1996, and it was mostly because Taylor invited him along. He didn't get access to the big campaigns so he wrote them off as uninteresting. Lewis doesn't give much insight into contemporary political campaigns and the interesting anecdotes that usually save books like this are few and far between.

I don't give it five stars because The short length of the shaft sometimes makes it a pain to attach it to bike racks, but with enough creativity, I've never had to leave my bike unlocked. OnGuard does offer the Brute in a Long Shaft version (LS 5000), but for some reason the updated version doesn't include a theft guarantee for bicycles, only motor vehicles. The picture Amazon shows is for last year's model, so maybe you can still get a long shaft with the guarantee. If not, go for the standard length, it's a \\"don't mess with me\\" lock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beast of a lock.","review":"This lock is nothing to laugh at. It's 4.9lbs of security is a hassle to lug around. With that said, I haven't found a way to properly carry it without killing myself.

However, after 3 years of heavy use it has become incredibly difficult to open. It requires a surgeon-like finesse to get the key to turn. Or, at least it used to. Now, it doesn't open at all. After lubricating with graphite, pounding with a hammer to loosen any stuck interior components and paying a locksmith to try to open it, the lock is still seized on my bike and my primary mode of transportation is disabled. There are numerous reports of OnGuard locks seizing on the internet, so my case is not isolated. My recommendation is to look to other brands for high-end u-locks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the first two months...","review":"I purchased this lock for my commuter bicycle in Washington, DC in May. It seemed sturdy, did not have problems with the key breaking off in the lock (like many of its competitors), and was hefty but not too heavy. For the price, it seemed like a great deal in the beginning.Like some reviewers have said, the plastic piece that attaches the lock to the bicycle is not strong enough, so I had to either strap it to my bicycle's back rack or sling it over the handlebars. This was a minor hassle, but no big deal. Unfortunately, this abuse proved to be too much for the lock. Its cheap, internal plastic components must have cracked during one of my commutes, because when I got to work it completely came apart, revealing cracked plastic parts.If this lock cannot handle a few bumps on my 3 mile each way commute for 2 months, I do not trust it to secure my bike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last...","review":"OnGuard brand locks have dissapointed me on all three occasions that I have purchased them. The first was a cable, easily cut through and my bike stolen. Second was a U-lock similar to this and then this U-lock. The plastic casing on both u-locks broke off within a month on both. Shortly after, the locking mechanism froze to where the key would only turn 1/4 of the way. Purchased a Krypto (a bit more pricey) and it hasnt let me down yet. Far worth the avoided headache to pay a little bit more for a better brand lock.... I will definitely avoid OnGuard brand locks in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Lock, Defective Holder","review":"The plastic lock holder that is supposed to hold the lock on the frame broke after just 3 weeks of normal use.

See's flowing, descriptive style as well as the interesting lives of her family made the book entertaining.I was surprised to see some reviewers give this only one star because they felt she was racist. I imagine they also did not enjoy \\"The Help\\", Faulkner's \\"Light in August\\" or just about anything written by Toni Morrison. Sorry folks, but racism has existed in this country for centuries.

It is kind of a fight for the right to be here and this is from the Chinese perspective.

Family sagas are mulled over and dissected, conflicting cultures often force choices that Beaver Cleaver didn't have to deal with.On Gold Mountain is not only a compellingly woven family/cultural history of perserverence and willpower in the face of prejudice, it is also incorporates a very honest appraisal of skeletons that a not quite as forthright narrator as Ms. see would perhaps perfer to bury in a closet.It's a compelling page turner, and well worth reading, a vivid testimonial of a truly American family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Story","review":"This is a complicated but fascinating story of the history/lineage of the author.

IN HOW IT ASK'S TO MAKE YOU BETTER MAN THAN YOU ARE. RICK IS A GREAT PERFORMER ON STAGE, BUT LET'S ALL GIVE RICK THE RESPECT FOR WHAT HE CAN DO IN THE STUDIO AS WELL. I BELIEVE ALOT OF PEOPLE FORGET THAT RICK IS A GRAMMY AWARD WINNER."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Back","review":"This is a must for the die hard Rick fans. The songs are great. It feels like he never took a break. I have a 5 year old who loves Rick and walks around with his walkman singing his songs.I hope is the beginning of what's to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just give it a chance.","review":"Several of Karma's songs didn't make much of an impression the first time I listened. However, by the 3rd time through the CD, I began to gain an appreciation for each and every track. Hopefully, Rick will release \\"Free\\". It has definate hit potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature music for maturing Rick fans!","review":"Karma is a heart felt and mature sounding cd. I believe this to be the most personal and intimate lyrics of Rick Springfield's career. The music is a little slow at imes, but does prove to be consist with Rick's undeniable style of music and from the first preview of the cd you will find yourself humming the tunes. Would have liked to heard a little more guitar sound, but it does rock at times. i highly reccomend to all. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quality Release!","review":"I've been a Rick Springfield fan since the \\"Working Class Dog\\" days, but I loved the more mature Rick on \\"Tao\\" and \\"Rock of Life.\\" This is an extension of what I believe is the true Rick, a fine musician who is not just a bubble gum rocker. Hey -- I can appreciate \\"Jessie's Girl\\" and all the earlier hits, but when he writes a song like \\"Kharma\\" which moves you both form an instrumental and lyrical standpoint, that's what what real music is all about. Give this one a chance! You'll probably find yourself playing it over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice quality - even the wife was impressed","review":"Dared to make a \\"furniture\\" purchase without the wife's approval. However, she was impressed with the style and quality of my selection.Also, it's quite heavy--which we like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little skewers for fruit shishkabobs","review":"I got the idea to use these from a magazine article using veggies. I used them for fruit for our church picnic and outside backyard barbeques, sticking them in covered styrofoam tucked in a cute container. I am very happy with these. Just the right size for 3 or 4 small pieces of fruit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad..but bacon kept sticking","review":"I bought this product for when I cook bacon and I wanted the bacon to turn out flat. The product definitely flattened the bacon but made it stick extremely bad to the bottom of the skillet. Generally when I cook bacon it sticks a little but this was so bad I demolished the bacon while trying to scrape it off the skillet. It might have been me but this doesn't usually happen, but overall it does what it says it is suppose to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thing for pan cookery","review":"Nice handy device for frying/grilling. Can't fathom the complaints about the handle. Seemed sturdy enough to me and very easily installed. Nothing strange about the attaching screws. Much easier than changing a watch battery. Does what it's supposed to. Nice and flat and to me a convenient size. Best to warm it along with your pan/griddle prior to cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it's supposed to do...","review":"I have one of these and may end up with another. After checking a previous review, someone obviously doesn't understand function as opposed to just looking good. The only thing he rated highly was a cookbook...I only wish this came in a size that would properly fit a 12\\" frying pan for when I'm cooking breakfast for a crowd.No complaints and I know how to clean cast iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"It is the right size and does the job it was meant to do. It was gift for my husband and he loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"does perfect grilled cheese","review":"I heat this up while I have my sandwiches grilling and them park it on the buttered top. It gently presses and heats at the same time. Great for bacon also..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I love this product! It is heavy, gets the job done. I used it for bacon, burgers, chicken, and more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BOON TO HUMANITY","review":"I had been wanting one of these grill presses for a long time so was delighted and surprised when I found it on Amazon. One can use this on the grill or the stove. It's perfect to cook flat bacon. I can't recommend this press enough. I LOVE IT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you do a whole lotta bacon - not required","review":"Will cover 4-5 slices of bacon or 2 burgers. Found burgers were better under the broiler, so this sits in the cupboard most of the time. Not essential by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screws Loose","review":"The Press part is well made, but the screws holding handle on don't fit it holes very well. I couldn't get the screws to tighten up. The flat head screws are too small for the holes. I went to hardware store and bought larger screws. Not it's excellent with new screws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"When the Lodge Press arrived today, I was disappointed. One of the main reasons I ordered this item was due to its handle. The cromed handle reminded me of things I use to see at my grandmother's house. What I got was a handle that is painted black, and not the what the picture shows. This seems to happen a lot when ordering thru Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good weight, poor handle design","review":"Apparently I didn't do my research very well when ordering this press. The weight of the press is nice, but it is smooth underneath (I assumed it would have the ridges like the grill pan). Perhaps that was my mistake, but I didn't see anything explicitly stated in the product description about that). Another problem with this grill press is that the handle must be assembled/attached by hand, and the way the handle screws into the press leaves nooks and crannies for bits of food and grease to get stuck. The \\"cool grip\\" handle gets hot and overall feels sort of springy/flimsy. It is also painted black, not sliver like in the picture. I am returning this and getting the panini press instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Round Cast-Iron Grill Press","review":"Much smaller than I expected. I should have asked for the diameter. Very nice, well made item but just too small for anything I can think of except one hamburger patty."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONSTANT HARRASSMENT","review":"Whatever you may think about this product, DO NOT CRITIZE IT. The crazy come out. Don't buy it. It is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"The worst thing about this grill press is that the handle is attached by two cheap recessed screws. The screw heads sit in depressions on the working surface of the press so they gather bits of food. This grill press is \\"SKILLET STYLE\\" which means that it the cruddy cast iron, pebble surfaced construction that will always seem a little filthy. There is NO reason to make it this way except to save on construction while passing the product off as having an antique quality. It would be much better if it were smooth and nonstick (like that modern KITCHENAID skillet I use it with). The handle gets pretty hot as well which is not surprising as it's all metal, and I have to use a pot holder. I will not buy LODGE products ever again and feel I was ripped off and duped by this expensive hunk of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but messy","review":"This press works great, but be prepared for a fair amount of clean up. I would suggest using it only when you have a fair amount of bacon to cook, otherwise I question whether it will be worth the cleanup.Other than that, it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book is very informative. I just wish it had pictures of all items. It does have information on all items up to the ppublication date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fisher Price Review","review":"I use this book constantly for reference. I received it as a gift, and have given it to others as a gift. It's a lot of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifetime is the best NJ has to offer","review":"Lifetime is definitely the best punk band to come out of NJ. The first time I listened to this cd I didn't get so into it, but the more and more I listened to it the more and more it grew on me. I can't wait to buy the rest of Lifetime's albums. What a shame I didn't catch on to them earlier...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bilingual volume for learning Yupik language and culture","review":"Each page has yup'ik on the left, and english on the right. Excellent volume for learning about Yup'ik language and culture. Not really the best first choice if you're just wanting an introduction to Yup'ik -- but the essential for intermediate or advanced studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and great value","review":"For the price, this is a great deal. The wood is great looking. It has two different colors: the outside of the branches are lighter and smoother and the insides are darker with more texture. I can't decide which side I'm going to place up. These \\"medium\\" sizes are probably equal to other sellers' \\"large\\" sizes. I ordered two and one piece weighted 3 lbs., the other was 2.5 lbs. A very heavy, dense wood. With free shipping, you can't beat it. Can't wait to get my large and extra large pieces!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry !!!!","review":"this product was i rip off the wood is the size of a rock. thought it would've been big enough to hold a baby iguana but like i said its very small .wish i could show a pic"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just order 1 at a time and you have a better chance","review":"Ordered 3 of these 1 was perfect size, 1 was ok and the third looks like a dog bone. Just an undersized straight piece of wood barely 11 inches long and not even 3 inches wide. the weight barely 12 oz. You'd think the person packing them would have noticed the tag wasn't attached and that it was a very small piece compared to the others. Buyer beware - You'd think Amazon would be more concerned about doing business better...."},{"rating":"1","title":"No 2 pieces of wood are the same but....","review":"The piece I received was the mentioned length and width but was nothing more than that. A long flat piece of nice looking wood but of no real use in my aquarium without any spots for the fish to swim through or hide in. Cheers to Amazon for a full instant refund and free return shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst product. So many water changes, still make water very dark","review":"Worst product. Change the water color. I tried hot wash in dishwasher, changed water so many times. Still it is changing the water color. Don't know how long it will take to stop chaining water color.I wish I could give negative or not even 1 star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product does not match Picture Shown","review":"Received my item in today. It looked nothing like the one pictured. I expected receive a piece that was somewhat close to what was in the picture with branching limbs. Instead my piece was pretty flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"Not even close to what I wanted. Much much thicker than dimension state and shorter than dimension state. I have zero use for it because of this. Not worth returning though. Each piece is different so you're either lucky and get a good piece or not. I would recommend just going to the store and buying a piece. I should of listened to the other reviews, was just hoping I might get a usuable piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tannic and Slimy","review":"Bought a piece of Zoo Med Mopani wood at Petco and soaked it for 2 weeks per directions, the water seemed to be clear at that point, but after a week in our aquarium it was turning the tank water amber, and the wood had extensive white, slimy mold all over it. (Water was crystal clear before this). I will be throwing the Mopani out and getting a sculptured resin rock. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage!","review":"I was really excited to get some mopani wood for my fish tank. when it arrived it looked great and was the perfect size. after having it in the water for about two days i started noticing little things all over the sides of my tank. i dont know what they were but they kind of cracked when i smashed them, they had an exoskeleton. while i was killing some i noticed another unwanted creature. little WORMS! i probably killed five of them and i dont know how many are still in the tank or in the fish! I don't know what to do now! i hope my fish are okay. and it does turn the water really orange"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking and good quality product","review":"We bought this for our 50 gallon and its a beautiful piece of hard wood! That being said we did place ours into a big kettle of boiling water turn off the flame and let it steep till cool to remove some of the natural tannins..upon reflection we should have done this at least twice because it did indeed cause our water to have a slight tea colored tinge to it after a couple of weeks. A change of charcole and a %20 water change restored our crystal clear water again, however it is beginnning to look a little tea colored again but not nearly as much. I suspect it will be gone completely after the next change down the road. Placing the wood in the boiling water also has the benefit of sterilizing it as well! I do not regret buying this it is a very interesting addition to our tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-Burnt Root Ball","review":"Well, I was expecting a something a little more like the product photo. The wood that came looks like an 8\\" long by 6\\" diameter root-ball with the roots cut off. No cool branches or structure for my fish to play around. One half looks pretty cool, but the other looks like a piece of charcoal. Also, I had to boil the wood 7 times and soak it for 4 days with frequent water changes, and it still leached tannins.I would say, if your local pet store carries this wood, buy it there so at least you can see what it looks like. Ordering wood this way is a total crapshoot. I am going to keep the piece since it's cheap enough, but will not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Water Brown","review":"I soaked this wood for 60 days in a bucket, changing the water just about every day in an effort to make it suitable for aquarium use. It is still turning the water brown each day and I don't know if any amount of soaking will make it ready to put into an aquarium."},{"rating":"1","title":"all Mopani wood ! \\"definately Think Twice\\"","review":"ya, I thought this African wood would be a good idea: I bought four (4) Large pieces (Not For Aquariums)I went as far as demanding a Refund from Customer Service / Zoo Med Lab in California. \\"Didn't want to Hear about it !\\"All I got is song-and-dance. at the end of the conversation - I suggested that if it is sooooo easy to soak the wood (the\\"tannin\\" issue) \\"Why don't you, as a merchant, take care of it before you market it ?\\" again, didn't want to hear it.All that I will have is: \\"Real Expensive Fire wood\\" NOT for Aquariums."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a big stick","review":"Nothing like the picture. What I got is a stick about 10'' without any branch. I don't even want to bother change the product and be disappointed again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piece of wood for the money.","review":"I'll be the first to admit that my expectations weren't very high for this piece of mopani with such an affordable price, but when the piece arrived at my home I was truly blown away. The piece was about the same shape as the stock photo for the product. The only real difference was the limbs were a bit longer. Buyer beware that mopani produces a lot of tannin acid, but this can easily be controlled by treating the wood properly before introducing it to your aquarium. Plus tannin acid is actually good for fish and a known anti fungal. After introducing new wood to your aquarium don't be surprised to if you get a white fuzzy growth covering the wood, this I believe is a harmless bacteria that will resolve on its own within a few weeks and good aquarium maintenance. To wrap it all up if you looking for a good piece of wood for your aquarium this product will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big messy brawling genius of a book","review":"I happened to pick this up in the library -- I dont think anyone had taken it out for 20 years -- as I was embarking on a trip to Naples. Don't go to Italy south of Rome without reading this wonderful book and immersing yourself in the lives of these fabulous characters.

It takes a while and some practice to get it to levitate and even once you can get it to levitate it only works for maybe a minute before the magnet at the top snaps it up. The globe itself is a thin, cheap plastic. I'm really unimpressed by this item, especially since it is fairly expensive for a globe. If the globe itself wasn't so cheaply made I wouldn't mind that the \\"levitation\\" is sketchy and brief at best. I would recommend people pass on this on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"I was very disappointed at how cheap the globe is and looks. It's a neat idea, but doesn't look that nice. Don't leave it anywhere that is accessible to children. If you grab the globe just a little to strong, it will crack easily. I would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Piece of Music","review":"I got this CD for my birthday,having onlyheard the song 'It's alright,it's ok'.Youwill not like the CD from the first timeyou listen to it,cause this are not easysongs.

Definitely an Artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD!!","review":"I love this CD so much that when I lost my original copy, I just had to buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow plod","review":"This movie was tauted to be in the vain of Sex and The City. Well there was no sex and no city. In short this movie was a slow and boring plod. The only people worth watching are...Will Estes and Sara Rue. Of which there is not enough. The rest I suggest you fast forward over. At times this movie was cringe worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this pan, but the nonstick coating vanished","review":"This pan works just great for stir fries, especially on electric stoves. The classic wok doesn't work well on an electric element, and this pan is the right shape and size to make Chinese dishes.However, within a few months, the teflon coating had vanished. The reason seems to be the surface design, which has a series of concentric, raised ridges. The teflon comes off the top of the ridges, maybe because you bump the edges of each ridge as you stir. This happens even with nylon or wooden utensils. The theory behind the circular ridges is that the teflon will be protected in the \\"valleys\\" and food that lands in them will release. Unfortunately, this theory didn't take into account the fact that nonstick coatings will flake, especially on an edge.A popular cooking magazine that rates cookware confirmed my observations that the coating on this brand is not durable. Too bad, because otherwise, this is a well-designed stir fry pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Kitchen Item!!","review":"I have had this pan for several months, my chinese fiance's mother also uses this and I have also bought one for my father recently as this is an indispensible item in the kitchen. I have tried many other non stick products and all tainted after the first few uses, however this pan barely needs washing. Most things will wipe off with tissue, the non stick is simply that good.Brilliant for tricky items such as egg fried rice and also low fat stir fries, the non stick coating is very durable as long as the pan is treated with reasonale care. Maybe those who found that the non stick dimished were using the pan over heat that was too high. Furthermore I have used this pan on both electrical and gas and both worked find.I would recommend this pan to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Circulon is the BEST!","review":"I have several other pieces of Circulon cookware, (2 quart sauce pot/pan) 12\\" skillet, 11\\" skillet, and now the \\"Stir Fry Pan\\" (Wok). Once again it is the best cookware I've used and I've tried many brands of cookware, many big names attached and Circulon is simply the best. The ultimatre test (and this wasn't in the Wok, but in my 2-quart pan) was horrendously burnt rice (I've lost 3 other pans with burnt rice) and it peeled right out and I'm still using that pan 5 years (and several other disasters) later. I finally decided to get this wok on sale because, despite owning a beautifully made, traditional wok, I wouldn't use it often enough to keep it well seasoned so I would have to scrub it and start again. Circulon non-stick cookware is the best non-stick cookware I've ever used and I highly recommend it. Especially on sale. It's worth the money at full price, so a sale is way too good to pass up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"works great at first, but then...","review":"We received this wok as a wedding present about seven years ago and I must say that at first I was delighted. The wok conducts heat very well, it is a very useful size and the ridges inside helped hold cooked food up on the pans sides while you did other things in the hot well at the bottom. However those ridges turned out to be the pans downfall. Most asian recipes call for very high heat which can carbonize food on the pan. And once this happens you cant get the carbon out of the ridges no matter what you do. Presently, you will find big carbon flakes in your finished dishes (what is that - pepper? my husband asked). Brushes, scrubbers, even wooden skewers used point first couldn't clean the problem. I bought a replacement pan with a smooth surface - problem solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky Stir Fry","review":"I agree with the ratings given by the enthusiast from Oak Ridge. Within a month of use, foods started to stick to the pan. Stir frying doesn't work in a sticky pan! Plus, with the ridges, it's a chore to clean. And this is a non-stick. I gave up using it for stir fry, but that's why I got it in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I got one for xmas and use it for thai dishes. I had a metal wok before that was a nightmare to clean and rusted if you didn't clean it right away. However this one is perfect. The food just slides off. I use wooden/plastic tools so as not to damage the surface and I don't go above medium heat. I have one other circulon pot and these 2 are my favorite cookware by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for a short time","review":"Mine worked for a year, then the bottom non-stick surface started to peel off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best nonstick stirfry pan","review":"When we moved into our first house, I purchased this pan as a new home gift to myself. At that time I was doubtful that the nonstick would be as great as they say. Very soon I was cooking all kinds of Chinese cooking, stirfry, eggs and ham for breakfast, I even use it with my bamboo steamers! Finally after 12 years of faithful service, it's starting to look a little tired and worn. I'm ready now to buy the 14\\" wok with lid! For Chinese cooking, other than a carbon steel wok, this is the best nonstick wok I've found."},{"rating":"1","title":"never again","review":"I had a larger circulon wok and used it almost everyday for about 6 months before the nonstick coating started to peel away. Once that coating gets a little scratch in it then it seems to gradually unravel. After about a year I threw it away. If you are tough on your cookware, as I am, then this is definitely not the choice for you. Another friend of mine also had the same experience and returned her circulon cookware to the store-and she tried to pamper her cookware. Plus I can't stand those ridges, the sauce and little bits of food get stuck in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the hassle","review":"Probably the first 9mo to 1yr, the pan works great. However, after a while, stuff starts to get into the ridges and the non-stick surface starts to flake off. This is going to the donation pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am glad I did not write a review earlier","review":"At first I was very pleased with my new Circulon Classic . But after 5 month of usage it started sticking. One year later it is totally worthless. Everything is sticking to it. I noticed today that they have lowered the price. For somebody who uses this skillet only sparingly it is good enough but for somebody who is planning on using it on a daily bases - Keep looking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read the other reviews and, after buying this book, was deeply disappointed. It reads more like a history book and is difficult to follow. It is jumpy and not smooth in the books flow. Without knowing the area, the canyons and ridges all run together but the book is written as if everyone reading it has intimate knowledge of the area. It was also hard to keep up with all the people because, once again, the book jumps around so much.Nothing about this book flowed at all and the stories were disjointed. All in all, I was extremely disappointed with this book and would not recommend it to anyone looking for an easy reading, smooth flowing narrative of this outlaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is BACK in print!","review":"...Sunn Amps and Smashed Guitars live is back in print after several years of being unavailable.

Best book for parenting besides the bible!","review":"I have EVERY parenting book under the sun, and didn't plan on buying this one until I stumbled over it in a quaint Park City, Utah bookshop. This is the only great BIBLICALLY based book I have ever seen to guide Christian ( and all) parents in raising children WELL with out spanking ( there is scripture to back it up gals). I wish every pastor, and every family could own this book and read it- it works, and it is based on solid biblical teaching without the issues of corporal punishment.

A great book for a resource center or individuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre biography containing little info not in other works","review":"This book has a rather cheap and tacky format, with few pictures, and those not the ones likely to appeal to fans. Some of the text is rather snide, in a subtle way, and there is little acknowledgement of the depths of Brad Pitt's character. It would be hard to guess from this book that here we have an actor who is intelligent, subtle and talented. It is also out of date, ending with Seven, and still has him with Gwyneth Paltrow. A better buy is \\"Brad Pitt - the rise to Stardom\\", which at least has a good range of pictures, although it is also rather out of date now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably works great but had no clue how to use it","review":"Im sure this product probably works great but they need to have better instructions on how to use it. The Lisle Coil website claims to have a video of how to work the tester, but when you click on the link it directs you to a whole nother website that has nothing to do with the tester or even the Lisle company. Don't buy this product unless you understand the directions on the box. I paid about 45 dollars for this when I could have just bought a whole new engine coil for my car for about 20 dollars more, which I did a few weeks later...Huge mistake that was! I should return this 45 dollar product that I'll probably never use, but I'll probaly just hoard it like I do with the rest of my tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"probador de bobinas basico","review":"Este probador de bobinas de fabricacion poco ortodoxa, que mas bien parece fabricacion casera,(bueno el producto mismo dice \\"PATENTE PENDIENTE\\"). es bueno, incluso para un tecnico profesional debido a que en el mercado de las herramientas electronicas no existe producto que sea capaz de exitar las bobinas para saber si estan buenas. Y los equipos que existen son muy costosos y solo los tienen los grandes talleres. En cuanto al chispometro que viene con el probador, que es de la marca LISLE, prefiero el THEXTON 404 que trae un tubo transparente que sirve de acustico para escuchar la chispa.

My Amazon purchase of it was a gift for my daughter, and no doubt due to a yearning for a long ago, not- so- long ago time when women could pot geraniums or win Pulitzer prizes, but were in no way compelled to do either. This author did both, splendidly. As far as political correctness goes, this book is off the map. If you are an angry (aren't they usually?) so- called \\"feminist,\\" you will want to bomb my house for this review.

I emailed him to congratulate him on producing this excellent window into our near future, proclaiming to him that he was, in a Vedic sense, in touch with achashic records (aware of future evnets).

A++++ for this necessary study!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Long Rant","review":"\\"The Long Emergency\\" is long on hyperbole and short on references. You will not find a lot of intellectual heavy lifting here, but lots of apocalyptic ranting and raving by the author. The central tenet of the book is summed up nicely in a Scientific American article from March of 1998 (available on the internet) titled \\"The End of Cheap Oil\\" by Colin J. Campbell and Jean H. Laherrere. This article is thirteen pages and will spare the reader a couple hundred extra pages of pessimistic conjecture and antisocial harangues. Colin Campbell and Jean Laherrere are former oil exploration geologists turned consultants who, applying theorems of M. King Hubbert to world oil reserves, conclude that world oil production will peak soon and then slowly decline. I suggest cutting to the chase and skipping \\"The Long Emergency\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was expecting a thoughtful assessment of the challenges that lie ahead. What I got was the musings of a bitter old man who seems to hate everything about contemporary American society and is cheering for its imminent demise.I knew the book wasn't going to be cheery or optimistic, but this was way too depressing. I don't need this kind of nay-saying pessimisim in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard that already...","review":"I thought that this book was a little boring because it just rehashed material that I have heard before: localizing the market, how the government must gain the public's trust, etc. I was looking for a book that supplied interesting facts and statistics about our current situation and I didn't find it here. The way the book was worded and the complicated vocabulary just didn't excite me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"I was very excited for this book, but I honestly couldn't make it past the first chapter. I think the worst claim was when he siad that it a ruling elite could unleash a deadly virus on the world for which only they had the vaccines. I consider myself an environmentalist and know that global warming is an emergency that needs to be addressed, but from what I have read, this book does not compare to other books like \\"Plan B\\" by Lester Brown or \\"A Green History of the World\\" by Clive Ponting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Alarmist Nonsense","review":"This book is just full of alarmist nonsense. Don't bother with this book unless you enjoy feeling despondent and depressed. Kunstler is \\"the pessimist's pessimist\\".

The 3 myths are: global warming; peak oil; and 9/11.To understand why global warming isn't real read the scientific appendix to Michael Crichton M.D.'s \\"State of Fear\\".To understand why peak oil isn't real read \\"The Deep Hot Biosphere\\" and ask yourself how much $ oil companies have made by touting the spectre of peak oil.To understand how 9/11 was a domestic intelligence operation and not islamic terrorism look at \\"[...]\\" on the internet (or dozens of other sites). Are you any safer now that we have a Homeland Security State or just more powerless?As in Watergate the question to ask is Qui Bono- who profits?"},{"rating":"2","title":"History, Erudition, Perspective, and Caution -- A Good Read","review":"This author highlights important current issues (not just the squandering of our financial and natural resources) in the context of world history, explaing how we got to where we are; however, the author seems so determined to convince the reader that the sky is falling (and he may be right), that he exhibits occasional bias (in this reader's opinion) against some possible alternatives that might in fact give the human race a better chance. Maybe, I am simply too hopeful, and the author has a better understanding of human nature, world politics, and our technological limitations. Even so, this erudite and sobering book deserves careful reading and urgent public debate. Finally, please don't allow the author's several instances of incorrect use of mathematical ratios to distract you from his overall message."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am watching the news much differently now.","review":"Just finished Kunstler's book, \\"The Long emergency\\".This book opened my eyes to a lot of things. I don't necessarily believe all of his conclusions but he makes a good argument for each one and I do think that the outlook for this country is indeed grim. The idea is not that we will run out of oil, but that we will run out of CHEAP oil.The interesting thing about peak oil is that nobody wants to talk about it. I bring up the subject with family and friends and they just glaze over and look around. This just confirms the fact that this country will do nothing about the inevitable energy crisis. The American populace will keep buying Hummers and houses in the burbs until gas prices shoot through the roof and then whomever is president will get the blame. By then it will be way too late.Read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sky is Falling!","review":"Future? Bleak. Like a Mad Max movie. Oil? Mostly gone. Nuclear power?

Kunstler brings very little to the table that has not been said before. Rich Heinberg's books on Peak Oil and beyond are infinitely better in both content and scope. Kunstler ends his book with an outright racist \\"analysis\\" that belongs in the 1700s. He displays a pathetic view of race relations in the US, marked by ignorance, elitism, and prejudice (his own).I suggest he, and anyone else who buys into his view, read \\"Uprooting Racism\\" by Paul Kivel.Those interested in what urban, grassroots organizations are doing to prepare for \\"The Long Emergency\\" should check out these organizations:People's Grocery peoplesgrocery.org(...)peace,ryan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spouts governmental propaganda from the beginning...","review":"In the first chapter of Kunstler's book, he writes:\\"Our war against militant Islamic fundamentalism is only one elementamong an array of events already under way that will alter our relations withthe rest of the world, and compel us to live differently at home--sooner ratherthan later--whether we like it or not\\".So, here is a guy who wants to inform us all about reality yet totally unaware that the \\"war against militant Islamic fundamentalism\\" was a manipulative and false premise. Kunstler need to read more and write less."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Better Book for the Peak Oil Beginner","review":"I read this book and Powerdown today, and The Long Emergency was both better researched and better presented. This is a decent book for those just now hearing of Peak Oil and wanting to read a smart yet pessamistic view of the future of humanity.I did not agree with all of the author's opinion, but he at least does a decent job of arguing most of his positions. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"one scary book","review":"This book is packed full of things I have never thought about before - and looking back, it's hard to believe we all don't know these things. This book will scare you. It's completely changed the way the world looks to me when I simply drive down the street.When I first saw the book, I thought the cover was a bit hysterical-sounding, but worth a look. Once I starting reading, I could not stop. I wouldn't call the information within it hysterical at all. It's very well thought out, deeply researched, and literate in a way that's become too rare.This book is an x-ray view of modern civilization. What is seen is hard to believe, but when you think about it, all too possible. Read this, get your friends to read it. We all need to consider these things."},{"rating":"2","title":"good reference book","review":"i liked the book. It had alot of history written in it, like from the 1980-2010, so if there was any energy related news you missed, it was all in this book. It was very informational, easy reading style, i breezed right though it. However, i thought the writer was a little bit pessimistic. the authors thinks the United state will regress to the technology of the 1930's, with no electric and no automobiles. I don't see it that way, i feel that with all our scientists we will be able to have electricity in our homes/business and factories.... What i don't see is any autos/tractors. We might just have to go back to horses for everyday transportation. And use horses on the farm to pull plows. And trains will still be around, perhaps more of them, but with tiny nuclear fuel plants to heat up their steam engines.this book is worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Long Emergency","review":"Excellent book that is up to date with information which I found very helpful in assessing the current energy situation and the worrisome future of energy as we know it. Author has excellent credentials with a history of energy savey, a sobering look at what some may see as \\"the sky is falling\\" while others may realize that we are indeed a society of \\"sleepwalkers\\" when it comes to our energy future. Buy it, read it, and pass it along to your friends.

I think his view is a bit extreme, however I think that the average American has NO idea how dependent we are on petroleum and how close we are to the edge. It should be required reading for every American, and every politician. I don't necessarily think things will be as bad as Kunstler writes but it does make you think and maybe will help you to be prepared.Personally I found it easy to read and full of facts. It has started me on my own fact finding mission to prove or disprove what he writes about. Time to wake up and prepare!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Long Emergency","review":"Kunstler starts off with some interesting concepts and speculation on energy consumption and the \\"end of oil\\". He also raises some good questions but never really gets to any solid answers.His apocolyptic conclusions dismiss out of hand alternative technologies and his assumptions seemed to be based on his own opinion with little hard data to back them up.He speaks of \\"going back to the land\\" and in his own case he seems to have acted on it. Kunstler has already checked out of the human race and I'm not sure any of us should follow him based on this book.Just my 2cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Me","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer. It's not that I don't think all of this is going to happen. I have purchased numerous books on this subject for years - survival, planning for catastrophes, etc. (for many years - you should see my basement). However, I did not find this book helpful, and did not like the tone with which it was written. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling Lack of Intellectual Rigor","review":"This author makes a presentation of problems which have evolved in the American landscape since early colonial development, citing obvious examples of bad buildings and making absurdly unsuitable comparisons, and with no regard for data about the realities of infrastructure or the complexities of such a vast nation... and to make a case for what? There is nothing here. Anyone seriously interested in these topics should be looking for writers with some background, such as Robert Venturi or J. B. Jackson. Mr. Kuntsler should stick to children's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINITELY FICTION","review":"Publishers weekly says: \\"\\"Kunstler's name is mostly associated with nonfiction works like The Long Emergency, a bleak prediction of what will happen when oil production no longer meets demand ---- the world economy will collapse and society as we know it will cease.\\"\\"This book however is nothing but the author's sick and profoundly pessimistic view of a possible future that he longs for, definitly fiction, possibly good fiction but not based on anything real. Environmentalist doomsayers are welcome to write their dreams of catastrophy as works of fiction but please don't try to pass them off as non-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"What comes after?","review":"There are many writers predicting a variety of calamities, Kunstler is one of the few to speculate about what comes later. I don't think he is far off the mark on a lot of things. I think his predictions could be right with a far less disruptive loss of the oil commodity-- whether a real or artifically created scarcity. I don't think this country has the infrastructure in most large cities that it once had to be able to absorb such shocks. When is the last time you even heard a civil defense drill?One other thing Kunstler's book gives you is some ideas and food for thought on what you can do to prepare your family for this not-to-unforseeable series of events.I'm looking forward to hearing him on the Art Bell show tonight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best peak oil book out there!","review":"I have read all the peak oil books out there and can say that this is the best of the bunch. It covers the likely consequences of peak oil like no other book out there. James Howard Kunstler writes in an authorative manner and comes across as a realist who comprehends the huge changes that are almost upon us. One of the best books I have read! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gutsy","review":"Lately, I've been dependent upon libraries for my reads. Which makes the things I read a tad behind the times. Information can get dated quickly. However, Kunstler was ahead of his time in writing this.What particularly got my attention was his discussion of the housing bubble (which he wrote about in 2004). He accurately predicted what happened in 2007-2008. His chapter on the history of oil was also quite instructive.What he didn't see was the momentary increase in oil production from North Dakota and the possible resurgence of natural gas from the practice of \\"fracking\\". What he gets right is that the cheap oil and gas are mostly gone. We are indeed in The Long Emergency.This is a gutsy book. Worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long, rambling discourse focusing on the worst possible outcome....","review":"I bought this book so that I could relate to a friend who is using it like his bible and guide for his future. I found it to be poorly organized and a long and rambling discourse on the evils and eventual failure of fossil fuels, nuclear energy, the food supply, and an eventual return to living in the stone age in our lifetimes.

Other than that, as others have said, you will basically get the opinions of the author presented as facts in a way that seeks to belittle anyone who does not share the same view.His disregard for alternative energy is laughable. His borderline hate for all people that are not like him is very evident. He not only believes that doom and gloom are the future but it is very evident that he wants this fate for the US.Overall, read this book with a grain of salt and there are probably much better discussions on Peak oil out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better books available","review":"I've read several books on peak oil. This is not the most erudite book on the subject. The author is rambling in his approach to the subject matter, long on personal commentary, and even veers into a diatribe of Zionist views.I can barely say that I learned anything new from this book, and I can guarantee you that you'll spend your money better if you buy some of the other books available on the subject, at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST \\"survival\\" book ever!!!

I have many good \\"survival\\" and self-sufficiency books- this is promoted as one, but is not. Written by a life-long New York City resident, it is totally prejudiced against anyone from the South or White, and filled with the \\"Liberal Guilt\\" of the typical white north urban residents.

It's the only marketing book I have read through without skipping back and forth (probably missing things) and I think that's due to Andresen's personable and intuitive writing style. Things start clicking as the chapters progress....before you know it, you are thinking like this book is written, like it's natural to be so creative, effective and smart.If you have any function in NPOs...volunteer, CEO, manager,...buy this book. You will not be disappointed by how you feel and think after reading it. It's a great help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lights on but nobody home","review":"The title sounds interesting but the content is contrived, less than useful, and very poorly presented.

It arrived just on time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Star Trek in Blu-ray","review":"As a longtime Trekkie, I hate to write anything negative about it. However, my comments are directed only at the quality of the Blu-ray reproduction. Most of the bright, indoor scenes are crisp and clear as you would expect on Blu-ray. On the other hand, some of the darker special effects shots look like you're viewing them through a screen door. The lights and stars are not steady, but tend to flicker. This problem does not exist on every episode with every special effects shot, but it should not exist at all. I've noticed this on some other Blu-rays I've purchased in the past so it's not uncommon. Whatever the cause, I suspect it has something to do with the manufacturer going for quantity over quality. If you have a standard DVD set with the enhanced special effects, don't bother with Blu-ray. There's very little to be gained for the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!!","review":"i have to say that I wound up opening only the 'Season One' volume of the set I received. In this volume, both sides of the disc are playable - regular DVD and DVD-HD, even though the latter is now obsolete. Unfortunately for me the very first disc of vol 1 had the regular version on top and there was a HUGE GASH - not 'scratch', 'GASH' - on it. I didn't even bother to remove it, or open the others. Paramount's quality control on this must have consisted of that gorilla we used to see in that ad tossing the American Tourister luggage around.There are MANY other warnings about quality control within the other negative reviews included here, but I ignored them 'cause the price was temporarily lowered to just over $100.00, and figured I'd take a chance. OOOPS!

The quality is below standard and is not worth the price. Stop's and starts, skips , lip sync out, angle on off with pauses.

They stick out like a sore thumb and completely destroy any enjoyment of the episodes. They are simply there to pander to the lowest common denominator: the undereducated viewer who simply CANNOT appreciate the value of something 40 years old on its' own terms. Its another depressing indication of how dumbed down things are today. Grown-ups should definitely leave them on the shelf. Granted, the technical quality of the remastered sixties footage is amazing - shame they couldn't leave the pointless, intrusive, horrible CGI rubbish off it.Star Trek is no longer in the hands of those who treasure it - just cynical corporate b*st*rds who only treasure taking money off people who don't know any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"All hail TOS","review":"Classic Trek done up all pretty and telling the stories Roddenberry strove to tell!

I am using a Sharp Blu Ray player. It may be related to the type of player, or not, I am not sure. I would like to be able to play these discs, but I do not know how.

But on the blu ray set you get both the original and the remastered versions. not only this but they are both in full HD. so whats the point in complaining about the remastered when you dont have to watch it anyways.This is a great set it has 20 discs total.season 1: 7 discsseason 2: 7 discsseason 3: 6 discsIt has all 79 episodes in the original and remastered editions fully restored in HD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent restoration!","review":"Received this item today (ordered it yesterday... thanks Amazon Prime!) and it is quite amazing!

Great value at the current price of about $170"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Star Trek but don't love the Blu Ray version","review":"I gave 4 stars because Star Trek is the best and the idea of the new FX into the old footage is inspired. But the Blu Ray conversion on these episodes isn't that great. Neither are the new FX. They could have done so much with this production idea but all they did was generate new looking ships with no detail.The ships have such little detail in fact that they look like prototypes or work in progress ships. These FX are far inferior to the old movie's because in the movie's the ships had detail. The new FX are better than the old TV show FX but it's obvious that these guys at paramount got lazy.Star Trek is one of the most inventive of all time. Paramount pictures are just lazy money grubbers who want to keep re-packaging these old episodes with no added value. 5 stars for Star Trek. 2 stars for the Blu Rays."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"The blu-ray cut of this series is NOT up to standards.

So, it is equivalent to $27.5 for the normal 1/2 hour shows. Not that expensive, but could be reduced by at least 30%.I liked the original series of Startrek because the special effects were simpler, almost amateurish. The acting didn't look that serious.

I have always been a fan - well since the age of 2 when I was old enough to sit up and watch, refusing to go to bed until I'd seen the new episode - and having this series come to life again in blu-ray format is awesome!

While the remastered space scenes are better than what was in the original series, I find the rest of the scenes to be very dark and grainy, verging on being blurry. The video details on my old disks were much better, brighter, and made one feel like we were almost on the set with the actors. These remastered disks make me feel like I'm watching the episodes on an old black and white TV from the 50s, with fuzzy reception. Plus it is really annoying that the disks aren't labeled.

It had so much potential but ultimately falls really short. Everything about it is somewhat decent. But the glaring stupidity of the plot really gets to you.For gorehounds out there - stay away.

Of course, I have the same problem with brightness that every one else does, but I always try to use extremely contrasting colors and HUGE TEXT, so my slides are still surprisingly readable, so long as the ceiling lights closest to the screen are switched off.I did stumble upon an unusual use for this gadget: It's a handy way to check for proper VGA output on notebooks booting Ubuntu Linux (or whatever my alternate-OS-of-the-month happens to be) off a Live-CD before purchasing. Whipping out the PP + battery + VGA cable sure beats hunting for a spare LCD monitor + extra AC socket at the shops. The raised eyebrows, turned heads and curious questions don't hurt either.I also connect this to an old VGA TV tuner and a pair of cheap PC speakers for a poor man's bedroom home theater system, which is good enough for at least the nightly news with the lights out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I was interested in this product at its debut but i wanted to wait for comments and ratings for this product before i purchased it.

It is so dim that the picture is unacceptable everywhere but in a VERY dark room within 4 feet of a highly reflective screen.

But, I tried to use it in class today, and it was not bright enough for anyone to read what was on the screen. It's fine in very low light, but in low to medium light, it's useless. I'm debating whether or not to return it.On the plus side, it is very small and easy to transport. And, it's very cute. But just not practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as expected","review":"Although this is a very nice, compact projector, the lumens are just not what I had expected from a projector with an original price tag of $799. If I could find another one of the same size with 2000 lumens I would be very happy but this one seems to be the smallest on the market.

Williams shows concretely how to organize small sections of writing and how to use words effectively.I was rather surprised at the distaste the previous reviewer had for this volume. I wasn't swept away by Williams' own writing, but I didn't expect a writing manual to be a work of literature. Perhaps writers all become partisans of their own favorites guides. I've never posted a review before, but I am so enthusiastic about this book that I couldn't allow such a negative view to give the first impression. (I have copies everywhere I do any writing.)It is a shame that a sample isn't available through amazon yet, because one or two lessons would convince any shopper of the book's utility or irrelevance.

I bought it and when I went through it, I found out that I wasn't far off from the techniques I was using, trying and helped me with aspects I wans't sure about.This book is really good for beginning belly dancers who are wanting to make their own costumes.

All four stars are simply for the two songs on the album which absolutly blew me away, \\"Ever Fallen In Love\\" and \\"Moving Away from the Pulse Beat\\" these quite simply rank as two of the best songs ever and not just from the punk genre. The guitar and drum solos in \\"Moving away from the pulse beat\\" are simply legendary and the lyrics in \\"Ever fallen in Love\\" are some of the best in any love songs. Credit must be given to other songs like \\"Lipstick\\", \\"Sixteen Again\\" and \\"Late For the Train\\" which in their own right are good but are simply over shadowed by the brilliance that accompany them on the album.I would also recomend The Jam to any who find the Buzzcocks enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value, Beautiful Chain","review":"The chain is well made.

The novel revolves around 3 familys The Trees, Macphees and The Arbuckles. Spit Macphee lives with his grandfather Fyfe on the river in a small shack. The two live strange and interesting lives until Mrs Arbuckle changes them completely. About half way through the book Fyfe dies and Spit has to live with the Arbuckles. Spit hates this arrangement and runs away to Pental island. Mrs Tree decides that this is no life for a 11 year old boy and adopts him. Spit has always liked the Tree family so he is very pleased with his new life. I found the book intrigueing in parts but boring and pointless in others. My favourite section in the novel has to be court case because it explains why Fyfe acts like a nut case through out the novel. I recommend this book to anyone over 12 years of age."},{"rating":"1","title":"The True Story Of Spit Mac Phee","review":"The True Story Of Spit MacPhee by James Aldridge is based on a young boy named Spit who is brought up by a series of different people during his adololesance. This novel appeales to the older and younger generations in different ways. The way in which Spit deals with the contraversial religious attitude thrown towards him is a true inspiration.Although this novel had an interesting plot, it did not appeal to me. Of course i am speaking from a younger persons perspective and i think a major factor to my opinion is the time and scene in which the novel is set. The novel was an easy read although because of the time in which the book was set, the language made the book less interesting and even a little boring. There was a lack of true excitement and adventure and because of this, the novel wasn't a satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who adopts the child?","review":"This book has an ok storyline.

It's a look at sports from another angle...one that even I could relate to. Who'd have thought a book by a lawyer about sports could be so interesting, amusing, and memorable!

In the previous volume GTO helped one of his students named Noboru Yoshikawa take revenge on a trio of girls who abused and humiliated him. One of the girls told her influential mom about what he did and she is out for his blood. After that crisis Gto continues to try to win over the hearts and minds of Class 4, especially the constant hostility of its ringleader, Kunio Murai. It doesn't help that he has a thing for Kunio's young and beautiful mother. The thing about Gto that makes it funny is that he considers himself a pervert but he's nothing compared to the principal who longs for his own daughter or the track coach who is just there to check out girl's legs. Put into the mileiu of what he THINKS he is, Gto finds out that his lust is replaced by caring for his students. Another volume in a very entertaining series."},{"rating":"2","title":"brother's fav","review":"My brother seems to like this series, I don't really get it but it does have an interesting story.

Last night, the figure fell off the bed (ON TO CARPET) and his head broke off. I couldn't believe it. Fell a few feet (wasn't thrown)on to carpet and now it's broken. There's a loose piece of plastic inside his body that rattles now which obviously held the held in place. I cannot believe this product is so cheaply made. Could you imagine if it was dropped on a hard floor by accident or something else? Dark Horse describes this toy as \\"high-quality roto-cast vinyl figures,\\" but I'm sorry, it's not. It seems to be cheaply made and my son is VERY sad it broke so quickly. I wrote the company, because maybe I have a faulty one, but I can't see how this thing could have broken so fast when my son is very careful with his toys. Needless to say, he's heartbroken.

Which turns out is a good thing because I would have been disappointed if I paid for it. Sure Frank Quitely's art is very good and the character designs are really well done. To me though if the story isn't interesting or it doesn't make sense then the good art is a bit of a waste. The story really feels like an ode to where stories come from and a love of comic books.

Can Flex save the world before the man who dreamed him alive dies of a drug overdose?My pre-teen sons are eyeing this book, asking about it, wanting to read it. Comic books appeal to kids.

This is a wonderful folm shot on location with many reenactors and brilliant acting, a fair depiction of both sides and real poetry in the language.Gettysburg covers the three day battle that is seen as deciding the war and concentrates on Robert E.

It has more than enough pistol magazine pouches; I think three on the main vest and two more on the web belt. There is a map pouch as well, great for storing scenario-based items, and a pistol holster, which I am surprised to say accomodated even my biggest airsoft pistol. The web belt is removeable for greater mobility, and on the back are straps that accomodate more pouches, which I believe is called the MOLLE system. The entire vest is fairly easily adjustable, and I am glad to say it fit me (I am a very lean person).

I thought I'd branch out & try a board book but I was a little disappointed. She is not terribly interested in them...I wish the pictures were different, i.e., more photographs and fewer drawings. It's not always clear from the picture what the sign is. For instance, the page for \\"baby\\" features a drawing of a carriage, and a photograph of Rachel signing \\"baby,\\" but no pictures of an actual baby. The page for \\"ball\\" has a sort of octagon drawing that's not as clear as plain round ball or a beach ball with bright colors would be.

In this case, he has strung together useless platitudes based on what he understands from manufacturers' literature, which isn't much. He can't give any \\"real answers,\\" as the book cover claims.

This season introduced us to Ensign Pavel Andreivich Chekhov, the Russian navigator aboard the ship with the Davy Jones wig in the first 5 or 6 episodes of this season. Chekhov is one of my favorite characters of the show and is always talking about how great Russia is...and I agree with him because he is one hip dude.

The episodes were at a consistently high level with both the scripts and the acting at their best. The scripts were thought provoking, including some written by Gene Roddenberry himself. Humorous scripts (\\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\")were blended nicely with dark themes such as the Jack the Ripper derived episode \\"Wolf in the Fold.\\" The interplay between Kirk, McCoy and Spock was at its height.

This comes from a reliable source-my husband who is not only a professional costumer, but worked on Next Gen, and has been asked over the years to authenticate quite a few original costumes from the TOS era.

This application allows you to use your iPhone or iPod Touch as a remote control for the movie. Another cool feature of Mobile-Blu is the tab called Content To Go. This allows you to transfer the special features video and exclusive interview video directly to your iPhone or iPod Touch. The special features video is then stored on your phone for you to watch whenever you want without needing the Blu-ray discs. I didn't have time to watch all of the special features over the weekend, so I transferred them to my iPhone to watch on the way to work.So, on top of the quality of this box set I feel that Mobile-Blu really adds a few very cool new features never seen before in Blu-ray.

I was reluctant to get one of these sets when they first came out, figuring it was just repackaging to get you to buy a product you've already seen a thousand times but I saw a few of these on AFTV while overseas and was really impressed. The color is much sharper than I recall and the use of digital special effects almost makes this an entirely new product... now when Spock looks at something in that viewer of his you don't have to take his word for it! Some of the effects are very subtle (such as planets being shown with atmospherics and texture, or computer screens with more realistic information) and others involve space scenes with other spacecraft never seen when the show was originally created.This one includes \\"I, Mudd\\" (arguably one of the funniest episodes), \\"The Ultimate Computer\\" (which has the Enterprise in a great space battle scene), and \\"Mirror, Mirror,\\" one of the best episodes of the series.

I would highly suggest that you buy all the seasons remastered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great second season/remastering!","review":"A great second season (I like all 3), but this may very well be the best, and the remastered shots/audio look great (as with all 3 seasons), the stains, cuts, and so forth has all been cleaned up, and I can compare, I have 38 of the episodes on VHS that Paramount released back in the 80s.Now, the first season is in HD/DVD format, this season is not, nor is season 3, but oh well, I just love that I can watch any episode, any time I want, and that's what it's all about!Standout episodes...all are great to me, but these are the best to me.Mirror, MirrorPatterns of ForceA Piece of the ActionBread and CircusesThe Gamesters of TriskelionObsessionThe Deadly Years.Great season, great remastering job, if you are a Trek fan, I do not think you will be dissapointed, if you are a purist, you may be, but I am not.Thanks Paramount/CBS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice compilation, but heavily modified","review":"This is a good compilation of these episodes at a good price, but if your a purist you probably won't enjoy how heavily they have updated the special effects.

You know they will release this in Blu-ray, it's just a question of when, and it will be sooner than later.Although I like the new effects (as a die-hard fan since about '70) and have enjoyed the quality of the remastered live-action footage, it's not enough to make me buy another standard-def second season just for them.My one-star rating is based on five stars for the series, minus four stars for not being on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy collectors case for star trek season one","review":"i was excited to get my star trek original series season one . until i opened it and saw what a lousy and cheaply constructed collectors case. the dvds are stacked on top of each other in separate disc holders . which i almost broke one dvd trying to remove one from the holder which is hard to remove . i expected at least separate casing for better storage of my dvds. like the honeymooners individual casing for each dvd disc which is perfect. hey mr case inventor next put the dvds in a paper bag .cause it's not much different from the crap star trek casing u came up with. yours truly very dissapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"TAKE A PASS UNTIL A BLU-RAY COMES ALONG!!","review":"There should have been a Blju-Ray of this is the studio had any respect for the fans, who hugely overpaid for the fiasco first season on HD-DVD.

WHY? As combos they still could play on either player? Not only will i not get this standard def set. at a ridiculous $63 i wont be buying in on Blu Ray either even though i have a player. The HD Version had picture in picture commentary on a few episodes along with a host of other features and whenever and HD is loaded with features if you check the Blu Ray versions its almost always just the movie or a cut down version of special features, why?? i thought blu ray held more and was better?

The imaginative stories, inspired writing, and wonderful characters of the original series finally have the backdrops and special effects they deserve. While some of the acting is dated, the new fx put these inspirational stories near the top of any sci-fi fans list. I was stunned seeing some of the old episodes \\"re-envisioned\\" - very well done!

They didn't go overboard with it and did a remarkably tasteful job. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is the trailers were not remastered. This still is my favorite show of all time. I've been watching Star Trek since about 1976, and it never gets old. It's amazing how the stories have held up this long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Star Trek- second season","review":"Excellent! Exactly what I was looking for, and in great shape! Thanx so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Improving on perfection","review":"As a fan of the original Star Trek since it first aired, I've always been honest enough with myself to admit that the effects back then were not the greatest. Also, given the fact that Gene Roddenberry had only a shoestring budget, he could never quite realize his dream to perfection. In spite of that, the stories always carried Star Trek where no science fiction story had gone before. These new remastered episodes go back and neatly bring the look of the show into the 21st Century of television effects. I still have my DVD's of the shows as originally aired, but having this is a nice supplement to any Star Trek collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of this Bride","review":"William Schoell is a mid-level horror writer who produced a number of decent King-esque novels back in the 1980s, of which \\"Bride of Satan\\" is one of the better ones.

Of course i had heard of Rob Zombie before, but i decided to go and buy Astro Creep 2000. I was amazed at how good it was. A couple days later i went and bought \\"La Sexercisto\\" and again was blown away. The guitar riff from \\"ThunderKiss 65\\" made me almost [...] myself. Rob's voice goes right with the guitars, and sounds great. The drumming is fast, and the bass is very clear and well heard. Most of the songs on this album are very good and talented.A friend of mine had both of Rob Zombie's solo stuff, so i decided to compare the cd's. I found that Rob Zombie's stuff with White Zombie was much more talented, even though i really enjoyed both The Sinister Urge and Hellbilly Deluxe. I recommend buying both of Rob's solo albums first so youre are not disappointed in te talent drop."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Zombie's 1991 Debut","review":"White Zombie carves out a unique identity for itself in the grunge/thrash genre with this one. The prerequisite loud guitars and shouting vocalist are here, but this album shows an obsession with '60s trash culture, particularly fast cars and grade-B horror movies. The subject matter of Rob Zombie's lyrics, along with frequent movie samples, help this group stand out from their more generic, disaffected brethren."},{"rating":"1","title":"please be gentle","review":"I really enjoy the songs welcome to planet motherfu@#er, thunder kiss '65, black sunshine and soul crusher. The rest of the songs are \\"filler\\" they are boring and after soul crusher I turn the cd off. You also have to turn up the volume pretty loud because of bad production values. I do think that this cd will appeal to people who like thrash so give it a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic zombie","review":"The album that introduced mainstream America to one of metal's most beloved bands, White Zombie's \\"La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Vol. 1\\" is a tour de force of heandbanging ghoul rock. Songs like \\"Thunderkiss '65\\", \\"Black Sunshine\\", \\"Soul Crusher\\", \\"Thrust!\\", and \\"Grindhouse (A Go Go)\\" fully display the growl and campy lyrics of Rob Zombie, the grinding guitars of J., and the pumping bass and drums of Sean Yseult and Ivan Deprume respectively. I still remember thinking how mind boggingly cool White Zombie was when I had first heard them when I was a kid, and as much as I loved their follow up (and what proved to be their last studio album) \\"Astro Creep 2000\\", \\"La Sexorcisto\\" remains my favorite album from this much missed band. Forget most of Rob's newer material, this is the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good songs; bad production","review":"I hate it when I get into a band later in their career and then track back to the first album, because they usually get worse the farther back you go. This is the case with Rob Zombie, but I can't fault him for how horrible this CD sounds. Whoever produced and/or engineered this album missed the point of a metal band: make it LOUD! Listen to Astro-Creep: 2000 or Hellbilly Deluxe and you get a thick, sonic blast of an experience; listen to La Sexorcisto and it's like listening to Alice Cooper on quaaludes. Overall, the tunes are catchy, but the quality of the recording detracts from what this album could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I borrowed this album because of all the high praise and the song \\"Thunderkiss '65\\". I can't say I didn't like it, but I wasn't terribly impressed, either. While it does have awesome guitar riffs and cool vocals, it's majorly lacking lyrically. Also, it's not as heavy as I was hoping it would be, and it kind of drags in some parts. \\"Thunderkiss '65\\" is the standout track, however, and I never get tired of hearing that song. There's a few others on here that are good (Black Sunshine, Thrust) that make this album worth buying, but it's not the best thing I've ever heard. If you like these guys, check out Fear Factory and Machine Head. Good and heavy music similar to this, but with better, meaningful lyrics. Oh, and I'm not putting White Zombie down or anything, I like them (Rob puts on a hell of a show, by the way), but they're not my favorite band."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd is bad","review":"i'm a white zombie fan and this cd is the biggest piece of trash i have ever heard don't listen to these morons who reviewed it earlier just get astro-creep 2000 and save yourself some time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Erk.. not too good.","review":"I really didn't enjoy this album.

Plenty of good stuff on here, like \\"Welcome To Planet MotherF*cker\\", \\"Black Sunshine\\", and \\"I Am Legend\\". But without a doubt the highlight is \\"Thunder Kiss '65\\", possibly my favorite Zombie song ever.

This, his latest effort, continues his tradition of excellence while venturing into new some new territory. I'm always a bit put off when somebody criticizes an album for not keeping with an artist's earlier musical trends, since it is imperative for a musician to continually seek fresh sounds. Granted, this album is not \\"Songbook\\" or \\"Black Hope\\", but it is a marvelous collection of innovative tracks.Basically, if you aren't open to something new, you best shy away from this one, but if you're looking for something original from a known talent, pick up the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing: radio-ready, slick, over-produced.","review":"I normally love Kenny Garrett's stuff, but not this release.

Give it a miss, but listen to any of his other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Disc by Garret","review":"I enjoy how Kenny can make all syles of music grove.

I really do. I think the problem comes from the fact that I have become so spoiled. Over the past few years Kenny Garrett has produced some of the finest contemporary jazz around. Period. If you don't believe me just pick up a copy of \\"Triology\\", \\"Persuance\\", or the incredible \\"Songbook\\". Each album brought a sense of excitment and adventure to it. Now comes \\"Simply Said\\". This is, unhappily, a step backward for this wonderful artist. The tunes presented here seem tailored to the \\"smooth jazz\\" radio formula. Hey, I have no problem with an artist wanting to broaden his fan base, but I feel that this effort will only serve to turn off those who have been following his music for years. So, if you are looking for the same musical vision that you enjoyed so much on in the past: I suggest that you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A departure from the journey and the fire","review":"Ever since I first heard kenny, back In 1987 with OTB and following him with Miles listening to many tapes of Miles in concert and also seeing him live. He has always evoked deep emotion and passion and spirit from me, with his fury and risk taking playing! And his last recordings manage to grasp that side. But this venture is almost a complete turn around. It has a folksy feel with almost a radio format angle to it? Its not what I wish for when I want to hear Kenny play his wicked Alto. Yet its not a bad Cd, its just not what we expect as Kenny Garrett fans. He is a great musician and I hope he is not trying to grasp a new audiance. For I will always treasure the fury and passion that he reached!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"What a shame. I went out and bought this without reading the reviews or listening to it or anything, just on the strength of his previous material. I wish I'd checked it out first. Aside from track ten, the album is extremely uninspiring for the most part, with several terrible tracks, including the title track. Stay away, and pray that his next release lives up to Songbook, Pursuance and all his earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Kenny has emerged in the past few years as one of the strongest alto men out there. His playing has been fierce and he also also written and chosen great material. Neither of the these qualities are present on this CD, which veers very close to \\"smooth jazz\\".

For his sake, I hope it sells well enough to finance \\"Trilogy, Vol. 2\\" or perhaps a live set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kenny \\"G\\"arrett","review":"This CD is a disappointment from one of today's leading saxophonist.

Kenny can blow his tail off, and has, particularly on \\"Triology\\" & \\"Black Hope\\", and certainly on live dates. Here, however, he barely plays. Very much a smooth-jazz album, all the musicians are underutilized. It sounds like there was someone in the studio censoring what everyone played. That said, some of the tunes are nice, and it's well produced. Drumming on the first two tunes is great. This could have been a much better record that it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally satisfying","review":"This is an album of very rare quality. Every one of these 10 tunes is a gem, with a great hook or even two great hooks. Listening to it you can't help smiling because the melodic and harmonic inventiveness just never stops, and the guitar tone is gorgeous.

A lot of the book is spent talking about his views on the thoughts of the sea gypsies rather than on describing the actual thoughts or their lives.

Ellis, Hitch, and Neary (and the colorist, whose name escapes me) did a fantastic job in their 12-issue run on Authority. I picked up the issues without having read a page of Stormwatch and wasn't lost at all. Yes, several of the characters are from that series, but you DON'T need to have read Stormwatch to appreciate The Authority. This is big-screen entertainment. Very well written and the artwork will make you gasp."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful","review":"This was quite possibly one of the worst TPBs I've ever read.It wasn't that it was too \\"smart\\" for me, as I am a fan of Grant Morrison, Alan Moore, etc. It wasn't that the heroes were more aggressive than the usual spandex bunch. It was the fact that there is zero character development, the dialogue is horrid, and every page is simply more of the same. It's late 90's shock value entertainment from the same era as Jerry Springer. Graphic violence, civilians killed for the \\"greater good\\", a take on Superman and Batman as a gay couple (which is so stereotypical and in your face that it's insulting to homosexuals), fights with God and the Earth itself, and more destroyes cities than you can shake a stick at.If you want a good superhero series that aren't cookie cutter crap, read Grant Morrison's JLA or Kurt Busiek's Astro City."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"A good collection of comics by Warren Ellis. The former members of Stormwatch are now the Authority. A team of super beings that want to change the world for the better. They aren't afraid to get down and dirty to do it. These comics are written well, though not the best Ellis work. The characters and situations are a little more adult than you average Superman comics, and the action is a bit more graphic, so any real young readers might want to stay away. I would recommend this however to anyone else. But I would start with a few Stormwatch collections first. Force of Nature, Lightning Strikes, Change or Die, A Finer World, and Final Orbit--all by Ellis. If you enjoy them, then read this collection followed by Under New Management(which is the start of the Millar run), Transfer of Power, Earth, Inferno and other Stories, and Jenny Sparks. Those would be the core classics with the best writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Even though I had read good things about this book, I'm not easily fooled by hype. Unfortunately, my low level of expectations were not met by this title.Standard Authority Plot:[Insert villains -- aliens, clones, time travelers, mutants, etc.] start a large scale invasion of [insert city or cities]. Authority attack with swift and violent force. It's still not enough to thwart force or it's not enough to defeat the source of the problem. Escape back to the Authority's huge space ship.

Repeat.I hope that I have saved you some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallower than Hollywood","review":"This wildly popular book suffers from thin plots and thinner characters. Ellis won praise for his frank portrayal of a gay superhero couple in this series, and rightly so. Ten points for social sensitivity, and about minus a million points for shallow, one-dimensional characters (yes, even Apollo and the Midnighter), literally mindless violence, repetetive plots, and aggressively insensitive portrayal of practically everything else. Particularly offensive was the grinning Fu Manchu villain and his yellow horde.It is interesting that Ellis was happy to turn this book over to another writer. Perhaps he chose to concentrate on Planetary, a companion series to the Authority that was it's polar opposite. Planetary had great character development and clever plots that both satired and honored the many genres that inform current superhero comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Widescreen\\" Superhero Action","review":"This is the equivalent of a big, budget summer action movie.

In Internet time, this book is an antique. While very informative regarding the state of technology in early 1997, its relevance is minimal today. As an unintended history of Internet commerce technology, it is interesting, but as an in-depth guide to design and structure of today's solutions it lacks currency.Some examples:No reference to DVD-Rom in the discussion of CD-Rom (DVD not commercially available when published); Amazon.com as an afterthought in the discussion of e-commerce players (early in growth cycle); ISDN as the holy grail of internet connectivity (cable and DSL not commercially available)...and so on. Do yourself a favor and find a book no more than 3-6 months old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Stand-alone resource","review":"I'd like to echo the previous user's comment about this book being hopelessly outdated. While I understand that information technology moves very quickly these days, there is no excuse for not having a website available where addendums and updates can be posted. That, IMHO, is the more damnable than being outdated. Most of the technologies are old, and the links provided work about 25% of the time.That being said, it does provide a good academic introduction to some of the mechanisms of e-commerce. The explanations and comparisons of such things as digital signatures and EDI are good. While the newer technology has indeed overtaken the market, they still build on top of the old. So this book will still give you valuable insight and understanding about how the new technologies work. It is not completely worthless, but readers should also refer to more recent texts or resources on the Internet for updated information on the technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic pan","review":"I bought the 3 quart hard anodized pan when it was on sale during Christmas. My plan was to try it out and buy the five quart sauteuse if I liked the 3 quart. The conclusion: I adore this product. The drawback: the five quart pan is no longer being offered! Cook's Illustrated has rated this pan as good or better than All-Clad. It has never been a problem to clean up. Food cooks evenly and beautifully. The only flaw it has is that certain foods will stick a little, such as fish and corn starch. The bottom line is I would rather spend a little time time watching out for sticking (and use a little more oil) than risk eating the non-stick lining on other pans when it, inevitably, comes off. The hard-anodized surface is extremely hardy and does not scratch. The riveted handles are well-made, stay cool, and are hefty. If you want to buy a pan to hand down the generations, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and mellow energy","review":"I received this as a gift from a friend, knowing nothing about the group.

I figured from all the stories I have heard about \\"Fireball\\" that this book would knock my socks off. Instead it went all over the place and then again it went nowhere. Hardly any racing stories at all and not much about the crash that took his life. Some of the pictures were neat to see but just about every picture in the book is used more then once. You would think there is tons of photos out there of him, so the need to keep using the same photos at different parts of the book seemed odd. And way to many pics of his girlfriend. I sometimes felt like the book was about her, more then him. If you can pick this up cheap somewhere for a few dollars it may be worth it. Other then that, it was a huge letdown.

I found that the solder joint on the speaker connecter had a cold/loose solder. Rather than send the unit back and pay the $20 return shipping and the price to ship it, I re-soldered it.Both speakers worked fine for a few more months then both speakers went out. I checked them out again and found both speakers had their connectors severely corroded. After cleaning them one speaker worked fine, but the other goes in and out.Net is that in 7 months both speakers failed due to poor workmanship and materials.

It seemed to track the cost to state and bounty, but didn't do anything with them.They also resurrected the drift tracks...so much fun!In a Risk-type manner you take over territories. With each race you unlock parts/customizations and with each territory you unlock cars. Also, if you do all the races in an area you get an added bonus.In this one you get a crew. Each crew member has different qualities (both on and off the road). If you want to come in second every race, then get a scout and enjoy \\"Team Member Won\\" wins.

I've been a Hank Snow fan for many of my 27 years and while this is a good set and serves as a decent intro to his music, there's a little bit lacking here. First of all, BMG misses all of his early, early hits from Canada that would've made for nice listening. Also, they fail to represent Hank's undying love for the music of Jimmie Rodgers (he released 2 LP's of Jimmie's music) or his love for gospel music. It's not that they didn't have enough room for it either as the CD only runs around 55 minutes and a CD can hold up to around 75-80 minutes of playing time. Yes, this works as a great intro to Hank's music, but BMG could've given a bit more such as \\"The Next Voice You Hear\\" or \\"Merry Go Round of Love\\" which are minor hits in comparison to \\"I'm Movin' On\\", \\"Hello, Love\\" and others, but are still first rate cuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Country pioneer","review":"Whenever I play \\"90 miles an hour down a dead end street\\" from this man it makes me start to boogie woogie in my car. Not many Country singers make me do that. The song was released in 1963 and stuck at #2 for 3 weeks on Billboards country chart and was on the chart for a little over 4 months. Hank had too many classics to mention- Pure country classic stuff like \\"Millers Cave\\" from 1960, \\"Beggar to a King\\",\\"I've been everywhere\\",\\"The Wishing well\\"and I could go on and on and on. But I always come back to \\"90 miles an hour\\" while driving and my foot always gets a little heavier on that peddle and to me that's so cool !Note:Hank had a direct influence on the singing style and guitar style of Willie Nelson."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hank","review":"An outstanding cd full of the great Hank Snow treatment of this great music,exceptionally good cd, easily worth the quite reasonable price.Many of these songs were done by Hank originally, what else could you ask for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hankering for a Hank Snow immersion?","review":"It's been a long, long time since I've listened to much Hank Snow -- since back in the 1950's, before rock & roll routed C&W for me. But this CD put me right back there with this really large selection of his great ones, plus some I had never heard. You can't beat Hank for the fast-talking, driving rhythm of such cuts as I've Been Everywhere, and Music Makin' Mama. Way before we got so aware of international influences in our music, there he was talking about the Cuban and South American rhythms in The Rhumba Boogie. Its the slower pieces, though, that are my favorites - Now And Then ... and I Don't Hurt Anymore. The whole CD is surely a trip down nostalgia lane, to a time when the world, and gender relations, and lyrics were different from what they have become, but I really enjoyed the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dolly Parton is FABULOUS!","review":"For most of my youth, I was a closet Dolly fan. My brother and I once put this very album under my mom's back tire so we wouldn't have to listen to it...ever. Since then, I have come out and admitted it: I LOVE DOLLY PARTON. This is a great CD because it has all of her big hits on it, together with Vol. 1 you have the complete Parton starter kit. Sure, she's the biggest hick ever, sure, her breasts are amazingly disporportionate to the rest of her body, and yes, she does have a company that makes wigs, but that is all part of charm. This CD is totally Dolly.FABULOUS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection","review":"This is the Dolly collection you want, if you are a fan of her music from early in her career when she was more country. If you are looking for her more pop-country sound, try Volume One of the Essential Series. This collection highlights some of the best songs in Dolly's career. From the simplistic songs that weve grown to love like Touch Your Woman, The Bargain Store, Coat of Many Colors, My Tennessee Mountain Home, to songs like Heartbreaker, I Really Got The Feeling, I Will ALways Love You, Light Of A Clear Blue Morning and more, there is a wide collection here. This will have to satisfy you until RCA realizes no matter how many Dolly Greatest Hits released, there is no proper collection until we get a boxed set covering her whole career and all her hits, but this is a nice place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all family's libraries!","review":"A beautifully written story that deals elegantly with death.

While the title \\"My first time\\" suggests a sexy look at guy's first experiences, nothing could be farther from the truth. This video is best suited as a high school sex-ed video dealing with to how to protect you from sexually transmitted diseases. While it is true that the information presented is accurate and valid, if I knew that sex ed is what this video preached about (i.e. how to use a condom), I would have passed. This video is produced in England, and for an American, the accents can be distracting. My recommendation is if you are a virgin and know nothing about gay sex, get this video.

I've had a few pieces of this cookware, and some relatives have had it as well, and our experience has been the same --- within 2-3 years, it looses its nonstick properties, it starts to peel, etc.Circulon is marketed as high-end cookware, but it really doesn't live up to expectations. Also, they have a seemingly nice warranty, but I just sent my pots to them to be replaced, and they lost it! They eventually agreed to send me a new one, since I still had my tracking number and could prove they'd lost my package. But it's hardly cadillac service --- I have to wait two weeks before I can expect to get the cookware back."},{"rating":"1","title":"At First Great, Later Not So Great!","review":"I have a complete set of Circulon Cookware and have used it for several years. At first it worked well, but after awhile I had increasing difficulty with food sticking and problems cleaning. The pots tend to work fine because you cook with significantly more liquid. The pans are the true shortcoming. After cooking with the pans I fill them with hot water and sometimes some dish detergent and let them soak. I find washing them after at least a 15 minute soak to still be problematic. I have to rub vigorously with a sponge, even then you cannot properly clean-out the grooves.I am phasing out my set and moving back to cast iron, aluminum and aluminum clad stainless. I do better cooking the old fashioned way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-stick surface peel","review":"I bought this set of circulon cookware.

I have purchased quite a few more peices over the years and have noticed that the newer pans are even nicer then the originals. The newer ones have heavier handles and deeper grooves and seem to have a thicker coating of non stick. I have found good deals on single pieces over the years at major department stores. They throw out a 'teaser' piece at a really low price because they know that if you use one pan, you will want them all.

The ridges, while they may be great for cooking, make it almost impossible to keep clean.

We thought we liked them at the beginning, but we gradually found that food would stick to the nonstick surface, especially in the grooves. The grooves are VERY hard to clean. I rarely use Circulon anymore (probably once every other year or less). Most of the pieces have not been used because of the above reasons. We even donated some (still in mint/unused condition) to charity because they're not worth using. The cheapo Wal-Mart nonstick pots and pans are better value than these.

Black spots have appeared on the bottom of the pots and will not come off. Everything sticks to both the pots and the pans and cleanup is a nightmare.

If you like toe-tapping Bluegrass instrumentals, this is world-class stuff. A couple of jazzier tunes as well. The second song, Buffalo Nickel, makes me weepy every time I hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy two!","review":"This is my first Bela purchase, and after playing it about 500 times in the first week, I immediately am starting to build my Bela collection. This is one of those recordings that you can play over and over and over, and each time you hear some genious lick that brings yet another smile to your face. What a kicking group of musicians - they sound like they are just sitting around having casual fun and absolutely shredding every note! It doesn't get any better than this! Buy 2 - one for the car and one for the house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Home run","review":"Bela has hit another home run with this one.All the usual all-stars and some great tunes.Unlike the first \\"acoustic planet\\" CD, this one has mostly traditional bluegrassy stuff on it.Almost all instrumentals, except the extremely fun cant-get-it-outta-yer-head \\"Polka on the banjo\\"Thanks Bela!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of good music, extremely well played","review":"There's a dopey spoken-word track that you can skip, but the rest of this CD is very good. How do these guys do it? I guess Bela provides the catchy tunes (+ obvious banjo expertise) and the hot band takes it from there. Many times I've put it on the car stereo thinking I'll just listen to one or two songs and I end up hearing the whole thing -- all 75 minutes! (less the \\"poem\\"). Highly recommended to just about anyone. (And by the way, person from Maryland: it's \\"avant-garde.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Again, Bela pushes the bluegrass envelope","review":"Wow...this guy is always thinking outside the box. Tony Trischka mentored Bela and, although Tony's influences are audible, Bela has developed an amazing style all his own. Normally, Bela's work is a little too experimental/Jazz for my taste, but this CD is an exception. It is a collection of traditional bluegrass songs along with several original songs which are purely Fleck. They take the listener on an amazing journey through ever changing rhythms and twisting chord progressions, which are definitely not your grandfather's bluegrasses. The names of the musicians on this CD read like a Bluegrass dream team so the music is always smooth, professional and exciting. With the exception of a goofy poem reading, this is an altogether wonderful bluegrass experience along the lines of Fleck's earlier CD \\"Drive\\" from 1985 which I also highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed California's natural beauty","review":"This video glossed over much of California's natural beauty andinstead focused on buildings, freeways, and football stadiums.They gave the impression of showing California region by region,but in reality they jumped back and forth, going from the southcoast to the central coast, then back south again.

The obvious difference, a mild reduction in hot water pressure. As for hot water temperatures, very comparable. I would say its not scalding hot out of the tap, but steamy. Not bad, given its winter in New England. Electric units are out of the question, the power requirements needed to raise the water temperature put them beyond the capacity of most homes in this climate. Our consumption is moderate, just two in the household. Can two use the hot water at the same time? Yes, the hot water pressure will again be reduced, but not uncomfortable for the one in the shower. One important note, the household uses half-inch plumbing, while the city water feed comes in on a three-quarters-inch pipe; larger pipe capacity could be a factor to consider.

Also, the book drags as well and Mr. Bonewits beats around the bush too much with way too many scientific terms at times, which i thought he should of gotten to the point.

Most of his explanation of the \\"science behind magick\\" is pseudoscience, much of it already thoroughly debunked, especially now that the Russian science community is no longer under Soviet control. His explanations of auras and telepathy are particularly disappointing; if it is true that they involve radio waves, they should have been measured under controlled conditions, and they haven't been. His 'color categories' of magick only cloud discussion. Read this book with a great deal of skepticism.

I find it a bit too slow sometimes, though (which is why I gave 4 and not 5 stars).My best part is the second part of the disc, starting with The Carny from Nick Cave, with a mysterious atmosphere (Cavelike, I will say). I then simply love track 15 (Zirkusmusik), it's absolutely fabulous, reminds me a bit of the Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain for those who know this movie (soundtrack). Angel Fragments (No16) is really angel-like, kind of flying music. Then tracks 17 to 19 are again full of mystery, in the Nick Cave style. Pas Attendre (No20) is nice, with good guitars, soft and groovy, a bit tortured. The disc ends with a nice piano slow.

EA is not capturing your browsing history or cookies. The only \\"tracking technology\\" admitted to is the fact that advertisers need to know that players actually saw an ad in-game. So, everyone has a right to be angry (and not buy the game), but do it for the right reasons. A modern-day ad looks very silly sitting next to a 40-foot futuristic war machine.This begs the big question, though. Why pay full price for a game that is subsidized by in-game advertisements?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I f I could play this it would be great!@","review":"Ok, warning guys. Be careful when someone lists a game as new in shrink wrap. I bought one and found out that it has been used, so the key is not valid.If you are installing this on an older system, beware, it caused me great headache to get it installed. First, the install shield would cuase my sytem to reboot from the beginning, so I installed in safe mode. Well, then it would not find the disk in the drive (it's a noted problem at EA), so I uninstalled and tried cracking it. Well, I got to registration only to find out that the key is not valid.So now I'm looking forward to black friday to see if a big box store will sell a good rig for a good deal. Until then, I must continue to play BF2.

Since that fateful day when I wasted a few days lunch money, I have spent few hours playing this game.Installing was a hassle, singing in to EA was a hassle, and playing was a hassle. I had to play for several hours before I could even figure out what was going on. Forget about doing well, that was too much work. Nevertheless, I stuck with it enough to be do well in matches, although I was never really satisfied. The balance of the game seemed off to me.Even though it is priced very low right now, I still do not recommend getting this game. I don't even know if people still play it - the servers might be empty. There are sites that track how many players are playing certain online games at once. I recommend checking those to see if people are still playing this game before buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great FPS MMO","review":"Full of FPS action in a fun multiplay enviornment.

It was even in the Battlefield line. The game was good for a couple of weeks - until I decided to play Battlefield 2 again, which was great! There was actually a level with the sun-perfect vision for snipers. Even the vehicles were better. It was great to fly a jet again and play on a server that didn't lag (2142 people always moved the Titan and slowed the whole server down).

You basically can't play for than 30-90 minutes without a crash to desktop. It got frustrating to the point that I had to stop playing (because I didn't want to change back to XP). If you are running Vista, do not buy this game. It doesn't work well. I went through all of the \\"tweak guides\\" to try to minimize crashing and it still crashes.You can argue that BF 2142 wasn't designed for Vista, because it wasn't, but this is the only game I own that won't run on Vista.

EA's statement neglects to comment on many details that concern privacy advocates about this game, (they say what it doesn't do but they are not specific about what it does.) and the LICENSE AGREEMENT gives them permission to add even more spyware to the game in later patches, It also says that by installing the game, you agree give EA lawsuit immunity if the game harms your computer or violates your privacy.

The \\"Man Just Wants To Rock\\"- just incredible and \\"Lord I'm Stranded\\" reminds me of my life in the wrong lane asking for help. Overall this Florida boy has put it all together with a great debut CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the beach whereever you go","review":"This CD will end those tiresome arguments of what music will satisfy all members of the family.

I bought this game for my grandson to play on my PC and it didn't work. After spending two days messaging with Activision I found that I needed a more powerful video card. I purchased one for $110 and after getting it installed and updating the drivers all I got for my time and money was the \\"blue screen of death\\"! I'm taking the card and the game back today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted money","review":"The game would not run on my computer.

It was difficult to maneuver the character and I was also pretty disappointed with the grapics, especially considering the amount of resource you need to run it in the first place. My PC was specifically built for gaming, so it's no slug when it comes to games. I play Sims 2 with ALL the expansion packs, plus thousands of downloaded items and NEVER have the lag I had on this game. When the kids (age 9) played it, they weren't impressed either. They said it was too hard to figure out the controls and basically tired of trying to figure it out very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"PC Game with a Problem","review":"I got the Shrek the third PC for my birthday present. I fought this game was going to be interesting. Even though I installed it just fine, and it works on our computer, this game often freezes our computer. Usually when this frezzing problem happens I usually have to turn off the computer and start the level all over again. Occasionally, this game erases files all by itself. Sometimes I could not pass the level because it usually freezes in the middle of a level. The graphics were good, the characters were funny. I WOULD NOT RECCOMMEND THIS GAME BECAUSE IT OFTEN FREEZZES OUR COMPUTER!!! BUY ANOTHER GAME!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant and Touching Surprise","review":"I expected the Pets in the new Sims expansion to be fun, and I wasn't disappointed. The surprise is how many new objects and decor items there are. There are a lot new walls and floors that aren't too theme-specific, and will add a lot of good new looks to building new houses. The ability to used partial floor tiles in the floor grids to make patterns is a cool bonus. They even have carpet strips to put between carpeted and tiled floors for an even more realistic look. There are a lot of great furnishings too.This game is really touching to me because I have been able to make Sim versions of all the beloved pets that I have had through the years. My son and I laughed hysterically at the photo portraits of the cats in the game; they are totally unphotogenic!I have been disappointed with the Stuff Packs because of the lack of \\"stuff\\" in them; not a good value. However, the Pets expansion pack is a GREAT value all around, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I like playing all the Sims 2 games that I've tried, and this is no different. It's enjoyable. There are a few frustrations, but they're easy to work around, and deal more with mobility than anything else... such as the fact that the puppies can't go up and down stairs to get out of the house, and your Sims will keep setting the pup down instead of carrying him or her with. It all works out in the end, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"I got this for christmas. Here's a hint for all of u with a slow sims 2 or sims 2 pets game.

She loves playing the people's lives, while I love building houses & creating families. The Pets expansion pack makes the game itself so much more fun to play. We have an Australian Shepard & Papillon, neither of which were included, but both were easy to make. Sims dogs and cats have personality traits that so closely resemble the real things, it's amazing! The whole Sims2 series in just good clean family fun that, with adult supervision, can be enjoyed by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but really slows down your computer!","review":"Having pets for your Sims is fun, but that's about all this pack offers. There are few new objects. I guess I expected more, with this being an actual expansion pack.I never had much of a problem with the speed of my Sims until I installed Pets. Now, the game \\"hangs\\" at certain times (while loading a house, when a Sim turns into a werewolf, after a pet comes home from work with a promotion, etc.). It is very annoying, and the game overall has slowed to the point of it being unenjoyable.I hope to get a new computer soon. Hopefully, that will help. But I wish that the minimum requirements on the box had been adjusted. Yes, the game will run with the minimum requirements. But it won't necessarily be fun to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"Very good expansion for the Sims 2 game. Not only does it give you pets and pet items but it gives you more decor items and interactions between your sims. I highly recommend this expansion pack. Just make sure before you buy it that your computer can handle the space requirements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!","review":"Pets are cute at first. Kittens and puppies eventually grow into cats and dogs. However, the pets are annoying and scratch up your furniture. You can buy a bird cage, but if you don't feed it, the bird eventually dies. Dogs and cats can be bred and have litters, but they take three Sim days to do so (if there's a hack to speed that up, I couldn't find it). Dogs and cats come out at night and dig up holes in your front lawn and scare off other pets. Adds a lot of modern furniture.Not worth it! My Sims could of lived perfectly fine without pets. After you install this expansion, they only want to buy and train pets. I wish I hadn't wasted my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality","review":"I chose this rating because, everything was there, Its shipped well, and also because it works perfectly.I liked it all, it worked and I was completely satisfied.I would recommend this product to anyone who likes the Sims 2 because this product was in great condition and worked.Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"issues with the game","review":"Cute and fun, but I couldn't combine Pets and Seasons on my computer.However, the biggest problem with Pets is that whenever any member of the house, including pets, is home and awake, time runs on normal.

While I didn't like the Henry character, Linus Roache did a wonderful job portraying him.Rahul Bose as T.K is another wonderful and natural performance as a man who is caught between two worlds, the Western world and his own village. Henry, T.K, and Sajani are all compelling characters wrestling with their own different moral principles. This is a beautifully photographed film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Movie, Poor Casting","review":"Before the Rains beautifully captures the tragedy of sexual attraction between a master and his slave. The slave never wins! Nandita Das turns in a commendable performance as an infatuated young woman who perceives the attention of the debonair British man as true loveThe main problem I have with this movie is the casting of Rahul Bose. It is almost painful to hear his malayalam (being a malayalee myself). Given the plethora of fantastic Malayalam movie industry actors some of whom were cast in this movie why choose him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Before The Rains","review":"Before the Rains was definitely a disappointment. The opening scenes begin with the leading characters in an adulterous affair. In the next scene the couple take off to go look for honey in the nearby wooded area and are discovered making love in a sacred pool. From this point on, the two lovers are telling lies to cover up this forbidden affair and lastly a death.

I have the Kenner version from 1979, and this matches it in sheer coolness. I don't know \\"fun\\" kids will find it, but it has close to 20 points of articulation so it can be posed in a variety of ways for display (stand and 3 facehuggers included). Plus, the inner tongue shoots out, ready to bite any of your 12\\" G.I. Joe figures right in the head... (Unlike the '79 version, however, the jaws are permanently molded in the open position.)Another cool thing about it is that they molded it in translucent, black plastic and then painted over it. If you hold it up to the light, it looks truly creepy.This thing has some nice heft to it but at the same time seems too fragile in places to be \\"played\\" with extensively. Definitely designed more for the adult collector, but really worth the price -- comic shops are asking $45 for it so buy one quick before Amazon catches on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great large-scale figure","review":"McFarlane's 12\\" Alien is darn near perfect. I count 14 points of articulation, plus the bendy tail. The construction seems pretty durable; however, as with the small-scale version, this figure is hard to stand without the base. It can be done, but you'll have to work at it. My only other complaint would be the \\"skull cap.\\" For whatever reason the front of the cap is completely opaque while the rest is completely clear. In the original movie, the whole skull cap was just slightly translucent. These are minor points, though. I would recommend this figure to all Alien fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value, needs a CD - Spanish Now is better","review":"Spanish the Easy way isn't exactly easy unless you're VERY familiar with the pronunciation.

It's really not that bad. I bought the package, and it smells exactly like Valerian is supposed to smell: strong and pungent. Love it! The tea does what it's supposed to do, too: puts your nerves at ease, and relaxes you for a little while, helping you sleep better. Works very well to sit down in front of a fireplace and doze off on those cold winter evenings. If you are familiar with the distinctive aroma of Valerian and don't mind it, then buy with confidence: good stuff! Otherwise, this may not be what you're looking for: try spearmint or chamomile (Celestial Seasonings has a good one called Sleepy Time that has a mix of those and more)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"Excellent Peppermint tea - can't beat the price - would pay quite a bit more on store shelves...highly recommend the chamomile also"},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it at first...","review":"The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I use this tea for menstral cramps","review":"I use this tea for menstral cramps. I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood. Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better. I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts. Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.

With rockers and soulful ballads, it proves once again the versatility of this band.

So pick up a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Believe the Anti-Hype","review":"Okay, so I admit that it took me awhile to buy this one.

It was months later when I saw it on sale that I bought it on a whim. Having now heard every album the Pretenders have recorded, this stands alongside LEARNING TO CRAWL as Chrissie and the gang's finest efforts. I really could just gush about this CD for hours, but here's what you really need to know:This CD is solid from beginning to end. No filler, no lame ducks.

He should stick to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, but lacks a glossary","review":"This book has a solid approach of linking grammar topics with communication functions. The book does a good job of showing the particular real-life contexts in which the various structures can be used. In addition, the explanations are straightforward, non-technical, and clear.The fatal flaw, however, is that the book lacks both vocabulary lists in the units and a glossary at the end of the book.

Not sure that Mattel checked this out before putting it on the market. We contacted Mattel and they would just say they were sorry and would give me my money back but that doesn't do anything for my very sad 4 year old who cannot play with the toy she purchsed with her own money.

I tried calling the hospital to find out what they used, but frankly my call was ignored, and the nurses did not know since theirs come in a clear package that is unbranded. After a ton of research, this looked to be the closest. I figured that it had to be the heavy weight one (Quickables come in multiple versions).

The interviews have little substance beyond \\"Gerrard is great!\\". The interviews are interspersed with a handful of his best goals. The few that are shown are repeated a great many times. There is a bonus feature which shows all 100 goals in chronological order. The bonus feature, however, has no narration, no setup of the goals, and no commentary. It is just a rapid fire showing of the goals. The goals themselves are beautiful but the DVD actually detracts from the experience rather than adding to it.

But \\"Speed of Thought\\" is a very mixed bag despite the talent on board for this recording.Mostly loud and technically very good, the music sounds strained and forced at times, making it hard to stick with more than a track or two. And after a couple of listens, one tends to note the better tracks----Bone Daddy and Get the Picture, for instance----and forgoes most of the others. Still. Mr. Schenkman and Mr. Laing can both play and sing with abandon.The lyrics sometimes seem too much of the same thing and tend to celebrate or denigrate the excesses of rock-star life, and providing little for the ordinary listener to celebrate. Perhaps a follow-up recording will prove more accessible and more convincing.

I use it 5 times a week and trust me, it will start sticking within a year no matter what utensils you use and how careful you clean it.Having said that, this stir fry pan is still a good value.

I've not had a single problem with sticking, and the interior remains scratch-free.I wonder if the people who complain about scratches are storing their pans stacked inside of each other. This can lead to scratching. One easy solution is to place a paper towel between pans when stacking.No, it's not dishwasher safe, but you really don't need to put it in the dishwasher! It doesn't fit in my sink, either, but you don't need to soak it.

My wok is now permanently on the shelf. I make stir frys, indian curries, all sorts of braises and one pot, stove top meals, etc. It's truly all-purpose. It holds the heat well and never, ever sticks. It's a wonder to clean. The lid is a real bonus because you can observe your dishes cooking away without having to lift the lid and lose heat/steam.

There is also a general disrespect for women-- or rather \\"girls\\"-- as the author prefers to call them. Some of the facts are completely incorrect, and one wonders who the fact checkers and editors on this project are.

Or big enough to do five good sized burgers. The non-stick is among the best I have ever cooked with. Even the grimiest, greasey messes just rinse away with your faucet. I've never had ANYTHING that cleaned up as well as this one does. Add to all of that the sturdy glass lid and you have one tremendous pan that is well worth the money.

The unit has worked perfectly every time and been easy to clean. This unit has also been great for making popcorn for guests watching sports or home movies at my house. The feature I like best, other than easy cleaning, is that the temperature dial is marked out in degrees and lets me exercise better control over cooking temperatures than what other slow cookers do (many others just have a low, medium and high setting, whereas this unit has a dial with various temps marked on it and allows you greater range).

The author has relentless pyschological theorizing and heavy-handed commentaries on every page.Though feminism and social psychology have much to offer, this book is barely sympathetic to the spiritual life per se and shows almost no understanding of the movements of faith in a person's life. Reading this, one could never imagine how the saint's life could have inspired millions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Au contraire mes amies!","review":"I found this book to be a refreshing change from the sentimental glop usually found in biographies of St. Therese. I was glad that Ms. Furlong interpreted Therese's life in light ofcontemporary psychology. For instance, Therese's severe childhood illness almost certainly had its roots in the fact that she had yet again lost a mother figure when her older sister entered the convent. (She had previously lost two mother figures.)The fact that Therese showed such maturity, strength of character and a will of iron during her brief adult life, despite her sad childhood is testament to her courage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"Awful book--Furlong admits in the introduction that she is embarrased to be interested in Therese and does not like the Catholic Church or Christianity in general. Furlong obviously has an agenda. She takes every selfless act or kind gesture by Therese and turns it into something neurotic or perverse. Furlong has very little sympathy for Therese's childlike faith. If you want to know about Therese of Lisieux, I recommend 'St Therese-the Little Flower' by John Beevers. I put this book in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a pass","review":"Poor Monica Furlong doesn't comprehend the spiritual life and therefore can't comprehend Therese, the universal sister and one of the greatest saints of the calendar East or West.

In the run up to the war there appears to be an explanation for all manner of incompetence whether the Navy's inability to prepare for Pearl Harbor or the failure of the bureaucracy to react appropriately to the threat. (Similar to our current government's inability to be accountable for Iraq and even missing the clues to 9/11) McArthur is presented as a flawless leader who heroically stands outside on Corregidor while the bombs are falling and his subordinates scurrying for cover--behaviour not documented elsewhere.The book is revisionist and not a worthy history of the era and certainly not in the same league as Rick Atkinson's recent histories of the was in North Africa and Italy and posited by another reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"More junk from Gump","review":"Here it is, he's done it again.

Highlights for me from her are \\"Miss You Like Crazy\\", \\"Jump Start\\", and a few others, but the comment she made about Ms. Ross in the 70s when she was strung out on drugs that \\"she could sing circles around Diana Ross\\" annoyed my father. And I understand that. Lately, Ms. Natalie has don albums of standards (and judging by the track listings) she is doing one again ranging from Anguun covers to other more known songs.....Maybe if we are lucky it will have some original material on it by Michael Masser again who shine on his production of \\"Miss You Like Crazy\\"...I still will see what the gal has been up to when this album comes out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"I'm a huge fan of Ms.Cole's, and when I first heard the single \\"Snowfall on the Sahara\\" (glorious!) I couldn't wait to get to the store to pick up this CD. What a MESS! There is no concept to this crazy quilt collection. \\"A Song For You\\" is way off target with it's soul-style embellishments, \\"Corinna\\" is one the the most god-awful and insipid songs ever, and for some strange reason the lady feels she has to say something cute before actually singing many of the numbers. I have nothing against Natalie singing contemporary material (\\"Everlasting\\" is one of my favorites) but next time out she should choose ONE good producer, some songs that are worthy of her, and just SING them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hated I T\\" !","review":"I am really taken aback on Ms. Cole's efforts in the production of this CD. Unfortunatly, there wasn't any. It sounds as though she is rehearsing for the part of a female singer. The soulfulness that I thought would be there did not surface in any of the songs on the CD. Truly, from my perspective this is one of her worst projects.

Most of the time, it's very mellow, but Natalie does a fine job on this mix of remakes and newer songs. The title song Snowfall on the Sahara is fabulous with its quiet feel on the keyboards--it makes you feel like you're in Egypt or an open desert when you hear it. Another favorite is Say You Love Me, which also has that mellow feel and it fits very well with Natalie's voice. But there are some other strong numbers like Reverend Lee, A Song For You, the soulful Serve Somebody and Stay With Me.

The first time I read this book, it was a paperback and after some long while of looking up words every page or two (it's not my lack of vocabulary that creates this need, it is the rich and complex language the writers use to describe their ideas), I gave up and just made guesses based on context and root words. With Kindle, however, I can just scroll over to the word in question... and the definition pops up on the screen. Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, could do with easier writing and better title","review":"I really liked this book, but I think it's much more of a cognitive and developmental psychology survey than a well tied together theory of love.I find the author(s)'s use of overly complex words and metaphors excessive. I am a fan of simple and clean writing... you can easily convey a idea without using $50 words in every sentence.My biggest pet peeve is that there were ancillary information (not really necessary to the context of the book) that is either poorly explained or out right wrong.But overall if you can overlook these little minor annoyances, the book is really very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical, poetic science?

Like, closely, dude) via their yawn-inducing, Wish-You-were-Here-meets-Burt-Bacharach (i.e., a thin hair shy of \\"Dream Weaver\\") production values may provide fast relief to chronic insomniacs, but are otherwise merely indicative of the continued gullibility of the average 'alternative'consumer, who'll gladly gobble up the most recycled doggy-poo so long as the vapid alterna-critics (who rarely know any better) gush over it. The only positive thing I can say about The Soft Bulletin is that it's only one, rather than four CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard this before","review":"and I had to think about it a little before I realized that this is the worst Yes album I've ever heard. If the Flaming Lips were ever a good band, this is not indicative of it.Boring, gauche, overemotive without actually communicating anything. Really, kids, I don't see what the hype is, unless youve smoked a few too many bones while this is on. Sober, it is gonna be difficult to stick in the changer again. The drums were nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's greatest band","review":"I have been a fan of the flaming lips since their \\"oh my gawd\\" album back in 1988. These guys have always flirted with genius and have recorded a decade's worth of staggeringly good, inventive rock. Sometimes they're called quirky or weird -- they certainly can be -- but that, I think, undervalues their work. They have always pushed the musical envelope, whether grafting pop sheen onto dense alternative rock or employing eighty kazillion separate tracks in one piece.As great as the flaming lips back catalog is, they really blew the roof off with \\"the soft bulletin.\\" It is quite simply a classic, teeming with unusual arrangements and hooky structures, and deserves to be celebrated as such. More importantly, it should be in the library of every serious fan of thoughtful rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely original, a classic","review":"This album is like nothing I've ever heard. I hear elements of Pink Floyd at their best, Led Zep, Neil Young, Queen, Beatles, and even a little Zappa/Beefheart. But it all blends into a completely new sound that sounds like the Lost Masterpiece of the 60s. \\"What is the Light?\\" has to be one of the most glorious songs I've ever heard, and \\"The Gash\\" is one of the most bombastic. Wonderful stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've seen things in this music I've never seen before.","review":"This music likes my way of seeing things. That is I've seen things in this music I've never seen. This drama is causing me to do somethings I've never done. What is this feeling, this utterance? Perhaps I've gone too far in my description. Or perhaps not far enough. This album is my favorite of the year because it makes me crazy. I discorporate from my soul and become one with the fleshy album cover. I yearn for something more than myself. Perhaps after a while I will return to earth. I hope not. This album really does something for me. \\"Fly in the air as you comb your hair\\". Indeed. I've seen things in this music I've never seen before. I can be this. Will you too? I hope so, for \\"your potential has arrived.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This one caught me by surprise","review":"I bought the album expecting something quite weird, like the old Dont Use Jelly stuff,but this is a symphony of angels playing saws and hubcaps and harps. Where does Gash fit in I dont know, and dont care. Excellent stuff. How can they possibly follow this effort?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lips Have Transformed Again","review":"Ok...Hit To Death In the Future Head will always remain my favorite just because I'll never forget the first time I heard the opening strains of 'Talkin About The...', but the strings in 'Suddenly Everything Has Changed' have also haunted me as frequently as those odd opening baritone noises. For this, I am in debt to the Flaming Lips. They have created music that will remain imbedded in my cranium long after I am gone. This is an album of pure genius. 'The Spark That Bled' is worth the price alone for it's many transitions and 'Waitin For A Superman' is such a beautiful song that it grabs you where it counts. I have never heard a song like 'The Gash' in my life and that is what makes it so cool. The Lips keep evolving into this higher band...I can't wait to hear what they have for us next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the hype, this is an amazing cd","review":"This is the only flaming lips's cd I have listened to, I feel totally amazed by this.... I'm buying the complete flaming lips collection just because of this masterpiece........Believe the hype and buy it, it is worth 12 dollars, or a thousand.....really, you won't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those","review":"I few years ago I randomly picked up Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots and was hooked. Hungry for more F'Lips I went back in time to this -- and was disappointed. Besides Race for the Prize and Waitin' For A Superman I didn't find much else to like. I decided to pick up this CD again recently, since I was going to one of their shows (it was unbelievable) and I was blown away. This is one of those albums that takes some time and careful listening to in order to fully appreciate its beauty. Tracks like Feeling Yourself Disintegrate and A Spoonful Weights A Ton are so well crafted I can only smile and sometimes even shed a tear. Simply gorgeous and worth every second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Forget my earlier review--this record is pretty much genius. And incredible sounding--these guys have been getting the best drum sounds since Zeppelin! Amazing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something here...","review":"I must be missing something here. I have a very extensive CD and vinyl collection, and have very wide ranging musical tastes. I bought The Soft Bulletin for two reasons: One, the reviews on the cover which rated it as outstanding. Two,for the front cover photo, which is of a guy tripping on acid and freaking to his own shadow (from a Life magazine story on LSD, I remember reading as a kid). But, I really did not care for this recording. I found the vocals particularly irritating, and the over-arranged string sounds really cheezy. The lyrics are downright silly. I do like the psychedelic nuances, but not enough to recommend this to anyone. So, I'm obviously in the minority on this one. My copy of Soft Bulletin, is going straight to the cut - out bin at my local used CD store. If anybody out there wants a free copy, get with me soon. It's not often that I say this, but I found it practically unlistenable. Sorry. Great cover, and artwork though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool little trick","review":"Hey- Many of you might already know this, but if you play this album's \\"Race for the prize\\" at the same time as the segment of 2001: A Space Odyssey titled \\"Jupiter and Beyond the Infinate,\\" you'll see that it is a perfect match. The song was designed that way, so that the two are in synch. Many people know about the Dark Side of the Moon/Wizard of Oz connection, but perhaps you haven't heard of this one. Check it out, it works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way over rated","review":"This CD does NOT merit the fantastic reviews made by Amazon critics. Were the reviewers friends or relatives of the band or its producer? The lyrics are silly. The vocals are very weak. The instrumentation is uninspired.

I will be more careful buying something sight unseen (or sound unheard) next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just barely...","review":"After all the rave reviews, I couldn't hardly wait to peel off the plastic wrapper and get this disc on my player. But, within a matter of minutes, I was transported back to the wonderful land of OZ, listening to the Tin Man lament his lack of a brain. If you thought this was the best of the 90s, you need to remove the ear wax which has been building up over the past ten years. Someone once said that the reason rap-rock is so popular is because the \\"singers\\" don't have to worry too much about carrying a tune. Listening to this, the same could be said about the Lips' approach to alt-rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album for all the lovers out there.","review":"This has some great tunes. It's perfect for those times when you and the lady have just gotten home from the game (go sox) and want to celebrate beating the other team (A-Rod sucks!).Wayne Coyne has the voice of a freakin angel. When it comes to his voice during intimate times, you might say \\"A Spoonful Weighs a Ton.\\" And there's nothing like listening to \\"Feeling Yourself Disintegrate\\" while you feel yourself disintegrate in the company of a good woman (or man, no judgments chief).You don't gotta \\"Wait for Superman\\" when you listen to this album. If you've been looking for something to replace your worn out Luther Vandross album in the CD changer, then you should \\"Race for the Prize\\" and get this album!Minus one star because I never want this sensual album to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I really wanted to like this cd after all the rave reviews its recieved, but i just don't get it, having played it many times over the last 2 or 3 yrs there is quite simply nothing to grab on to and by the time you get to the end of the cd, it all becomes rather forgettable.oviously an aquired taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows and grows on you","review":"When I bought this, it wasn't what I had expected and I was evan a bit dissapointed. But I must say after repeated listenings this is one of the best albums of all time. Trying to get other people into it is a little hard, but worth doing in the long run. And I can't wait til 30 years in the future when my grandkids think I'm awesome for having this in my collection as the amazon.com review says. ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"wicked good stuff","review":"I understand where everyone that absolutely hates this album comes from, but I love it. It's polished and catchy (one point that I might add about catchy is that I thought I had heard some of the songs before like Gash). I haven't heard the rest of the lips repertoire except for priest driven (the mushroom tapes) and I must say that I like this one better only for the fact that it's so lush with sound the other just sounds like...well...a mushroom trip. I personally like the fact that I could show this to some friends of mine who know music and while they realize it is pop, realize it's beauty too. I must say \\"I stood up and I said yeah, I stood up and i said hey yeah yeah yeah...\\" that part kills me everytime. Good GAWD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT, MELODIC AND TENDER, BUT LACKING FIREPOWER","review":"THE SONGS ARE MOSTLY SWEET AND OPTIMISTIC, AND THE MELODIES AND ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEAUTIFUL.

The emphasis with them is more on vibe than intellect. The spiritual journey you take with them on this ride is unforgetable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A modern masterpiece?","review":"I bought this album after reading how great it was by the people who supposedly know about such things: music critics. Upon listening to it for the first time I was a little disappointed, but thought it might grow. It did grow as well, more and more irritating with each listen. Don't get me wrong, there's a few catchy songs here, the best of which is A Spoonful Weighs a Ton, but the plastic production, nerdish lyrics and annoying effects, particularly when the rhythmic intro to one track is sung by a band member, really grate. The whole thing sounds somewhat soulless and cosmetic, but perhaps that's the point. It's not particularly original either, as many critics would have you believe, but more a high-tech 70's prog album. If you want to see how this sort of thing can be done with feeling then buy the Pretty Things album Parachute instead, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Lips record","review":"After the mind-blowing intensity of \\"Clouds Taste Metallic\\" and \\"Zaireeka\\" (4 CD's playing at the same time; it must be heard to be beleved), I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed the first time listening to this. But the more I listened to it, slowly but surely, the pleasures of this album unraveled before me. The pleasures this time around are more subtle than they have been in the past. It's not nearly as in-your-face noisy as their previous stuff and the guitars are almost completely pushed to the background to make room for the new, more expansive sound.But the new sound just gives more dimension to their always impressive songs. The Lips have to be one of the few bands remaining who consistently challenge themselves and try to do things different each time around. This is probably simultaneously their most accessible and most challengng release. And although I wouldn't call this my favorite Lips record, it's definately worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot stuff","review":"He always was a funny one, that Wayne Coyne. Despite the fact that there were only three members of The Flaming Lips at the time of recording The Soft Bulletin, at times the music sounds like it was made by 300. The lyrical content is on a different level from the average chart stuff - poetic and just a bit pretentious, but I guess that criticising them for pretentiousness would be missing the point. Couple of complaints, though. Why two versions of Race For The Prize and Waitin' For A Superman? As a statement of intent to release them as singles, yes, it works, but the additional versions (remixes?) don't really add anything. Just the thing to listen to when I'm feeling like a float in a lazy May parade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to stay sane by.","review":"I don't know what was going on in the minds of the Flaming Lips when they recorded \\"The Soft Bulletin\\" but it had to have been something good. Not very many bands can make a song that lyrically can make you think, and musically make you smile as well as the Lips. Besides, what other band writes battle hymns for wounded mathematicians, or try to lift up the sun even if Superman can't?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality is poor","review":"I own a vintage tube amplifier with a mullard driven pre-amp. I love listening to records through it.However this album did not pass grade. Dont get me wrong, I love this album but this pressing must have been poor.It sounds much better on CD than on this cut. Extremely trebbly and too much bass. Almost sounds like tin.It may be WB mastering though. I dont think they changed the mix for vinyl from CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album","review":"This is such a great album that makes me feel such a variety of emotions. I gave it 5 stars even though there are a couple songs I don't particularly like (\\"The Spiderbite Song\\" and \\"The Gash\\"). The rest of them are so good it's impossible for me to give it anything less. My favorite songs are \\"Feeling Yourself Disintegrate,\\" \\"The Spark that Bled,\\" and \\"Waitin' for a Superman,\\" but they're all wonderful. I had this album on repeat for a very long time, and I always enjoy listening to it these days as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"The Flaming Lips are amazing! This highlights some of there songwriting talents and combines a stellar array of musical instruments to infatuate the listener.

It's an absolute masterpiece. Definitely in my top 5 albums of the 90's and my first favorite Lips album (every one I listen to gets better and better)... If you like densely layered, well crafted, beautifully written music then there's nothing about The Soft Bulletin you won't like! Long live the Lips."},{"rating":"2","title":"one more word","review":"Clarification: Comparisons to Neil or Pink Floyd are fair and accurate (sorry).

Although there are a few high spots, each time I listen, I wonder what all of the fuss is about.

How disappointing it was! I'd save only 2-3 tracks out of it. Boring, full of honeyed orchestration, only a rough and ugly copy of the YES, a mithycal group of the seventies. What does THE SOFT BULLETIN have to do with rock?Wilco, Coldplay, Sparklehorse, Counting Crows, Porcupine tree, Beck, Smashing Pumpkins, even Train and Travis are very far better than this useless Flaming Lips.I know that all is subjective but before talking about \\"masterpieces\\", \\"album of the year\\" etc. one should think twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yow!

The sound is frequently inked by the accordion, but of course there are also electrical guitars, violins or a National Steel / Dobro in some bands.

I bike to work five days a week.I used the lock regularly for eight months until today, when I dropped the lock part without the shackle attached. This was the first time I had dropped it. The plastic cover of the lock broke into pieces and flew off in all directions. The key would no longer turn to close the lock with the shackle in place.Lock went into the nearest trash can and I hope to find a different brand that can make a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although I agree with the author that the idea of the immortal soul is of pagan Greek origin and not a Biblical truth - whereas the resurrection is - the arguments have been poorly constructed. This little booklet is simply not convincing and lacks Biblical support. It is largely philosophical in nature and therefore rather disappointing. If I knew upfront that it was only 60 pages, ie. 20 minutes worth of cursive reading, I certainly would not have ordered it. I believe the blurb on the booklet is misleading. I would not recommend it to serious readers of any persuasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Value","review":"Bought 3 headlamps, one for myself and 2 for my hunting partners.

It takes hours to adjust its temperature and so it's regularly off by 10-20 degrees. The other night it was 84 (by another thermometer) but the outdoor reading said 107!

Unfortunately, I was wrong. Fortunately, I only spent 4 bucks on it. This effort by the band Reveille is nothing that I haven't already heard 100 times over. It features the same formula of anger fed guitar riffs over rapping and scratching that holds no listening captivity whatsoever. If you dig the whole rap metal scene, then this might be an album for you to check out. Otherwise don't waste your time or resources. Its hard for me to understand how bands like this land spots at Ozzfest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Rage Against the Machine!","review":"\\"Laced\\" by Reveille sounds only somewhat like Rage Against the Machine. They are angrier and rock harder. This band from Massachusetts would fit nicely in a CD collection featuring Rage Against the Machine, Korn, (hed) pe, or anything else that rocks. All of their songs are powerful and rich in quality. The song \\"Splitt (Comin' Out Swingin')\\" even features B Real of Cypress Hill while other excellent songs include \\"Rise and Blind,\\" \\"Dark Horizons,\\" \\"The Phoenix,\\" and \\"Permanent (Take a Look Around).\\" This CD is a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great metal/rap band","review":"When I went to see the GODSMACK concert in Pensacola there were 2 bands oping up for them.

I wish to God that I could get my money back. They sound like a thousand other mediocre metal bands. Their guitar riffs are basic and boring, their vocalist tries way to hard to sound mean, and the songs have little variation to them. If you were to take Rage Against The Machine, Korn, and Helmet, smash them together, and send them back to the garage in their parents' house, then you'd get this band. Reveille's \\"Laced\\" is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rage Against the Machine","review":"Someone in a previous review of this CD said they dont understand why people are mad at Reveille for sounding like Rage Against the Machine. Well, I am not mad at them for that. I am mad at them because they stink, just like Rage Against the Machine does. When are these psuedo-hostile hip hop based wimpy rap rock bands gonna go away? Remember the Seattle Grunge scene? What do you think is gonna happen to Rap Rock? Same thing. Passing ... fad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the new rap metal bands","review":"Outside of Rage Against the Machine, I dont like most rap metal cause it all sounds like Limp Bizkit. But this, while it sounds a lot like RATM, is just too good to look over. The main difference is that the guitar sound is much heavier, and more rythmically oriented, and there are almost no weird guitar effects. Fans of Rage should definetly check this out, cause they would LOVE it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest all time debuts","review":"Reveille has become one of the masters of the rap/metal genre.

Goes over all the basics, but unfortunately just barely touches the more advanced stuff like air brushing. The book is also a little out dated concerning the various newer techniques like the \\"ninja hood\\" style mask and body part molding.

But it's a bit skimpy when it comes to us clay sculptors. Basically the latex chapter near the end is a bit too short for my tastes and doesn't offer the different ways of making latex or foam latex masks/props. Or other ways to make masks with clay and molds with different materials besides latex.It would have be nicer if that section had more pages to it. Overall the book is a great read and good resource. But does it need to be a spiral bound book? Why couldn't the book be bound normally with a protective cover like many paperback books?I've found that the book cover (front and back) picks up clay, dirt, and gets scratches in a sculpting class. So it's not a book to have on hand in a very hard work environment. If your in a place like that and care for your books, make sure to copy pages from the book and take the Xeroxed pages with you in class or work space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!","review":"I was ready for something light-hearted and entertaining when I came across this book. I won't recap the story for you, since I don't want to spoil the surprises, and surprises there are! I identified with the main character, Grace, and enjoyed her sense of humor. As a former romance addict I enjoyed this part as much or more than the action. Grace seemed to be laughing at herself and her attitudes towards this handsome, but somewhat dubious man who has entered her life. It was almost like sharing a few giggles with an old friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"While it doesn't remain exactly true to the mystery writing rules (there are people introduced too far into the novel), it has all the elements of a rollicking good romance with a charming romantic rogue, secret panels, English country houses, and sinister Sikhs.

High Rhymes and Misdemeanors, the initial book is full of action, laughs , chills and full of smart dialogue, twisty plot points and two of the most beguiling lead characters to come along in ages. Grace Hollister, American academic and Peter Fox, British former (he says)bad boy couldn't be more opposite. And you know what opposites do!Full of scenic atmosphere, the Lake District serves as a backdrop for the action as Grace unfolds a mystery involving Lord Byron that people are only to willing to kill for.I highly recommend this book. You will not be disappointed and will rush right out ( or order on-line) to get the rest of the Poetic Death series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grace Hollister--could never survive the real world","review":"I bought this novel based on the glowing reviews associated with it, and have to say I was somewhat disappointed. While the 18th century poetry and literature references were nice, they couldn't successfully neutralize Grace's utter daftness--she's like Daphne from Scooby Doo. If her character had only been a little smarter, I wouldn't have winced from page to page.As it was, all I can think is that Peter must enjoy answering inane questions and dealing with a ditz on a day-to-day basis. I don't mean to be cruel--just saying I think the book could have been better if the main character hadn't seen an enemy in everyone and everything.And you don't brown garlic!

If it's about white-skinned dj or something, but the rhythms and other sound selections work indeed. You can compare white-skinned dj's like DJ Muggs and O.G.Styles with others and you will find out that their sound world seems to be a bit more colorful. It's hard to find bad songs from this album. Latin sounds are just so irresistible. If you like Cypress Hill, Funkdoobiest or stuff like that, then take into deep consideration to add this band's records to your collection.

Yet it has such camp value that I never had it my heart to toss it. When one listens to it, they are warped to a strange demented world... What shocked me the most about this compilation; that it was created years after Disco, so I think it was someone's evil plan to \\"warp\\" music!If you ever find a copy, you either are very lucky, or insane, but none the less it's a great conversation piece. What demented mind created this compilation, we'll never know but at least we can have a good laugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Preparation","review":"I am new to slow cooking and got this book from the library to get some new recipe ideas. This book is very nicely arranged (separate sections for: bread/breakfast, soups, poultry/seafood, meat, pasta, vegetarian and dessert) with nice full color photographs of the food and nutritional information on each dish.Though it does contain many delicious sounding recipes, I was frustrated that nearly all of them require pre-preparation of the food beyond just browning meat or chopping vegetables. Nearly every one of the recipes I wanted to attempt began with \\"In a skillet....\\" Personally, I was looking for healthy recipes with minimal pre-prep that I could put together while my children napped or were occupied during the day and NOT what amounts to cooking an entire meal on the stovetop and then throwing it in a slow cooker.This would be a good purchase for someone with more time on their hands but for me, it just didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Purchase !","review":"One of the guidelines I go by is that if I can find one good recipe in a book it was worth the purchase - This was not !

I would go for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of uses for chicpeas and converted measurement recipes","review":"I was very excited to receive this book so quickly. Now I am sorry I bought the book. Immediately I noticed converted recipes and I see why other reviewers considered the ingredients uncommon. I like European food and actually lived in Europee six years, long enough to know the ingredients are package differently and the measurements are in metrics. There are Scottish recipes that lead me to believe the author is Scottish. I can see the recipes will not be widely appealing to American taste and use ingredients that while available are not common in USA. I am also fond of chicpeas and in fact have cans in my cupboard but there is a heavy use of chicpeas in recipes that I don't like. Check this book out at a library if your can before committing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy Cooking Made Easy","review":"I studiously avoided learning to cook for 50+ years but a friend who's very health conscious recommended trying a slow cooker. This cookbook gave me the additional boost I needed. Finlayson is very knowledgeable about nutrition, and somehow manages to make it interesting to read about. Plus, she gives tips on what to prepare the night before, so you can set up the crock pot in the morning, turn it on, and have a great meal by the time you get home. I love the Thai Pumpkin Soup, which has become a favorite in our household. If you're trying WeightWatchers point system, this has an abundance of good recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a beginner or if you want easy recipes","review":"Unfortunately I have to agree with \\"too difficult\\"s review.This book has wonderful recipes but they are more complicated than if you tried to cook them the standard way using a regular cookbook. This works for people who actually get home from work before 7pm or have time to prep for cooking. Could be a good weekend cookbook.Really it seems some of these things could be adjusted to the modern working person's lifestyle, it would be better if the cook book gave you alternatives to \\"browning seeds and grinding them\\"(!) Healthy cooking doesn't really require all that. But I plan to substitue here and there through out the book........ If I keep it.On the plus side: Lovely pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 3 or 4 dishes I would actually make","review":"If beans, lentils and other legumes aren't your thing then DO NOT get this book! Many of the recipes require some type of legume and a good portion require a trip to a more gourmet type store. Lots of fish recipes if you are a fish lover. Not too many for meat. The presentation of the book is excellent, with wonderful pictures, easy to read recipes, slow cooker tips and nutritional information, but I live in a house full of pretty basic eaters. While I don't want to dump chicken in with cream of mushroom soup and call it a meal, I also don't care to mix prunes and quinoa (who knew quinoa was so expensive?) with my chicken and have to locate 'herbs de Provence'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Weight Watcher Points Plus and low sodium diets.","review":"Great healthy slow-cooker recipe book. Recipes are easier than they look-not that they look complicated. Minimal salt used-most of which is in broths and canned whatever. Buy no-salt broth or make your own, recipe included. Pomi boxed tomotoes are very low in sodium. Prepare your own dried beans in bulk, freeze until ready to use. In fact you can make most of these recipes ahead of time and freeze in portions. May want to hold back a couple ingredients until ready to use ie: potatoes don't freeze well. Some fresh herbs are always an added plus when serving (especially if you are reducing sodium). Almost all recipes are less than 8 Weight Watcher Points Plus, with the average around 6 points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipes and very healthy!","review":"I have only tried two recipes, but they came up soo good! I definetly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too \\"gourmet\\" for me","review":"This is not a book for someone like me who wants to put together a meal quickly before leaving for work in the morning. Although most slow cooker recipes nowadays do require some advance preparation, such as browning meat or chicken, I draw the line at toasting seeds in a frying pan and then grinding them in a mortar and pestle. I can see where it would be a good book for someone with the time and inclination to do gourmet cooking, though, and it does provide a lot of nutritional information and tips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy cooking made healthy","review":"Although I purchased this cookbook for my parents to aid them in both healthy and easy cooking, I myself have tried several recipes and have been very pleased with the results. This book offers a wide variety of recipes to accommodate even the fussiest eaters and best of all the recipes are healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for regular use.","review":"Sadly, I have to agree with the reviews that say the recipes are overcomplicated and not for daily-type use. I was highly disappointed by this cookbook. Many of the recipes require a ridiculous amount of prep and effort (toasting seeds in a pan and grinding them with a mortar and pestle -- talk about completely missing the point of a slow cooker!) Quite a few use hard-to-find or specialty ingredients that can leave you scouring all the stores in town to find what you need and then paying an arm and a leg for it. No thanks. I'll be checking out some other slow cooker cookbooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed bag","review":"Some decent recipes in here but some real stinkers too. Better than most slow cooker recipe books but that's not saying much. Pasta with Syracuse sauce is quite nice. Meat dishes are generally better than the vegan dishes.The biggest single problem I see is the incessant use of cracked black peppercorns in almost everything. I just looked briefly through more than a dozen recipes and every one included peppercorns. Of course it's easy to omit the pepper, but it says a lot about the author that she thinks peppercorns should be included in everything. She seems to have a thing for celery too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of this cookbook","review":"I was excited to have a cookbook with healthier recipes than the traditional ones with lots of processed foods. Unfortunately this book has only a handful of recipes that I am interested in making -- an overabundance of recipes w/beans and legumes or ingredients that I am unlikely to have on hand in my pantry. Not the starter/beginner cookbook I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Favorite","review":"I have hundreds of cookbooks but this is the first I'm returning....hardly any recipes that I'll use, ingredients I don't keep on hand, and a lot of the recipes take more time than I have to pre-prepare for the slow cooker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I wouldn't have purchased","review":"Even after reading the other reviews I figured I'd give this cookbook a try because I really wanted something with healthy recipes I could make in my slow cooker. There are very few recipes I can even make. Most of the ingredients are impossible for me to locate. I'm all for gourmet food and being difficult to prepare isn't a problem for me either. I just need to be able to locate the ingredients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice book, but had to return it.","review":"I wanted to start the year off right by only cooking healthy meals in my crockpot. Although this was a nice looking book, with great pictures and details--I didn't find any of the recipes useful. After looking thru the whole book, I knew that this wasn't the cookbook for me. None of the recipes were those that my family would eat. I have a 7 year old daughter, and the ingredients in this book were not very kid friendly. I guess I was hoping for more \\"down-home\\", average recipes. If you are more of an adventurous eater, then I am sure you will like this book. As for me...my search is back on for a healthy, crockpot cookbook!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have bought if had \\"look inside\\"","review":"This is a note to the editor.

The flavors of the sauteed vegetables and meat are so much more pronounced and flavorful. Adding items during the last 20 minutes like peppers and seafood prevent them from overccoking and becoming mushy. I have found recipes in this book all don't taste alike due to the flavor layering. Yes, it does take more time than traditional slow cooker recipes but it is well worth the investment. I only make the recipes on Sunday so it's not a problem. I have also started to use the same cooking techniques with other slow cooker recipes. I have also seen new recipes requiring the same sauteeing requirements. I would definitly buy another of her slow cooker books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlaps with EMI's Very Best of Franco Corelli","review":"I would generally echo the superlatives bestowed upon Franco Corelli by the previous reviewers.

I would buy one or the other, but not both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strange, Very good!","review":"Despite being shot on digital video, these shorts feature artful compositions and editing.

Do not waste your money on this. I should have done more research before I wasted mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"I ordered two DVD's by this author and was disappointed by both. I found them to be well informed and delivered, but one sided. Had I known that they would be religious propaganda, I would have thought twice before purchasing them. A balanced delivery of history is not easy. Still this was clearly a view supported by and meant for the religious right. I will use this in my studies to inform this perspective on history. So, it's not a total waste. Still, I had hoped for more from such an all encompassing title and weighty online summary.

The context of the late colonial / early historic period in Mexico was a tearful time in the history of this country, and Padilla seems to have captured the beauty and depth of religious passion that prevailed at this time. This modern recording brings back to life the times of colonial Mexico, that have literally not been heard for hundreds of years.

Naw! The author HAS gathered some good pictures of the Stones, however, the synopsis of the songs is horrible. There are no quotes about the songwriting from either Keith or Mick; the comments are all the author's GUESSES of what the stones were writing about. Some of the comments are very trivial.

It's a cheap lie of a book that seems more like the concerted efforts of a fawning Amazon reviewer than a track-by-track insight. The author appears to conjure up the stories behind the songs based on magazine articles, random quotes, second and third-hand interviews, gossip, and God-knows what else. More than anything else, he merely describes the song (not very well, I might add), but in other cases he goes off on bizarre tangents.There's a particulary prescient comment he makes about one song that sums up the entire book, wherein he states: \\"Whatever the source material....\\"Exactly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another awesome product by Lodge","review":"My Wok is now my main cooking utensil (also helps that I cook authentic Chinese food).Once you use a cast-iron wok, you will NOT go back to using a steel wok.Please treat your wok properly by not cleaning it correctly, keeping it dry and seasoned with oil.

It has a flat bottom so you don't need a wok ring. The cast iron distributes heat extremely well. Being a Wok, it catches most of the splatter from high heat cooking.

Everybody knows that. What is so cool about this one is the cast iron. No other Wok, whether rolled steel or non-stick crapware aluminum can compare, period. The weight and mass of this Wok retain heat longer giving less of a temperature shift as you add and remove food while cooking. This means more consistent and predictable results making even a novice look (and taste) like a pro.It may even smooth out the weird pulse on/off heating thing electric stoves do, but don't quote me on that! So cast iron does make cooking on electric almost feasible but I personally would never have an electric stove in my house!REMEMBER! Slowly warm it up! Start on low until the pan stabilizes in temperature then adjust higher. Starting it directly on high or medium will result in it cracking.I will be buying all of my Lodge cast iron through Amazon now. The service was fast and I didn't have to around to different stores to find it, and this is a rare piece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very high quality - perfect for cooking","review":"As long as you don't mind the wok's weight which is expected for cast iron, I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT electric/induction friendly","review":"I do not feel well in complaining about this well-built item, but...The base is sooooo tiny that I imagine that it works perfectly on a flame based cook-top.

A few years ago I bought this heavy beast. It is unlike anything I've ever cooked on before. I agree with all of the other reviews on its versatility, non-stick, great heat retention etc. etc. So I'll just add one thing I didn't see in the other reviews. In addition to using this in the kitchen, I also use it on my grill. You can heat it to incredible temps & with its superior heat retention you can cook outdoors and avoid smoking up the kitchen. I really enjoy cooking with this monster, and my family sure enjoys the meals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the american flat top stove.","review":"Absolutely great if you have a glass, induction, or coil heating elements. Those with gas stoves should look for a wok ring and a lighter wok with the right curvature. Holds heat very well if you allow it to heat gradually for 10 minutes until stir fry heat levels. Heating too quickly will cause the bottom to heat up while the sides are cold. This will have a detrimental effect on the life of the wok and can crack it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wok You Can Buy","review":"I have owned 2 other woks before this one: the first was electric, the second was anodized, and now this one -- by far the best of them all. I was in a department store, looking at woks, when a guy noticed and told me about this one that he'd bought from Amazon -- at about 1/2 the price of the stainless steel versions in stores. I am really glad he spoke up, because this heats uniformly, cleans up beautifully, and the slightly rough texture allows the food that has already cooked to be pushed up the sides where it stays warm. I only wish it came with a lid, but I have the lid from my old wok and it's \\"almost\\" big enough to cover -- sits just inside the rim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cast-Iron NOT the best choice for a wok","review":"First, let me say that I absolutely LOVE Lodge cast iron. I own 11 different products of theirs. Good stuff! That being said, thick cast iron (as this wok is) is NOT the best material for a wok; in fact, it is a poor choice. Wok-cooking requires very high heat that can be replenished quickly as new ingredients are added to the wok. This cast iron wok will, with sufficient pre-heating time, get VERY hot but any liquid ingredients will quickly soak up the heat from the wok and it will take WAY too long for the wok to reheat. Believe me, I LOVE cooking with cast iron but this is not the right application. I would recommend using a carbon-steel wok from WokShop (available for purchase on Amazon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wok!","review":"This wok is quality! What makes it stand out is that it retains heat evenly even on a poor heating element. I have a very low BTU, apartment gas range that doesn't put out enough heat, but what's nice about this wok is that you can throw it into a preheating 500 degree oven for ten minutes and pull it out and be stir frying like a champ.I've used it to make meat sauces for spaghetti, stir fry, to fry eggs, boil water for ramen noodles... what haven't I used it for should be the question... This would make a great gift for someone just starting off as it really can be used for just about everything. And cleanup is really simple. Just follow normal cast iron care instructions. Truthfully this wok never leaves my range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy but worth it","review":"This baby is one heavy wok, but I love how it retains heat and just overall all the properties of well-seasoned cast iron so much that I don't mind scooping the cooked food out instead of being able to pour it out. It is a bit difficult to season evenly since the bottom half gets hot enough to season but the higher half all around doesn't get hot enough or doesn't get enough \\"cooking\\" done on it so it's not totally blackened with seasoning, but that doesn't really matter much. Highly recommend if you're willing to put up with the weight! And if you really know cast-iron (and know how to season it) and are a lover of it, you will love this wok. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I use this at home for asian or asian-ish dishes.

Think of you favorite cast iron frying pan formed into the shape of a wok, weighing 14 lbs. Although rounded on the inside, it's flat on the bottom, which caused the wok not to fit into the wok accepting grates on my gas range. Also, when the grate was in its flat position, his wok sat so high above the flame I thought it would take too long to properly heat. If this one is your cup of tea, I'm sure it's a great product, but I reordered the hand hammered 12\\" cast iron wok instead, seasoned according to directions, and so far the new item has been a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"some pits and If only come with a glass lid","review":"I ordered yesterday and it came today.

Can anyone tell me where I can find a glass lid for this wok?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I wasn't sure which wok to buy for a cook from China, but this turned out to be the right choice. It's big, it heats up well, it's mostly non-stick and cleans up nicely.Cast iron isn't for everyone. It is heavy and requires a bit of care, but if you like cast iron, this is a great wok. Also, it is just the wok--no lid, no accessories.This is good if you will use it often, probably not the best choice if you just need a wok a few times a year. It is big and requires a lot of place to store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, long lasting wok","review":"This wok is as sturdy as any cookware I've seen. It will last for generations with minimal care. The handles are more than adequate to support the weight of the wok. It is cast iron and it is large, which means that it is heavy, you'll need to use both hands to pick it up. It would not be a good choice for someone who can not lift heavy pots and pans, but for everyone else, I strongly recommend it. Cast iron, when properly seasoned (covered in cooking oil, stuck in the oven upside down and baked at a very low temperature for a couple of hours) is completely non-stick and cleans up easily. You can turn the temperature all the way up to properly sear meat food and not have to worry about it ruining the pan. The handles stay relatively cool compared to the body of the wok. The only things that would make this wok better are a rack and a lid.I am a very satisfied customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flat bottom for use on electric or gas stoves","review":"I could not believe I found a cast iron wok! Heavy - but that is the point and it eats even and stays hot. This is high quality - which I have come to expect from this brand. It is round on the inside, but has a flat bottom so you can use it on electric stoves as well. I use it on my ceramic top and it is great. Let it heat up well and stir fry away. I would definitely recommend and purchase again.UPDATE: I have used this several times, NOTHING sticks, it gets very hot for a true stir fry and cleans better than any teflon wok I have ever had.

The songs are nothing less than outstanding, especially Dreams to Dream, sung by Fievel's golden-voiced sister, Tanya, who is voiced by Cathy Cavadini.Fans of the original American Tail are bound to enjoy Fievel Goes West as well. It's a great movie for kids, or for anyone who enjoys a great animated flick! Highly recommended! (Oh, and check out the first American Tail movie as well, if you haven't already. It's just as good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome quality good price","review":"Recieved movie quickly and although it was used, it has no scratches and works perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, Fievel...come back east.","review":"For those of you who loved the original, and don't want to see the disspointment and the fact that this didn't live up to the first one at all, just skip this one nd move on the the third and fourth ones.Don Bluth should've watched who he gave the American Tail rights to. To get away from the violence of New York and to find new opportunity, the Mousekewitzes take a train out west to a town called Green River. Fievel gets tossed overboard mid-way through the journey.This is exactly what it appears to be - a bad western movie. The plot isn't good, the story never really gets off the ground, and while Dreams to Dream s nice, it's nothing special. So just skip this one - its not very well done at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"What's so great about this slow-moving and pointless movie?! It didn't keep my attention for even ten minutes!! And I'm usually good about these things, too...Tanya [is weak] at singing. The whole thing bored me to death. No one in my family ever watches this, so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did. Now I know Bluth has made MANY better movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This vacuum cleaner is a cheap piece of junk --- poorly made with little suction! I purchased it, sight unseen and without doing any research, because I wanted to have a second vacuum for the upstairs bedrooms for some light daily cleaning and thought any $100 machine (with a 12 amp motor) could corral a few dust bunnies, boy, was I wrong. Save yourself some money and aggravation and pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"very very best japan rock group","review":"this group is my favorit japan artist. it seems virous hit song in japan. many people likes B'z concert. if you are listing in B'z music, maybe get a lucky mind"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent bread keeper, but mind the size","review":"This bread keeper works well on fresh baked bread. It keeps loaves fresh and the clear body makes it easy to see how much bread is left to eat. The only downside is the relatively small size. Note that it's only 5.5 inches high and wide, which may be a problem if you use some types of bread machines. My Breadman Pro bread machine occasionally makes loaves too large to put into this container, which renders this keeper useless in those cases (I usually end up using a gallon-sized Ziploc container when that happens). If you don't bake giant loaves often, however, this is a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Circulon","review":"My husband and I purchased the Circulon electric skillet. We love it! I have fryed in it, made soup in it, pancakes turn out great, grilled cheese sandwiches don't burn and I've even popped popcorn in it. I've never had any problems cleaning the pan. I use hot soapy water and a sponge and sometimes a nylon scrub brush. My plan is to buy more of the Circulon products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Caphalon instead","review":"I bought a Caphalon skillet about 6 years ago at a half price outlet store. These pans are initially expensive but well worth the money. My kids have even put it in the dishwasher (against instructions) and I still don't have problems with it. It is the one pan that I constantly use. I'm planning on purchasing a whole set soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst customer service ever!","review":"I sent this pan back to Meyer because of flaking after taking extra care of it. Circulon offers a lifetime warranty so I figured why not. Well the Meyer corporation proceeded to lose my original skillet. Then refuse to even speak to me about replacing it. After waiting for an hour on hold the rude CSR simply said too bad and hung up on me. This is without a doubt the worst customer service I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Clean","review":"I have never been excited about a skillet or any pan for that matter but this Circulon Classic 12 inch skillet is the best! Food does not stick even due to the fact that you don't need to use oil or spray. You don't even need to cook on high. The pan attracts the heat so well that lower temperatures are perfect. All you have to do to clean it is rinse and wipe dry. Odors from the last food you cooked do not stick to it. I love it and want more pans like it. It is also very sturdy and heavy. Nothing cheap about this pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"12\\" French Skillet Disappointment","review":"My wife and I bought several open stock Circulon pans as we read reviews that were favorable. At first we really liked this pan, however after a few month's use, we began to notice that it was becoming very difficult to clean. The high-low cooking area was no longer very non-stick and the \\"lows\\" or grooves were very difficult to get clean. We tried brushes and scouring pads but the longer we used this pan, the more difficult it was to clean. We spent nearly $100.00 on this pan, but we rarely use it any longer because it has become so difficult to clean. For light use I suppose it would be a good pan, but don't use it every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Circulon skillets","review":"We bought a whole range. Both skillets now are full of stuck on food, despite lavish attention to cleaning and the purchase of the official Circulon bristley cleaner. A total rip off by the way, save some bucks and get a nail brush if you do buy the pans.One skillet was replaced under the lifetime warranty plan, but only after a bit of whining by the sales rep., who said we were not cleaning it properly. saucepans are fine as they only encounter food being boiled really. Add some oil and fry stuff, and forget it. My advice: money spent better elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've owned a set for over 5 years","review":"Circulon's signature groves work well for the first few years keeping damage to the non-stick surface coating to a minimum. However, after four to five years of regular use the non-stick surface loses its effectiveness and these groves then become nearly impossible to clean. We had bought an entire Circulon set and found the pots that we used regularly all failed within a 1 year from each other.We always use plastic cookware and never set the stove to more than medium when using any non-stick pot. We don't use any oil when cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lived finish","review":"After I purchased this pan at first I was delighted. However after less that a year, a third of the non-stick finish has lifted and flaked off. I called their warranty numher, 1-800-388-3872, only to find it no longer is accessible. I received a message that the number could not be accessed from my location in the US. I tried my MCI calling card and still no luck accessing their 800#. There is no email address or street address given on their web site either. POOR quality and NO service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say, this is a classic.","review":"Even though it's not very old, this game is a classic, the adventure is truly a blast, I've beaten this game over 5 times in less than the 2 years I've owned it. The basic plot of this game is that you (Jen) and your side-kick (Scree) explore four different highly detailed realms. Forest, water, haunted, and fire, is what I like to call them, can't remember the real names of them, and my PS2 isn't connected so I can't check, but basically those are what the reamls are. They each take well over an hour to beat, even when you know what you're doing. Another great feature in this game, is you get to control your side-kick \\"Scree\\" whenever you like, so basically you have 2 characters to pick from, having to switch to progress in the game. Ifyou don't already own this game, definitely pick it up, it's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game!","review":"I told people that I liked Silent Hill 2, GTA: Vice City, Final Fantasy X, and Devil May Cry (the first one!)...and they recommended this game.It's a true to form adventure game. Not necessarily another slasher. You don't have to slash if you don't want to. There's plenty of story (Funny characters and real humor), puzzles, beautiful scenery to keep your mind involved in this game. I give this game 4 out of 5 stars. Recommended.If you like slashers where that's ALL YOU DO. Go elsewhere. This is mostly an adventure game, not a first-person slasher/shooter."},{"rating":"2","title":"'' GREAT GAME , BUT TOO MANY DUMB PUZZLES '' !!","review":"I WAS REALLY BLOWN AWAY BY THE GREAT FIGHTING IN THIS GAME . AS WELL AS THE COOL FORMS JEN TAKES..BUT THE ONLY THING THAT MADE THE GAME A BIT BORING AT TIMES,WERE ALL THE ENDLESS PUZZLES YOU HAD TO DO THRU THE GAME.IT WAS FUN PLAYING AS SCREE , AND SOMETIMES DOING A BIT OF FIGHTING .. BUT HE SHOULD'VE HAD A BIGGER ENERGY BAR , OR MAYBE EVEN A SECOND ONE .THAT WAY IF YOU EVER NEEDED TO GET SOME OF HIS ENERGY AFTER A BIG FIGHT, YOU WOULDN'T COMPLETELY TAP HIM DRY.. JUST IN CASE YOU NEEDED SOME MORE ENERGY AFTER RUNNING INTO MORE DEMONS TO KILL !! PLUS A LOT OF THE TIME YOU STILL GOT LOST , USING THE MAP- OR YOU COULD NOT USE IT IN CERTAIN AREAS..BUT IT WAS ALSO NICE TO KICK DEMON ASS AS A DIFFERENT DEMON , RATHER THAN THE ONE YOU WERE FIGHTING . FERAI , AND DJINN ARE THE BEST FIGHTERS ..BUT DJINN HAVE SWORDS AND FERAI ONLY CLAWS.. THE WRAITH ARE COOL TOO WITH THEIR WHIPS..BUT ALL IN ALL IT WAS A COOL GAME AND GAVE ME LOTS OF FUN PLAYING IT.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this game","review":"I was very disapointed in this game. I bought it and was excited but found out fast that it wasn't at all what I thought it would be. You have hardly any control over your charactor. You can't jump or climb, the computer does it all!! You can only move your charactor(s) and when you get to the right spot the computer moves them for you. The fighting ... to, had some cool moves but nothing to write home about. I was very saddened for the graphics where great and so is the story but I like action and being able to explore with my charactor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What crack were you smoking when you thought this game was good?","review":"I bought this game after reading all of the reviews on here. I thought, wow, super, this game will be awesome. I played it for an hour and was bored....maybe this just isn't the type of game for me. Maybe I should have given it another try. Maybe it really is horrible. All I have to say is rent it. Save your money. Don't be stupid like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky clunky clunky","review":"The combat system in this game is sad, slow and clunky. In a the modern age of better, more smooth combat systems, this one is depressingly bad. I can typically tough it out for an interesting storyline, but I had to put this one down. Definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks like it's gonna suck.","review":"From the commercials and magazine adds, it looks like a boring and meaningless title. To skip or not to skip? I'd say skip. Sony's capable of making much better games than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Glitchy","review":"I agree with all the reviews that this game has great voice acting and environment, so I won't beat a dead horse.The problem I had with this game were some of the glitches I encountered. For example, a couple times when I switched characters, I ended up in a blank space outside the game environment and I had to save and reload my game. Also, there were a few times when the characters \\"stuttered\\" and didn't say the full sentence they are supposed to say (good thing I used subtitles).I worked as a game tester and I know that these errors are considered critical and most companies would never release a game until these problems were fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Primal: A watered-down Kain","review":"Folks, if you were going to purchase Primal to fill that adventure/exploration gap in your PS2 life, save your time and money. While Primal did add some interesting twists on explorative/gothic gameplay, it still falls short of being a title worthy of hard earned cash. Interesting and often beautiful environments are a plus here... but the figthing system is lame and repetitve, and the puzzles hardly merit mention. There is no sense of addictive fun or excitement in Primal. - The stop and start brawls with easy-to-kill monsters gets old really fast. This game is mostly comprised of clever cut-scenes and too much walking around. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was caught inside this one","review":"I have just finished the game and must say, from a female point of view, I loved it. If you are looking for a game that will take a part of you in with it, then this is the game for you. I will tell you now if you are looking for high action this is not what you want. Far more puzzle solving and exploring skills are needed. You do battle, but they are not so difficult that you are stuck for days on them. The graphics are great and you enjoy the images of four main world, which harbor many different races of deamons. Jenn, your main character, can change into other deamon forms as the game progresses; and each come with their own special moves. She grows on you.To help you on your quest for a new RPG I want to tell you that I am a die hard Final Fantasy fan. I began this game after finishing FF10. I was so excited to find another game that intrigued me. I can't wait for the next instalment and suggest that you trust your instincts and take a chance on this one....:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"game tries to be \\"cool\\" but falls way flat. the main girl voice actor is incredibly annoying, its the first time i ever skipped cut scenes i hadnt seen before. her dialog is just so lame, they tried sooo hard to make this game \\"hip\\", but ended up being about as hip as my grandmother doing the macarena"},{"rating":"1","title":"glitch galore","review":"I was really having fun with this game. The graphics are pretty good and it kept me going, trying to figure out where to go and what to do. It gets sort of tedious after awhile having to go back and forth and fighting is sort of dull, but I did enjoy playing it. I started running into glitches once I got into the second world. I hade to restart once because for some reason I got stuck in some \\"nowhere zone\\" with no way out. Then right after I fight the boss and save, I go to the top of this tower where only the other character \\"scree\\" can get to. The only problem is, I cannot select him no matter what I do. So needless to say, I've come all this way for nothing so I am very disapointed indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Primal","review":"I like the demons and I always liked a dark, cryptic type of games. And well this is one I had my eye on for a while. Like Diablo and Devil May Cry, I liked the type of games where you are only you against legions of enemies. And well I give this game a 5 stars cause I wanted too."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Did it","review":"They spend so much time with this game making it , trying to make it as good as it could be and they did. They only thing wrong is the slightly \\"blocky\\" movements that the main character makes when climbing or coming don off of things. Primals Exploration is amazing, it makes you feel very interested in whats coming up in the game. Primal combat system is innovative, and the graphics are some of the best I've ever seen on PS2. This game is a fantastic game and I think people who love adventure games would be foolish to pass it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"love stinks","review":"this is possibly the most sickening compilation i've ever heard. while there are some good bands and singers on this cd, the songs are their weakest. if you love silly love songs like \\"i wan't to make it with you\\" then this cd is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lights work fine. But mounting piece is a cheap piece of plastic","review":"The lights are fine. The thing you attach to your bike that you mount the light on is cheap. You can't easily take the light on and off your bike. Mine broke the second time I used it. I have no bike light to compare this to, so maybe they are all like this. But this thing is a piece of junk in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was in very good condition, just like it was described","review":"This is a best product that I have bought.

The cheap plastic breaks easily. The shells are hard to separate to change batteries. The attachments to the bicycle break. The light is bright, but not worth the price. The rear light is broken. The front is held by packing tape. However, the lights are bright and good for protection. Shame on Bell. Spend a few more dollars for better quality that will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap price, really cheap parts, poor design","review":"I had to return this product on the day I received it from amazon.When I opened up the product to insert the battery, the light set literally crumbled in my hands. And I was being careful.In my disbelief I inspected it further and new pieces kept falling apart. The very tiny and cheap plastic piece holding the bulb fell apart next, the tiny metal and precariously soldered piece holding the circuit just gave up doing what it was made to do. And all this 10 minutes out of the package.God forbid I actually have to mount this thing on a bike and expose it to the elements.I returned it immediately. Poor product, poor experience and I had to eat the shipping cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-engineered piece of crud","review":"My main issue is with the tail light. You can't just turn it on and off. You have to cycle through all the blinking options (7) in order to turn it off. Plus, you can't do this quickly because sometimes the inconveniently placed, micro-sized on/off button gets stuck inside the casing--especially when trying to go through the stages quickly. And forget about messing with this light if you are wearing gloves."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK rear tail light, poor quality headlight","review":"The tail light has worked well for quite some time, has many light modes, and stays on the bike well, but its construction is not that great so I'm just waiting. The headlight is another story.This was given to me as a gift and that's the only reason I have it. I've never known Bell to make quality bike parts and the headlight is no exception. As others have noted, the lamp mounting design is terrible where it easily falls off while you are riding and ends-up into a bunch of pieces when it hits the ground or you run over it.I've been able to keep mine working by taping it together, but finally I took a fall the other day and the base of the light that slides on to the handlebar clip broke into a million pieces (very cheap plastic construction) and no amount of tape/glue/etc will ever hold it. Also had on my bike a Cat Eye LED light (that I've had for years) that took even more force from the fall and it wasn't even scratched."},{"rating":"2","title":"People, it's under $15...","review":"I have nothing to complain because it only cost under $15. Battery is hard to change but hopefully I don't need to change often. Way too many modes so it takes time to turn off. Overall, a great value for what's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after one ride","review":"Perhaps the build quality on these lights is spotty, and that accounts for the wide range of opinions on it. Mine broke after I got back from the first ride. The front light part of it became loose, and fell, and it does not work any more. I would not buy this item. In the time it did work, I thought the beam of light was much too diffuse. I have previously owned a cateye light, and it was much more sturdy and had a better beam of light."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be a zero star ratting","review":"The light itself is so-so. The mount is cheap and poorly designed. I put one on my Stepdads bike it fell and broke on the 3rd week.Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a good price & regular use","review":"The product is a great value for money. Placing the batteries is a bit tedious though the batteries do last long enough. I never have had any problems with either of them. Plenty of diff. rhythms/sequences for both the lights. The flexibility to use the Xenon Bulb or the LED's comes in quite handy.I wish it would have included the batteries though. The headlamp needs 4 AA batteries while the tail lamp takes 2 AAA batteries.I would definitely recommend it since it's adequate for regular use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to keep on the bike","review":"This is an overall good light. The only problem with it is the clamps that are provided. If dropped, the light breaks into pieces that can be put back together again, but that takes time. Is not user friendly to other clamps. The light is good but the clamps make it not worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA","review":"The front light was DOA and the back light took me a day to figure out. I resorted to finding instructions written by previous owners.The back light seems to be working just fine. I've not yet mounted it but that appears to be the consensus with previous reviewers. Flipping through the various light modes I felt like Kate Reid in the Andromeda Strain. It's BRIGHT & I'm seeing more stars than this product's reviews.You get what you pay for, basically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Night-Riding Lights.","review":"Several light patterns for visibility, very bright when turned to steady on with no flashing. Got it for my wife's hybrid bike and it works very well, no issues at all, I'm completely satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for your dollar","review":"I have to be honest, I was skeptical about how bright these lights were going to be once mounted. The LED setting is easily bright enough to light your way down city streets, and the trail light setting is easily bright enough for anything else. Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes, as long as they're not looking for a $110 pair of trail lights. If you're an avid trail rider, I'd suggest you look elsewhere, for night-time city riders, this set is all you'll need to be noticed and see where you're going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither piece fit my bike","review":"The lights on this thing work. That's nice. However, neither of the fittings are big enough to fit my bike. I have an Iron Horse Competition mountain bike.

I'm stuck with a useless set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough light for back roads.","review":"My husband bought this for me for my commute home from work. Although it is fine on main city streets, once I turned onto my cross street, (no street lights) I was pretty much on my own in the dark. Cars would be able to see the light in the dark, but it wasn't powerful enough to illuminate the street before me. I am returning it after one use."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of crap","review":"At first I thought this was a great light, very inexpensive, pretty bright, several modes and all. I bought it becuase I always ride home after dark, and I wanted to see ahead of me, and let cars see me. First of all, it isnt all that bright to see the road in front of you, but more than bright enough for cars to see me. Second of all, the day I bought it, I was riding home and as I was cornering,it came right out of the clip that holds it and went underneath my tires and broke. I was very disapointed. The same day. What a piece of crap.P.S. From all the use I gave it, the tail light worked great."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for -- cheap and fragile","review":"Very poorly constructed switch. Press it just a little too hard and its internal glue breaks. After that it lets rainwater in to short everything out. Not a terrible unit for the price if you are very careful with it and never use it in the rain. Flashing mode is adequate for letting people see you, but not otherwise particularly bright. It's an inexpensive unit that may last a couple of months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Flawed Bell Product","review":"Back in 2005 when i bought my 1st Bicycle i also got this light combo(Whereas my front light was gray in hue,unlike the black/gray one you see here)thinking it was a good buy,wrong!This product is as shoddy as most \\"BEll products\\" are.The rear light went out first,then the front light shorted out after a minor drop.Later after having my bicycle stolen while using a Bell bike lock i've learned not to trust the viability of \\"Bell products\\" ever again.That's why i'm now a \\"Cateye's\\" and \\"Nite Ize\\" product fan.Learn from my mistake and avoid buying this product at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable.","review":"Fell apart the very first day I used it.

If I go to a retail store locally, I pay *the same price* for ONE battery as they cost between 5-10 bucks EACH. So I can get 50 for the price of 1?! I will never buy a battery at a retail store again. Who in their right mind would pay 10x as much for the same product. (1000% markup! Retail average is %50 markup, I am a small business owner.)

I wasn't expecting stellar batteries for the price but would have preferred ones that didn't explode.

Mainly, I bought it because of all the great reviews it got here on Amazon, pretty much everyone rates it above 4 stars.I myself didn't find anything particularly especial about this movie. Cheekie is just another average superficial soft porn movie. All of the carachters are very one dimensional and predictable. Most disappointing is the fact that you keep waiting for the plot to thicken at some point but alas.I personally would've liked to see something develop with Moira's husband or at least something with Moira herself.Even the sex scenes --specially the oral sex ones-- were very badly acted.In my opinion there 100s of European titles that deliver a better punch for your buck.2 out of 5 stars for me and only because the leading character was really beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"unrated not uncut","review":"Although this is a good movie it is not an uncut version.

The movie lived up to the Nudity expectations that I had for it (from reading other reviews). However, the movie falls \\"flat on its face\\" when concerning the plot. For me, the plot was uninteresting and about an 1/8 of the way into the film, it started to feel like a chore to finish it.After finishing the movie, I can say that: while there is a bunch of nudity in the film, the \\"nude\\" factor actually became boring for me about halfway through the film, because all I was thinking by that time was \\"please be over (the movie, not the nudity)\\", since the plot was that BORING.So, to wrap it up, if you are a Tinto Brass fanatic, then, by all means, try it. If your a normal \\"joe-schmoe\\" movie watcher (like me), you might find the film very uninteresting (eventhough there is nudity)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for your buck.","review":"I have had these speakers for about 6 months and they are working well.

Install time for all four sides was less than an hour.

I was a little concerned about buying them because of some negative reviews about the bass output. I have found they provide much better bass then the OEM speakers. Maybe the people posting the negative reviews didn't have enough power to properly push the speakers. The only problem I had was that even though they were supposed to fit my son's 2000 Ford Contour, I had to drill an extra hole or two because the mounting hole locations didn't match up. The OEM speakers were mounted with three screws while these speakers mount with four. That was really just a minor hassle, though. For the price, these are great speakers. I paid twice as much for a pair of two-way Pioneer speakers that can only handle half the output and don't have as good of a high end."},{"rating":"2","title":"PYLE 6 X 8 speakers","review":"Big Bang for the Bucks.

These sounds fine, especially with a cheap 10\\" Sub handling the bass in back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good factory replacement","review":"I bought these for my 2007 Ford Edge SEL after reading many reviews stating that they are a massive improvement over factory speakers using a stock head unit. My left door speaker was rattling and needed to be replaced. Stating with just that one, I put the new one in and when I tested it, it was much quieter than the rest. Increasing the volume only made it distort. Perhaps it's because I don't have the power (amp) to push them but nonetheless, if your looking to improve on your factory stereo by simply adding these speakers, you'll likely be disappointed. Also, they cannot be returned.per Amazon: \\"For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.

You get what you pay for with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"I got these for my ford Fusion to replace the Blown OE speakers in the front door ,however they didn't quite make the grade because the factory speakers are a component set up with the Tweeters mounted at the top of the door panel.

Naturally, as I started listening to more jazz, I wanted some Hawk for my collection.If there is a better record out there, I have yet to hear it. The warmth, richness & elegance of Hawkin's playing hardly seem like something of this world. The supporting cast is stellar. Another reviewer put it well, there is not a wrong note on this album.

From a technical viewpoint the Detectives in the story live from one cliche to the next, and the medical aspects seem like they are taken directly from the E.R. At first I was amused at portions of the story I felt contained errors, then as the story developed I turned the pages rapidly to see what was next. The author's style takes some getting used to, and is certainly not what I have become used to in recent years. I hestisitate to mention the number of sensibilities violated by this work.

I search for the best of the best. I read the reviews here, but rarely am I inspired to take the time write a review ... unless I discover a true gem. Disks like these are why I fell in love with the genre. Silky smooth flow, quietly pumping groove, perfection that lifts the soul and moves the body. It's spiritual. Forget about limiting boxes to fit music into neatly organized categories - this transcends that, and trancends you. This is what it's all about, brutha. Simply inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just might be as good as the original...","review":"It took me a while to warm up to the East Coast version of Northern Exposure. It seemed different than the first. Seems I had too many expectations. As is often the case, I eventually tired of the music in my collection and gave this one a new spin. It was great and keeps getting better.It covers more terrain the the first, mixing many different styles together in one mix, taking you up, down, funky and melodic within an hour's time frame. Doesn't seem like it should work but it does. It all builds towards a tremendous finish with the last three cuts.This is Sasha and Digweed achieving their peak.

There are all of the favorite villains and heroes(?) involved in their convoluted adventures attempting to do what they deem as good. This stuff requires a thick skin with an open mind hanging in the residue of a previous or newly found brain energy. The characters are all well developed and sure to entice everyone with their intriguing dialogue and antics. The drawing is superb and should be enjoyed by casual art goers and especially comic fans.

Grammatical errors abound (whatever happened to good editing?)and there are several instances where the author contradicts his earlier statements. More importantly, the author never explores comments made by the key characters, asking why they felt certain ways or to explain and support their position. This is a glaring omission; especially when judicial misconduct or corruption is alleged.My advice - check to book out of a library rather and spend your money on one of the other book recommended by reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, liberal nonsense","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but after only about twenty pages, it was evident that the author was going to go on and on about how conservative white guys are the cause for all the problems with the Chicago legal system. And yet the author also lets us know early on about the sadistic and cruel black jailers that inhabit the bowels of the Courthouse. These \\"jailers of color\\" treat every new arrest (no matter what race) like garbage, and yet, white racism is cited early and often in this book as the reason these folks are in jail.

No, I am not a flaming liberal, but a die-hard Republican. If this book can convince me that things need to change, I believe that is a pretty good indicator as to the depth of the problem.

Most parts, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry as it became evident that there's very little justice that really goes on in our justice system. All of the hidden agendas uncovered on the part of the judges, attorneys, police officers and even courtroom clerks is very disturbing when we consider that we are at their mercy to administer laws, justice and legal representation fair and impartially.

Maybe he could learn a few words and phrases that just might be invaluable. (When travelling to any foreign country, a little language is like a little money; much better than none at all.)The content of the book is divided into three columns on each page. The first column has a military acronym such as PX. The second column translates the aconym into English words, Post Exchange. The third column translates the English words into Arabic, which I cannot understand nor reproduce here.In someone spoke English and Arabic and was mystified by American military acronyms, this book could possibly be useful.On the other hand, if someone (who speaks no Arabic) is looking for an English-Arabic word and phrase book that could be studied to pick up a few Arabic words and phrases because they are going to be deployed, this book is 100% and totally useless.

This book is so basic, much too elementary for anyone who already owns a cat. Really. In two years I've learned more from my cats than this book could tell me. The information level is cursory, and in some cases, spotty. It was published in 1992, so there's NOTHING here about breakthrough medications for flea and heartworm prophylaxis.

They also look MUCH nicer. So why are the All-Clad so much more expensive? The only reason I can see is that the KitchenAid set is made in Thailand and the All-Clad set is made in the USA. All things being equal I would buy made in the USA, but in this case the KitchenAid product is clearly a better product at a lower price. The only All-Clad set priced similarly to the KitchenAid line is Emerilware, which not coincidentally, is their only non-US made product (Korea).I would compliment this set with a few nonstick pieces as the cleanup with the saute and frypan can be messy.

How the heroine felt about how the hero will be and how he treated the baby like he did his dog, talking to the baby the same way, and about how each were unloved by their parents. There was no romance in the story. I did not feel a connection through them and the only part I did even remotely like was the end when Charlotte was talking to her brother. Even that was far fetched seeing as she is 3 and can no way articulate the way she was, it seemed she was 6 or 7 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"KD fan wrenches","review":"This set is not for the 1999-2000 7.3.

The vendor whom I purchased the set from did a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"I found this book grabbed my interest and I couldn't put it down until I read it twice. The appeal of this book lies in the author's ability to translate his pursuit of the fullfilment of his fetish into the universal condition of humanity. It makes you re examine your search for happiness and materialism. It illustrates the truth in the age old cliche \\"beware of what you ask for because you might just get it\\". Sometimes what we think we want is just blocking the truth of who we are. Styranka's writing is direct, unpretentious and a pleasure to read.

The chords are simple but the nuances, the details make the songs unique. It's got so many potential singles that I just don't get tired of it a month after I bought it. Not many bands like this around. How do they make such powerful music without extensive usage of distortion? I wish I could listen to it when I'm surfing.

It also contains typos that should have been easily caught during proofing. Example: Anthony Shriver \\"was born in 1965...\\" Further down on the same page you will find this sentence: \\"In February 1965, he was quoted in People magazine...\\" Please!

The information is as old as the assasination of John Kennedy and there is so little about the younger generation that you will find absolutely nothing new in here.

She has an antique shop, runs a tavern, all in a nice rural setting in New Hampshire. But she does one stupid thing right after the other. She gets rammed on a snowy road, meets a bad guy alone at night, follows another one and rescues him from drowning when he wrecks his car, gets shot at, buried in snow, etc. Even after each of these things happens to her, she does the next dumb thing. She has a cop/friend, goes off to a dance with him without even telling him about her horrendous adventure of that day. Her dog is the best thing in her life, mostly because he's smarter than she is. This is the first (and last) in this series that I will read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent captivating adventure. A must read.","review":"I've read this book three times now and it never fails to lock me into the story. It's a story with depth and character that you just don't find on the shelves these days.

A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!","review":"This book takes the reader on a adventure seldom matched in fantasy novels. It kept me interested through to the very end. I honestly couldn't put it down! I can't rave enough about the story ... it pulls you in and you feel the emotions, both good and bad vividly and in full color. There are no 'down times' to give you a breather ... it forces you one after another into the fast paced danger and thrills that fill it! 5 stars, Mr. Lawson!Robin"},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely for pagans","review":"This book wasn't what I thought it was going to be but with out giving anything away, it has amazing conversations about paganism and the burning times.

The author is obviously a very imaginative person as can be seen by the creation of another language for this book as well as some very intriguing games. I would be interested in seeing a full book of rules for Matu-catu. Easy to get lost in this world of fantasy and was one of those books that I looked forward to spending time with each night reading before going to bed.

Like most other reviewers say, rap, rock, and unimaginable, awkward sounds and noises mix together making this cd an inch away from being a complete mess. Probably, the only tracks that are satisfactory is the main theme, the pokerap and what kind of pokemon are you. That's about it. From a scale 1 through 10, I have to say that this soundtrack would definetely mark the open #TWO space, meaning one point away from disaster. Thanks for your effort, producers, but we'd rather stick to some normal soundtracks.

But, I am so glad I didn't pass this one up. This is one that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. There is no violent language, which is nice, and the music keeps you in a cheery state of mind. :) My personal favorites are: the opening theme, Double Trouble (Team Rocket,) the Pokemon Dance Mix, Together Forever, My Best Friends, Pikachu's Goodbye, and Viridian City. So, even if you're not a pokemon fan - I'd still reccommend the album, as it is one that will stay in your CD player for a long long time. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"PUUURFECT!","review":"THIS IS GREAT!

I'm a 25-year-old professional who's hooked on a kid's show. Picked this CD up after hearing some of the \\"Pikachu's Jukebox\\" segments following the cartoon, and it's a lot of fun. The cute, peppy, sometimes just plain corny songs reminded me of nothing so much as the Buckner & Garcia \\"Pac-Man Fever\\" album I listened to as a kid in the early 1980s... any other adults out there remember this one? My favorite track is the Team Rocket song; I love those three on the show, they're such great characters, and hearing them rap is hilarious. The whole disc is great for kids, nothing for parents to be concerned about (face it, there are much worse things for kids to be into than Pokemon). Also recommended for kids-at-heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLOOD of MEMORIES!!","review":"Sadly, I'm 15 years old. And I'm not going to lie -- I'm not into Pokemon anymore.

Unfortunately, ages ago it had gotten damaged to the point where it was unuseable. I was happy to see that it was on here and at such a decent price. So I jumped at the chance to purchase it. I am very glad I got it too. The star off, is when I got it, it had a crack in the side of the case. But nothing major, and the CD was in perfect condition.

Other songs like \\"Double Trouble\\" and the Pokemon Dance Mix are all right, but not spectacular. You're probably asking right now \\"Then what is this good song you were talking about?\\" The answer: \\"The Time Has Come\\". I'm just about to graduate high school, so I know what it's like to have to say goodbye to a best friend. I can relate to this song, and that's why I like it.

Children do not need this in their young age. It seems that children have become \\"Pokefanatics\\". We at the Government of Fads do not approve of this behavior. Children have become ripoffs and con artists. Suppose a young child is giving away a fifty cent card for an fifty dollar card. Now when the child finds out about this, he will break into tears. Doesn't that make you sad. Childern have to focus on their work in school, not Pikachu. We have seen many fads in this decade alone, but nothing like this. You cause uproars in schools.

This C.D. STINKS!!! The song 'What Kind of Pokemon are You?\\" has TOO many plays on words, such as a \\"Muk\\" is gonna kick your Grass sounds to much like a Fu-k is gonna kick your A-s. Call me old-fashioned, but the children of today DO NOT NEED to hear things like that. It makes it seem acceptable to hide it behind a childrens show but instead is very INSIDEOUS and ultimately leads the child to believe things of the nature are 'OK' when they are really not.

They are too making the world better,and being caught up in a fantasy world with magical powers from the lush grass in the shade of mt moon(that was from Song of Jigglypuff)is better than living in reality where everyone has to be mean to eachother. Most Pokemaniacs(not Pokefanitics,you got our title wong)are immune to teasing from other kids because they can always quote characters to defend themselves and it always makes them feel better.

After VERY closely inspecting the disc, I found a small bubble in the imulsion over the disc's ID band just inside of the hole near the center. I sent an e-mail to Bandai Customer Service and received no response. After two weeks, I sent another. After another two weeks, I sent another.

Witch Hunter Robin was recommended to me by a fellow lover of the more serious type of anime. I didn't like it; I found the plotline to be predictable and forced with a 'so-that's-it?' ending I hated.The animation is top quality with lots of dark tones and the music is appropriately spooky. Good visuals don't make up for bad story though. This serious drama geared is towards adults, and not children. If you like dramatic build-up that delivers, humor, or romantic comedy give this a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts slow, ends strong","review":"Witch Hunter Robin is an acquired taste in anime-some dislike its visual style, while others rave about it, some find the stories flat, while others think the plot is brilliant. I think WHR is a more cerebral series than anything else. It has action, certainly, but much of the movement of the plot is between the characters' lines, and in their interactions with each other and the world around them. Robin herself is thrust into fighting people whose powers sometimes eerily resemble her own without knowing why. It is the process of Robin's self-discovery (and the ultimate revelations about herself, STN-J, Orbo, and more) that makes this series captivating. The unique character designs, beautiful artwork and animation, and brilliant soundtrack by the ever capable Taku Iwasaki are just icing on the cake. As I said in the title, this series starts slowly and ends on a very strong note, but the real beauty is in the journey between the two points."},{"rating":"2","title":"modern thriller","review":"I started this anime by renting the first disk -- and decided about 4 shows in to buy it.

First off ALL characters were likable...there was not one character who did not fit in the whole ordeal. Second, the music is great, it's perfect for the atmosphere!!! The show has a great setting (great atmosphere and mood)...and it's a good mystery show. I was having sooo much fun with it and therefore expected a lot from the story (since there was lots of mystery and suspense) but I was pretty disappointed with the story....In genereal great show!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest anime ever made!","review":"Witch Hunter Robin, The Complete Collection is finally out. I've been waiting for a collection like this to come out since I seen all 26 episodes on Cartoon Network channel, on \\"adult swim\\". I was very very happy watching the whole series because I am a fan of action, anyone that is a fan of action would find this series excellent. It is a cartoon or anime which is Japanese animation but the characters, storyline is very real and watching it is a real adventure. It does not \\"drag\\" like some movies I've seen but maybe just a little bit. The characters voices are absolutely perfect for the characters. The only unfortunate thing is, is the ending is pretty dissapointing.

As a reader, you want the good guys to triumph over the evil doers, unlike some of the other fantasy books I've read, where you rooted for the bad guys, and wanted the good guy to meet his end in the most horrid way possible. My only problem, where the hell is the sequel? It's only been three years since the second book was first released.

They do not.My advice : spend a few extra dollars for quality, go with a known good name brand i.e. kenwood"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice replacement for old stock speakers","review":"These are a 1,000% improvement on my old stock speakers! The price was cheaper than some crummy Walmart off brand name that I'd never heard of before. Hooked to a Kenwood 4x50 deck, there is lots of bass (too much, actually, I've got rattles in the doors I didn't know about before...) and the midrange and tweeters are giving me sound I hear on the hom stereo, but not in the car before. Highly recommended, although for my 1998 Ford Contour SE, I did have to drill holes for one set of the speaker holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers for the price","review":"I purchased these for a 1995 Mustang - they bolted right in and since I was replacing other aftermarket speakers hookup was easy. The sound is very clear, with excellent highs and good mid range. The bass is nothing to write home about, but I'm running a sub so the Pyles are just what I wanted.I originally thought my car had factory paper cone 5x7s in the doors. When I pulled the panels, I found TEMPO 57C MOREL speakers sitting in there and those are (were) $200 speakers. I hooked up a Pyle in one side and Tempo 57C in the other, and the Pyles sounded much cleaner and louder - so the Morel's came out and the Pyles went in!Of course these aren't audiophile speakers, but the price and sound is right on the money if you're running a sub and want to fill out the front of your cabin with clean sound on a budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love KitchenAid But....","review":"I love KitchenAid, but this grill pan was not for me. It would not sit evenly on my ceramic cook-top out of the box. The handle appears too heavy on the end. It would not be much of a problem on a gas range, but a real disappointment for me. This led to uneven cooking and some burning in the pan. And with the grooves, this pan is exceptionally tough to clean relative to the flat five-ply 12 inch skillet. Even if the grill pan sat evenly on my range, the cleaning of the pan was certainly a major drawback to using this pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for teachers","review":"I purchased this set for my daughter, who is an elementary school teacher.

Not being a Dylan fan, and never having purchased a Tzadik CD, I did not know what to expect. I am familiar with 'Ballad of a Thin Man,' but not with the other Dylan tunes. The music is fresh, stretching but not breaking the jazz envelope. The players are technically adept and creative. The drum tones hint of 'Bad Plus,' but I thought this approach was more polished. This recording is clearly a labor of love from very fine musicians. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio Mic & Cable bag","review":"Should of gotten a little wider bag to carry my Microphone and cable.

When trying to carry the bag in \\"messenger mode\\", the strap quickly cuts into the side of your neck (I believe someone else also left a similar comment about the strap), but this is really extreme.

It is easy to access the bag on the plan and the padding is sufficient to protect the items inside from casual bumps when boarding. I have had several messenger bags but did not like to have to open the flap to access my iPad. With this bag, the flap is only for accessories. Your iPad or small notebook can be accessed by a zipper on the very top of the bag.

The Ideas exist but they bore the heck out of you with the same thing over & over & over again, how uninteresting. And you people call that art? The music in itself all sounds very cheap. Please dont get me wrong cuz I love DB, but this stuff is just ridiculous. Altogether, It's just a darn shame drum and bass has to sound like this when we all know it has SO much potential.Now, if you like D'n'B thats simply fun and yet artistic, get DJ DB's shades of technology. I listen to any music with some degree of artistic intelligence and that cd barely slides by alright.

The title attracted my attention as well as the cover art. The cover even stated that The Village Voice had selected this title as one of the top 25 books of 2004. (Shame on the Voice)! So the story began. I liked the way the author relayed the events through chat room discussions. However, as the book progressed some of the violent sex acts reported were a complete turn-off for me. If you like reading about interesting sexual encounters this book certainly has its fill, but when we start getting into castration and the killing of male escorts this is where I have to draw the line for myself. If this sort of thing gets you going I highly recommend this piece, otherwise, forget it!

And, of course, I finally got the first two set and then the third only halfway, but the threads were stripped such that I could not get the screw the rest of the way in and could not remove it either.

Not great, just good. Before all of you Steve Cole fans attack my opinion, consider this. The man has talent in spades as a performer, and his writing's not bad either. But it seems a little anti-climactic overall. The softer tracks on \\"NY LA\\" (\\"Love Letter\\", \\"Missing You\\") are the most fulfilling, along with \\"Keep It Live,\\" an extended jam featuring Brevi and Aloe Blacc. But most of the uptempo tracks tend to blur together, and the tracks with vocals are trying way too hard to be hip. If you like smooth jazz saxaphone in the manner of Boney James and Nelson Rangell, or Cole's other albums, you'll like this one.

My hat is off to Mr. Cole for an awesome CD. If you liked his other releases, you will be blown away by the pure energy of NY/LA. Cole takes a bit of dance, a bit of R&B;, and a bit of soul and this is the result. I have been waiting almost impatiently for this CD to come out ever since I heard \\"Off Broadway\\", and let me tell you, it has been more than worth the wait.

I thought the beginning was a bit too slow, but over all I found Twisted Path pretty entertaining.

Cousin Dinky is the only small person who moves from family to family freely, and he gets the ball rolling when he suggests a meeting of small families. Lucy and Tom want so desperately to meet other children their own size that a trip is arranged, despite the dangers that the outside world presents.This book capitalizes on the elements that make the series a success, by presenting realistic obstacles posed by a giant world. The differences between the Littles and the Specks is fascinating, and the interaction between the small people and potentially fierce animals is exciting as well.Buy this series for your child, and let him or her go from beginning to end for some good, clean entertainment that will keep them reading until the last page has been turned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a great book.

The majority of the recordings are described as archival. Which means, they were taped off of the radio 20+years ago on someone's home tape recorder. And rather than paying the BBC, Island records and other companies for origianl recordings, the creators of this set used these poor and often unlistenable recordings. The booklet is quite nice, but the money spent on the booklet could have been better spent purchasing original source recordings.There are a few (and I mean few) shining stars, like the Hexhamshire Lass from '76 and Wat Tyler from '92, but not enough to justify the price.Some may tell you that this set is designed for long time fans of the band.

Sounds like a bunch of formulas instead of truly original, inspiring creative work. I would shut my keyboard except I read review praising this man. I can not understand the appeal. Frank Gambale is a great teacher and can play what you ask; lets not confuse high technical ability with lyrical originality. I am not a skilled player like Frank. But I've studied jazz theory and enjoy his instructional books and DVDs. Its just that you see so many musicians playing other peoples riffs. True composition that is fresh and original is rare.

It seemed better at making stronger congestion less noticeable than it did in reducing slight congestion down to nothing. In other words, I felt little relief if congestion was minor, but very noticeable relief when I was more congested.The one other complaint I have is that I found it slightly difficult to use at times of heavier congestion - or at least, less effective...because think about it - it's a NOSTRIL inhaler... if you are congested, getting a good inhale through the nostrils could be difficult. A good strong inhale is needed because there is this \\"ball-like\\" mechanism that lifts up in the inhaler that seemed to allow more vapors through. To combat weak inhales, I simply tipped it upside down during use.Size is similar to lip balm, so it's easily pocketable."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT FOR TEMPORAY RELIEF","review":"I use them, nasal spray and nasal solutions along with a HEPA filter system in my bedroom to be able to sleep in this enviroment of farmland dust generated by constant winds and strong gusts."},{"rating":"1","title":"smells horrible","review":"I bought a 6 pack of this inhaler due exclusively to the great reviews on it>>> \\"Its WONDERFUL....Best Ive ever Used.......ETC><<< My Opinion is it burns my sinuses if used too long.

Studio recordings of other music the orchestra performed on location make up the remainder. The album cover presents a lush, tropical panorama through textured nuances of the color green and vivid floral display. The resplendent composer at its center, providing a glimpse of what is to come. The suite is happy and relaxed, the easy gait established by Ray Nance's violin on \\"Fiddler on the Diddle\\" and Cat Anderson's range on \\"Jungle Kitty.\\" There is a Broadway flavor present, Mr. Ellington using word play in titling the tunes to reinforce the \\"unique, independent\\" flavor he found in the Islands. He takes this a step further by placing \\"The Opener\\" near the end of the program. I enjoyed the thirty-seven minutes immensely. If I had to pick a starting point for anyone interested in this giant's music, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What??????","review":"I can't believe people rate this album so highly when it's just simply a lousy flamer glam production. Vinnie Vincent had some good work with Kiss when Paul Stanley dragged him into the band but that's about it. This album is just flashy glam at its worst. I can still remember seeing him open up for Iron Maiden when he was touring for this album. He was wearing more pink and purple than Prince and was swinging his hips looser than Janet Jackson. He literally had to run off stage after 2 minutes of lousy guitar playing to avoid getting hit by the objects being thrown by a hostile crowd getting ready to riot. I have been to countless heavy metal concerts from Kiss to Slayer and I have never seen that happen before ever.

From what I understand, they sped up the tape during his solos to make him appear much faster than he really is and to try to create an \\"Yngwie buzz\\" about him. If you listen to any of his KISS songs and any of Vinny's next CDs (which proves he was convicted), you will not hear ANY of the shredding that was on this CD. In addition, if you ever saw him live with KISS (which I did) or Invasion (and you can remember), he was not capable of playing like this CD. Lastly, watch him try to pull off the solo in the \\"Boyz Are Gonna Rock\\" video and you'll see his hands cannot keep up the music (which is probably why he played the solo with a microphone instead of a pick in the video).Either way you slice it, he was never that good of a guitarist. PLUS he is/was as ugly as sin {sorry Vinny, no offense} ;>)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Invasion that Failed","review":"Vinnie Vincent is a really good guitarist, and seemed like the perfect talent to build a band around. With a high profile launch from KISS, Vincent should have been able to parlay his guitar wizardry into mainstream success. Unfortunately, Vincent's songwriting ability was the chink in his metal armor. None of the songs featured here are awful...but they aren't that great either. Take the least memorable song from the \\"Lick It Up\\" album by KISS and multiply it by 10. The tunes are all pretty pedestrian, and while the guitar tracks are really good, there really isn't enough difference between Vincent's shredding, and what was available on hundreds of hair metal releases coming out at the same time. If you are a hair metal fan, you may enjoy popping this in every now and again, but it's not going to become a heavy favorite. But for under $10, it may be worth it just to escape from today's over-produced, under performed junk from the latest American Idol winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's loud & then there's LOUDER","review":"This CD is meant to be played at maximum volume.

Their return policy is that the customer pays for return shipping no matter whose fault the defect is. Sheesh. Two strikes, you're out of my list of technology manfacturers.

While I really liked the size of the clock, the nice black on white contrast, and the readability of the time, I had to return it because the second hand would only work sporadically, often stopping for hours. I would probably have been happy had the clock simply not had a second hand at all. But before I sent it back I tried all of the recommendations by La Crosse (resetting, new battery, facing the clock toward Colorado, etc.), I even sent them an email. In the end, nothing helped, and it took their \\"customer support\\" department more than a week to respond with the same suggestions as on their written documentation.

Well, this so-called button is very flimsy and squirmy and it's impossible to tell whether it is engaged or not. If you reset the time manually you lose the atomic synchronization.

The hands started spinning endlessly until the battery wore down. I thought maybe it was a signal issue (though we hadn't moved the clock) so we tried relocating it. Nothing helped. We have another model of the same brand that's fine. Judging from the other reviews, I'd say don't buy this model. It's inexpensive, but unreliable. I have regular battery-operated clocks that have been in service and keeping time for 10-15 years... I bought these thinking it would spare me the hassle of resetting clocks twice a year. It didn't adjust automatically, so I had to take it down anyway to push the little button on the back. Lame.

One works great without any problems at all. This clock has a mind of its own. It didn't work with the new daylight savings time so I switched it to a different time zone (I am in Mountain Standard Time) and it worked fine. When it did switch time, it started behaving weird. It will rotate the minute hand for hours at a time. I changed batteries and pushed a few random buttons but it just would continuously try to set itself. Periodically, the time would be correct and we would forget about it. Then later, we would hear this strange buzzing and track it down to the clock and it was resetting itself. My wife has been nailed with being late by paying attention to this clock a few times.If you want an entertaining clock that may or may not give you the correct time, then this is it. Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"No correction for Daylight Saving Time","review":"These clocks work perfectly except...

What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I ordered one of the clocks. The first arrived with broken glass, so I ordered a replacement. It also arrived with broken glass. The boxes were undamaged, so the problem is with the packaging done by the manufacturer I put a battery in it to see if it would still work with no glass, and it is unable to receive the time from the atomic clock over two days. There is no way to manually set the time.These clocks are rediculously fragile, and unreliable. Suggest you do not waste your time buying on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advertised","review":"The clock was not as advertised. It was to be radio controlled but it did not change according to the new daylight savings time date.

It is best just to leave it alone then it is to play around with it. They are long lasting. Give one as a gift to your friends and they will have a reminder of you for a long time.

I received the replacement clocks about 2 weeks later and they both worked OK so far.I read the recent customer reviews and noticed a number of others having the same problem as I had. It would be obvious that LaCrosse had a bad batch of clock movements.I emailed LaCrosse explaining about the number of others who had the same problem as I did and that I should be reimbursed the 11+ dollars I spent on shipping because the clocks were bad from the start. The reply: LaCrosse has no exceptions to the warranty policy.In conclusion - LaCrosse has poor QC and bad warranty policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The second hand stops moving after a while","review":"I bought four and every single one of those has exactly the same problem--the hand for second stops moving after a while while the batteries are perfectly fine.I would've given it 4+ if there's simply no second hand.

First of all it would never atomatically set so I had to set it by hand. Then a month later the second hand stopped working. Two months after I bought it it stopped working completely. I contacted Amazon and they immediately replaced it (thank you Amazon). I got the next one, put the battery in, and nothing. I went to the store and bought brand new Duracell batteries... and nothing. I sent the clock back for a refund.

While not as loud as the clock it replaced, it does have a tick that is audible anywhere in the room. That said, I have used it for about 3 weeks, and most of the time, my brain tunes out the tick.

I tried to reset it and it quit altogether. sigh! I saved my old clock and went to find it and lo and behold it was working again! Why? I have not a clue.

Complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well but slow on the Daylight savings time changes","review":"I bought this clock from Amazon August, 2005 and it's been great most of the time. I needed a clock with a sweep second hand and an easy to read face and this met my needs.The only problem I've had is with the daylight savings time updates and with this last change I waited a week and it did not update. I put in a new battery and it went to 12:00 and stayed, during the next few days it went to 4:00 and stayed then to 8:00 and stayed? I nearly tossed it thinking I'd had my five years of use but it finally went to the correct time and has been perfect since. Still, for the cost I would buy another one just don't toss it out too quickly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DST doesn't work","review":"I bought four of these and all fail to observe DST and I'm stuck with incorrect time, I cannot use the timezone trick because I'm already in EST.Without proper DST, these are junks. My Radio Shack digital atomic clock adjusted to DST perfectly, so it's not a signal problem.By the way, it seems the clock only update itself once during the night. If you are a light sleeper it may wake you up when hands are ticking forward.Stay away from LaCrosse atomic clocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap plastic arms jam","review":"The hands on the clock are cheap plastic and are very flimsy. When it received the VLF time signal (it takes several hours), I discovered that the second hand jams with the minute hand. At first I thought the movement was faulty but it's just the cheap plastic hands. The second hand does not bend so it's permanently in this weird state. I took a fingernail clipper and removed the second hand permanently.Also, I can't say whether this clock is aware of the new Daylight Savings Time rules but the current close-out price may be a clue.This clock model is too cheap--I don't recommend it at all.***EDIT*** This clock is NOT aware of the new Daylight Savings Time rules.

If you have this clock, try to get La Crosse to replace it with one that properly handles DST changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It can not be used as a clock..","review":"We brought this clock 6 months ago. First few months it worked properly. After the new DST time changes it got confused and doesn't show right time. After that it doesn't serve the purpose of a clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never set your clock again","review":"This clock is very attractive and functional. We have it in our bathroom and haven't had any issues with the moisture/humidity levels. The simple black face has a nice modern and clean look.Only annoyance is that it is out of sync enough every day that it has to reset every night. That means that late at night, the hands will make a bit of noise as the clock sets itself to the atomic signal. I imagine this is also detrimental to battery life. This doesn't happen with another LaCrosse atomic clock we have in the house.The clock did not properly switch over to the new Daylight savings schedule that started in 2007 (for reasons that are still not entirely clear to me), so the clock was off by an hour for 2 weeks. But, I contacted LaCrosse through their website, and they will be replacing it for free! Now that's what I call good customer service. They stand behind their products, and have earned my business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good any more","review":"The problem is that the clock has dayime saving dates hardcoded and not automatically reads from the radio waves.

I went out to see if everything was okay and found the hands of the clock going around and around. I took it outside and that stopped. But now the second hand doesn't work. I put a new battery in it but that didn't matter. It was working fine for five months from when I bought it. I am very disappointed with it and will not buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atomic Clock as Accurate as Can Be","review":"This clock looks like the average analog wall clock. It's not fancy, which is what I prefer. It sets itself according to a tower in Colorado, and it's accurate to the second. It also resets itself when we have a time change in spring and fall. The price was right. If something goes wrong, I've got it covered; the company it comes from is in the same town I'm in! I have another of their products; namely, a digital clock/alarm/day of the week/indoor thermometer. I bought that product for several family members and have two of them in my house. These are the only truly accurate clocks I've ever owned. My next purchase of La Crosse Technology's products will likely be a weather station."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly perfectly accurate","review":"If you buy an atomic clock, it's probably because you want it to be accurate. I bought one of these, and mostly it's accurate. Sometimes though it just loses its mind...right now it's 45 minutes off.I have a Casio wristwatch and it's ALWAYS PERFECT. Am I spoiled? I want the clock to work right so we'll all know what time it is...not what it probably is."},{"rating":"2","title":"clean design, works fine","review":"I bought this clock in spring 2009 because I like accurate time and wanted a clean design. This clock fit the bill and has worked perfectly across daylight savings changes, too. It looks as good as the picture. The one \\"feature\\" that I hadn't really thought about ahead of time is that the second hand has an audible click. Nothing too annoying, and if it's mechanical, then perhaps unavoidable, but if that really bugs you then you might want to reconsider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work!!!","review":"I purchased 6 of these clocks for my business. They absolutely do not work. I tried sending a couple back, but had the same problems with the replacement clocks. They can't seem to set themselves. The hands just spin around and never seem to land on the actual time. I tried taking them near a window to set themselves, thinking maybe they just couldn't get a clear signal -- but that didn't work. They were a huge waste of money and time. Now, I'm back to my good old fashioned, reliable clocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Clock - Steer Clear!","review":"Purchased 3 of these clocks for my office and like the design. Unfortunately, they don't work as billed. The LaCrosse is not programmed correctly for Daylight Savings Time and 2 out of 3 of the clocks that I bought are in the dumpster - they simply quit working in less than a year in service. Buy another clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clock Does Not Work With The New Daylight Saving Time Rules","review":"I purchased this clock which is advertised as Model # WT-3102B. The clock that I received is Model # WT-3102. I do not know what the difference is between the two model numbers but my clock does not work properly with the new daylight saving time rules. I tried to call LaCrosse technical support and the line has been busy for several days. When I finally got through the most you can do is leave a message in voice mail for them to call you back and they have not called me back. Although LaCrosse advetises that all of their clocks are compatible with the new daylight saving time rules, this clock is not. Based on this and the lack of technical support I cannot recommend this clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Sticker on Back == Broken DST","review":"I bought 4 of these recently, and found that while they picked up the timing signal perfectly from WWVB in Ft. Collins, CO, they did NOT 'spring forward' for DST. Since the DST indicator bit is part of the time-code signal, this was very confusing. I just got off the phone with LaCrosse technical support, and they acknowledged that this is a known-issue (just confirmed in the last couple days), and the WWVB receiver IC used in any of the movements with a red sticker on the back IGNORES the DST bit sent on WWVB (and uses the pre-2007 DST date algorithm instead.) LaCrosse is taking names and numbers and will supposedly be contacting everyone in late April with instruction on how to exchange the product for a working one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both LaCrosse clocks are still not showing correct time","review":"I have this model and the bigger silver WT-3144P that amazon always has as a buy it together option. It has been 5 days and no matter how many times I take out the battery and try pressing different buttons, they are both still 1 hour behind. I am starting to believe this clock will only be accurate in November when DST changes again. My 6 casio radio controlled watches all changed to the correct time on March 11th so the problem is not because of the signal coming into my house.Since I am on the east coast, I can't trick it into the correct time by using another time zone.

I purchased this pan as a gift for a friend and then we made aebelskivers as an appetizer for our New Years dinner with friends. The little pancakes browned evenly and cooked thoroughly with some patient turning, making them just crunchy and brown enough to be finger food. The only criticism I have of this item is that it did not come with any recipes, but that problem was easily solved with a search of the Internet as well as the purchase of this little bookletbleskiver and More: A Sampling of Danish Recipes. In addition, we tried a traditional blintz filling with a mixture of farmers cheese, egg, and a litle sugar.

He slanders Einstein and Freud, and even doubts Darwinism at one point. He paints the world in black and white, in which every single citizen of the USSR was a firm follower and staunch supporter of Stalin, and any American \\"Communist, Socialist, fellow traveler, or Left Wing 'liberal'\\" is working either knowingly or unknowlingly for the Politburo to turn the whole USA into one giant gulag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passage to India","review":"Wonderful movie for it's time. Having spent time in India I can relate as to how the British and Indian cultures have merged and yet were in conflict, even as they are today. You must see this film from the understanding that the British were harsh rulers of India, and most Indians were considered servants of the British. Dame Peggy Ashcroft, gives an inspired performance worthy of her Academy Award, her acting is effortless, and acting students should be inspired by her performance.

It's about two English women who come to India with great expectations for adventure and instead, find a country and culture which at times is disturbingly at odds with all they've ever known or believed in.

It's a masterpiece of filmmaking -- one of David Lean's best efforts. Judy Davis plays a conflicted British tourist; nevertheless, I instantly fell in love with her (and still carry a torch). I've watched this film dozens of times, and it never fails to entertain me. I always find some new discovery or nuance that I hadn't noticed previously.

Take a look at the number of used for sale and their price, lots of people are unloading it.

The combination of Kirk Whalum, Norman Brown and Rick Braun starts off good with the Groovin track and finishes solid with Up for the down stroke. Although the trio could have really impressed c-jazz followers if they added two or three brand new tracks, over all its a fun CD. I hope these guys tour together next summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are all jams!!","review":"Don't know what kind of taste the negative reviewers have, but these are all #1 cuts.

I picked it up, opened it in the middle, and started to read. I couldn't put it down. I read to the end then went back to the beginning and read to where I'd started, without ever getting up off the bench in the store. Then I bought it, and have since bought many copies as gifts. The true story of how seemingly external events dragged this 'ordinary' man, kicking and screaming, into full awareness of his connection with Spirit is absolutely gripping, as well as highly entertaining. It also inspires one to want to go where he went in his inner travels, to have the kinds of spirit-based experiences he describes. And you can. He can take you there. The man has found his power and his teaching provides awesome tools for making that connection with self. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Once again it appears that most of the reviews for this book are by A Customer.

(...) This is a book that I still have available in my classroom and students continue to refer to it (independently!) to advance their drawing techniques. SO glad I bought this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful book, but not useful to me","review":"This book has many beautiful and stunning pictures (just like any other \\"coffee-table\\" book), but it is not useful to me personally, as I do not like working on black art paper, and every design is to be done on black art paper. If you enjoy working with black art paper, then you will probably enjoy using this book.Also, as expected in a \\"healing\\" book, there are strong religious undertones through-out the book.I would recommend that you spend a few minutes studying a copy of this book at your local library or bookstore before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bo-o-o-ring...","review":"I bought this album when I was 16, along with Stick-It Live. I wanted to have Slaughter's latest album, since I did like their \\"Up All Night\\" from their first album.I have to say that this album was so boring - I can see why grunge took over the scene - glam metal just became tired of singing about everything, glam metal bands were running out of ideas - that is the message I got from this album. The male cast of Full House comes to my mind when I listen to this album - that's how boring this album is. Don't buy it.Nowadays, when I tell people about Slaughter, people go \\"Oh, isn't that a Satanic rock band?\\" And I have to go \\"No, that's Slayer.\\" It seems that the whole world has forgotten about Slaughter. I would recommend either Mass Slaughter (greatest hits) or Stick It if anyone wants to know what Slaughter is all about. This album is sooo booring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunny","review":"I first listened to this CD in my mom's car...she never likes music very loud, so I was listening to it softly. DON'T do this. It was bland, uninteresting, and I regretted buying it. However, I got home, and put it into my bedroom CD player, and turned the volume up high...Wow! It was suddenly toe-tapping and swingy, and the melodies were sheer perfection (I love those raggy tunes).My only complaint is the lack of stringed instruments like banjos (albeit not widespread in the repertoire/style for part of the target period) as a good grounding for the airiness of the winds, which seemed to be lacking in places. It's also great percussion, and drums just don't always do the trick.But anyways, my advice is: turn the volume up--don't even listen to it on headphones--and lose yourself. A delight. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Balanced Review of Islam","review":"I am a Western educated Muslim reader and bought this book to try and actually understand how a Christian would see Islam and portray it to other Christians. I was pleasantly surprised to find this book written in a fairly objective manner, and even concialliatory at times. It shows a gentler and kinder side of how Christians may want to be; that is to have a more open, empathic, yet non-patronising approach to other religions, especially Islam--a religion that has been unfairly portrayed by the mass media. While this book may be a good introduction from a Christian perspective, I would also recommend another book for those wanting a quick and light overview of Islam, i.e. \\"Islam for Beginners\\" (A Writers and Readers Documentary Comic Book) by Nabil Ibrahim Matar, which is also appears to be written for non-Muslims. (This book is also carried by Amazon.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book For a French Student.","review":"My French teacher had this book on her desk one day and I looked through it. We weren't using it as a textbook, nor were we learning very much French, but my teacher said that she would grade the work that I did in The Easy Way. I have been using this book for a few weeks and I have improved a lot. It has great dialogues with vocabulary translations at the bottom of the page, and great grammer explanations and practice. You'll be amazed at how fast you learn. I now know the most French in the class. I recommend, though, that you have somebody on hand who speaks French, just in case you get confused. Most likely, however, you won't be. It's in a very simple format and the explanations are easy to follow. I highly recommend French The Easy Way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably a good book, but useless on Kindle","review":"Some good books are best in hardcopy format.

Also: many diagrams are not easily understood or viewed in a Kindle screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for the Kindle","review":"I think this is probably a good book in paper format, but it just doesn't work well on the Kindle. Maybe language books in general are not going to work with the Kindle. The exercises are images so the text can't be resized. Some are very difficult to read and others are impossible to read. I also imagined that I wouild be able to enter the answers to the questions in the Kindle as notes, but it does not work because the exercises are images."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and detailled book","review":"This book gives a very detailled description of the joint pathologies, looks at different causes, genetic, bacterial or viral.

With Step 2 only 2 months away I've finally decided to cut my losses and get Crush the Boards.

The script is incoherent. Actors who were quite good in \\"Coming Home\\" - especially Patrick Ryecart and Joanna Lumley - are left to random plot points and dialogue so horrible that they seem mystified while reciting it - I hope they were well paid! The character of Judith Dunbar - central to \\"Coming Home\\" - is relegated to the sidelines, and Emily Mortimer has been replaced with a charmless actress who spends her little screen time whining. The plot involving Jess is completely unrealistic, as is the notion that Judith would sell the Dower House (which has disappeared in Nancherorow). And the scriptwriters seem to have forgotten that Judith was left independently wealthy in \\"Coming Home\\". As to Gus going from impoverished artist to savior of Nancherrow by virtue of a single New York art show....please. Don't waste your money, especially as this is a rather pricey DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money","review":"Not bad for the cost.

My quest for perfect music is over","review":"Having tried such a wide variety of what I originally thought RAVE music was supposed to sound like, I happened across this CD. N.E. has everything I've ever looked for in music because it moves me while I'm laying in bed as well as it relaxes me while dancing to it. It's like a journey through soft, fluffy clouds on a electric pogo stick. I can't wait to receive all of S & JD's work, and if I could buy stock in them, I would be very rich very soon. Simply a must have for those who crave the better things in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - this is Wild!","review":"I borrowed this CD from a friend and he literally had to pry it out of my hands. I didn't want to give it back. I like ambient and trance music and this is right up my alley. This is definitely thinking and imagination music. I even read a book while I was listening and everytime I hear the songs it makes me think of the book. If you like anything that's different this is definitely worth a sample."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as they say","review":"i started listening to techno in 93' when i was introduced to the club scene. not too long after that i bought my first cd, renaissance with dave seaman and ian ossia. how fortunate for me. anyway, throughout the years i've listened to all types of techno music, including sasha and john digweed. in these reviews people have stated that this cd is an instant classic, or a flawless mix. now i don't want to discredit sasha and john digweed, but this is not their best mix. it's good, but not great, it's a solid mix, but not flawless, it's a classic, but not one that i would continually listen to. it's too out of date. the sounds are too old and the structure is too outdated. in my opinion, and it's a seasoned expert opinion, look for something a little newer, a little more modern, you'll be happier with the sounds, and leave the classics to the symphony."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD MUSIC + UGLY RECORDING = FAILURE","review":"The music is very good and I would give it 5 enthusiastic stars.

Everything in my collection seems to move out from this series, and nothing seems to have outdone the sheer magic of this first. If you like to go to those secret places in your mind, grab this one up. It is beautiful, haunting, lively and lovely...and what a build up to the last cut! It is a mystical journey that leads to one final explosion of musical joy. I have never tired of this cd and have frequently given it as a gift...just for the joy of buying it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck","review":"I keep trying to get these two. I couldn't describe what I like about my favorite trance, or even if it qualifies as such. I suppose one thing would be to say that it moves like mercury and runs very deep, telling a story more than throwing my heartrate around. This album, by contrast, was massively boring. I have tried over and over to listen, but I can't stand any of the tracks long enough to make it through them. What a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be crazy!","review":"After reading all the 5 star reviews about this CD and being a 'Trance' fan since 99 I was excited to get this cd. I guess I must have been mistaken in someway but this cd is not the Modern Day Trance that I know. I guess it must be some other Genre, maybe some kind of Jungle, Goa or very electronic music with lots of drums and base etc.I have put this CD in maybe 5 times after reading these reviews even cross checking the tracks to see if they were the same cd. Perhaps I am being a bit harsh but I was under the impression that this was Trance or Progressive Trance, unless I am seriously mistaken.I am no big fan of Sasha or JD but have recently heard songs like Xpander (sasha) which was is very good. Just not sure what genre this is???"},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"when i think trance i think club music not this strange collection of electronic music.

If you can get passed that, though, you will find absolute flawless mixing with gentle yet moving track selection. This album moved me in a way I never thought techno could. Also if you liked this little beautity, check out the Global Underground sets (mainly sasha, seaman, diggers.) Awesome CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Emotion","review":"How can you describe this music? It's bliss, happiness, sadness, everything you can imagine.

I was trying to get a recording of the various instrumentals which played on the TV program \\"Northern Exposure\\", but I was unable to get any info from the credits. So I inquired of Amazon and naturally they came up with this CD. Since I was seeking those wonderfully exotic native chants and especially fine instrumentals which played while they displayed spectacular film of the aurora borealis, I was naturally disappointed when this was not the music I expected - but that is not the fault of the artists! Nor is it their fault that my taste found the music from the first CD to the second one indistinguishable. Sorry, but it just sounded like more of the same! P. S. If you know who the artists are who contributed to the TV show Northern Exposure, please email the info to me at \\"westby@tgarden.com\\" Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Listen","review":"Wow,!!!One word that comes to mind when I think about this CD. One word of advice though; truly listen to this album. I remember when I first got it, I was expecting something very different--I was expecting hardthumping, body moving trance--DJ Tiesto style, but this album doesn't come close to that. It's much deeper, with layers and layers of notes which you can only pick up if you really listen. Essentially, it's a chillout, headbobbing,thinking, emotional album that is mixed with such precision that you will not be able to tell when the songs go from 1-3. It just happens. The tracklisting is phenomenal, and when the album weaves its way around to the last 2 tracks, you will feel like dancing/ images of dancing on a beach/forest/the moon will appear in your head, and you will be extremely happy that you bought this abum."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" Let me take you, on a journey.....\\"","review":"Sasha and Digweed are hands down some of the finest UK Dj's around. This CD (actually the whole NE set box 1) is amazing. It captivates you and takes you to cosmic places. The beautiful harmonies and melodic tracks let you escape your everyday reality and enjoy the essence of trance music. This is not representational of a NYC Twilo set, but from a CD aspect, it is one you must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning !","review":"Just so you know...do not expect anything trance-like from late work from sasha, this is pure ambient trance, very slow, not very enthusiastic. So if you are looking for a dance-high energy type of trance, this is not the one. If you are looking for a dark, soft, kind of trance this maybe it. Also the tunes here are a little bit old, ranging from 91 to 96."},{"rating":"2","title":"the first and the best","review":"and in more ways than one: this is the first trance disc i bought, and it's still the best in my collection -- tho sasha's ibiza set comes pretty close. my favorite moment is easily \\"water from a vine leaf\\", but the whole thing is really, really good: forget the local train-wreckers; i'd rather hear this front-to-back at a magical party under the moon. OOPS! except for track 7, \\"ultraviolet\\", whose vocalist is irritatingly incompetent; you can really hear the ecstasy holding those notes up .."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Ballad of Trance","review":"Sasha and John Digweed team up in compilling this novel album although it definitely has more of a \\"Sasha-feel\\". A ballad of soft trance that is best suited to lazy Sundays or post-clubbing come downs.For the most part, the individual tracks and the set overall does not sound that outdated when related to the album's release date of 1997.I like this album for its sheer creativity. It the album cover and title have any true purpose in conveying what type of setting Sasha and Digweed were going for with their track selection...chilly, untamed, and isolated...then they sure succeeded. I just don't understand why they decided to open with a track using a vocal clip of the BBC's premier documentary narrator, David Attenborough talking about the Amazon instead of the Arctic or Antarctic?This review is for the single disc album with the tracks featured above. 4/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten years on and still amazing...","review":"Wow....time flies...I've owned NE Vol 1 for 10 years....and it still doesn't fail to blow me away every time i listen to it.

Truelly exemplary stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably not your best bet","review":"Although the title seems promising, the actual text is a little wanting. Vacillating between \\"I was there\\" interviews and relying upon sources like Kenneth Rexroth (who although a fine poet had a Bunyan-sized axe to grind against the Beats), there's lots there that doesn't seem to ring true, and more than a little hero-worship (Michael McClure as \\"half a Hell's Angel\\" because he owned a Triumph? I'm not buying it). But, if, like me, you've read every other portrayal of the Beats this one can't hurt you, I'm also convinced it won't help you...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kokoro","review":"I love the scent of plumeria, and thought this product might be just like fresh plumeria flowers.

I first saw her open for Dar Williams and I was blown away! I bought her cd, Distillation, that night. Shortly there after I attained this album. I must say that I liked Distillation better, but this cd was not a let down. You can hear her on stage presence.She is phenomenal performer, with an incredible artistic range for a folk singer. She combines blues, funk and folk with smart, witty lyrics.I've had the pleasure of speaking briefly with her, as have one of my friends, and we both agree she is wonderful. During the Dar show she was next to me in the crowd and sat through the show. In my personal experience, I usually don't see performers sitting in the crowd through other performers. She is, all in all, a refreshing energetic addition to the folk scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"My boyfriend loved it.

Hearing BJ Thomas in his early years sound so good, and energized and alive was so refreshing. The songs are very unique- most were written by Marck Charron, a memebr of BJ's first band, the Triumphs. A lot of treasures here, folks- especially \\"I Wonder\\". Seems like BJ specialized in Teen Angst back in his early years. Several of the 25 songs are very dark- some of the characters in his songs wind up dead. But what a time capsule! BJ sounds as if he's trying to copy the style of Roy Orbison or Jay Black of \\"Jay & The Americans\\"! I've found this CD set at twice the proce in stores!

The midwife Tara had been gang raped not once but twice in her past but joked about it and laughed. I have never met a woman who had been raped once that thought it was funny enough to laugh about at anytime, regardless of coming to terms with what had happened to them, let alone having been gang raped twice. She then went to say that Tara was unable to have children due to a veneral disease contracted due to the rapes which she was unaware that she had and so had gone untreated causing damage. Get real..this woman is supposed to be a midwife and she didn't know that she should have gotten checked out? Ms. Early does no help to the cause of midwives here. I will avoid any books by this author in the future if this is an example of her books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Street Smart","review":"A true friend introduced me to Fourplay and Bob James in the 80's. I guess I see myself as a musical orphan. You can only listen to the oldies so long and then you do long for something fresh and new. My teen son unexpectedly liked Street Smart and almost any time he's in the car, he restarts the album so he can hear it. Without a doubt, my favorite is \\"When the Lover is Over\\" with vocals by Bob James' daughter Hilary. This is a powerful trac for me. Buy it--it's new and has an enduring quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Wretched, oh my g--","review":"This is the type of video that makes you wish you could have your precious time back.It is so horrible, boring, uninteresting. Could the people actually involved in it sit through it?I strongly advise everyone out there to do something better with their time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no pay off","review":"The premise of this movie looked mildly interesting, but in fact what could have been a decent film was botched by it's attempts to bring a touch of seriousness to an otherwise humorous \\"mockumentary\\". I have seen well done films of this type, and this was anything but. The more the characters in this film portray the protagonist as a \\"likeable, non-egotistical\\" person the less the viewer believes he is, especially in light of the fact that Dirk Shafer wrote and directed this film. The movie leaves the viewer confused, bored and uninterested. It was not worth my attention, and is not even entertaining as a bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bra","review":"I bought 2 of these bras to replace some VS bras. Wound up buying two more.. great everyday bras. Very comfortable. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah and bland","review":"I really disliked this book (even more than Ms. Sullivans first novel - Stay). It was hard to finish. Ship is a decent character, but she is fairly bland and one dimensional; the plot is really scarce and boring because it revolves around her acute hearing...which gets old without much meat attached. My least favorite part of the book is when Ship needs stiches for her hand, it seemed totally pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch review","review":"Well constructed. Keeps time accurately.

I'm very impreseed with the quality & workmanship that went into this watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book wasn't what the title implies - it is not specifically about organizing your fabric or scraps. While it touches on the subject, it is mainly just another quilt book with projects. Wanted a book that would tell me how to handle the bits of fabric or give storage and organization ideas. There must be enough information out there for someone to fill a whole book with photos and tips on how how quilters store their stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted to know","review":"The advertising for this book implies that it will help a person get organized. Actually there are only three pages that have any suggestions at all about organizing your scraps. All the rest of it is patterns for scrap quilts, which are ok, but none of them offers any suggestions about organization. Perfection is nowhere to be found here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also disappointed!","review":"I agree with previous reviewers - title is misleading. I've seen much better coverage of how to organize your fabrics in books that don't claim to be on that subject! There are some nice patterns for scrap quilts but shame on publisher for not giving it a more accurate title. ADDITION: Look at the more recent reviews carefully! Someone was obviously padding the reviews with positive ones . . . most REAL purchasers who are not married to the author or otherwise have an invested interest don't like this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the Heads Up...","review":"I must thank the honest reviewers of this book. My money is hard-earned and I hate to waste it on false information. If you will notice that all of the reviews giving this book 5 stars have very similar writing styles...even using identical language. Also, please note the date for these great reviews. Same person, same day, I bet. Glad for the insight of those before me."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but the accompanying CD needs improvement","review":"I bought this with excitement- the CD companion was a good selling point. However, I was unable to figure out a way to do a text search of the CD to match a topic of interest. Despite the fact it was published in 1999, many of the chapters appear dated. A web site, like that in the competing volume Neurology in Clinical Practice, would be helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This blender looks cool but doesn't work well","review":"I held onto this blender for almost 2 years and finally threw in the towel.

Do stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blender","review":"The blender has a powerful motor and runs quieter then any blender I've had before.

This blender failed to blend a moderate level of frozen fruits with milk and ice. Dissapointing.

I've gone through two of the most expensive Kitchen Aid blenders in an attempt to recreate the blended drinks I get in coffee shops. They simply never worked right. I would always end up with big ice or fruit chunks that just wouldn't blend, but the longer I ran it to try to get those pieces, it just made the rest of the drink too watery. Anyway, finally I said enough and tossed those out. I did my research and bought this one. What can I say - after 15 seconds in this blender I had the best smoothie I've ever made on my first try! I wish I bought this years ago! And it wasn't nearly as loud as I feared after reading some of the other reviews. It looks great too. I couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little blender for making drinks","review":"I've used this blender model for many years now. It does a great job pulverizing ice as it blends. The main con with this model is the noise during use - it is very loud. Cleanup is fast and easy. The stainless steel container keeps drinks chilled. After using this model weekly for several years, the motor did start to die. Since you can only ignore the sounds of a failing motor for so long I researched blenders before buying this model again with no regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Performance","review":"Just got this yesterday and it's better than I had hoped. Ingredients don't clog up at the bottom, and there are no ice chunks in my smoothies anymore! It's not as loud as I was afraid it would be - about the same as my last blender. Very good purchase, and it looks tough on the counter.1/3/09 Update - it's more than four years later and this machine is still doing great. We've been grinding dry dog food into \\"puppy mush\\" and I was reminded again how well this blender just does what it's supposed to do. I still highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Job well done.","review":"My husband and I drink friut smoothies almost daily, so I was looking for a blender that can withstand daily use. We've been through 2 previous blenders and the magic bullet, but the Waring Professional Blender is great.It gets the job done. It crushes the ice cubes and blends well in only a few seconds. I love having only 2 speeds, who needs to liquefy or puree anyway? I also like having the stainless steel container, no glass to break. So far I'm pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buff Blender","review":"I've found this Waring blender to be excellent for making a variety of drinks, as well as being helpful with food. But I really use it more for drinks. It's sturdy enough to handy thicker ice-cream drinks, but not so over-powering--it doesn't pulverize the ice in a margarita, which is nice because watery drinks aren't worth drinking. It also looks good, with a nice color, adding a little style to the counter it sits on. All in all, a solid and reliable appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"dead already","review":"It Was a great blender till it died Thanksgiving day. Used 6 times! Replaced Cuisinart that lasted 6 min.What now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Blender","review":"Only had the blender for a month now so I really have not put it through a hard test but so far it is doing a great job. I mostly make fruit smoothies with it now. It easily takes the chunks of fruit and purees it. It is easy to clean and use. I go through a blender about every 4-5 years and the last two have been the professional models. The other models do not seem to crush the ice or fruit and I burn out the motors in about a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"love these blenders","review":"i bought 2 of these for my wife to make smoothies with. she is in love with them. they are so easy to use and even easier to clean. there are no parts to lose, and when cleaning you simply add water and soap, turn it on, then rinse it. i have always hated the ones with the gasket you lose or tear and then it leaks all over. these work so wekk, that you can make slushies with ice of perfect consistency. you get what you pay for, 100 bucks for a blender, but its a waring so it will last for a long time and the smile it brings to my wifes face is priceless, so to me it was a great deal. this green one is not so pretty, i like the red one we got better, but both are nice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Blender I've Ever Owned...","review":"This is the first \\"nice\\" blender I've ever purchased and I'm very happy with it. We make shakes almost every morning and it whips it together (ice, frozen fruit, fresh fruit, you name it) in seconds. And it's super easy to clean because the blade is built in to the bottom of the glass. I love it - highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product but smaller 'jar' then expected","review":"slight delay with receiving due to carrier but package came in good shape. just used blender to make our evening smoothie and it was SO fast to get done compared to the one we had been using. Rather than take about 5 minutes it only took 2. Also compared to the average blender it is rather quiet which I did not expect. I would like the 'jar' part to be bigger but not too big of a deal. It is probably just the 'new' smell of it but it had a slightly odd smell come from it when first used it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"This blender works wonderfully and is very easy to clean. I have not yet experienced any problems with it blending evenly, or leaving lumps, etc. I find that for a smoother result, I blend on high for a few seconds, then on the lower setting, then on high again.It is simple to take apart, and it is sturdily constructed. Be careful - the blades in the bottom are sharper than expected! At least, sharper than many other blenders I have owned.The colour is an attractive retro green - great for any mid-century styled kitchen :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - Blender jar seal leaking at 1 year + 1 week / Burning smell since day 1","review":"This is a review of the PBB25 -Waring PBB25 Professional Bar Blender, Black and Stainless Steel JarI use this to make smoothies 5-6 times a week. I use frozen fruit instead of ice. Last week (53 weeks after I purchased the blender) the blender jar started leaking on the underside, where it connects to the base.After I add the frozen fruit the motor whines (on high speed) and smells like it's burning. This has happened since day one. I'm not adding a lot of fruit, 1/4 of frozen blueberries and 4-6 frozen strawberries. This blender should be able to handle this. I don't expect this blender to last very long.I called Waring customer service today about the leak and got a recording that basically said \\"We're busy and can't take your call. Leave a message and we'll call you back.\\" I'll post back after I hear from them.If you're looking to make smoothies on a regular basis I suggest you consider a different blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS PRODUCT","review":"This by far has to be the worst product I have aquired this year.I few Ice cubes an some juice and the blender hangs and stalls.It has no power and should be pulled from the market.I should have spent more and just went with the Vita-Mix.Live and LearnTime to place at the Yard sale"},{"rating":"1","title":"mr","review":"This blender is not professional Bar Blender.Its blade and motor is not strong enough to crush ice.To buy this product just waist of money.I am not happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price for the amount of use","review":"I got this as a gift, and while it worked great while it worked, it didn't last long. Like most of the reviews, the blade broke after about 2-3 months of use. I bought a replacement blade, which was SUPER difficult to put in. When I finally found a place that could install it for me, the blade piece broke AGAIN! Don't buy this blender if you want to make lots of drinks with ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low durability / High price","review":"I've had this blender for just over a year. My wife and I have mixed shakes and drinks perhaps a couple of time per week. Last month the motor seemed to lose power and the kitchen started to smell like smoldering rubber near the blender. At the time I bought it the price was $149 (copper color model). I think for a hundred and fifty dollars the unit should have lasted longer than a year considering the low usage it received. I certainly won't be buying another Waring product but will probably upgrade to a Vita-Mix Drink Machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"At first was happy with it. A lot of power, good chopping ability mainly ice for slushies, smoothies etc. After a little more than 3 weeks the motor was dead. Nothing at all once turned on. So this could not last at the most, once a day for a couple of days over 3 weeks. Heavy duty as it says, it's not. Buy something more reliable, the few extra bucks will prevent you from having to return it like I am doing today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ice Crushing???","review":"I purchased this blender based upon its reviews, especially its ice crushing ability. When it would not crush ice from my freezer, we tried commercial (smaller) ice, and it did absolutely nothing. I don't know whether we have a defective unit, but this was the biggest waste of money I've experienced with a kitchen appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I use this to make smoothies. Totally shocked that it blends what's on the bottom, and never blends the top stuff without me having to scrape the sides and mix it up several times. I've never seen a bartender have to do this...so I'd consider their marketing as a professional \\"bar\\" blender completely false.Save your money and try another brand. Lid doesn't work right either...but I could live with that, if it actually blended. Very sad. And very curious who is giving this 5 stars, HAVE to be paid reviewers. I don't see any other explanation. Bad form Waring, spend the money on product research, not fake reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender blunder","review":"Blender has a on off switch that is not secure.

I wanted one that could crush ice to make margaritas in the summer. Sold by the name and the fact it said it would crush ice for drinks I spent the $100. In 1 year I've used this machine because each time I do I'm thoroughly disgusted on its performance. It does not crush ice but makes this block in the blender. It was difficult in making pesto and I finally decided to get rid of it when it couldn't blend hummus! I'm not a novice cook or a pro chef but I have gone back to my 15 year old machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks after a few months","review":"I bought this less than 6 months ago and it now leaks. There is a rubber gasket seal on the underneath of the jar assembly which no longer seals after maybe 20 or 30 uses. Through normal use (making smoothies) its been dislodged so part of the seal is pulled into the shaft to the cutter blades and the rest of the seal extented outside the edge of the metal washer. I've pulled it apart to fix it, which works for a while but the problem repeats itself, the seal now no longer seals for more than a couple of goes.This is the only Waring product I've owned and it will be the last based on this blender as its about to be thrown out and buy a different one.On the plus side, when it didn't leak it was a good blender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for veggie smoothies","review":"My friend is big into veggie smoothies for breakfast. She told me that I needed to by a $400 blender to do the trick.Well, I didn't. This blender is AWESOME for my uses.I wouldn't try to chop veggies in it (like for coleslaw) though. There is no stopping between whole & puree!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"This is a handsome product and is undoubtedly a good blender, but it should be noted that it is considerably smaller than most blenders. It is described as having a 32 oz container, but it will only blend 24 oz, about half of a standard KitchenAid. A more accurate representation of its functional capacity would have kept me from mistakenly ordering it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this item for my husband who likes to blend his liquid breakfast drink. After only 2 months of normal, residential use, the blade has loosened from the bottom of the glass container and the container is leaking from the bottom. For the cost of this item, I expected much better performance. My 10 year old plastic Hamilton Beach blender that I probably paid $20 for (if that much) has held up much longer and in fact, is back in use now that the Waring has fizzled. I liked the professional look of the Waring and the glass container but had I known how short lived it would be, I would not have wasted my hard earned dollars on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretty LEMON","review":"Bought this blender for smoothies only 4 months ago. Just suddenly stopped working. Price is too high for such a lemon. Really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Switch","review":"Blender came with a broken switch out of the box.

It looked really nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Taken a Beating - and Keeps Going.","review":"I was looking to replace the cutter assembly after six years of serious use/abuse, when I came across the reviews of this blender. I am absolutely surprised by the number of bad reviews (about 1/3). I've had this blender for over 6 years and use it 4-5 x's per week (frozen fruit/ice/protein smoothies mostly). It gets a beating, and I have not had one ounce of trouble with it. I wonder why the huge discrepancy? I love this blender - have the stainless steel model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this blender.","review":"This is the best blender I've had. It works quickly, effectively with no problems. It makes my kitchen work so much easier. When I make smoothies it blends like a dream. No chunks or frozen bits. One huge point in its favor is it's MADE IN THE USA. I was thrilled to find something of such quality still made here. I will have this for years, but when I buy my next blender it will be this one. It is fabulous. Definitely worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down on this one -","review":"Add another dissatisfied customer to the list of people who have had problems with this blender.We have had it for just a few months, and the nylon drive shaft broke off right at the fastening nut, inside the container.It has not seen heavy use - making fruit smoothies with fresh fruit and ice that was pre-crushed in a canvas bag the old fashioned way, maybe twice or three times a week. If it won't hold up to this sort of mild use, it isn't worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"This blender makes great frozen margaritas","review":"I bought this blender to replace a $35 Oster that died. It was definitely worth the money. There is a huge difference in quality. It can make restaurant quality frozen margaritas in about 10 seconds. The pitcher is smaller than my old Oster which could be a problem if you want to make more than 2 drinks at a time. This is why I only gave it 4 stars. When shopping for this blender it bothered me that the blender only has 2 speeds but I found that it doesn't matter. I would recommend this blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance","review":"Purchased this after reading other reviews.After having it for three months with less than optimum performance in crushing even four ice cubes at one time the motor died.

After more than a year of daily experience with the Waring Pro (both MBB* & PBB* models) I cannot recommend them for serious smoothing making. Here's why:Both glass- & stainless-jug models use the same blade assembly. This blade assembly wears poorly when asked to blend frozen fruit. It fails often, and must be rebuilt or replaced. Parts are easily purchased if you're handy and have the correct tools. DETAILS: The assembly screws together, and is threaded to tighten under use rather than loosen and fall apart. But this tightening action is so great when the blade contacts frozen fruit, that it bends the metal washer below the blade. The assembly eventually becomes so tight that the shaft cannot turn.The Waring Pro is all the blender than many people will need, but is not sufficient for the daily maker of multiple smoothies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked and disappointed","review":"If you want shocking results then this is the color for you--- #42 Deep Burgundy Black CherryI bought this product and was extremely disappointed by the results. I was expecting the color to be more of dark wine color and ended up with all of my hair being very, very Purple. The color did not take on all of my hair (despite following the directions exactly) so some strands were my natural color. It would have been nice to know that the color was going to be such a shocking purple color. I have shampooed my hair multiple times in 24 hours trying to calm the color down. If I could afford it, I would go to a salon to have this corrected professionally. I have never experienced anything like this with any other at home hair color products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good color but process is harrowing","review":"The good: this color works on black hair to give it a reddish sheen in sunlight - pretty, subtle and attractiveThe bad: trying to rinse the dye out of your hair post-processing feels like a bloodbath because the red keeps dripping out rinse after rinse after rinse until finally you'll give up because you're just too tired to rinse one more time.

Of the 200 pages in this book, scarcely 30 actually pertain to the author's house building experience. It appears \\"the Most Beautiful House\\" subject was merely a excuse to ramble from one topic to another. One minute he is talking about animal sacrifices & liver divining, the next he is discussing the verb \\"to habit\\". I was sorely disappointed and struggle to find any redeeming quality in this work. Readers be warned that this book is a motley crew of diatribes on topics having little to do with The Most Beautiful House in the World."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the ONE I've been looking for! :)","review":"Finally I found the perfect citrus juicer that only \\"Juices\\", not eat up whole pieces of fruit with something gross coming out! It does require some strength in my hand to press the orange hard enough for juice to be extracted."},{"rating":"2","title":"juicer","review":"It works well. More expensive than I expected but if it lasts for 10 or more citrus seasons, then it will have been worth it. I have 4 orange trees, 2 grapefruit trees, 2 tangelo trees and a lemon tree, so I do a lot of juicing. So far thus season, it has done well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful, but dangerous","review":"This juicer is a beauty to behold, sturdy and powerful, but...When my hand slipped against the revolving strainer basket it caught my thumbnail and ripped it half-off. Needless to say, I won't be using this instrument of torture again.Also, the tall design necessary to put a glass under the side makes for an awkward working angle for a short person like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake!!!","review":"I own and wrote a glorious review of my Waring blender with stainless steel body which looks nearly identical to this, however, this product (listed as stainless steel) is fake! There is no metal in it. If you look carefully at the pictures, you can see it is exactly as the white one (which I assume is also plastic). They merely put a scratched mylar coating on the plastic. The other plastic pieces also seem flimsy and poorly made. The quality was much worse than my old, cheap $15 Braun juicer. The power of this unit is decent, but not so much that I think it qualifies for a $100 juicer. I would have given this a much better rating if it was half the price or if it really was made out of stainless steel. The \\"stainless\\" finish is fake and doesn't match my other stainless appliances."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Better Than a Conventional Juicer!","review":"When I got into fruit and veggie juices last year, I made the mistake of getting a toy citrus juicer at the local department store. It was fine for a couple of oranges, but wimped out when I wanted to juice a bag of oranges. The Waring juicer has the oomph to produce as much juice as I want, usually about a gallon at a time.The one, very mild complaint, I have is that the basket that catches the pulp is a bit too small for the largest oranges, making it awkward to do more than a couple of oranges before cleaning out the pulp. Not a big deal, unless you are always using the large oranges.Other than that, I am very happy with this juicer! It is holding up very well after a couple months of heavy use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Product - Worst Service","review":"I bought this product because it had great reviews from several buyers. I was extremely excited when I received it but was quickly disappointed. The product had no power whatsoever. It kept on stopping each time I put any kind of pressure on the orange. Apart from looking great on the kitchen counter and very easy to clean (I have to give it that), its OJ making abilities gets 0 starts.Buyers beware that this item is not returnable and thus not refundable by Amazon or Ace Photo Digital. If you buy it you are stuck with it. I would think twice before buying this product or any product from Amazon or Ace Photo Digital as their return policy is very restricted. READ THE FINE PRINT. I should have known when the package came without the return slip and return instructions in it.I shop online all the time and this was my first Amazon experience. I have to say it was not a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an inferior citrus juicer","review":"This is the second Waring Citrus Juicer given that the first one's motor strained with just the slightest pressure.Surprisingly, the current one, presumably with a properly working motor, also strained with pressure although it allowed for more pressure than the first, faulty unit.It appears that the motor is not very powerful. As well, the juicer attachment, over time, since it doesn't have a very tight fit over the motor shaft, will simply stop turning when pressure is applied.I returned the unit and opted for the more expensive Breville Citrus Juicer.That unit is magnitudes better than the Waring unit.My recommendation is to not even consider buying the Waring unit. It has an underperforming motor and is poorly constructed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grade A Juicer","review":"This is strong and effective. It is heavy enough to keep it from driving around your counter while attempting to juice. Easy cleanup due to detachable sturdy plastic parts. IMHO worth the extra money over buying a cheaper citrus juicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Speed","review":"The unit looks attractive, however, I expected a better RPM. The motor is not fast enough. It takes too long to extract the juice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply works","review":"The Waring PCJ218 Citrus Juicer does what it claims it will do.Very simple in operation (on/off toggle switch) the juicer doesa fine job on Key Limes to Large Texas Grapefruit without theneed to change anything.Easy to use, clean and store. Perfect for my small kitchen.Can recommend without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promise Lost","review":"\\"What's in a name ...\\" went missing with this one.Clumsy to use and promises to make a mess every time.The top of the rim is sooo much higher than the reamer that it is impossible to get the half fruit fully juiced. Also, the spout does not lock in place. Therefore, while my wrist pushes down on the rim (see above) the spout will rotate away from my glass and spill juice on the counter.Waring has a great name that does not come through in this product. Overdue for redesign considering other products on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Juicer Rocks!","review":"After testing several low end citrus juicers and finding them lacking in both features and power, I decided to spring for the pricier Waring Pro.This machine is heavy duty but light enough to handle and compact enough to store on a cabinet shelf. The motor is relatively quiet and the reamer type extractor is a hard plastic that can taske a beating. It operates with the flick of a switch and is very easy to clean: just lift out the reamer and basket.I juice oranges every day and find this unit to be sturdy and perfect for any task. The best one I've seen yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick \\"To Go\\" Breakfast!","review":"We've had two less expensive juicers previously, but they didn't last long and/or had a very noisy, grinding sound. I bought this juicer for my husband for Christmas (our family juice-maker) and we all love it. It's much quieter, quick and an easy clean-up. He makes me and the kids a nice take-along breakfast when we're headed off to school. This is a great investment in your health!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected.","review":"While this juicer does clean up nicely there are some design issues that I did not like. I purchased this to do grapefruits easily. They are a mess. The larger basket is great for containing the grapefruit but the extractor head is the same size as other juicers which now means your fingers keep hitting the sides of the basket. The basket has about 1/2\\" rotation so you have to hold this in place while holding the fruit in the other hand. Also the inner basket allows for seeds and extra pulp to flow into the glass. Lastly, the spout is fixed. For the price this should be adjustable to be able to remove the glass to prevent drippage.I intended to use this to replace my Cuisinart CCJ-100 Citrus Pro Juicer ($25.00 and great warranty) as the product info stated it did grapefruit easily. I returned this juicer and am still very happy with my CCJ-100!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect citrus juicer","review":"This is a great juicer for citrus fruit. You just push a halved citrus fruit against the reamer, and the filtered juice pours out the spout. It is very stable (no walking around the counter), easy to clean and quiet (just a moderate whirring sound). The spout is positioned high enough for my tallest glasses. In short, it's perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so professional","review":"this juicer is not what we expected, based on the reviews we had read. it simply does not perform well at its most basic task, getting juice out of an orange or lemon. frustratingly, the motor appears to disengage when you \\"press firmly\\", which is the recommended operating method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sturdy juicer","review":"I bought the juicer to handle a tree full of giant sized Ponderosa lemons (they're the size of grapefruit) that is getting ahead of me in lemon production. I juice the lemons and freeze juice in ice cube trays for later cooking -- but with a manual juicer and a hundred large lemons, my hands couldn't keep up. Enter the Waring juicer. Now all I have to do is cut, juice, and pour, and the thing goes through lemon after giant lemon with no problem at all. I've done juicing sessions of 1 hour at a time. Now all I have to do is figure out how to use all these cubes of juice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the cheap plastic gears","review":"I love everything about this juicer except the cheap plastic gears. The base is sturdy and heavy. The motor is plenty strong. The design of the reamer and basket are effective and easy to clean. I usually just rinse well after use and it's ready to go again. The motor is a bit noisy. The reason for one star is the gears between the motor and the reamer are plastic. They've nearly stripped after less than one year of moderate use. Now the gears keep jumping cogs and the unit is extremely noisy. It is only a matter of time before the gears are completely stripped and the whole unit gets sent to recycling. What a waste. For the price I paid, the unit should be a lot more reliable. Engineers or product planners at Waring get an F for releasing this design. Do I really want to throw good money after bad for another Waring unit??? BTW, I am an engineer, and nothing peeves me more than an expensive product becoming useless for the sake of a $0.15 piece of plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Strong, sturdy, easy to clean, doesn't slide around the counter, juices much more efficiently than the cheaper model I had. What more could anyone want?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Power galor","review":"Great Juicer. Living in the Southwest, it is lemon season and this juicer plowed through the hundreds of lemons I juiced. The switch was broken in transit but bought another switch and installed it without any problem. I'm highly satisfied with the sellers shipping time and with the juicer over all. If you want fresh orange juice every day or juice for lemonade or grapefruit juice, this is the one for you. Reasonably priced and well built. Made in the USA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful workhorse","review":"I've used this juicer for years and it keeps on juicing. Motor never skips even with heavy pressure.

Doesn't bother me but drives my wife crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Citrus Juicer","review":"Works very very well! Easy to use and easy to clean. I am not sure why it is promoted as a stainless steel juicer as none of the juice ever comes into contact with any of the stainless steel. The actual parts that do the work and come into contact with the food are all plastic. I still like it very much and can recommend this product.22APR12Still using the juicer and loving it. I make 5qts. of ice tea at a time and I like to keep some citrus juice on hand ready to go in a glass jar that I keep in the refrigerator. I can do a bag of lemons, limes, or oranges very quickly and easily. The juicer separates the the seeds from the juice very well and cleans up very quickly & easily. I don't baby this thing, so I can say that it seams to be holding up pretty well under the circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I read a ton of reviews and picked this item. It is fast, powerful & super easy to clean up.

Wanted a better replacement and this was it. Solid with good power ... doesn't slow when you push down hard. It retains pulp nicely, but if you want some, you can just slop it over. No problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Service!","review":"This is a duplicate replacement juicer for the one I have had for six years. I am replacing it because I currently hear straining noises in the motor and don't want to take a chance of the old one conking out before I have a replacement standing in the wings to take over (since I usually juice a full 40 lb case at a time).I can't say enough great things about this product. One should remember that the motor has a full five year warranty. Most juicers you buy for around $25 are lucky if they last a year (I went through about three of 'em before finding this gem). I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic \\"gear\\" and rotating parts wear out and fail! Avoid!","review":"Press hard enough to get all the juice out of an orange or a grapefruit and the motor either stalls out or the cheap white plastic drive deforms and fails to turn the rotating juicer device on top. Needs a stronger motor AND metal parts that would not wear and slip. Do not waste your money on this or any other juicer with plastic gearing and rotating parts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only juicer that lasts","review":"This juicer is simple and it works. It has a switch on the side, so the push down to turn on type switch in the other ones that always breaks isn't there. It's really just a motor with a reamer on it - simple and effective. The motor is powerful - it never bogs down. The white finish is probably easier to keep clean, nut the stainless looks pretty sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Juicer","review":"This is the second juicer I tried and it works well. It doesn't walk across my counter and juices pretty efficiently. I guess the only negative thing about it is the build-up of pulp after processing several fruits, which doesn't release a lot of juice and I have to take something to scrape it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Horror Tale Even for Non-Horror Readers","review":"As a fellow Five Star author, I can say with some authority that this is a tale worth reading even if you're not into horror stories.

I can not wait for Nate Kenyon's next novel. I think I've found my new favorite author."},{"rating":"1","title":"As your grandmother told you, \\"Don't judge a book by its cover!\\"","review":"\\"Bloodstone\\" is a plodding supernatural tale that never got off the ground for me. I struggled to get through the first 200 pages and should have stopped at that point and moved on to another book. I kept going only because a number of reviewers noted that the book improved dramatically during its last third. Well, maybe that was true, but not enough for me to give the book more than two stars.The book contained characters that I really didn't care about, and frankly, found unlikeable. The story, at least in my humble opinion, certainly didn't match the book's exciting and provocative cover. Kenyon's novel has been compared to the work of Stephen King; in my estimation the only thing \\"Bloodstone\\" has in common with anything that King's written was that it used Maine as the setting for the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"space ape ruins this mix.","review":"When I first heard space Ape on the Burial CD, I thought he was tight.

It is a real show stopper. All the duets preceding it were quite good too with the kids working out their personal relationships around the duets.

We spent a whole prior season on this very issue. This season opens with that being the dominant issue among the glee club members. Meanwhile, the teachers are all (realistically) facing budget cuts in extracurriculars so it is war among those teachers (sue, will and the new football coach). Sue is fantastic as usual. The musical numbers are great. Also, the new football coach is a hoot, a woman no less.

I hope they transfer him back to Mckinely soon, because the shows seems off with him split from 'his glee club.'

Their entire life seems to be taken up with singing and dancing. When do you see them do any study? They also have a massive range of songs so when do they find the time to learn them all. The second series seems to be changing into a gay series as more students are coming out .Most of them are far too old to be high schools students and that is where credibility disappears out the door. Have the writers run out of ideas? Episode 8 consisted mostly of songs and with little of anything else. The characters of Sue and the headmaster are totally ridiculous. More cartoon characters than real people.They become very annoying after a while. The cast is very talented as far as their singing and dancing goes and they obviously have a huge budget despite the dialogue stating otherwise.

The storylines were generally smartly written, the characters likeable and the tone of the show was mature enough for adult audiences without alienating younger ones.For this second season almost everything good about the first has been stripped down and reduced to a musical soap opera for teenagers. This in itself could be OK given the shows primary demographic except the first season set the bar so much higher. The majority of the characters have been rewritten into trite caricatures of their formal selves and come across as petty and unlikeable. The adult actors still deliver fine performances but their roles have been pushed far into the sidelines to make room for more high school angst.

Much gospel of this era was rockified, informed by soul and funk of the era. This= crated a wonderful chemistry that made the inspired material great listening, no matter your religious persuasion.Salvation is no Stax album, but does have its share of funky gospel, and singers informed by soul. This does not dominate the album--there is softer, more pop and theater influenced work, but still plenty of groove to go around. Listen to some of the bass lines here, which could easily function on any deep (or top 40) soul single. 1969 gospel on 1969 popular culture imbued musicianship.I wonder how many DJ's have sampled this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely a copy of Ayn Rand and Muscle& Fitness articles","review":"Nearly half of this book is a reprint of Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty Training Advice that the author reprinted from old Muscle and Fitness magazines. His material about Dorian Yates's training is reprinted from old muscle magazines as well and is partially incorrect at that. The ONLY thing good about this book were the pictures and he used virtually the same photos several times at that. Hey Little, how many times can you use a photo of Mentzer on a Nautilus Pullover machine? I am a HUGE Mentzer fan having had a phone consultation with him once but this book straight up sucks. I view this book as nothing more that trying to milk another dollar off of Mentzer's good name. As the previous review stated there is nothing here that is original.

WHAT A BOOK!","review":"This book is the answer to the question: Who is Mike Mentzer? His greatest contributions to bodybuilding science, his having the guts to stand up to Arnold and corporate bodybuilding, his advanced training techniques -- everything! It made me appreciate Mentzer that much more. John Little together with Joanne Sharkey has done a fantastic job of making Mike's ideas sparkle with new radiance and relevance. The photos are great (I I haven't seen most of them before) and very inspirational. Little, a long time close friend of Mentzer's, speaks from the heart about his friend but also uses air-tight logic to present his points. The Consolidation Routine is a killer -- especially when used with the advanced technique of Infitonic! Long live Heavy Duty!

The price is easily justified when compared to the cheap rapid chargers that are often bundled with batteries. The primary benefit is that the charge rate can be reduced to prevent heat damage to the batteries. The other modes are helpful as well, but not often used.

It worked OK, though I noticed some inherent heating issues, especially at the higher charging current levels. Upon charging, the AAs would get quite hot - almost too hot to touch. One day, the charger died in a rather spectacular manner. Smoke poured from the unit and the 4 expensive Eneloop batteries being charged overheated and started to swell up. Glad I was around to notice it before this device burned my house down. I tossed this dangerous thing in the garbage (once it was completely cooled, of course). I went back to the plain-jane Sanyo wall charger I used before.Fifty bucks is a lot of money to spend on a battery charger. Paying this kind of dough is even more of an insult when the device presents a safety hazard. Avoid this charger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great battery charger","review":"I've been using this battery charger for a while now and love it. It does the best job of charging batteries, more importantly it tells me when my rechargeable batteries need to be recycled. I can tell how much useful life is left in the battery, make sure the battery is working at its highest performance and properly charge my batteries all in one station.This charger has also allowed me to sort my various rechargeable batteries and determine which ones work best for different needs. I've found a few \\"expensive\\" batteries that don't last any longer than some cheaper rechargeable ones.I have it plugged into next to my computer and quickly swap out dead batteries for recharged ones and keep on going.Great battery charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Once","review":"Received the unit on a Monday from Amazon, which provided excellent, quick service. Plugged it in, inserted 4 batteries and did a \\"Refresh\\" to restore them. Finished the cycle a couple days later. The next day I plugged the unit in to do another set of batteries. The unit would power up to the \\"Ready\\" state and then reset after about 10 seconds. This happened continously, even after inserting batteries and trying to set the operating mode. I purchased this unit because I have seen it operate and believe it has good ideas. Very disappointed in the quality of the unit since it only worked once. Will try Customer Service at La Crosse."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Crosse Technology Battery Charger","review":"This is a great package... includes 4 AA rechargeable batteries and 4 AAA sized rechargeables as well as the charger.

I used it several times over xmas holidays as I have 3 digital cameras and a video camera that all use rechargeable batteries. Don't let the 1 star complaints keep you from buying this charger. Frankly I am surprised at the complaints about the complexity of multiple choices for charging, etc. I thought I might struggle with that since others had complained, but it is quite simple and doesn't take long to remember what button to push to get the desired results.

But it also said it came with 4 C and D adapters. Now since I thought this was a battery charger, I assumed that they meant it came with 4 C and D adapters that would make it so you could charge these batteries on this AA and AAA charger. That is not what they meant. They meant you could put AA's in these adapters and they would work where you normally would need C or D batteries. It cost me money to send it back because of the misleading advertising.

Although it is relatively expensive compared to others on the market, its functionality, versatility and the information it provides on each battery justify the price. It definitely merits 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Restores nearly failed batteries","review":"Very nice charger for not much than I paid for cheapies. The refresh mode takes a while (days, sometimes for batteries that won't hold a charge) but I've restored a dozen batteries to their listed capacity or above. One battery that never took a charge out of the pack now has 90% of advertised capacity after a round of refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reliable friend","review":"I purchased one for my son. He liked it so much that I ended up getting three for myself. I have two for my digital camera batteries and one for my digital recorder batteries. If you use NiMH batteries then do yourself a favor and charge them at the low setting as they recommend. I've been using the same four sets of batteries for over 2 years now. I have older batteries which I wasn't as careful with and as they begin fail I notice a diminished cell voltage when you begin to charge them after they've been in the same camera together. I save those batteries off to the side and I use them in flash lites and other things.By the way the batteries that come with them seem to have a larger diameter than most batteries. I notice that they are a tight fit in my digital camera. I think that perhaps they are manufacturing rejects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best charger I have ever used....","review":"I bought this charger after buying the Duracell 15 minute charger. The Duracell would eat up the batteries, but this La Crosse unit is much better and gives the batteries a much longer life.

Also, it comes with C and D adapters you plug your AA batteries into to run something that requires those two batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have burned my house down","review":"Purchased a Lacrosse Charger mainly for charging batteries for my kids toys. First few months it worked fine. One day I plugged it into the same wall socket I always used for it, put in the Lacrosse Batteries that came with it and let it do it's thing. 20 minutes later I smelled something burning. Found out the smell was the charger. The screen had gone half black, the batteries inside it were swollen and extremely hot, too hot to touch, and the charger had melted under the batteries. The tray part of the charger where the batteries go had swollen, melted and warped. I contacted Lacrosse, and no response as of yet, so we will wait and see. I will update my review when I hear from LAcrosse support. Until then, I cannot give this more than one star since it could have burned my home down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value out there","review":"I do a lot of research on everything I buy, especially electronics, and when I did research and bought this in 8/09 it was the best deal out there as far as a battery charger.

Saved several sets of older batteries.","review":"I bought this due to the stellar previous reviews and also because I needed a smart charger. My old dumb charger ruined several sets of batteries.I love the LaCrosse. I have no complaints other than it does too much! Once I got the hang of it with the manual, all is well, but initially it can be quite intimidating due to the sheer amount of options.It also helped save a few sets of old batteries that had their capacity reduced to about 20% by my old charger. This new one, after a few days of cycling, brought the batteries back to about 80% and usable.It also does wonders with a new set of Duracell precharged rechargeables I bought. Charges them fast, and keeps them in tip top shape.Highly recommended charger, and it will save you tons of money in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what it is supposed to","review":"Getting through all of the extended technical reviews, let me sum this up...It's not simple to use if you want to do advanced features. You actually have to read the manual, which could be a touch better. I went through over 50 AA batteries and it weeded out a good dozen completely bad ones in about 2 weeks of charging them all. The ones that were working poorly are now working well after it re-conditioned them. This is truly the best charger of its type I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CHARGER EVER","review":"The LaCROSSE CHARGER IS THE BEST CHARGER I HAVE.I TAKE A LOT OF UNDERWATER PHOTOS.WE DIVE EVERY DAY, WITH THE CAMERS AND THE LARGE FLASH I USE UP THE BATTERYS FAST.BUT THIS CHARGER WILL KEEP UP(BC-9009 ALPHAPOWER)RICK IN MEXICO"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feature Rich","review":"Not much to add after all the already existing great reviews - which were the reason I purchased this charger.Never owed a charger before, so I have nothing with which to compare. However, this charger has plenty of great features - various charging modes, the ability to charge both AA and AAA batteries and simultaneously a mix of them, the ability to have each battery charged with a different charging mode and a different current, adapters for C & D type batteries, and plenty more.And above all, this charger is able to fully charge batteries in a reasonable time frame.

Very high value! with D and C compatible attachments, very sturdy travel case, it is a device that lets you know exactly what condition your rechargeable batteries are in and does a wonderful (albeit long) job of refreshing older batteries! I will take 1,200 digital pics a day at times but with a few extra rechargeable battery packs this unit keeps em' charged and ready to quench the cameras voracious thirst for battery juice. I plan on purchasing another unit to act as a standing refresh unit, dedicated to refreshing batteries only, to free up the original charger for recharge only use.

To my horror I saw 2 batteries with the acid leaking out of the jacket of the batteries! little bubbles of acid coming out.I turned it off but by this time it was so hot i had to use a paper towel to remove them! after that,I noticed the bottom of the charger where the batteries lay was melted! WHAT!!! I called LACROSSE and they told me to send it back.I have another one on the way,ACCORDING TO THEM but i don't know if its a new version or not.It will be here in 3 days. if its the exact same one, I don't want it!

Surprisingly small unit.Runs on 3 volt DC power via the AC adapter included. Beautiful unit, runs cool even when charging 4 batteries at a time, just wish it ran on 12 volt DC so I could easily use in my car, or solar charger, for my long camping trips.This package came with a carrying case, 4 high capacity 2600mah AA and 4 1000mah batteries, as well as adapters to use the AA's as C or D size batteries. The charger alone is worth the price but the extra goodies will be used too.I've had 4 other chargers, all had problems, one ruined batteries, others ran hot, etc. This is the only charger I will recommend to friends and recommend it without hesitation. Easy to use, even for advanced features."},{"rating":"2","title":"good charger","review":"Good Charger. Works nicely and doesnt heat up. \\"Refresh\\" mode takes a looong time. Came with decent bag, a set of AA and AAA rechargeable batteries (havent tried them yet) and adapters for the bigger size batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"The charger you want","review":"This is the battery charger you want. Forget the things you see in the impulse isles of big box stores, this is the one.The default charge setting goes nice and slow (for good battery life), but with one button you can charge them in a number of increments, up to 1800mA (which is very fast). After they're full, the charger moves into a low power maintenance mode to keep them fully powered and ready to go. The display shows how much you've charged each battery. The included carrying case comes with a form adapter so that you can use AA batteries in things that take C and D cells (although obviously for not as long)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price","review":"There are other, more extensive reviews, and so I will keep this one short. I will say that this battery charger is a great investment even if you only have a couple devices that use up batteries. By being able to know the capacity of my batteries I can match them and more effectively use them. The refresh feature is great, and can turn nearly useless batteries into functioning ones again. A great product overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the hundreds of other reviewers say it is.","review":"Since I don't want to repeat what everyone else said, let me just say... THEY'RE RIGHT!It's easy to use. Intuitive interface. Revives batteries that other chargers have given up for dead. Having an individual LCD readout for each individual battery is wonderful and a huge advantage over the MAHA charger, while being half the MAHA's size. This is the charger to own! It will save you from situations where you thought you left the house with charged batteries in your camera; only to find that the batteries had lost their capacity. Well... not only will this tell you their capacity in charge/test mode, but will bring back their capacity in refresh mode. I highly recommend this charger!Edit: 6/24/11: I wrote the first review a few years back. It's a great charger, but this year, the mode (right) button stopped working. I can't do anything other than charge now. Ah well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings rechargeables back to life","review":"I'd been using a quick charger for many years and unknowingly killing my rechargeable batteries. Nearly all my rechargeable batteries were dead after a year, and wouldn't work at all for things like my camera or video game controllers. I didn't want to throw them away so started looking into the charger as the problem. Came across the BC-9009 and couldn't be happier. Refresh mode got every one of my AAA and AA batteries back to full charge within a week. The great things about this charger are the digital readout for voltage and mAh levels, the fact that it fully drains the batteries before recharging so you don't lose capacity, and the refresh mode which drains and charges the batteries 20 times to get them back to full capacity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't hold your breath waiting for a response from Tech. Support","review":"I bought this item last December and it has been nothing but a headache. The latest issue, since receiving a factory transformer upgraded, is the charger no longer charges.

I have used all types of chargers, and this one is the best I've ever had. It has even resurrected batteries I thought were dead with it's capacity cycling function. I have used it on both Ni-Cd and Ni-MH chemistry cells with great success. The only negatives I can think of is that it will not handle larger cells like C or D. It will not handle 9V, alkaline, or Li-ion batteries either. But is anything absolutely perfect for all things in all occasions? Not in this world, but this is the best charger I've seen so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Neat","review":"I got it when it was on sale and it was one of the best battery chargers that I have ever used (I used at least 30 different battery chargers before).I really like its features and it really helps users like us who like to know all the details about the rechargable batteries.It performs well and the quality is pretty good. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think their functioning buttons are easy to push, the response of pushing them is kinda sluggish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Charger","review":"This charger has allowed me to rescue several rechargeable batteries that I had resigned myself to discarding. I use it for all my charging now for the same reasons other people have given. I took away one star in my rating as it cannot recharge fully discharged NiCads. I have to put them in an old NiCad charger for a few minutes then let this charger take over.

This is far better than the previous charger, because it has the ability to fast charge batteries (one or two AAA batteries can be recharged in as little as 25 minutes!) and because it has discharge functions and refresh functions, which refresh old batteries. My only gripe about it is that it only gives you 8 seconds to set the current and then you have to take out the batteries if you want to change it later. You should be able to change the current at any given time not just 8 seconds after inserting the battery. It would be nice to be able to change the default current from 200 mA to 500 and why is the discharge always half of the charging current?I have refreshed several old batteries with this charger, and they are nearly like new now, even those that have been lying around for more than a year unused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Fantastic","review":"This unit is the best battery charger I have ever used. It reliably charges all of my NiCD batteries. It works so well that we have almost completely converted to using rechargables only. I did have an issue with one battery that had no/low voltage and the unit failed to recognize that it was in the charger. I had to use a low voltage power supply for another device to get a little bit of voltage into the battery. That only took a couple of minutes and then the battery charged charged the battery perfectly. Versatile, functional and well made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent battery that wouldnt charge, customer service was rude.","review":"I left more feedback under the top negative review titled \\"Customer service a joke - possible unsafe product\\"Subtract 2 stars because this charger will not charge batteries that are dead or have a very low charge. Batteries much first be charged with another charger and brought up to minimum level before this charger can register them (otherwise you get a NULL reading when they are inserted).Subtract 2 more points for rude customer service rep who clearly needs a lesson in manners and etiquette on treatment of customers over the phone.

I love gadgets and can usually pick something up and master it within minutes. I read the instructions, and was operating the BC-900 correctly, but it just didn't want to perform. I couldn't get it to fully charge the batteries it came with. One stopped at around 300mA, one at 1750mA, and the other two stayed around 2100mA for a few hours before I decided this charger wasn't for me.

Although the user interface is not perfect, the battery charger is hands down the best on the market. If you are into battery charging, then this is the unit for you. It gives you several options for charging current and allows you to set it by battery. It also has discharge options and allows you to fully see what your battery is doing. I also think they do a better job when it comes to automatically stopping charging. I don't think they are cooking any batteries. Add to that the 4D cell inserts and 4C cell inserts and 4 AAA and 4AA batteries and you have a winner.The only other thing to note is that an AA batter is just slightly longer then a C cell. I used six C cell inserts, which simply hold the AA batteries in place and had to struggle to get them into the radio.

Also, one AAA battery failed to charge about 20 cycles and another failed after about 30 cycles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it....","review":"I will say that the first unit was a flop, but don't let that stop you. I returned it to the manufacturer and they mailed me a new one... But this baby is a gem. I've had batteries for a long time and was having difficulty getting any use out of many of them. So, I got this because of the refresh. It works! Maybe not as good as some of the other reviews, but the good batteries pick right up, just like other have said. Then there are those dogs, but hey! They are usable for all those low consumption devices. Long and short, it is worth the bucks to save or revitalize the dead beats and to know which are you good sets and mark the dogs..."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick charging","review":"after having the AC adapter replaced, this charger does everything I need. Having the carry case with it is a bonus! No more buying batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melts itself","review":"I bought one charger, had the same melting issues with the buttons and the screen going dark, sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement, and had the exact same thing happen again. I've tried several types of batteries. The charger got great reviews, but it really is junk in its current manufacturing quality. Don't buy, or if you do get good fire insurance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard!! Don't buy","review":"La Crosse Technology BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery ChargerI purchased two La Crosse BC-9009 Battery Chargers and after only six weeks one of them overheated, melted, and stated to smoke. These units have a history of defects and are fire hazards. I've contacted the US Consumer Product Safety Commission and they are opening an investigation. If you have had a similar experience please contact them to file a report so we can remove this dangerous product from the marketplace. 1 800 638 2772.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"LaCrosse BC-900 Battery Charger","review":"I've had this for a month now and it has proven to be an excellent charger. I have a 10 bay microprocessor nimh slow charger and was looking to get one more portable and faster. I also have a Rayovac quick charger that overheated my batteries. This one delivers as described. I warn you, there is a learning curve to use this properly. It took me a good 20 minutes or so to sift through the manual before the initial charge. After that, it was easy. I especially like the battery refresh and test features. This comes in very handy when using many nimh batteries like I do (I have more than 50 floating around the house in various toys, lights, and tools). With this I don't have to guess if the battery capacity is matched with the other batteries. You also get a sense of which company (battery maker) is accurate about claimed capacity and how they lose capacity as well. Would buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock bottom quality","review":"Unit was DOA, with a completely nonfunctional keypad. Amazon paid return shipping and promptly refunded the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"takes days","review":"Bought this charger and it works, but it literally takes days to condition one set of batteries. I keep it in the closet now and use a charger from radio shack. That one works really well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Exploder","review":"This LaCrosse Technology BC-900 battery charger has an undocumented feature. It can wake you from a sound sleep.My partner and I were staying at a motel in Canada when disturbed by what sounded like a gunshot. At first I thought there was a homicide in the next room, but it turned out to be my battery charger increasing its carbon footprint.Quite a few of these chargers have melted, according to reviews on Amazon, but this explosion of my charger was much more dramatic. I uploaded a photo showing the damaged charger and an exploded battery.I plan to contact La Crosse to see if they can provide a safe replacement.We spent about half an hour cleaning carbon powder from the walls, ceiling, floor and fixtures in the bathroom. My charger is V22."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a charger","review":"Plug it in, charges, that's it. Not much to say but it works. I keep it on the default settings and it charges my double AA batteries in like 12 hours. Fine with me, since I'm in no rush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great charger, just a steep learning curve","review":"The charger seems to be great, but it's a lot more complex than any other charger I've had. With the others, I just put the batteries in and once the lights turn green, it means they are finished. With this, you can select different charge rates, drain power, refresh, and do so many other things. If you're easily confused, it's not for you, but if you like gadgets and want to keep your batteries in tip top shape, then it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent charger","review":"So far this charger has been everything I hoped it would be. It is the best charging system that I have seen. The only reason that I did not give it five stars is that I have not had it long enough to determine its durability. If it lasts 10 years and doesn't eat up batteries then I will be very happy I bought it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot charge low voltage batteries","review":"Charger appear to work as intended but three of the La Crosse batteries shows as 'null' and cannot be charge. This is what La Crosse customer support response:\\"This charger requires at least .9v in the battery in order to charge it. If the battery is depleted below that point, you will not be able to charge it on this battery charger\\"I can't believe their solution is for me to buy another charger to bring up the voltage, and then charge the rest using the La Crosse charger. Totally ridiculous.Additional comment: Save your money and buy the BC-700. After charging the La Crosse batteries I found it would not hold a charge. Totally useless batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great charger","review":"This is the best battery charger I have ever used. well worth the money!Give 4 star because the one I received from Amazon seems to be an open-box item (box and bags apparently re-sealed with another tape). The charger itself looks new and have no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive technology","review":"I bought this and enjoyed it for probably less than two weeks before my son plugged the wrong AC adapter into it and smoked it. Argh! While it's really amazing, I use enough batteries, that it's preferable to have a charger that can do more than four batteries at a time. The LCD read out is really cool. I bought a replacement charger after my wife got a new camera and keep it out of reach of the little guy. I'm using the batteries in our Wii-motes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very buggy","review":"* It doesn't load the battery properly. The batteries are charged for 10 minutes then it says the battery it full. Then, I have to remove the battery and put it back. Only now it will charge the battery properly.* The 'refresh battery' function is not working at all!!!* Support was blaming my batteries! But I use about 9 different brands. They can't be all bad and LaCrosse good!* No power connector for Europe (230V).* The quality of the batteries included in the package is good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexplicable bad engineering - DO NOT BUY","review":"The 1-4 buttons under the batteries are plastic and connect to a potentially hot contact underneath, which can cause them to melt and become inoperable.Other than the fatal flaw, a quite good unit. Mine died after about three weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"overheating","review":"i just received this charger and already the unit has overheated and melted the 2 and 3 buttons. Looking at the past few days of reviews is looks like this isn't an isolated case either, which is unfortunate because it appears like it does pretty much exactly what i want it to do. Now i'm left with the decision to try returning this and getting another lacrosse charger and hoping it's not messed up or going with the maha c-9000update: amazon immediately sent out a replacement charger, however the same issue occurred with the new charger. I can't recommend this product if it's going to overheat and potentially be a fire hazard. I am going to order this instead, hopefully the quality is a few steps up from the lacrosseMaha Powerex MH-C9000 WizardOne Charger-Analyzer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revive All the Old Rechargeables in Your House","review":"The charger arrived before its scheduled delivery and worked wonderfully out of the box. I have a number of solar powered lights in the yard and used this device to refresh the whole bunch. Half indicated \\"dead\\" even though they recharged with other chargers and guess what? They were really beyond revival. Rechargeable batteries can fool you if you don't have a device that can actually determine their real usefulness - not great if your depending on them to power a camera. Great device and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced Junk","review":"This expensive charger only lasted me a year-and-a-half before catastrophic failure.
