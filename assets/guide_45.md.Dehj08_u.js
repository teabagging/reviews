Joseph Smith in his caption identifies the two female figures as male. It is evident that (a) Smith didn't know the difference between male and female costumes in Egypt, and (b) the caption is patently false, and (c) therefore we may suppose, on the basis of this caption alone, that the document as Smith presents it is a fraud."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have.","review":"This book is a wonderful addition to my kindle library.

Joseph Smith claimed this is an ancient record of Abraham(along with a rewritten Genesis). However, Smith did not count on the fact that the original document would still be around and we would be able to translate it. The document survived and is in fact not an ancient record of Abraham and varying account of Genesis.

Tiny stuffs always get caught in the tiny holes in the grinder and it is not always easy to get them all out. It takes just a few moments to make the juices, a minute to finish the juices (they taste great), but a lot longer to clean up.

The mini-games are fun because of the DS's touch screen. For instance, there's a game where you have to unroll a toilet paper roll. There's also microphone mini-games, such as blowing into the mic to land a paper airplane into a target. The game lacks in difficulty, because it's just too darn easy! I beat the game in a couple of days, because it was so short also. But the main purpose is to play the game over and over again to get more games. You can practice the games also, which is like taking a test. You have to beat the same game a number of times to pass. Since the games are so easy, you'll probably pass the practice with a 70, when you only needed a 15.

Ingraham sees Hillary's leftist ideology as offering women nothing but a series of traps of dependency. After all, if women are truly strong and independent, they don't need Hillary or N.O.W. or some other victims' group to \\"protect\\" their rights. This isn't another tome of hate against Mrs. Clinton, it's a book that unpacks her ideas, and scrutinizes the effects of those ideas on society at large.

He got to his position depending on his father and brother, we can not lambast Hillary for something which we praise George for.In writing this book in the first place Laura Ingraham becomes that which she hates the most, in writing a defence of feminism she fails herself and her cause through only criticising a woman.

Additionally, you can have you dinner in less than 10 minutes.Their are two difficulties. Uneven cuts of meat or fish are very difficult to cook. The best bet is to cut piece into sections that are of equal thickness. Along the same line, cuts that are over 1 1/2 to 2 inches do not cook all the way through. Additionally, clean up, though not too difficult, can be messy. It cleans up well with paper towels or sponges, but some elbow-grease can be required, as \\"gunk\\" tends to develop on the grill as meat cooks--especially when seasoning prior to cooking.Bottom-line: This grill does so much for so little.

With the turkey burgers, try mixing some chopped red onions, an egg white, some tabasco, some low sugar BBQ sauce, and fresh ground black pepper, in with the ground turkey before cooking (yummy)! Tuna steaks with peppered honey mustard is really good too. Little tip:Put on your sauces about 1 minute before its done cooking or they end up burning.

I used mine three times (pork chop, steak, chicken breast)...then...took it out and set it by the garbage can. Save your money! I wish there were provisions available to put up eiter \\"zero\\" stars...or...\\"negative\\" stars. I had no choice but to put up one, undeserved, star. Again, save your money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect For 1 Person","review":"This unit is for my single daughter.

It does a good job grilling food, but it's small and it's rather a pain to clean. We liked the way it cooked enough that we turned around and bought the bigger 4 burger GF grill that has the removable grill plates that are dishwasher safe. This is working better for us. The small one would probably be fine for one person or two people who eat the recommended serving sizes of meat. Spend the extra few dollars to get the GF sponge for cleaning it, though.

It is fast, healthy, and you can make some good tasting stuff, but you can do the same with a non-stick pan.These things are not easy to clean. The flavor isn't there as well, so I threw mine away.It's a great idea in many ways, made George far more money than even his boxing, but I'd suggest a mini propane grill as the best compromise between electric and charcoal/wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't buy another","review":"They are hard to clean thoroughly, it throws grease everywhere when you lift the lid and I will never waste my money on another product with this Morons name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"George is Over-rated","review":"I enjoy cooking and am drawn to new ways to cook healthy food.

That's about all it does. Yes, the fat drips between the raised sections of metal. Whoop-de-doo.It will cook your burgers. It will cook your steaks and hot dogs, too. But they won't taste like they came off a real grill. They'll taste like you heated them up in a George Foreman grill, which is sterile and boring. Steaks turn ghostly white.Now for the real fun -- cleaning. You cannot immerse this thing in water. You cannot remove the grill plates for washing. You've got to wash it while it's all together.

My roommates like to use it and \\"forget\\" to clean it because it's such a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This !!","review":"This does not have removable grill plates and is a PAIN PAIN PAIN to clean !! There is just no easy way to clean this since you cannot remove the grill plates from the unit, and of course you can't get the unit wet. Spend the money to get a grill with removable plates. In addition the unit does NOT have any adjustable thermostat control so every piece of meat cooks at a high temperature which produces a *crisp* (not in a good way) outer layer with a not well done enough middle. I couldn't cut through the outer layer of the meat it was so tough !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"How can so many people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread? I bought one of these because I thought it would be cheaper, easier and more convenient than an outdoor gas grill and because some friends had told me how great it was. I've tried to cook steaks on it a few times and each time the steak comes out dry, tough, and an unappetizing gray color instead of brown, tender and juicy.

While I was initially skeptical, it has proved to be a great tool to whip up a variety of dishes-pain free. I use it quite a bit for chicken, and it works great with boneless skinless chicken breasts, cooking them with ease.Other uses can be hamburgers, which need to be made very slim to effectively use with your George Foreman grill.

If you're sick of all that cafeteria food, just use this Forman grill. It's also the perfect size for 1-2 people. You can cook chicken, burgers, steak, etc. on here, but the hard part comes when you try to clean it. You're not supposed to \\"immerse\\" it in water, as the label says, so you have to clean it very carefully (one of the reviewers said to put two damp paper towels in between the grill after cooking; I have yet to try that). You shouldn't clean it with a steel wool pad because it'll take the coating off, so use a sponge or something better. If you make hamburgers on there, it'll take a while to clean, and even longer to dry if you should happen to get water in it. But those problems don't detract from the fact that this is a very useful appliance.*Also recommended for bachelor pads."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice surprise","review":"After several people told me that I had to get this grill, I was skeptical but when I saw it on Amazon.com for under ten dollars new I figured I had nothing to lose. I was quite pleasantly surprised to find that it actually is as easy to use and clean as everyone says, and does live up to the infomercial claims. It cooks quickly and with no radiating heat you can use it in the summer without heating up your house. The only downside to this grill is that it is too small for a family meal, so I have to cook things one at a time. This isn't that big a deal most of the time however, because things like chicken and fish cook so quickly that the other serving is still warm when the second one finishes. It cleans up very easily and quickly, and takes up very little room in the cupboard because it stands vertically. If only I could cook 2 or 3 servings at a time, then it would be perfect. I guess I need to invest in the family size grill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum Yum Yum...","review":"Cooks a 1.5 inch steak in 3 mins plus 1 minute pre-heating...great item, great price, great food.

It sits on top of the waffle iron and I can hardly tell the difference between the two.I wasn't impressed with the taste of the food. It's nice to pretend you're eating healthy since 1% of the grease in that 20% fat hamburger dripped out, but guess what? The burger tastes bad. I also found grilling vegetables to be a pain. Don't expect them to cook evenly unless you chop everything to exactly the same thickness. The model I got had a timer which is a nice convenience. It doesn't look like this one has it.It's basically a frying pan that puts grill marks on your food. The food doesn't taste as good as a charcoal or gas grill and cleanup takes longer than grilling or even pan frying. So why get it? Reviewers say it makes good grilled cheese sandwiches and I might give fish the old college try but I'm pretty sure mine's going back to the store before the 30 days is up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Great, but Good","review":"I bought this model because I have a very small kitchen and simply no room for a larger grill. Also, I mainly cook for just myself and my husband, so the size was fine. This grill does what it says it does, and clean-up is easy if you actually follow the strategies recommended in the instructions (I learned the hard way). Skinless, boneless chicken breasts come out wonderfully on this as long as you're careful not to overcook. At any rate, it is certainly not the best grill ever, but it is perfectly fine for someone who: 1) has a smaller kitchen; 2) cooks mainly just for 1 or 2 people; 3) doesn't need to use it every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried, hated and returned","review":"I wanted to eat healthier and bought the George Foreman grill. The grill is slanted so frozen foods slid off onto the floor, the grease catcher constantly slipped out of place, there is no OFF switch - it has to be unplugged - and the racks are not removable for dishwasher cleaning.

No wonder the price is dropping on the Foreman grill - great idea; bad design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The George Foreman Grill is a great product for anyone, especially college students.

In order for the inside to get done without burning the outside, I ended up slicing the chicken breast and the beef into very thin slices, then cooking them.I also agree with the other reviers - cleaning was a pain.With all the extra time waisted, we promptly returned it to our friend and now laugh whenever we see a comerical for any of the grills.So, if you like your meat cooked, then don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty, speedy & easy!","review":"Makes excellent burgers and steaks really fast.

It heats up very quickly, cooks evenly and without drying food out, but I caution people who think that cooking on the grill really reduces fat by a huge amount. As a lifelong \\"blotter\\" of fatty foods like hamburgers and bacon, I probably remove more grease and fat by patting a burger down with a few paper towels than drips off this grill in the cooking process. In short - buy it for the convenience and the quality of the product, but not as an excuse to pay less attention to the fat content in the foods you cook with it! If you keep those things in mind, this is a good product for the relatively low price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"grills fast","review":"It is a wonderful grill for 1 or 2 people, if you don't have a fancy cooktop or range that comes with a grill. I used it to make salmon teriyaki and the salmon came out real tender on the inside, with a nice grilled flavor. Cleaning is not too bad either as the nonstick surface seems to be permanently in tact. The only thing I wondered about this grill is why the drip pan was a flimsy white plastic and not aluminum or stainless steel. Although oil cools fast, I found myself worrying that the plastic would melt as soon as the oil dripped onto it. But of course it didn't and the drip pan cleaned well, so I can't give minus points for this one...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grilling again","review":"When my Father inadvertently killed my grill, I was truly pleased to find I could get an almost identical one to replace it.

Ever since a friend told me the ONLY way to clean it, I've never looked back. (When you are finished grilling, just unplug the machine, and close it on a dampened paper towel. Go eat.

Maybe I got a defective unit, but everything I cooked in it was hard and crunchy on the top and dried out!

I think the idea is wonderful and it deserves a certain amount of appreciation, but the sad fact is that it simply fails musically. Grandma's voice sounds like Norman Bates mom's voice, and the lyrics seem like they were family reminiscients poorly adapted to song.Maybe this album would work better accompanied by a wordless film or animation where the characters on screen acted out the stories. Think an indy rock version of R. Kelly's 'Trapped in the Closet.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Disappointment of the decade!!!","review":"All the naysayers are right this time.

These things have a number of issues:1) Sometimes the sound is way out of synch from the video. Happens sometimes when recording from TV and a lot if dubbing from VCR to DVD.2) If there is any static, pauses or other problems on the tape when to DVD, the unit just stops the recording and you get part of what you were copying followed by whatever was on TV or the default input.My sister-in-law bought one and it broke too.I guess I shouldn't have expected much for the price, but this is ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY unrrliable","review":"I've had one of these for a number of years. The only reason I've kept it so long is because I have a warranty on it. I've actually used the warranty about six times so far. I have to keep bringing it back to replace the laser. Apparently, they didn't mean for people to actually use this dvd recorder. I think if you burn more than fifty DVDs, the machine is shot. That's been my experience so far, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could rate it 0 stars","review":"This unit was purchased by our family in Aug 2006 and it had to be repaired in Oct 06, just over 2 months later, because the DVD tray, regardless of disc present, would just pop right back out and discs wouldn't play.

Even when they were working, the sound was often out of sync with the video. You will find other reports of this. It's most annoying (though not shocking) that TigerDirect sales people claim to have no knowledge of these problems... \\"first I heard of it\\"...But the worst part is that soon after I got them, around 3 months after getting them, they stopped being able to read new or un-finalized discs. I use Verbatim 8x DVD-R.I suggest that you read carefully the terms of any extended warranty policy before shelling out any more money.Too bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!!!","review":"I have to agree with all the other 1 star reviews. I purchased this player exactly 2 years ago and now it is nothing more than a piece of junk!! It won't recognize any dvd I burned on it and it won't even play store bought dvd's anymore. It just says the dvd is loading forever and then kicks the dvd out. It will play a dvd sporatically but good luck getting it to work. The recording capabilities were good and easy to use but what is the point if you can't watch these dvd's just 2 years later from a crappy product!

I have had the project for a little over a year, and now it no longer reads discs. I had the lense cleaned and it STILL DOES NOT READ DISCS!This product is garbage, like other reviewers have observed, it is nothing more than a 250 dollar VCR.Don't waste your money on a Samsung VR330, it will start crapping out in a year or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first, but one of our two units stopped working quickly","review":"We have two of these units. One continues to work most of the time, though occasionally it won't play DVDs that play fine in our Philips DVD player; the other Samsung that we bought at the same time will often not play out-of-the-box DVDs that play fine in the other unit. Some of the DVDs we have recorded do not play elsewhere, and the unit that has problems playing DVDs also can't be relied on to record something that can be played back later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made for heavy use","review":"I purchased this unit to copy vhs tapes to dvd. For the most part it worked well, with occasional disc errors, etc., but the errors overtime do become more frequent until the unit is no longer reliable, and you're wasting a lot of dvds. All in all, I got about 2 years out of it, which isn't that bad for the price. I'm still looking for a really well built and reliable dvd recorder, and from all the reviews I've read about various models and manufacturers they all have their quirks. Even the high end models have bad reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable DVD player and recorder","review":"I think just at a year it stopped working entirely for the DVD playing/recording side. It gives a disc initialization error, it malfunctions when playing a DVD. This model is now only good for playing mp3 and music CDs and VHS tapes, neither function is what I bought this for. I got probably 5 DVD recordings before this function stopped working.This unit lasted less than a year with moderate use and I most likely will stay away from Samsung electronics from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Unit","review":"This unit rejects 2 out of every 3 disks. The record quality is poor. Do not buy. I am sorry I did. Their TVs are great, but whoever designed this deck should be fired!"},{"rating":"1","title":"$250 VCR","review":"The most regrettable electronics purchase I've ever made.I've had this thing for about 10 months. Initially, performance was sketchy but not abysmal. It would record to almost any format DVD, but only single-layer DVD-R discs recorded in 1 or 2 hour mode played reliably in other players. There was a sync problem between audio and video in recorded discs.All this is in the past tense because that's what it would do back when it would read discs. Now, it no longer reads anything - blank discs...recorded discs...rented DVDs...new DVDs. I've tried to clean the lens and it's now about 50/50 on pre-recorded discs but beyond that, the DVD drive is pretty worthless. It's essentially just a $250 VCR at this point.I had a Toshiba DVD player that was still working after 7 years when I replaced it with this. I'll be sure to pick Toshiba over Samsung in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product Doesn't Work, Don't buy it!","review":"There is a 1/2 second delay between the picture and sound for all DVDs burned with this machine. My unit has been back to their repair shop 4 times. Two of those times they sent me refurbished units that also had the same defect. Each time, they have kept my machine for two-three months and then sent it back to me un-repaired. Their customer service is just playing games with me. I am no longer going to purchase Samsung products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problems: spits out discs after warranty expires","review":"We originally had an older DVD Recorder/VCR combo player from Samsung very similar to this one, but we sent it in to be replaced after it stopped reading discs and just rejected them. They gave us this unit as a replacement, and it worked fine for a few months, but then the same problem showed up. Now, every time you put in a disc, blank or not, it starts to load, then right before it actually starts playing it spits it out. DO NOT BUY THIS. Samsung's support is terrible and denies that the problems exist. The problems usually start soon after the warranty expires, so you'll have to spend another $60-$100 just to fix it until it breaks again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One more user whose experience with the DVD-VR330 was an unqualified success...","review":"I was able to commandeer this unit at our school for a solid week of transferring VHS tapes I knew I'd need for teaching, along with some favorites for re-watching at home, and was amazed at the ease of transfer and the machine's lack of persnickitiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I love this Combo. We got it in late 2006 refurbished for $80, I have it in my nice looking basement where we light a fire in our wood stove during the Winter. We watch DVDs and VHSs all the time on it. I record DVDs like crazy on it. It weighs at least 10 to 15lbs, little heavier than normal. I love it, I record from it all the time to have home made videos copied from VHS to DVD, and it works like a charm. Only thing is I had to open it up twice already to clean it out, ever since then, the VHS shows a little lines on the screen now. Other than that, its awesome and will probably use it until the VCR breaks all the way in it. Then I just get the newest Samsung DVD/VCR combo recorder. Thanks Samsung for all your good products!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst recorder I ever had!","review":"Samsung should be ashamed to have made such a overpriced faulty recorder.Mine has been for repair & still rejects over half the blank DVDs.Takes much longer to finalize discs than other makes.If you stop recording before full disc, it says to wait \\"a moment\\" & it takes enough time to have Breakfast or lunch.Could have bought 2-3 Lite-ons instead & they work much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU CAN FIND ANOTHER BRAND TRY IT!","review":"When I bought this item, it was on sale, which was one of the major reasons I bought it. It was really being sold at a great discount, but with all that it was not worth keeping. I was very glad to return this item, and I returned it. One observation was in copying scenes. The product freezes and that's what gets recorded, frozen image that lasts about five seconds on your recording. This was a major reason for the return. I also did not like the design of the item, it wasn't the latest design on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is my third DVD recorder. It is the best of all.

All in all, a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parody on \\"Walk The Line\\" movie","review":"From the very (silly) start of the movie you know you are in for the goofy fun. John C. Riley gives wonderful performance as a main character Dewey Cox in the movie that is sometime funny, sometimes offensive and filled with stars from start to finish. Cast includes most of the comedians from the Saturday Night Live show and in addition to that Jack Black, Lyle Lovett, Paul Rudd, Jason Schwartzman to name a few. They all give fantastic performances in a movie that is making fun of Johnny Cash, Beatles, Elvis Presley and pretty much the entire music industry. I am not sure if John C. Rilley did his own singing in this movie, but if he did, he has a great voice that matches his acting abilities (I have a great respect for this actor). If you watch this film, be ready for the night of fun poking and superficial laughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS parody!","review":"It's too bad this movie tanked at the box office because I thought it was a very funny movie! In fact, anybody who I knew saw it said the same so I know I'm not alone. Bottom line...it was funny! Was it cheesy at times?...sure, but it was great for the most part so I don't think it should be instantly disregarded just because it didn't do so well in theaters. This movie is obviously a parody of 'Walk the Line' & maybe even 'Ray,' & just quite frankly mocks the lives of how some people end up in the music industry after experiencing fame & success. This is a cult classic! I'll be buying it for a nice hard laugh now & then."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Funny Movie","review":"\\"Walk Hard\\" is not \\"Ha! Ha!\\" funny. It is however cleverly funny, which is good enough for me. The film makes fun of every part of the lives of musicians. Drugs, break-ups, divorces, family issues are all poked fun at in a campy way which make the film very fast-paced almost like a \\"Scary Movie\\" film. But because of the films context and John C. Reilly's fantastically silly acting, the film just works in its own right as a deviously entertaining film.Bottom line facts: The songs are hysterical. For the guys, adorable Jenna Fischer, Pam Beesly, from the Office is in it. In a great Beatle reference; Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Justin Long, Jason Schwartzman are the uncredited Beatles in the film. There are hassidic record moguls. And lastly is the tear jerking song at the end of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling Down Hard!!!","review":"I have always been a big fan of movies that feature good music: Eddie and the Cruisers, Almost Famous, Doing That Thing You Do, Pirate Radio. I love the movies that feature soundtracks of classic oldies, like American Graffiti. I should have noticed the \\"credits\\" (embarrassments) on the box before buying this one (40-year-old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, c'mon!!!)This movie is a let-down from every angle. The jokes are not funny, the music is not listenable, the acting is terrible, the sex scenes are revolting. It's not a comedy, not a drama, not a history, and too vulgar for family viewing. I bought it used at FYE, and, as usual, they won't buy the crap that they sell back. Oh, well, I have a two-disc dvd case for something else, along with a couple of frisbees for my dog. This is a pure piece of worthless trash, and, while I don't like to waste my time writing these reviews, I thought I might save someone else a few dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not doing badly for a married 15 year old with a kid!","review":"This is NOT an intelligent movie! This review's title just about sums up the level of dialog. The song \\"Lets' Duet\\" is the level of the jokes and the music. This is either good or bad depending on what you want. If you are looking for a turn off your mind, semi dirty joke this is a fun filled movie with a lot of laughs. If you don't like that type of entertainment, why are you even reading the reviews? My wife and I had a good time with the extended movie version. The acting is good enough to carry the movie. The story is a good spoof of every rock n roll biopic ever made. The songs carry the movie and are good enough to be believable. The extended version is good smutty fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, bad case","review":"The movie is great, and it looks especially good on blu-ray. The only problem was the case was broken, the top left corner was cracked which keeps it from closing. I want to say that it must be a shipping problem, but I looked inside the box and I could not find the broken piece of the case which means that it must have been broken before it was put in the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FUNNY","review":"This movie is not funny or entertaining.

This movie makes you want to cut someone in half and write a song about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Daddy-O","review":"Blu-Ray quality is great. What I don't understand is why \\"The Dewey Cox Show\\" is not touring the world playing the great songs on this disk. John C. could be a rocker if he wanted, he is better than a lot of the crappy musicians out there. If Bruce Spring-whatever is \\"The Boss\\", J.C.R. is the CEO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Funny","review":"When this movie started playing, I groaned to myself. I didn't think I would be able to watch it. I don't tend to go for stupid comedy, but it soon won me over. If you liked Walk the Line (the Johnny Cash story featuring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon which was excellent), this will have you howling with laughter. It takes that basic story line and completely obliterates it with lunacy. It's so stupid that you just have to laugh. It starts to lag when Dewey meets the Beatles. That part wasn't in Walk the Line and I didn't think it added to the story. When it wraps, you feel good both from having laughed so hard and also because the ending is sweet. Reilly is excellent as is the rest of the cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really funny!","review":"This movie's a classic! It's funny, but not in the current definition of \\"funny\\" these days. It's funny like the old Leslie Neilsen / Airplane / Naked Gun movies were. With jokes that are truly humorous without relying on stupid gross-out humour like most movies these days. I rented it because I was in the mood for something ridiculous, and what I got was much more than I expected! Not only is it good for a laugh, but John C. Reilly can really sing! And kudos to the costume designer! The movie spans 60 years, and they nailed the period clothing to a \\"t\\".Very funny, ridiculously smart, well acted, and worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time...","review":"This movie has made it onto my All Time Worst Movies list. Please do not rent this movie much less buy it. The beginning childhood flashback opener isn't even remotely funny. In fact the rest of the movie isn't either. Still, I like many others somehow fell prey to the lure of a funny movie. I had the pleasure of seeing Walk the Line which is a really great movie. This movie follows the same story line but in the worst way ever, the jokes are flat, the innuendos are lame and who wants to see flaccid male penis right in your living room??? I just hope I can save someone from making a horrible mistake by watching this movie.

'Walk Hard' is just another \\"churn out\\" comedy with an idea no bigger that an SNL skit trying to stretch in out into a full length movie! I must admit I did laugh quite a few times in this crude and silly film, but it grows old way before the credits role. A good cast of funny people can only do so much with a non existent script!

Bah! What is even more amusing and tragic is that Klausner, perhaps chagrined by criticism of her review by the estimable James Windle 'jimbo', totally changed her review in a desperate attempt to garner more votes. Hahaha. Go away Harriet, you parasite! Your infinite mediocrity will be dealth with accordingly.As for the book, it is readable and at times amusing, but it is certainly no Maeske: Thaery, Trullion: Alastor, nor Showboat World - less known than some other Vance novels perhaps, but truly brilliant works nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Vance's best, but that's still pretty good","review":"This two-part series suffers from an episodic plot that's only moderately entertaining.

It was announced a long time ago, and at one point there was another author's name attached to the sequel. Now that it has finally come out, it is obvious that some hack took Vance's scant notes or outline and filled it in as best he could. Many of the characters of Ports of Call are summarily dealt with in a manner very unlike any other Vance series. Ports of Call hinted at certain things happening to the three girls in Moncrief's show and that the crew would have to do something rash to save them from a \\"fate worse that death\\".

You can't really get realer than this. The intro starts out with an excert from the movie with Elias Koteas speaking then Rodan comes in spitting light speed saying that he's the angel of death and you are at the end.

You would definitely assume such as the picture also shows the ring as round but when I received the ring it was smashed down into an oval as tightly as it could be. In this shape the dimension was close to 17 inches in the long direction but in this shape you would be lucky to fit a finch in the ring. Once you pull this out into a round ring like in the picture the dimensions are 13.5 external diameter and 11 internal diameter. This is a good 3 to 4 inch difference than what is advertised and makes a big difference when you have large birds like Macaws. I am not happy with the misleading product description!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My macaw loves this swing","review":"My scarlet macaw (big scarlet) loves this swing. I got one for him years ago, and he finally had it totally destroyed to the point where I pulled it out of his cage. I had looked every where to get him a new one, but had problems finding it. Then a surprise, I found it here on Amazon. My guy does have fun spinning his swing around, and he does get the bolt unscrewed that is holding it onto the quick link causing it drop. A piece of wire at the top around the plastic joining piece to prevent 360 deg spinning will solve the problem. Yes, it comes oval shaped but it's easily changed to round, which is what my guy prefers. The size when rounded must be adequate for him (he's large for a scarlet) because it's his favorite place to hang out and to sleep. He has a super size standard swing I gave him when I wasn't able to find this one, and he won't even sit in it (but he does smash it on the side of his cage when he wants attention or wants out)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small (?) bird swing","review":"Though this product is well made and attractive, it is definitely not small.

The parts - the filter basket, the filter basket holder and the lid of the carafe - are easily cleaned in the top rack of the dishwasher, and the carafe goes in the bottom of the dishwasher. No problem. It's true the interior is hard to clean by hand, so you just have to do the same as you would with any coffee maker by running a cleaner or vinegar & water through a brew cycle. (We don't have the directions for this one so that's what we do. It works fine.) It makes great tea and is easy to use. Also, we like it because it's not so large.

It makes very good tea. My only complaint is a part that was missing from the brew basket. The part was the spring that allows you to remove the pitcher during the brew process.

The pitcher doesn't fit snugly into the well, and when youremove it, instead of turning off the flow of tea (as advertised), it makes it flow heavier (which ends up in a mess). When I tried to clean it I found that a difficult task because the filter cup has ridges from edge to center, every inch all the way around. The reservoir got tea in it, and it's so narrow, you can't get in there with a sponge to clean it. When I tried to rise it out, tea flowed out from somewhere, and went all over the place (if I hadn't tipped it, the tea would have dried inside and ended up moldy). Don't waste your money like I did. Boil water, that's all this does. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or your time","review":"I bought this iced tea maker because a friend had a similar model from a different manufacturer. Thinking they were all similar I bought this one. I was wrong.This machine uses a spring-mounted lever that activates the flow of brewed tea into the pitcher, once the pitcher is placed in it's proper place. No matter how I placed the pitcher (even exactly as the manual instructs), the spring-mounted lever would open the valve only halfway (or not at all), leading the pot to fill with hot tea that spilled out of the top and flooded my kitchen. After two months of this, I threw it out.This product's design is simply flawed. I think the idea of iced tea makers is great, but this execution of it, with the spring-mounted lever valve, simply does not work. Look into another brand if you are thinking of purchasing an iced tea maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pros and Cons of this Purchase","review":"It is small and compact I like the design and features that's why I purchased it as a gift. It is a little smaller than I prefer actually and the overflow problem was very messy I was going to send it back or throw it agains a wall then the spring popped out.

I'm so damn frustrated with this program, and its poor instructions, that it drove me to write this review, which I have never done before.

Once you figure out how to make that thing bigger, you're exhausted from trying to learn the rest of it.

I am a Photoshop, powerpoint, excel user and am comfortable with toolbars and functions. This program will not group and move an object. Each line drawn must be adjusted individually. I gave up after 2 hours of trying to draw an odd shaped house angled on an odd shaped lot. For straight lots it will probably work fine. Also, the arial views were extremely difficult to control.

I am a landscaper and this software is useless for the do-it-your-self or for any serious designer. The plant selection is extremely limited despite the claim of the large number of plants.

I wanted to start with the basics, and recreate a survey I had done of my property. Even using the landscaping tool for this simple task was difficult. When you drag the line beyond the window, it does not automatically scroll down, so you have to page down, and extend the line.

But the ad description says for NT4, however, I was unable to make it run on three different machines in NT4 and two other machines in Win 2000.

There is nothing like waking up to a freshly ground/freshly brewed cup of coffee. The settings are a little complicated, requiring me to keep the manual handy. Also, the different settings for grind don't seem to make much difference, with No. 1 setting still too fine for my taste. However, these two things not withstanding, it is a great machine. And ya can't beat the price either.....most other brands like this are like double this price. I have never been more satisfied with a product than I am with this one. By the way, I get my coffee beans from a coffee exchange store some 2,000 miles from me.....you don't think I'm not a serious coffee nut???"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Compromise","review":"I've had this coffee maker for a year now and the verdict is mixed. It's convenient not to have to grind the beans before putting it in the coffee maker. On the other hand, I find that the coffee that comes out is not hot enough, and therefore the coffee aromas and tastes are not released properly. The coffee tastes old even when it's freshly made. My old Krups coffee maker made a better cup of hot and tasty coffee. This Melitta's design allows too much coffee sediment to go into the pot. My wife bought this maker and I'm hoping she'll ditch it and go back to the old fashioned drip maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"5stars at first site then 1star after 3months","review":"I bought this product because I love freshly ground coffee. It was a great coffee maker for the 1st 3months then the plastic latch that closes the grinder fell off and you could not operate unless the top was closed completely. You are unable to purchase the grinder so I'm left using a grinder and using another coffee maker. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this one","review":"I purchased this after weighing the pros and cons from other reviews and have used it for 4 months. It is easy to clean and set up. That's where the pros end for me.-Coffee is barely hot enough unless you are making a full pot.-Since the grind takes place in the brew basket, you can only use the metal mesh filter that it comes with, this leaves muddy coffee that a paper filter won't (my preferred filter).-The flavor of the coffee is weak unless you use a lot of beans- I think this is because the brew temp is not hot enough. A free Gevalia coffee maker I have made by melita makes much stronger, fuller flavored, rich coffee!- If you like milder coffee and make full pots, this one is great for the price, quality built, otherwise avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instant Coffee Maker","review":"This is my second MEMB1B, the first died after a little over a year. The grinder blades froze and Melitta did not offer any replacement parts. I did purchase a second one because I found it on Amazon at a good price. Well, four months later it did it again. No answer to my emails to Melitta and forget the toll-free number, you are on hold forever. I don't feel like having to pack the entire unit up to just get a new brew basket assembly. They don't say to hand wash the assembly in the owners manual, but I think that might be the issue. I have always washed this part in the dishwasher. I will say it does make good coffee, but I don't want a machine that will last less than a 3 pound bag of coffee beans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine was cursed.","review":"I bought this coffeemaker because of all the favorable reviews on Amazon.com. I really wanted to love this coffeemaker, but I didn't like it at all. The filter basket is messy and hard to clean. The grinder settings (coarse to fine) didn't seem to have any impact on the flavor of the coffee. I like medium roast coffee, but this coffeemaker produced weak, nasty-tasting coffee regardless of the amount of coffee I used or the setting of the grinder. I made 3 attempts to use the timer, and it worked once. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I was so excited to purchase this product, as I love fresh ground coffee and usually brew it at the same time each morning. The problem? The lowest setting for the grinder time still grinds the coffee for 15 seconds. This makes the coffee grounds way too fine and creates a distinctly bitter flavor. I only want to grind for about 8 seconds. Also some of the fine grinds pass through the gold filter and leave residue in your cup. I will be returning this product. Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and Perfect","review":"I bought this coffee pot after reading reviews of it on multiple sites. I wanted a fair priced coffee pot to replace my grinder and coffee pot I had now. This all in one is great. Easy to clean, brews a nice fresh pot. My only issue is the plate stays hot for only one hour but we are managing fine around that issue. Other than that I cannot complain, just put water and beans in and press the on button, it cannot get easier than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melitta Mill & Brew is perfect","review":"I have owned the Melitta Mill & Brew for a few months and have never had a disappointing cup of coffee. The design is small enough for limited counter space. Cleaning the removeable filter container was a breeze. Your coffee beans can be set to grind extra fine to corse, whichever you prefer. Easy to add water in the side chamber with visible cup measurement in front. The non-drip feature means non-drip. The included scoop for coffee measuring is acurate for a good cup of coffee. Melitta has always had a good reputation. Excellent price for a terrific product.We previously owned a Krups Brew and had one nightmare after another. The machine would start grinding on its own. Unplugging was the only way to turn it off. The front panel leaked water. The worst was you would measure a cup of water and it never failed to brew only a half a cup. The beans would jam the grinder system which was not easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"convenient and easy","review":"Our first coffee maker was a Krups that lasted 14 years. Naturally, we replaced it with another Krups but were disappointed with the quality upon opening it and seeing how thinly made the glass carafe was. Sure enough, the carafe broke from a light tap and we hadn't even had it for two years! Disgusted with the longevity and knowing the replacement carafe would be just as flimsy, we bought this Melitta. Perhaps we've had it about a year now. We are so pleased with this product. We chose this after reading that the Cuisinart was loud and difficult to clean. This coffee maker is easy to clean and the glass carafe is sturdy. We regularly use the timer and grinder and like this coffee maker very much. We'd gladly recommend this as we get tired of grinding coffee separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great!!","review":"My wife Linda has always made the best coffe I've ever had. With this Melitta MEMB1B she now make the BEST COFFEE IN THE WORLD!! (It's the little things that the spells love!)This coffee maker is just wonderful! It has a built in grinder for whole coffee beans. And the filter is permanant! So you don't have to buy filters or a seperate grinder. It's small and does not take up a lot of counter space. It also has multi settings for your \\"personal\\" blend. I highly reccomend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Fine Coffee Here","review":"After my twenty dollar fifteen year old Mr.Coffee bit the dust, the wife and I decided that we should look around and put a little money into a stepped-up machine. I was convinced that there should be a way to get the $/cup coffeehouse taste at home. I did the research and landed on Melitta.I love this pot. I've been using it for about a month. Morning coffee has become more of a treat rather than a bitter dose of caffeine. I enjoy an afternoon pot on the weekend. The aroma is wonderful. Using filtered water, I haven't made a bad pot yet.One thing to point out-the grind feature is easily over-ridden and you can use your plain old grocery store \\"ground in the can\\" brand. It tastes a lot like premium with this gem.The thing was simple and instinctive to use right out of the box. I enjoy not using paper filters. Simply put, Melitta Mill and Brew is a professional quality pot and can make a coffee house style cup of coffee for pennies rather than dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Coffeemaker","review":"I got this coffeemaker for my husband for his office. It is absolutely WONDERFUL. He is in the military & gets to work at 5 am. I searched for a coffeemaker that would have the coffee ready when he got to work.

This machine is absolutely amazing. (All of my comments are based on a comparison to the original Cuisinart Grind & Brew.) The grinder (not really a mill) is much much quieter than the Cuisinart. It no longer sounds like an F16 taking off in my kitchen! You can't even hear it two rooms away. There are fewer parts to clean each time (5 compared to 7). Not one molecule of the grounds escape the grinding chamber (the Cuisinart sprayed them all over my counter.)My only gripes? Instead of a paper filter you are forced to use the permanent one, thus it is slightly more of a pain to clean - but I get to save some dough on filters. The coffee isn't very strong. I end up using one scoop to every four cups of water instead of one scoop to every six."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee, but...","review":"We had two of these units, and both made great coffee, but...The latch does break, and you end up holding it down with a weight in order to make coffee. Also, the temperature tends to be be toward the warm side, as opposed to hot.These problems should be easy to fix, and obviously they are very common, as seen from other reviews.As a result, I am now looking for a non Melitta coffeemaker with great coffee and fewer problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best available","review":"I have not heard good things about the Cuisinart, but this one is much cheaper, and I love it so far. The only downside is that it's not recommended to make less than 4 cups, and I'm the only coffee drinker in the house. I fixed this by just drinking more coffee on a regular basis..... :)Sure the clean up isn't the easiest, but there aren't any other clean ups for grind and brew machines that are easy. I just rinse out all the grounds and leave it in the sink overnight to dry.I love being able to choose the fineness of the grounds, the window that shows the water level, and the option to just mill, without grinding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in durability","review":"A good design that is let down by poor materials and workmanship.After about 13 month's of use, the latch that secures the lid on the brewing basket broke.

Unfortunately, I wound up disappointed. This coffee maker made bad coffee. It was weak even when I increased the amount of coffee. The grinder was not consistent even when kept on the same setting. The coffee was not very warm and the automatic shut-off activates after an hour which is too short. The few times it did brew a good cup I could not replicate even with the same beans and ratio.After about 3 months, I gave up and bought a cuisinart coffee maker. So far it has performed terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mesh filter makes a weak cup of coffee","review":"I bought one of these because I thought it would make it easier to brew fresh ground coffee. The beans are ground in a chamber with screen walls and then the coffee is brewed by dripping water right through the grinding chamber. This works surprisingly well and is easy to clean since you can remove the grinding chamber and rinse it out in the sink.The problem I had is that the the bottom and sides of the brewing chamber are all mesh so water ran through the beans to quickly making a weak cup of coffee. Adding more coffee produced stronger coffee but it wasn't as full-flavored as a cup brewed through a paper filter in a standard coffee maker.I ended ditching this product and going back to a standard coffee maker and a stand alone grinder. If you like the complex flavors of a strong cup of coffee you'll probably end up doing the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This was a disappointment. I purchased it based on the brand name, but it is not a high-quality machine. Within a few months it had stopped working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted!","review":"I use this everyday and it is great. It makes excellent coffee. The timer and controls are fairly easy to figure out. For people talking about leaks; there is an overflow hole in the back of the water chamber. And moving the coffee maker while there is water in it will cause it to spill out. Assuming you don't overfill the water chamber or try to move it, you won't have any issues. The permanent filter is real good, and not too hard to clean, and the outer housing for the coffee filter/grinder comes off for easy cleaning.Side Note: The new Cuisinart's don't have the same problems as the older ones, but it is hard to tell which are old stock and which are brand new from the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great Product","review":"We put in the beans, set the timer for the morning, and get the freshest, best cup of coffee ever! It is easy to set up and easy to clean. Plus, its' sleak appearance and not-too-big size fits right into our kitchen decor. No big time displays - just a great cup of coffee every time. Can't recommend this highly enough!

My father and brother-in-law liked it so much, they also purchased one. Both of them broke the filter latch within a couple of months. Ours didn't break till a week ago when overnight guests made the coffee. HERE'S HOW TO PREVENT THE LATCH FROM BREAKING: IF THE LID DOESN'T CLOSE EASILY, DON'T FORCE IT! If it doesn't close easily, be sure that the filter basket dropped all the way in (jiggle to line it up if needed) or, check that a stray coffee bean isn't between the filter basket lid and the hinged lid.

I have made 12 mugs of coffee with it over the past 4 days, and even though I used DOUBLE the amount of beans I normally use, the coffee comes out very weak every time. I tried various grind settings, but they made no difference.Other things I hate about this unit:- You have to clean it after EVERY pot of coffee because it has a permanent filter (thus you can't just pull the filter/grounds out). I make 1 mug of coffee 3 times a day, so I have to clean it 3 times a day!- The permanent filter allows some of the grinds to end up in your coffee, which is unpleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS - You Can't Get Parts if it Breaks","review":"We have had the Melitta Mill and Brew (MEMB1W) for just under 2 years. We liked it better than the old Cuisinart Grind and Brew coffee makers we had that would only last a year and die. We thought we had hit the mark with the Melitta. It appeared to be well made. Well the other day the Assembly Lock on the lid broke. I called Salton-Maxim to get the part and they said it is not available. The part is also not available to repair shops. THUS THE UNIT CANNOT BE REPAIRED! The only option was to send it to them and pay \\"more money\\" for a replacement coffee maker. After you add it all up, you could just about buy a new one for less. So my advise, if you can't get replacement parts, don't buy the coffee maker.

Again, horrible watery coffee. Third time used 2 scoops for 1 cup of coffee. Again weak watery coffee. Just out of curiosiosity at this point, I used 4 scoops of beans for 1 cup. This time finally it started to look like coffee although it was still on the weak side. And if you are thinking this reviewer must prefer espresso, NOT really. This coffeemaker is ridiculous. What one is saving on the price of the machine, one would spend very easily on coffee beans. I think the problem is that the blades throw the ground coffee to the sides instead of the bottom of the cone, therefore when the water drips down there is not much coffee there.

With the Cuisinart, I could brew a pot with the grinder and then take out the filter with the grounds and make a second pot using pre-ground coffee without having to wash the whole unit. After 3 months of this we recently purchased a new Cuisinart.

I am completely dumbfounded by this unit. I based my purchase on the other recommendations, but now I am wondering whether these people actually know what a good pot of coffee tastes like. I brewed to the exact specifications in the manual and then went hunting on the internet for optimal brewing methods with an automatic drip and nothing produced even close to a decent cup of coffee. Calls to Melitta and the parent company Salton where fruitless, so back to ...(the store) this product went. For those of you who drink coffee at work, this machine makes coffee less desirable than the last cup which has been sitting on the burner for several hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melitta coffee mill and maker","review":"The product is a good one. I'm very satisfied with the coffee maker but more than that I am very happy with the service I received from Amazon in ordering the product.The transaction was fast, smooth and very satisfactory! I'll be back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"melitta mill & brew coffee maker","review":"Very nice & easy to use ,cleans up very easy. Glad I purchased this model.Had no problem at all getting started with this machine. Makes great tasting coffee. Thankyou Melitta."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best grind and brew","review":"I like this coffee makers so much that I bought a second one. It is simple to use, easy to clean and makes good coffee. The drawback is that the small piece of plastic that attaches the lid over the filter basket breaks off (my sisters have the same coffeemaker and the same piece broke off on theirs). I solved the problem by using a piece of tape to hold the lid closed. It worked just fine for three years or more, but I decided to treat myself to a new one for Christmas. I recommend this coffeemaker but I wish Melitta would re-engineer that lid latch, if they are going to continue making this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Second Mill and Brew","review":"We have recently purchased our second Melitta Mill and Brew. As we did before purchasing our first one we looked carefully again at the competing brands that were closest in price, all of which however cost more, the highest being $100. more. These all had many small pieces and moving parts and were difficult to clean -- Not so the Melitta. Both the ease of use and the ease of cleaning are outstanding and the coffee that is brewed, either from ground or from beans, is uniformly excellent. This would easily rate 5 stars but there is one minor \\"flaw\\" that might be important to some users. Immediately upon completion of brewing with the carafe filled with fresh coffee, the brew is not piping hot. It should stand in the carafe for about five minutes and, after that short wait, be removed for an outstanding drink - whether one cup or filled to the max."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee but....","review":"I've been using the Melitta MEB1B Mill& Brew 10-cup coffeemaker for a couple months. I have just a few comments....It does everything as advertised.It makes great tasting coffee and is farily easy to cleanI hate the one hour auto shut-off. I thought I'd be able to live with the one hour timer, but I guess I was wrong. I would like to see the auto shut-off time programable.A 12-cup instead of a 10-cup coffeemaker would be nice.The footprint is fairly large, but livable.Other than the auto shut-off timer I'm very satisfied with the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy...real problems","review":"I bought this coffee maker a year ago, and I'm getting replacing it today. I was disappointed from the beginning because the coffee it makes is NOT HOT ENOUGH. The top to the basket broke within a few months, and we have had to wedge it closed ever since to make it run. It's unattractive on the counter--lots of shiny plastic, and a shape that's the opposite of streamlined. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MACHINE AT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not produce quality coffee","review":"The idea of this machine is great, but unfortunately the results are less than spectacular. On the highest grind setting, it produces a watery, muddy cup of coffee, not at all what you would expect. The heating element burns the coffee easily if you leave it on for more than a couple of minutes after you brew.I have experimented and experimented with this machine and can not get a good cup of coffee out of it. My $9.99 machine from Target produced a better quality coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces wear out","review":"I received this coffee maker as a gift 2 years ago. After a year and a couple of months' daily use, the gear at the bottom of the grinding basket wore out and we could no longer use the \\"grind\\" feature of the grind-and-brew, which was the main reason we wanted it to begin with... Soon after, the latch which holds the ginder lid in place broke off, and unfortunately, the coffee maker won't work unless it senses that this lid is closed. So we had to resort to weighing the lid down with various objects... and finally we gave up all together. I loved the convenience and ease of grind-and-brew while it lasted, but it didn't last long enough for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee but too easy to break","review":"I was given this coffee maker for a birthday gift a couple of years ago and after I figured out how to make it work, loved it. After a while the latch on the top broke off and I had to hold the top down while it was grinding the coffee. That made the timer on it useless unless you propped something against it to hold the top down. It was a little inconvenient but I got use to it. Then the metal filter broke and I decided to get a new one. Luckily I put the old one in the garage for \\"spare parts\\" because not long after I started using the new one the side tab broke off and I had to grab a replacement off the old one. I will probably not purchase this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME AND BEST COFFEE MAKER ON THE MARKET FOR HOME USE","review":"I bought my first Mill and Brew a few years ago and the latch just recently broke. We used tape for a few months and I wanted a new one. I searched and saw info from another review in here from a guy named Sam who you can get replacement parts. I did call and found him to not be too honest. He charges almost as much for a part as it cost for a new maker. Then he calls back trying to lower the price and continues to try to get you to buy the item needed to fix the latch from him.I decided the best way to go was to buy a new Mill and Brew from Amazon. I am not unhappy about this decision. I love this maker. We have it programmed daily at the same time. The coffee is wonderful, hot, and ready every morning before work. I wash the basket in the dishwasher once a week . I hope they continue making this coffee maker because it is the best for my family. I will continue to buy this maker as long as it is on the market !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melitta Mill and Brew","review":"This coffee maker makes delicious coffee, grinds the beans immediately before brewing and is easy to clean, but the heating element only remains on for 1 hour. My husband leaves for work very early in the morning and by the time I get up at 6:45 the machine has already turned off. I have been using Cuisinart Grind & Brew machines for many years and they make wonderful coffee, but they are not fun to clean, they cost twice as much as the Melitta and they break down frequently. However, they have the option to incerase warming time for 1-4 hours after brewing. If Melitta could increase the warming time it would be perfect!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"This coffee maker broke and is NOT easy to use. I DO NOT recommend it. We've had it a year and will be tossing it in the trash as soon as we get another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get It","review":"We've had this coffee maker for about 9 months and are already looking to replace it. We make the coffee at night and take advantage of the timer so it can be ready in the morning when we awake. Well, if you decide to use ground coffee and forget to press the mill button, the coffee is terribe. Worse yet, if you forget to put the pot in the machine it will brew anyway and the hot water falls all over. I can't tell you the number of times we have forgotten to put the pot in and have awakened to water all over the counter! Also, there is a little latch that broke almost immediatley after we got the machine and now the only way we can brew coffee is to put a heavy book on top of the machine so it will stay closed.My advice: if you want freshly groung coffee, grind it yourself and use a conventional coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lasting","review":"I bought this machine in 2001. It has lasted 6 years. I've not had to replace any parts. A couple of days ago the latch on the grinder lid broke off but it still works if I hold it down. Easy to use. Sometimes when pouring, coffee spills down the side of the carafe and makes a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"great coffee maker","review":"this coffee maker works well and brews a fine cup of coffeethe only drawback is the cleanup. the filter/grinder combo never gets completely clean but it has not messed with the flavor of the coffeeI recommend it especially when you are short on time since it has a timer so you can set it up the night before and its ready when you are in the morning"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Pot","review":"We have tried another similar coffee pot and like this one better. It is more compact, takes up less counter space and has fewer parts. It makes great coffee and cleans up easily. It is noisy but a grinder does make noise. Our only complaint which has been stated by others is the piece that will easily break if you force the lid down to the grinder basket. We are careful about this now but unfortunately company may not be, as recently happened to us. But it will still work if you hold the lid down. At least ours does. This is the fifth one I have purchased in about 10 years but 2 have been for use on our boat. The price is good too. Size is important to us, so I would purchase another if I had to replace one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grinding and brewing","review":"I have to say, this is my first review! I have had the Melitta Grind and Brew Coffeemaker for several months now. For the money the machine grinds and brews coffee well. A problem has come up, though, in the last few days. The grinding basket that houses the blades has developed a tear in the wire meshing that allows the water to percolate through the ground coffee! I suspect a replacement will not come cheaply! I haven't looked into it yet. Maybe I handled the basket too roughly when I wash it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coffee Maker I've Had","review":"I bought the Cuisinart Grind and Brew on the recommendation of department store sales staff. Within a week, I knew this coffeemaker was not giving me the cup of coffee I yearned for, so I returned it. I went to Amazon to read the coffeemaker reviews and was convinced that the Melitta Mill & Brew had what I wanted. When I made that first cup of coffee, my husband and I were amazed at the full-bodied flavor. No other coffeemaker we've had compared to the Melitta. Reviewers have talked about the problems with the lid and I am just very careful about lifting and setting it down. I feel that the Melitta gives you the coffee shop full-flavor cup of coffee. We liked it so well, we bought one for our son and daughter-in-law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy mornings","review":"Lovely product... came well packed... grinds the coffee beans to perfection and fast.

Very easy to use. You can set the grind...I like the #2 setting. Cleanup is very easy. No disposable filters to buy. The coffee is so good that I have to make 2 pots each morning.Unfortunately, I have to go buy another Mill-N-Brew today. A little plastic tab on the cover of the bean compartment broke off and the cover will not latch.

The users that write great reviews just have not used them long enough!They seem to last about a year before the contact switch on the brewer cap breaks and it requiries weight to keep it down as the snap breaks and can no longer keep it closed.I just broke a very nice antique sugar bowl, by it sliding off the top of the coffee maker!I am positive most companies know about this problem and are ducking the issue. Hopefully Target or someone will stand up and at least provide new ones for our money!I am planning on buying another one and then return my old onein the new box for a refund.I am sorry but I for one cannot deal with the fact that it is so aggegious and predatory that I am not going to spend my time fighting the over a $75.00 purchase of which I am sure I do not have the receipt any longer!! I am not going to play their warranty games either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee maker but breaks easily","review":"We've had great coffee from this coffee maker. Its probably the best we've ever bought, but it has shortcomings! The grinder latch broke after a few months and you can't get replacement parts so you can forget about having fresh coffee ready when you wake up! It will still work, but you physically have to hold down the griner top until it starts to brew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a piece of junk","review":"Within one month the warming pad had rusted. Then the plastic piece that secures the lid broke. The mill is so loud it would wake the dead. During the last minute of brewing, it makes a rumble like a volcano. Enough?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melitta Coffeemaker MEMB1B","review":"This coffeemaker beats cuisanart coffeemaker hands down. Very few parts to clean and quick to make coffee. One problem I don'tunderstand is why the manufacturer doesn't fix the top that closes the grinder. I've seen so many reviews about this problem,otherwise it's a great coffeemaker.

I have been using this product for about 10 months now and am very pleased. It is easy to clean and easy to use and makes a good cup of coffee. What more do you need? They almost got it perfect but here are two things that need more work. 1. The lid to the coffee basket is sometimes difficult to close. You have to be careful here otherwise something might break on the latch. 2.The base of the basket looks slightly flimsy and I am a little concerned about the longevity of the part.I can certainly recommend this product. I am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegance in Simplicity","review":"Better than Cuisinart, Team S and Mr. Coffee.

I shopped for a reasonably priced machine for 6 months and finally settled on the Melitta. I LOVE IT! Great, hot coffee made every morning. I've owned it for a year and never had a problem. Getting the basket into place after washing it can be a little tricky-you have to wiggle it a bit. But well worth it for fresh ground coffee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three years and still working fine","review":"I bought this three years ago and still use it up to twice a day. The caraffe retains heat very well--it's not uncommon to find coffee still hot after 6 hours (the handle slightly separated after about two years, but it hasn't broken). The lid that holds the grinder broke after the first year, so we had to improvise with a rubbermaid container to hold it down. Otherwise, I've been very happy with the product and its ability to brew and grind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Good to Be True","review":"The technology behind this product is promising, but it has a long way to go: seven attempts at brewing -- judiciously controlling for variables like beans and grind -- resulted in profoundly weak coffee. It didn't seem to matter how much we increased the beans or reduced the water. One reviewer correctly noted a related shortcoming: if you want to make the full ten cup pot, the coffee strength is significantly limited by the maximum number of beans the mill will hold. Beyond that, the coffee never seemed to be hot enough. The machine cycles on and off once the machine is done brewing, which seems to be a safety feature tied to the fact that the pot will automatically turn off after you leave it unattended for a while. So the bottom line: the machine is sleek, the coffee tepid and weak. Keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grind & Brew Coffee Maker","review":"If you want your coffee beans grinded & then perked, this is the best i have found.

Same problem as everyone else has mentioned here in the reviews. What's nice about this coffee maker is the easy grind and brew. It's also quite easy to clean. Needless to say, we've just got to have hot coffee on these cold winter days in Colorado, so we're looking for a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee maker, when it's not broken. Cheap plastic.","review":"I read all the reviews on this machine and felt comfortable with buying it. I was so excited with my first mill and brew machine. It did make good coffee when it wasn't broken. There is just too many plastic parts that easilly break. I had to have part replaced on it and with this last part, I have to send it in. So, I'll be without a coffeemaker for who knows how long. My husband said oh just forget it. I'm sending it in cuz they are paying for the shipping but I'll probably sell it in my garage sale and buy a better unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold up over time","review":"LOVED this coffee pot, and the quality of the coffee it brewed, until it developed a small crack in the mesh on the filter/grinder, and no one from Melitta found it important enough to answer my inquiry about buying a new part.

Anyway, it didn't last me two years..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very quite","review":"Nice and quite. Easy to use. The only drawback is the coffee doesn't stay as warm as we'd like.

Which is fine. I have been waiting for it to go kaput so I can buy a new one. This one is a gift and I would have never bought this for myself had I the choice. I didn't like it when i looked at it. It seems cheaply made of black plastic. The big gripe i have is that I am constantly reheating my coffee and prior to pouring a cup, I heat up my milk. This has been my OVER year long ritual. But not anymore...i've researched and I'm off to cuisinart.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed!","review":"I was a bit skeptical when purchasing this coffee pot. How could a grind and brew pot be so affordably priced? I just dumped the Cuisinart Grind and Brew, due to consistent malfunctions from the time it was purchased. This Militta pot is hands down, a much better coffee maker: 1)Almost $50 cheaper than the Cuisinart, 2)Quiet, quiet, quiet...the grinding no longer wakes my son up at 6am when the coffee pot turns on! 3) By far 100% easer to clean and maintain than the Cuisinart coffee maker. The other pot was the biggest pain in the rear to clean and coffee residue was always scattered within the water container/filter area due to the grinding. The Militta has one compartment that grinds the coffee and the compartment is completely separate from the water and filter. The compartment is also removeable to pop in the dishwasher.The best part..........this pot makes a better tasting cup of coffee! I'm very pleased with my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee maker for a great price!","review":"This coffee maker is absolutely amazing! I couldn't be more pleased. It's easy to use and brews wonderful, robust coffee.My friend owns a Cuisinart that was MUCH more expensive and she constantly complains about what a pain it is to take it apart and clean it after use. This unit only has the pot and the coffee filter to clean - both of which are easy to remove.The grind cycle makes the amount of noise I would expect is necessary, but it is fairly quick.What a gem! I highly recommend this unit for those who love the taste of freshly ground coffee, but don't want to leave their home to get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one you're looking for-","review":"if you REALLY want the grinder built in. This coffeemaker works very well, and it's very simple to use. Cleaning is the only problem, but all of these combo units are like that.

This is a really good price..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice machine, difficult to clean","review":"I don't drink coffee, but my husband does. He says it makes nice fresh coffee. We use whole beans and grind them in the mill. I read the other reviews before purchasing, so I was aware of the delicate nature of the lid and the screen. We've also tried the programmable feature, and that was nice that I didn't have to get up to make coffee at 4 in the morning!My issue is with cleaning the screen. I don't want to scrub too hard for fear of tearing the screen, but I can't get it clean. Maybe there will always be residue, but even after doing vinegar cleanings, the residue remains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why now!?!","review":"The best coffee maker I ever had broke after two and a half years.Now they don't make them anymore?

Unfortunately, my filter basket screen started to separate from the plastic allowing grounds to flow into the coffee. Melitta has not only discontinued this item (model MEMB1), but it has made parts unavailable. However, I bought their new model, ME1MSB, which is similar to the old, but with more complex electronics and a weather radio. Lo and behold, the filter basket in the new model is EXACTLY THE SAME as it was in the old model! As for the new model, electronics are too complex, weather radio not only doesn't work, it connects to MSNDirect which is stopping service in 2012. As for the new model's coffee brewing design, it's still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Wish They Still Made This Coffee Maker!","review":"I purchased this item for a Christmas gift for 2006. Aside from being a little loud when it grinds up the coffee beans, this coffeemaker ALWAYS produced excellent cups of coffee! If you liked a REALLY dark coffee you could put already ground coffee in it and use as much water & coffee to suit your tastes! Used it a few times (without coffee in it) to make hot chocolate (by putting the hot chocolate powder in the bottom of the carafe and running a cycle. Quite useful coffeemaker, much loved in the house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So handy! Yummy coffee","review":"I've had my Mill and Brew coffee maker (in the unavailable white) for at least 5 years now and am extremely satisfied with it. I work for a major coffee company and it makes the coffee almost as good as a coffee press. So far, it has held up to every day use for this many years. The ONLY gripe about it is that the graduations available on the carafe are different from the ones on the water tank. If that is my only problem, it can't be all bad!!I just say buy it. Easy to use. Makes a better cup o' joe!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wise investment","review":"We had one of those Cuisinart grind and brews and did not like it, too much cleaning and then the motor started going and the swing basket started gluing itself shut, what a mess! So we read tons of review on this one and they were right, what a dream in comparison! Easy to clean, easy to use! I'm not sure why people had trouble with the basket side lid breaking I haven't had one bit of trouble with mine as has been described. Only thing I don't give it a five is because I used to brew to the 6 line for 2 people to have morning coffee (with refill) now I have to brew to 8 and it's only a 10 cup maker- the cups are smaller than standard. But that aside, the coffee tastes great and the timer is wonderful. There is a funny taste even after washing and running the cleaning cycle through initially but it does go away and is well worth the wait, makes great tasting coffee. We highly recommend it, best bang for the buck!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about getting parts","review":"I have now been waiting for three months for a replacement carafe and lid which broke when I took the item out of the box. Parts come from China and customer service is clueless about when they will arrive. Unbelievable waste of my money since I haven't been able to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Coffee...Bad Parts","review":"I had friends who had this machine and the latch on the grinder lid broke about a year after they had it. Figuring it was just dumb luck, they replaced the whole machine, because...did I fail to mention, it won't make coffee when that latch breaks and they had a heck of a time trying to get replacement parts? Other than that broken part they loved the coffee and sang the praises of the mill and brew machine. So, I decided to buy one for my sister as a housewarming present. 5 months later...her latch broke! A month after that the latch on my friends' second maker broke too! I appreciate that it's a fairly inexpensive machine and makes good coffee, but if you have to deal with broken parts all the time, it kind of loses it's charm. Luckily, I never bought one for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, economical, easy coffee machine!","review":"I was looking for a solid programmable coffee brewer. I saw many on Amazon, but this one caught my eye because of the price, the design, and that it was both a grinder and a brewer. I usually have my beans grinded in the store, but I know that the coffee would taste fresher if I were able to grid the beans and brew right after. This machine is amazing. It is very easy to use and to figure out. I got mine going without even looking at the instructions. The filter is awesome. I don't have to buy those paper filters anymore, and there are no more bits of grounds in my coffee. The cleanup is a snap. The settings are great. This machine has made my life a lot easier, and the price was amazing. I give this a highly strong recommendation to anone who would like a higher end coffee machine for a lower end price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but Breaks","review":"As other people have mentioned this is a great product for about 8 months to a year. Then the latch breaks. I have bought two in a row but I am going to try another manufacture. The latch is plastic and keeps the lid down during the grinding and brewing process. I figured they would have fixed this after the first but my second one just broke this week. Just wanted to let others be aware of this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coffee, but sludgy","review":"This is a great value, and easier to clean than the Cuisinart grind-and-brew. However....because of the filter basket being odd-shaped (thereby not allowing you to use paper filters), there is sludge left in the bottom of the carafe each time you make a pot. Didn't bother me, but grossed out my husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"My main complaint is that the hot plate only stays warm for one hour. I called their customer service dept to see if there was a way to program it for longer time but there is not. Turning the unit back on just starts the whole brewing process again. One hour is just not long enough. We need 3-4 hours. I was lucky to find another Cuisinart Grind & Brew (the model we previously had) and am once again happy. Sorry I didn't find it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Very disappointing. I purchased the Melitta Mill and Brew after my Cuisinart Grind and Brew wore out (five years old). A friend had recommended the Melitta and I decided to try it because the price was so reasonable.I used the coffee maker for three weeks and was never able to get a good cup of coffee. I had to add extra beans just to get it strong enough, but it was never really quite strong enough. Finally, I put the coffeee maker back in the box and went out and bought another Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Carafe","review":"I bought this product just less than a year ago and enjoyed it for most of the time. The coffee really is NOT hot enough--I often have to put it in the microwave right after it's done brewing--but I love the mill option and have brewed some good coffee with it. About 2 months ago, while hand-washing the carafe, it cracked! It was functional for another month or so, until it completely broke apart and shattered. Since there's a limited one year warranty, I called the company to have it replaced. They explained to me that there is only a 3 month warranty on the parts, even though the carafe just fell apart, and not even in the dishwasher! I liked this coffeemaker and will probably end up dishing out [...] to replace the carafe. But beware of this problem and just know that you are dealing with a company that is aware of this problem and does not care enough to fix it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good coffee maker","review":"I did a lot of research prior to this purchase. I currently work for Gevalia and my father is a big coffee drinker, so I wanted to make sure to get a grinder/brewer that he would enjoy. This unit is very sleek and professional looking. The cups we've had have been very good and the Melitta name is well respected. We've had this coffee maker for probably close to two years now and haven't had any problems.Two knocks on it that I guess I could give is that like most coffee makers, the area to pour the water is kind of in a strange location in the back and a tad hard to pour into. The other thing is, also like most coffee makers, that measuring the right amount of beans/grinds to use to make cups can remind you that you are a chemist.

What made me get it in the first place was the ability to grind the beans right before brewing. At first, I loved coffeemaker - freshly ground beans every time, great coffee...wonderful! Then, like others, my plastic piece broke off. No problem, just taped down the lid instead. Then the timer malfunctioned a few times. Well, ok, it's a machine...it's allowed to have a glitch every so often. Then I went to pull out the carafe mid-brew, and the coffee flow stopped as usual...then continued, and wound up all over the counter! Well, it was nice while it lasted. I would not buy another Melitta, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. There were just too many \\"little\\" things that went wrong with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Coffe Maker","review":"I purchased my coffe maker only a few months ago. At first I thought I was not emptying the carafe because the coffee was all over the counter. Today, AGAIN, the coffee was all over the counter and I found out I only had 1/2 CUP in the carafe.

Although I love fresh, strong coffee( I even roast my own beans!), I'm not willing to give up the convenience of having coffee ready when I wake up. Here's what's great about this pot:Built in Grinder: Coffee is ground fresh in the morning for the best brew. Also, you don't spill grounds on the kitchen counter. Put your old grinder in the basement.Simple design: My 9 year old makes the coffee now. Easy to clean, takes up no more space on the counter. The Cuisinart looks like a plumbing nightmare compared to this.(And its HUGE.)Pours without spilling: I loved my old Mr. Coffee, but I could never get a clean pour.If you want to make better coffee than this, you need to go to a manual method, such as French Press."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE BRING THIS BACK!","review":"At least once every day this coffeemaker brings me joy.

The permanent filter is easy to deal with and very efficient..just a good rinse in hot water and it is ready to go! Once a week I put the filter,pot and the basket that holds the filter right in the dishwasher --how easy can it be? The brew time is great and the end result is just the best coffee in the world.

Makes very good coffee. It's a little hard to fiqure out the timer so save the instruction book if you don't use that feature often. The only weak part of the machine is the latch that holds down the lid where the grinder is. Just close it carefully or the little plastic nub will break and the machine won't run unless you place somethine heavy on the cover to keep it closed.We are heavy coffee drinkers and the first machine lasted a year and would have gone more but we tired of placing a napkin holder on the lid. This one should last longer now that I know it's weakness. The coffee strainer gets well stained after a couple month's use. I set it overnight in a bleach solution and put it in the dishwasher and it cleans up well. Overall it's the best general coffee maker we found and the only one with the milling machine built in.

The coffee comes out at a lukewarm 150 degrees farenheit however. I have tried prewarming the carafe with 210 degree water but it doesn't help the situation much. The box states that the unit turns off after an hour but the instructions make no mention of this feature. There is no hot plate so I don't even know what they are referring to in this regard. The system relies totally on the metal carafe to keep the coffee warm and it fails because the coffee is not warm in the first place. I cannot recommend this unit and I am looking for a new coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Feature, Not durable","review":"I've had this coffee makers for about two years. The fliter basket tears easily and can only be replaced through the manufacturer (about $10). The latch that locks the cover of the grinder basket has just broken off for the second time.

I have tried twice to get a working Melitta mill and brew coffee pot. On my first try, I discovered after reaching home that I had been sold one with broken glass. On my second try, the dispenser which was supposed to drop the coffee into the glass pot didn't line up, so coffee flowed all over the counter. When I called the Melitta helpline, I waited for an exceptionally long time and when 'help' finally came, it consisted of a woman reading the directions back to me. That was all she could do, she said. I also had a question about setting the timer, which she was unable to answer. Also beware of the default settings. Each time you use this coffee pot, you have to reset the time you want the machine to activate in the morning. Trust me, this is a royal pain if you use the pot several times a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"This is a cool product. I would have given it 5 stars but it shuts off after an hour and sometimes I don't drink my coffee that fast. It doesn't use a paper filter so it needs to be rinsed out.

We then decided to return it to our local store thinking it was just a fluke. I happily brought the new machine home, and when I opened the box it had a strong smell of coffee. Sure enough there was water still in the machine and uncleaned coffee grounds. I could not believe that target would put returned/used products back on the shelf. There is a reason why people keep returning these machines.

Then today the unit simply failed to brew the coffee. The grinder worked okay, and then... nothing! It WAS very convenient to be able to put the beans and water in the night before and have it grind and brew automatically at our predetermined time the next morning...when it worked. However with first the lid breaking, and now the unit not brewing coffee at all this thing doesn't deserve more than two stars. Perhaps I should give it 4 stars for when it worked and 1 star now.

Often times multi use items have a tendency to break easily, but this grinder and brewer has been a workhorse at the office.

The coffee never seemed hot enough and the latch on the grinder lid broke making the machine non-functional. The filter basket is pretty difficult to clean each day since coffee grounds tend to stick in the bottom under the grinder blade.I replaced the unit with a Braun and I am much happier but do not have the built in grinder capability. I understand Cuisinart has a built in grinder which is separate from the filter but it still seems to require a lot of effort to clean and use daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coffee at a good price","review":"We've been very happy with this product.

Couple that with the fact that it sells for slightly more than half the price of the comparable competitive models and you have a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only One Small Complaint","review":"We had a Cuisinart Grind and Brew and broke it within 2 years, as we do every other coffee pot that we have owned. I wasn't sure about another grinding and brewing machine, but then I found this one. I agree with others that the Cuisinart was a pain to clean, and that this one is much easier. The two pieces that you clean just snap right back in. I never have to fight with them.After 1.5 months, I love this machine. I have lovely coffee in the morning and its held up well to our harsh treatment of coffeemakers. I have only one small complaint about this pot: it turns itself off after only 1 hour and there is no way to set the time longer. With my husband getting up in the morning 1.5 hours after I do, I would like for him to not have to warm his coffee if I turn on the machine too early."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adjustments may be necessary","review":"To the person from Chicago: 1) Don't blame this great coffeemaker for your memory deficit. Maybe you could put a chain on the pot so you will remember to replace it after filling the chamber with water. 2) Try a piece of packing tape to hold the grinding chamber lid down instead of the dictionary. It works great and is less dangerous/scatter-brained. 3) If you are using ground coffee and can't remember to push the mill button when setting for morning brewing, just don't set it. Push the on button when you get up. :-)I broke my caraffe and need to find out where to get a replacement.

Grind beans? Check! Brew coffee? Check! Turn itself on at a designated time? Check! Turn itself off? Check! Abandon messy filters forever? Check! It even has a function where if you forget to put the top on, it won't start the brewing process.It may be the greatest coffee machine ever.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the functions are not intuitive. For example, to get the coffee to brew without grinding beans first, you have to push the button you would normally think would be the one that would tell the machine TO grind the beans. It's the same with the timer. It's kind of backwards. But you get used to it very quickly, and the user's manual is well-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful!","review":"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work a coffee maker, but it obviously takes one to make a decent pot of coffee with this machine. I am completely dumbfounded by this unit. ... I brewed to the exact specifications in the manual and then went hunting on the internet for optimal brewing methods with an automatic drip and nothing produced even close to a decent cup of coffee. Calls to Melitta and the parent company Salton where fruitless, so back ... this product went. For those of you who drink coffee at work, this machine makes coffee less desirable than the last cup which has been sitting on the burner for several hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Housing could be better","review":"I've had the Grind and Brew for over a year. Naturally, the warranty is for 1 year. Last week, a small plastic 'nub' broke off the filter housing top preventing the top from staying closed. Now the grinder will not work unless you hold the top down manually - a real pain. Also, the machine shuts off immediately after brewing is complete, I assume because without the little plastic nub, the top doesn't close and the cycle is interrupted. It's a shame because it makes good coffee. From now on I'll stick to a basic drip pot and grind my own coffee in a coffee mill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this coffeemaker","review":"We always try to buy quality products and we usually find that we have made a quality purchase. Not this time, though. We bought this pot while we had company and the box got thrown out before we tried the coffeemaker. What a mistake!! When you try to pour a cup of coffee, the pot leaks down the sides of the pot and all over the counter from the area where the plastic part of the pot joins the metal part. Can't find a replacement pot to buy anywhere!!! The grinder does not make consistent size grinds and most times it grinds so fine that the coffee goes through the filter and coats everything like sludge... even puts grounds in the coffee pot. Doesn't matter when setting you put the grinder on. Almost all the same. The coffee cools off right away. The very messy filter is not easy to clean and takes several minutes to rinse or wash and then you also have to wipe the sludge out of the grinding area. Ugh! What a waste of good money!!!! I would give ZERO stars if possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best!","review":"The Melitta Mill and Brew Coffeemaker is indeed one of the best coffee mill and brews we have owned...would LOVE to have another in case the present one gives out...use it daily!

I'm using the same brand of coffee beans I've used previously and the coffee is easily five times better than before.

If you buy this machine, following the directions is a must! Also, the coarse grind of this machine is not coarse enough. I always felt as though the machine grounded the beans too fine even or the lowest setting of 1. The coffee that it brewed was never hot enough, and would get cool quickly after pouring into a cup. Also, you have only 1 hour to drink your coffee before the machine turns itself off.

The coffee I made for myself was fine (I prefer a strong brew). The coffee I made for my fiance, who prefers a weaker brew, had a strong flavor and smell of plastic. I think my stronger brew masked the plastic flavor. Twice we tried the vinegar solution cleaning cycle prescribed in the manual, but the plastic flavor remained. My fiance understandably didn't like the plastic taste, and neither of us liked the idea of putting unwelcome chemicals into our bodies. We returned it. Ours was black, by the way, which I suppose could affect the flavor if the odd taste was something leaching out of the plastic. Since this is a mill-and-brew, the hot liquids travel across more plastic than in most coffeemakers.

I was always nervous about frying on the stove because there was no way to regulate the temperature of the oil. I always ended up with soggy, greasy food. This product looked like a great deal,had a regulated temperature control, and a cover to protect against spattering. The problem is that I once again ended up with totally greasy food. I read everything I could find about deep frying and determined that high temperature was a key ingredianet to light and crispy fried food. I suspected that the oil wasn't getting hot enough so I purchased a candy thermometer. What do you know, the oil was always 25 to 30 degrees below what the temperature control indicated. I returned the device promptly and got a decent fryer....don't wast your money on this bulky and ineffient product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another fryer!","review":"After much searching, I purchased this fryer to use occasionally for french fries, etc. After just a few weeks, the handle broke while frying potatoes, spilling greasy food on our carpeted kitchen floor. Also, the food was extremely slow to cook and greasy - I checked the oil temperature with a digital cooking thermometer and found it was often 25 to 50 degrees lower than the set temperature, definitely not hot enough. This unit is not only a safety hazzard, but it does not get hot enough to cook the food!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I've read many books on healing but this one was different.

Christians often pay \\"lip service\\" by saying that it is God the Holy Spirit who does the work. And then go right ahead and struggle to do in their own power that which only the Holy Spirit can do! The author discovered the answer is to REST in God, MOVE in His GRACE and to ask for the IMPARTATION of FAITH from the HOLY SPIRIT! Watch God MOVE when we TRUST Him to KEEP and DO His WORD. Dr. Price knew that he was a partaker of the Divine nature,and that without Christ, he himself could not do the works. Read, enjoy, GROW in the Grace of Jesus and in Knowing God.

The only really annoying thing is that trainers can call you and they never have anything even close to interesting to say, but besides that this game is perfect. And they added back the animations of the Pokemon, like in Crystal! This game is even better than Ruby and Sapphire!If you liked Ruby and Sapphire, chances are you'll like this.

The blade basket is really cheap (gotta cut cost somewhere). The teeth on the blade that are used to grind and liquify eventually start to bend upward and actually start eating into the plastic food chute. Perhaps I just have a defective blade, but I doubt it since it worked fine when I got it. In any event, unbeknownst to me, I probably ingested small particles of plastic with my yummy fruit drink.

It requires some work to pull the produce out of the refridgerator, wash it, and cut it into smaller pieces. Cleanup is not that difficult.

The right video card is a very, very small list so your chances of having it are slim. The Aspyr Technical Support is unbelievable bad! Their answer to everything is \\"we do not support that, check back later\\". What a waste! Just buy Dreamfall for the X-box and save yourself the aggrivation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid like hell","review":"The original game (The longest journey) was quite a decent game. It had some damned challenging puzzles, a ridiculous amount of great dialogue, and a good plot.This game, however, is a POS. It tacks on a useless combat system, dumbs down the puzzles, and ends with a 'to be continued' with impending world doom and your characters more or less dead/captured. It has some maddening 'missions' which consist mostly of running around and fetching. The overall sensation is somewhat akin to being repeatedly beaten with a crowbar, but less fun and more potential brain damage.Avoid with prejudice until they come out with the third in the series. Let's face it...2nd games in a trilogy are usually the worst and this one adheres to the rule well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful!","review":"I needed this for a pharmaceutics lab and it was very useful!

This is definitely an outstanding text for this purpose. It's genetic engineering in a nutshell. Each chapter is summarized at its end by a \\"concept-diagram\\" that connects all the essential information in that chapter (I wish other authors could do the same with their books). The book is divided in eight chapters, spanning over 165 pages approximately. It covers basic molecular biology (gene organization, expression), manipulation of nucleic acids (labelling, hybridisation, electrophoresis, and sequencing), restriction, modifying, and joining enzymes, vector techniques, cloning, recombinants, and applied issues (making proteins, transgenics, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Overview","review":"Nicholl covers every pertinent aspect of this fascinating field of science and engineering in this book in a clear and comprehensible way. His use of concept maps to summarize the key concepts in each chapter is a tremendously effective tool.Nicholl approaches this subject in a schematic way. That is to say, he makes considerable use of idealized diagrams to explain the many components and characteristics of genetic materials and processes. The terminology will be a challenge for non-geneticists, but Nicholl has included a fairly comprehensive glossary of terms at the end of the book.I highly recommend this text to anyone interested in understanding the basics of GE and its implications for our world."},{"rating":"1","title":"very brittle material","review":"This bowl was the perfect size for a plant I have.

I tried to carefully drill a hole in the bottom of the bowl with the intention of leaving the plug in place and the entire bottom of the bowl cracked and shattered.

More than once, says I, and mostly for himself after he'd gotten himself into hot water once again. The story of course is once again inconsequential, but the fun is seeing how many situations Flashy can get himself into, and the remarkable ways that he gets himself out, say I.The one really extraordinary thing that we learn about Flashy is that even among other men, his manhood is admired as 'above average'. That Fraser can take another story, and turn it around so that you would swear that the other guy is guilty of plagarism is just another piece of the Flashy legend.All in all, says I, a rip-roaring tale of a man without a consience, says he; who seems to do his damndess to preserve and protect other people's honor.Four huzzahs for the Flash-man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashy in hot water again","review":"Flashman gets roped/coerced into masquerading as a Danish prince and the action gets furious from there. Written in the first person, Flashman is brutally honest about himself and others, and waxes philosophical more often than he should, but then this is part of his \\"autobiography,\\" take it or leave it. A good deal of human nature can be learned from him.I think many of us will live vicariously in Flashman's reluctant adventures, especially the erotic episodes. Being a 19th Century Anglophile, I enjoy the History, phrases and terms used then, as accurately described by Fraser. I am most impressed at his research for the background and settings used. For a while, I wasn't sure whether Flashman had been a real person.Strongly suggest that the reader read the Flashman series in order, starting with the first one, Flashman: 1839-1842, to get the most out of the series. If you are really into it, read \\"Tom Brown's Schooldays\\" first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashman, Prince of Denmark","review":"Yup, the plot's implausible. Nope, it doesn't matter. This is a comic novel, folks. It's a brilliant one, too. The second, and so far, the best, Flashman novel. Plausibility be damned, as Flashy would say. Fraser takes the pieties of \\"Tom Brown Schooldays\\" and the romantic farrago of \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\" and makes of them something altogether hilarious.There is a movie adaptation, directed by Richard Lester. He doesn't apparently get the joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOORAH! FOR FLASHMAN","review":"Talk about swashbuckling, this book(and series)has it in droves. Flashman may be fictional but, he is a real hero. He isn't doing it for queen and country though, he's in it for a quick buck and a roll in the hay with a maiden or two, or three... Written in memoir form it is not the usual autobiographcal self-glorification you would expect. No one is more critical of him than Flash, himself. He's a self serving coward and proud of it. A hero by default, Harry tells it warts and all. Booze, broads, and stealing the crown jewels. Anytime you think he has escaped unscathed he blunders into an even bigger mess. I promise you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"You may as well walk off the stage when Lola Montez does","review":"The opening chapters are a fascinating little \\"what if\\" involving Otto von Bismarck meeting the famed Victorian boxer John Gully. It's well worth reading. The opening lines, having nothing to do with the rest of the book, are my favorite in the whole series.But once the Magnificent Montez exits, the book turns into a stale Prisoner of Zenda retread. The devices of making Flashman/Rassendyl the coward and bully we all know he is, or satirically suggesting that Hope copied his novel from Flashman's story, are outrageous enough to be entertaining, but not enough to keep the interest level up for the whole ride.I'm hopelessly addicted to the Flashman series and have read eight of them so far. I'd recommend any of the other seven above this one, especially the original Flashman!, as well as Flashman and the Redskins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the man I want to follow out of danger....","review":"I stumbled upon what looks to be an addictive series ofbooks following the rise, fall and sidestep of the ne'er dowell 19th Century Englishman named Flashman.

I didn't have time to give it to him to early with these summer storms giving no warning at all, but I would think it would kick in sometime in the middle of the storm that lasted an hour. I think I'm going to try buying something in pill form and see if that works.

It does everything for you. It is quite simple to adapt any recipe for use in the cooker once you have a little experience with it. I had never owned a pressure cooker before, and found this one very easy to learn to use. I cook in it 4-5 times a week with great results (and I am very fussy).

Often these quotes are interjected into the manuscript, cutting off any real solutions to problems. It is just commentary without the advice.

This 7-track disk is nothing more than a K-mart single, and a K-mart single they keep re-releasing and re-releasing, so far with 3 different covers. Is this to fool us into buying all three? Or tugging at the heart-strings of an avid Selena collector? One never knows.

I have yet to run into a recipe I couldn't convert using this appliance. After reading some of the reviews and comments on the noise made by the rotisserie, I say get over it. It's a rotisserie!!!

If we had not been home this would have caught our home on fire . NEVER GO AWAY AND LEAVE THIS ROTISSERIE PLUGGED INTO WALL OUTLET (Don't have to be on for it to malfunction ) .

It's very easy to clean and I especially like the fact that you have variable heat settings.The food rotates smoothly and quietly. The only drawback was the cooking times in the instruction book were off. The unit defaults to the two bottom heating elements. I just add the top one and it's fine.If you have a chance to compare the two rotisseries out there, I'm sure you'll agree that the George Foreman Rotisserie beats the Showtime hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Big","review":"I love the big rotis and it does a great job with chickens and turkeys. It takes alot longer to cook than the books suggest, but you can just put the chicken in and leave it and in 2-3 hours it tastes as good as any chicken you have ever had. It holds two chickens easily and a good size turkey breast. It would be tough to do a 16 pound turkey like they say it can. The product is solid as a truck. I cant recommend it more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big George \\"Way To Go\\"","review":"This machine is so great , it is larger than i expected .

The slide out grease tray works very well and is easy to get in and out . And i will also say that the manual does suggest that you line it with foil and add 2 cups of water to it . I think if people did this they wouldn't have a problem with smoke as i have read in some reviews . Wow , a manual can be helpfull. I have only had mine for a short time but the food has been great !! The chicken was so juicy . The meat was cooked to perfection . Oh and did i tell you how quiet this machine is ??

I have done a full turkey 3 times to rave reviews and other things as well. I even baked a Challah (bread) in it.The other thing to note is if you have a small kitchen this is a large piece of equipment and in my old appartment the only place it would fit is on top of the stove.

It takes an average of 2-3 hours to roast a chicken! It takes even longer to cook a roast, try 5-6 hours!! It is almost as if the machine never heats up!

It turned out that the machine was broken. I returned it and got a new one. It still takes longer than the instructions, but as long as you have a meat thermometer, it's okay. The brakets rusted in the dishwasher, but were still usable. It's pretty easy to clean, even the heating units which get covered with fat after cooking. I usually can't hear the timer bell, but I check on it every once in a while, so that isn't too much of a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"It is impossible to mess up a piece of meat on this machine. Super easy clean up, easy to understand and I highly recommend. All you need is a meat themometer to make every piece of meat come out perfect. I have done whole chickens, salmon fillets, and filet mignon tenderloin roast. All have come out perfect. The cooking times I have found in the manuel are not exact, so you will need a themometer like I have suggested and you will find this a no brainer. I simply cannot say enough about this rotisserie. I used to do all my rotisserie cooking on my outdoor grill. I find I no longer need to do that. I do it all in the comfort of my kitchen. No more fighting the heat or cold outside. This machine is a breeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"This item is wonderful but....","review":"This rotisserie is one of the best things I have in my home. I think my husband loves it more than I do.

How can you send a book off to print without having at least a couple of sentences about the city's major streets, even if just to print unconfirmed theories? I kept flipping around in the book to make sure I had the right city. It does have Lomas, Carlisle, and Juan Tabo, though. But just because it's a major street in Albuquerque doesn't mean that it's in here, which I view as inexcusable.Meanwhile, as if to play with you, the book straight-facedly informs you that \\"Rio Grande\\" was so named because of its proximity to the river, and \\"Academy\\" got its name because it ran along the Albuquerque Academy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to listen to","review":"I'll be honest and say I only listened to about 4 tracks off this album, and I found it so awful, it was actually painful for me to listen to it.

Also if you are in a bad mood that dorky Cat in the Silly hat will cheer you up! Dr. Seuss is a very good author. He expresses his amagination through the cat, which makes the story even better. I also liked this story because the stupid cat always makes messes and problems then ends up not only picking up his own mess but everybody elses as well, and make a big problem into a great thing. Therefor even though its a childesh book something in it makes it special and so i enjoyed it very much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't ask me what Voom is","review":"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back is another story about the Cat inviting himself into the home of the two kids and (to their dismay) making a spectacular mess, but cleaning it up before their mother gets home.

Naturally the Cat's efforts to clean it up keep making it worse, until the whole yard is a bright pink color.The story and illustrations are a lot of fun and have some brilliant ideas. For example, there are twenty-six little cats named \\"A\\" through \\"Z\\", each of whom comes out of the hat of the previous one to help with the mess. The dramatic solution to the problem is found in the hat of \\"Little Cat Z who is too small to see\\" (you'll have to be American for that rhyme to work).

As the story went on to tell the tales of the cat's mischevious exploits of how he left a spot that travelled around the house and was then blown out into the snow, for some reason guns were now needed to \\"Kill\\" the spots on the snow. Why one would want to introduce guns and the word kill in a children's story I do not understand.

We returned it the next day after stopping half way while reading it to our 2 year old. the book is dated and reflects actions that at the time it was written were probably not considered objectionable. There is a graphic 2 page spread involving the widespread use of popguns and red splotches. Hopefully, a child who is at this read-aloud level should not yet have been exposed to guns at all and if they have, every attempt should be made to limit that exposure and to make sure that guns are not presented in any validating format. Regardless of one's opinions on gun control, guns are very dangerous and should only be used under very limited circumstances and in the hands of a skilled user.

Drive through Espanola and Truchas the next time you are in the Santa Fe area, and you will see, it feels in person just as it appears on the movie. You can stay very quiet and almost, but not quite--(we are not native townsfolk!)--hear the magical accordion.Note: the Migration CD by Dave Grusin has, along with other selections, VERSIONS of the music on the soundtrack, beautiful, but not exactly the same. I want the exact renditions! and I want a DVD too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Real\\" New Mexico Revealed","review":"The Milagro Beanfield War is the real New Mexico. It is full of the characters and natural beauty that I love so much about my home. Sure the storyline is a bit 'Hollywood' with the evil Anglo land developer taking advantage of the poor Hispanic farmer. Get beyond that and look at the sub-plots and the characters and the sets ... that's New Mexico. And the soundtrack!!! Wow!!!OK I love this movie. If I get homesick on my frequent travels I can always pop it in the player and see the beautiful mountains near Truchas, and almost smell the green chili roasting. Bring on the enchaladas (red or green - your choice) and the sopapillas with honey.Robert Redford did a great job converting Nichol's book to the screen. Sure he had to combine a couple of characters into Amarante .. and the Smokey the Bear wars is glossed over .. so read the book. The movie is still entertaining -- no matter how many times I watch it -- and the characters are memorable.

He reaches some surprising conclusions regarding the magi.Powell's book is worth reading for the scholar, preacher, or educated lay person. He explains the potentially boring and difficult concept of reader-response criticsm in a very witty and lively manner.

I enjoyed it much more than the recent entries by Zubrin, Landis, or even Kim Stanley Robinson. However, in addition to the criticisms others have raised here about typos and editing, one other thing Cronin would have benefited from is to have a real Mars geologist give the book a read, before it was published. There are some real errors in the geology. For one thing, no dunes on Mars move as fast as those in Cronin's story, and quartz is practically nonexistant. (dunes hardly move at all under the present climate conditions). Regardless, a really fun book that I only wish was taken to that next level (some editing for typos, and a *Mars* geologist's input)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked","review":"This was my third brew n go.

It is very short. You can probably beat it in less than an hour. The graphics arn't great (about the same as the Gameboy). The main thing I dont like about this game is that there is no freedom. Yoshi moves along and all you do is draw a path of clouds for him to walk on with you stylus.The reason why this game is hard because, Basicly the game is one long level. In this level yoshi walks automaticly along the world on a path of clouds drawn by you. If Yoshi falls off, your dead. If he touches an enemy, your dead. what would really suck is if you were about to finish the game and you died. GAME OVER you would have to start from the begining again..and again...and again.Take my advise...DO NOT BUY \\"YOSHI TOUCH AND GO\\" EVEN IF IT WAS A PENNY!!!

The game uses the themes of Yoshi's Island from the SNES era, but in this game, rather than controlling Yoshi directly, Yoshi walks on his own and you have to draw clouds on the touch screen to help him cross pits and trap enemies and coins in bubbles so he can retrieve them. You can also tap Yoshi to make him jump, and keep tapping him to make him stay in the air longer. YT&G resembles an arcade game in many ways, such as the fact that the only goal you are trying to accomplish is to get the highest score (which can be very hard). You start out with 2 game modes, Score Attack (trying to get the high score) and Marathon (an endless game where you simply try to get as far along the path as possible). The very fast gameplay takes a while to get used to, but once you get into the game, you'll find it to be highly addictive and very fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids under the age of 10","review":"I bought a CD that had 4 songs by this \\"group\\" on it.

This is repeated 2000 times with different words. Quite an accomplishment in verbosity, but certainly not worth the money.

Introduction to the conceptual framework, relationship management issues and jargon are the key takeaways. A reader will be fully conversant on supply chain management matters after finishing the book.As for shortcomings, this book could have been written in a third less print, the job of a disciplined editor. While I understand business books need some heft, brevity is under-rated in this category. Repetition is rampant in this book. After the much needed tightening, a chapter on supply chain management for new or smaller businesses would be a welcome addition.That being said, I happily lend this book to friends and colleagues, the most practical compliment to a book's authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"Authors Charles C. Poirier and Stephen E. Reiter envision a trip down your supply chain like an effortless sail on calm seas. Your organization can reach this placid efficiency, they explain, by forming partnerships with suppliers and others in your business network. But the authors don't ask you to take their word; instead they present detailed case studies of companies that have implemented supply-chain optimization strategies and reaped prodigious benefits. The book's only flaw is its style. It is densely written and often weighed down by prose as murky as a rural delivery system and twice as difficult to penetrate. But we [...] recommend that business owners, corporate managers, executives and logisticians of all levels take the time required to patiently excavate the practical and pragmatic information that lies within."},{"rating":"1","title":"author chose wrong title... waste both time and money.","review":"The authors chose the wrong title, I guess.

Steaks are tender, chicken is moist, and burgers are juicy. The is no open flame, so there are no flare-ups or burnt foods, even if you are using a sauce or marinade. Great for veggies and fish,too. There are no spaces to lose the food through. Clean up is quick and easy, you need only hot water, a sponge, and a little soap! The size is great, too.

The only thing that happened (no biggie for me) is the Foreman name washed off the glass lid the first time I washed it. It does clean easily, I have not had anything stick or even hard to wipe off. Even after grilling onion slices marinated in a honey mustard recipe I used that came with the grill. I have owned other grills, and had a small Foreman grill, I like this one much better because it offers more versitility with it's size. For instance I started the grilled vegies, while preparing the fish and added it 10 minutes later, and it finished cooking at the same time.

Well, since then, let me put it this way ... the teflon wore out to bare metal on about half the grill in 3 months. Even when the teflon was intact, things stuck, to the point that half a steak was left on the grill one night. A night's worth of soaking didn't even lift it. Yes, I did everything according to the directions, however this grill has never worked for me. Ok, so now it's George Foreman's grill ...

Everything we've cooked on the grill so far is tender and juicy. The ability to control the temperature of the grill (unlike some other Foreman grills) ensures a perfect cooking temperature.The one complaint I have (the same as my other Foreman grill) is that it is slanted too much. This is supposed to enable the fat to cascade away from the meat, but all it really does is make it harder to position the food on the grill. The grill also has only one fat drain, so if you don't position the grill perfectly the fat can drain to a spot on the grill where it just pools.That said, I really like it so far.

Brand Asset Management details how to build a process to develop a brand, assess its health, and support business strategy.The brand and its management have implications well beyond marketing and sales, so Davis argues that brand management is the responsibility of all in the enterprise -it's about much more than techniques used by the brand manager. The brand should inform and drive decisions in product development, pricing, human resources, and business strategy.Brand Asset Management is so prescriptive that it sometimes reads like a checklist, and some will find it best used as a manual capturing all the steps to developing and maintaining a brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A practitioner's guide to brand management","review":"Davis' book is highly recommended for both students and pracitioners alike to gain insight on building a brand both internally and externally and then using that brand to help drive profitable growth.

If you've worked at any of the big agencies: McCann, JWT, Y&R;, you learn the contents of this book on your first day in about a hour. All the cases cited in this book are stale and extremely weak. The \\"editorial reviews\\" listed above are shill quotes from clients who are cited as \\"cases\\" in the book.Remember this before you buy: the author, and the firm for whom he works, use this book as nothing more than a lead-generation tool--it's called \\"thought leadership\\", a nebulous term used by company to propagate its own way of thinking.

Don't be surprised if you feel as if you're reading your old marketing or brand management textbook in a new paperback format. It is as if Kotler had rejuvenated himself and lost some weight.There is absolutely nothing new on what the author proposes.

I taped it off the lifetime network one day after seeing it months before. Tiffani plays a great role as a couragious and determined teenager who wants to see the people who hurt her get punished. Not only does she end up going against the whole town but she becomes outcasted and hurt by people she considered to be her friends. Brian Austin Green's character is awesome as far as dealing with peer pressure and in the end just going with what he feels. I cried in this movie and I laughed...it belongs on every girls movie shelf! I gurantee you will enjoy this movie as much as I do now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!","review":"I have not seen the DVD yet, but I remember when the movie first aired on NBC. I loved it and am sure I will enjoy the DVD as well. The movie was done while Tiffani Amber Thiessen and Brian Austin Green were costars on 90210 and living together in real-life, so the on screen chemistry that they displayed in this movie is both incredible and real. This is a great movie to teach women that they should fight no matter what, I can't wait to get the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not quite the book I was looking for.","review":"A large portion of the book is dedicated to the history, design, and evolution of the PC.

The pictures are sweet enough, and very colourful, but I would stick to some of her other cards like the Archangel cards...I feel Doreen has simply thought\\" Hmmm what mystical icon can I put on this new set to re-sell as something new \\".

There are dolpins and mermaids, of course... but there are also children and manatees and other magical creatures. The artwork is fantasy / mythical. Each card in the deck has a specific title at the top and then an accompanying message at the botton. The messages in this deck are geared towards fulfilling your life purpose and goals / dreams. I usually refer to this deck each night to see if I am on the right track...

After reading the book, I got the impression that Ethan didn't truely love either Zeena or Mattie, and so the \\"daring escape\\" from his life that he tries to make doesn't seem realistic.

The purchase of a 'Rumble Pack' was a definite necessity. The game controller, for me, was a little hard to get use to at first. The definite disadvantage for me was any game where I was looking at the scene, through my evey.Those made me dizzy and lightheaded (as warned on the package). Still fun after all these years.

There are a lot of fun games and it has all right graphics and good sound. Even though it's kind of old, I still have a lot of fun with this console.One thing to keep in mind is you may need to add some things to it. Some games require a memory card, which plugs into the controller, and some need an expansion pack, which plugs into the console. You can add a rumble pack if you want, but that's not required.

The collection should be complete with another $150 and some deep searching. The replay value for the N64 is second to none, because most games are for four players.The system is highly recommendable, and for maximum fun buy three more controllers and the expansion pack.

It has a lot of flaws in the games. Like when I was playing Mario 64, I jumped at the top of a stair case and got sucked into a solid wall and somehow ended up at the bottem of the stairs! I think the games cost to much for what they diliver to. Every game I played compared to the Play Station (PS) was extremly short. And they have no RPG's! The sound is all blips and dongs too. They don't have a lot of good games either. Compared to the PS I think this systom is almost trash! I'm not saying I don't like Nintendo it's just that this systom has to small of a libray of games, most of the games cost to much, the sound is bad, the games are to short, lots of flaws in the games, most of the games are boring, and they have no RPG's! If you have money, save it, and either buy a PS, PS2(when it comes out in September), or the new systom that's coming out for Nintendo in a few mounths or a year.

It is not clear why they even bother to pack a dough-hook given the power. But that's not all. The bowls are shaped badly, so material accumulates in the sharp angle and escapes mixing. They are so narrow that adding ingredients without hitting the beaters is tricky. And finally, the beater release button is a chore to operate. We once had confidence in Farber products.

He made art that had homoerotic themes. Andy Warhol was a mentor to him, but not just as an artist, both were openly gay men in the heavily homophobic 1980s. This disc showed some of Haring's safer sex messages, but they just breeze past the art he produced on a large pink triangle. At the end, they say he died in 1990. However, they should have said, \\"He died in 1990 due to complications from AIDS.\\" If Madonna could do AIDS activism in Keith's name during the time this documentary was made, then this documentary could have been bolder.

Sprinkle some seasonings, especially sage and celery seed on the chicken, and you get a fast flavorful healthier snack.We also use it as an addition to our oven with bigger meals. Sunday bacon sizzling is perfect with \\"George\\"--no shrinking, just the come and get it aroma without all the splatter.For faster cleaning, keep the drip pans in place and wipe down while it is still warm.

I emailed the company and heard no personal response at all, only received a shipping label in the mail two whole months later - at least, I think it was from them, hard to tell, no letter or anything. I didn't send it back because I had no idea what would happen if I did. So I consider it a lot of money wasted, and it definitely costs more than it's worth. I was very unhappy with the grill for this reason, the only way I could use it was to constantly turn foods - and they still burnt. But I was most unhappy with the company.

The book points the infrequency and lack of severity of most dog bites and offers solutions to help prevent future dog attacks from occurring. I now feel armed and educated to set realistic, responsible dog policy. The statistics are mind blowing and the information is invaluable. Dogs Bite is great resource for landlords, policy makers, schools, media outlets, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This book is truly amazing. A realistic look at the statistics of dog bites, this book is packed with great information not just about whether or not dog bite incidents are as dangerous as the insurance companies and newspapers would have us believe, but also about the best things we can do as a society to address dog-specific safety. This is one of those books that makes me wish I had the money to purchase hundreds of copies so that I could hand them out on the street corner, let alone the money to send a box to every legislative body from local town mayors to the Congress and Senate. This book needs to be read by every parent, every school principal, every pet owner, every perspective pet owner, every person with a pet-owning neighbor - well, everyone. The only downside to this book - things like this don't hit the New York Times Best Sellers List, no matter how much they should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long overdue reality check!","review":"It's easy to get carried away with flashy headlines and hearsay - but just how dangerous is man's best friend? Thank you Janis Bradley for dispelling myths and FINALLY putting dog bites into perspective for all of us, using astonishing facts instead of fear-based opinions! If you love dogs, get this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"Another pro-dog diatribe, attempting to justify dog ownership by trivialising the danger to children and the elderly from unconstrained dogs. There's something rather perverse and unnatural about 'owning' a mammal, whose utter dependence and williingness to endure anything strokes the fragile ego of the owner. Whether these types of books - of the polemical pro-dog type - spring from the PR department of the large petfood industry (very likely), or they are simply self-justifying therapy by dog owners, enough is enough. There are a few billion humans on this planet who could use the thousands that dog owners waste on dumb animals each year. And an environment that could benefit by ridding it of the massive damage that millions of dogs create annually."},{"rating":"1","title":"KARCHER Pressure Washer K3.98M","review":"TOTAL JUNK! Don't buy unless you like poor quality products. I bought my Karcher K3.98M pressure washer about six months ago. I only use it about once a month to wash my cars. The Vario Power Spray (VPS) wand stopped producing pressure during my last use and is already rendered useless and needs to be replaced. I contacted Karcher and was told the warranty is only 90 days. I had to pay $35 for a replacement wand.

Unfortunately, it couldn't happen.This movie was terrible! Thinking back on it there is NOTHING I could say I liked about this movie, and it's the worst asian horror movie I have ever seen. Spitting worms on someone is juvenile, not torture.

I order the brown/brown color.First pair was 5 stars, the next 4 stars. This one three stars: The dye color of the leather in the shoe is poorly matched. Also, the foot insert is problematic. It is removable (good), but the end covering the ball of the foot is not stiff and tends to fold up with use. Also, I swear the number of stitches per inch used to make the shoe has gone down with this last attempt, making the shoe look cheaper than earlier versions.The sole remains well crafted and should withstand long hard use. The shoe remains well priced.Oct 6, 2011 update: this pair lasted only 4 months before the stiching along the side gave way (on both shoes). On prior pairs, this took more than 2 years to occur. I must conclude that the shoe maker is substituting lower quality stitching on newer shoes. I would now give 2 stars to these shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality and High Price!","review":"These shoes cost about $90 and Timberland can not even cough up the $2 to waterproof them.

My favorite part of the DVD is most of an entire race at Lime Rock has been filmed from the driver's perspective, and that is an incredibly helpful tool. I would have given it 5 stars, but it is beginning to show it's age. I think Skip Barber's School should do a scene-by-scene remake so I can give it 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"basic stuff, good for newbie's","review":"this dvd is actually a rehash of some old 80's video, the picture quality and sound quality is not very good, but the actual content material is quite good. of course its useful for total beginners only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to basics reminder","review":"Pretty old now but the basics remain the same.

The DVD is introductory and won't answer all of your questions, but plenty of information is still packed into it, and the information is generally presented clearly, except for a few areas where I think they should have gone slower (eg, shifting technique). As others have noted, the DVD dates from about two decades ago, but the ideas presented are still valid, so the DVD is by no means obsolete, though I wouldn't mind an updated and greatly expanded version. Since I know of no better DVD on this topic, I can certainly recommend this one.PS - I've had performance driving instruction at Lime Rock, where this DVD was filmed, so it brought back some great memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Greastest, but mad smooth nonetheless.","review":"This album is tight, but in a subtle way.

Flipping through the reviews i could not believe how many positive reviews there were. They simply dont have what it takes to be mentioned in the same breath as Tribe, De la, and the Roots. Their style is not innovative, flows are awkward,lyrics are corny (positive doesn't have to be corny, ala tribe, de la). Like any rapper/vocalist you must have the voice to convey your messages. How many times have you heard someone like Raekwon rap and ask yourself wtf is he rapping about? yet you gotta feel his vibe cuz his voice and flow and the extreme conviction he raps with makes you wanna bob your head. Not that im advocating zero content like 90 percent of the rap crap that comes out these days but you have to have both which is what tribe, de la and roots have. This cd is near coaster material.

This C.D. must be pretty close to scratched because the tracks just roll off the C.D. and into my ears, I always play it. Even my boyfriend loves them now because they got a lot of play on a bodyboarding video featuring some of their songs. They are incredibly unique and I can tell you that Kim Hill belts it out on these tracks.

I believe that the BEPs aren't getting the amount of recognition that they should be credited with.

The live instruments and original positive out look on life is what is so attractive about their music. It dosen't duplicate any other sound or vibe you get from any other albums that they have been compared to, (Roots, Tribe, De La etc.)It's the music that makes you think of the good things in life, isn't that how music should be?

However -- and this is a big reservation -- I was flabbergasted that she & her sidekicks couldn't figure out why Joelle was killed until the very end! For Pete's sake, I had it nailed on page 39 as soon as Sonora found the girl's secret stash of kidnapped children materials. Even Joelle's journal entries all but shouted the truth -- how more obvious a clue do you need?! I read a ton of mysteries and, to me, one of the hallmarks of greatness is when I am left guessing 'til the last page. On that count, this book failed miserably, because the only ones left guessing were the detectives."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is excellent!","review":"Lynn S.

The best part is when you use this cooker there is a tremendous amount of fats that drain out of the meats that you would normally eat if it was cooked in a regular pan. The first time my wife cooked hamburger in the Forman cooker I could not believe the fats that came out of the meat especially since she only buys the best ground beef. If you dont have one of these cookers you should buy one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GEORGE FORMAN GRILL","review":"I have used my grill about five times.

Slowly the non-stick coating began coming off, and now it's completely gone on the bottom rack and I can't cook hamburgers on it anymore because half of my burger sticks to the pan. I've tried non-stick spays and they don't help any. Very sad. It still cooks steaks, chicken and vegetables great, but if, like me, you are a big fan of hamburgers, beware. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Received as a gift","review":"Nearly everyone has seen this grill in action at a friends or on television. It is a quick and easy way to cook without a lot of fat and calories. Sounds great.Well, I've given this thing a whole bunch of chances and what I can say is...Scallops, Sirloin Tips, Steak...all get seared on the outside and stay raw inside. There is no temperature control so its hotter than Hades or cold grill. Bugers taste great, but watch them carefully.Now, cleaning up is a royal pain. The non-stick surface cannot get scratched or its all over...so clean the non-immersable surface with a soft cloth or paper towels. There are nooks and crannies all over the appliance. The white outer surface gets greasy and smudged.Other than eating grass clippings or vegetables, nothing is safe or healthy says the experts. So if you need red meat grilled there are plenty of other options. The novelty of this grill wears out too fast.Sorry George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grill #20B","review":"My new grill instruction book not very helpful.

This little guy cooks up one great burger. It's fast, even cooking and the burgers come out just perfect. One of the great featres is the fact that access fat rolls off the meat and is collected in a little tray to be disposed of. I like that since it isn't being deposited on my hips. A BIG plus! It also makes great grilled sandwiches and is a snap to clean. One drawback....it isn't that big so if your family is large you may want to go with a bigger unit.

I assumed these reviewers didn't know how to properly take care of teflon and were using metal or rough objects to clean it. My unit was great for a month, but now the teflon is coming off in flakes. I never touched the grill surface with metal or a rough sponge. I cleaned it with a brush made to clean teflon surfaces, and was even sure not to use a lot of pressure just to be safe. I'm just very disappointed in this grill, it was great for the first 5 weeks, and now I can't even use it if I don't want teflon in my meat. Don't be skeptical, this product is cheaply made, and doesn't hold up to the quality I've known from these grills in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works like something designed by a punchy ex-boxer.","review":"I just got this today and used it to good chicken breast.

Then take a bun or hoagie roll, slice it and brush it with olive oil and put in grill for a few minutes....then assemble the sandwich with condiments...perfect taste!! Just like any type of cooking-proper seasoning, and proper preparation will result accordingly. You can't cook a sow's ear into a filet mignon.

I only seemed to have three radio station options: one has way too much static, the other still had a little static, and the third, well, didn't have that much static.I live in LA, so when I'm sitting through traffic, I'll notice that sometimes when I'm rocking out to my music, mid-song there will be static interference and sometimes I'll catch a glimpse of the gospel radio station that I have to tune my radio to just to listen to my iPod (which is really wierd if, say, I happen to be listening to some death metal band).I've only had this for a month, and my experiences are only getting worse.

Just a warning to potential iPhone users there looking for a FM transmitter.

Pretty unhappy about this since it cost $35.The transmitter part worked better than a Griffin device I had and returned around the same time; that is to say, much better job cutting out the FM signal. Alas, the charger is really kind of important so I'll have to buy another one after I do some research.

As far as the sound is concerned, it is very good but not quite as crisp as a CD player's sound.

This unit goes from 88.1 up to 107.9 with the ability to scan the range in between on odd numbers - like 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, etc. I live in a city where there are many open stations and with my 3rd Gen Nano this works great. You will get drive-bys in traffic of people operating a similar device in their car overpowering yours. This sometimes can be fun to scan through 88.1 to 89.9 ranges at the lights and see who is listening to what. And there is always a slight amount of static. For crystal clear, loud or no static audio this isn't your best choice, but for audio books and everyday music the price and quality are great. For a higher powered device that has less static I recommend the Belkin Roadmate, but these are mounted models that cradle your iPOD and aren't as flexible between devices like the iCarPlay is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monstor iCarPlay Wireless","review":"While this Monster unit is OK, it's just that. I bought it on a friend's suggestion. I plugged it in and it will not tune below 88.1. The FM dial on my car goes to 87.5. It is silent at that setting. The Monster unit is not able to lock in or find a silent station in Nashville, TN. I get a lot of interference while playing the ipod. The only true way to get good playback is to use the cassette player connection if your car has a cassette player...most don't these days because of the shift to using CD players only. Another idea is to have control of your antenna. If the antenna is down the unit works just fine. If you have a set antenna in the extended position and cannot lower it then you're out of luck with this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't support 4G Nano","review":"Radio portion seems to work great.

This adapter works better than more expensive adapters I have tried.Highly recommended if you just want to listen and don't need high-fidelity audio--I listen to podcasts mostly on mine.

DO NOT BUY!","review":"This is the worst transmitter I have ever used. There is constant static even when the station I am programmed to has no other signal. If it moves even in the slightest the static increases for whatever reason. Before this product I used an old iTrip transmitter which I had for 7-8 years now on almost a daily basis until the prongs on the phone/ipod plug-in went bad and it had perfect clear signal on the same stations the monster transmitter has static. Even when there was another signal faintly coming through the iTrip was clear. I'm not sure whether the monster transmitter is just under-powered or just of poor quality, but I could not be more dissatisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm ...","review":"Hmm ... It's easy to use and reasonably priced. The transmission quality is as one would expect from any portable FM type of device such as this. (That being from \\"bad\\" to \\"fair\\".)

I figured it'd still charge since this is a charger, right?Wrong.I drove 45 minutes today, ipod plugged into this device, and my battery icon dropped from 1/2 to 1/3.I'm giving this 2 stars because the FM transmitter is \\"OK\\" but the charger doesn't work at all.I'm sending this one back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not charge new iPod Nano","review":"The product is generally a good idea - however it is not compatible with the new iPod Nano... it works for all the older ones its seems, what this means is: it still will connect your iPod so you can listen to it in your car but it does not charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"This does not charge a ipod touch or Iphone","review":"It does not fully work with the ipod touch or iphone, it just plays the music and does not charge, was made for the older versions I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this unit.....","review":"I'm returning two of these. They are very difficult to plug and unplug from the iphone. You have to press in two side (very tiny) buttons and if you don't press them at the same time, the plug sticks in the iphone. The sound quality is poor at best, due to bleed from local stations. The 3 presets are not always open, unless you live in Death Valley, Az. Why didn't they make the plug like the iphone cord, which just slides in and out without pressing buttons? The connection plug (two tiny) buttons don't function some times when pressed and causes the plug to stick, and it seems like it's damaging the Iphone!! Also, each time I plug the unit into the iphone, I get an error message that says it's not compatible with the Iphone, but it seemed to charge and have normal functionality? I'm not sure why?? I will never purchase anything from Monster again. I'd rate it lower than 1 star if it was an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrrible sound quality, non-intuitive tuning....avoid","review":"Major issues with this product:(1) Sound quality is terrible. Can't overcome natural FM static. If you're old enough to remember a \\"portable transistor radio\\" or \\"AM Top 40\\" radio....then you'll know what the sound is like. Extremely low fidelity.(2) Tuning is non-intuitive. See those \\"+\\" and \\"-\\" markings next to the three pre-set buttons? Well, they don't mean a thing for tuning to a vacant frequency until you press and hold pre-set button number three. Then when the LED starts blinking, you have about a 50/50 chance of it either continuing to the unused frequency you're trying to tune to, or simply stopping someplace along the way.A disappointment all around.

I found that the wires were constantly in my way and slipped in between my seat and the center console smashing the wires and the control buttons. I also found the buttons irritating and impossible to operate while driving. The three buttons work as preset stations and if you hold down one of them for several seconds you can scan through all the stations. I really don't like the buttons. They're close together, and constantly bumping up against things changing the stations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Great product!

I used to drive around a lot, and I loved getting to have a huge mix of my iPod music in the car with me at all times. Sadly, one day, the transmitter just stopped working with a little pop noise, like a fuse blew. I was VERY sad, because I was so enamored with listening to my iPod all the time. So, I bought another one (FYI--at the time, they were around $70 at Best Buy, so it was a big investment).

I find it very useful although you may need to change the three memorized stations if you are traveling heavily through different towns. But I did find three stations that work well (are not used) in my city. The only issue I run into now is if someone else sits next to me at a red light and overrides my station so I suddenly get their music. That has happened twice. You get FM static as you raise the volume but it is insignificant at normal listening levels for me. I'll switch to a direct audio connection when I get a new car but for now, a definite hit for using in my 8 year old car."},{"rating":"1","title":"iCarPlay Fail","review":"I bought the Monster iCarPlay wireless FM Transmitter to replace an older model I'd bought about 4 years ago. Testing this equipment on a 10-day road trip was miserable as it was near impossible to find a station that had clear reception to the transmitter. If I'd known this, I'd have never bought this and relied on it to keep my iPod connected for this trip. Using it around town is a bit better but is still hard to find a clear station that will stay stable beyond a 10-mile radius. Also, this came with no instructions. It took a bit of frustration and multiple attempts to change the channel (from the three presets) before I could figure out how to move the channels up and down one-by-one. Buy something else if you're looking at this. As for me, I'll be looking at direct connections to my car stereo and just skip the FM transmitter altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak FM Output and Poor Audio","review":"I have owned this iPod FM transmitter for about 11 months and have used it while driving thousands of miles through many FM radio markets. In urban areas this unit is not useable, because, despite the availability of the three FM presets, you can't find open FM frequencies in urban areas, and if you do, the unit's FM modulator is not strong enough to overcome adjacent channel interference from city FM radio powerhouses, and typical poor car stereo FM tuner performance (selectivity).If you live in the country this unit's FM performance is just fine, unless of course you regularly travel to a nearby urban area.Also, my unit \\"overdeviates\\"--the iPpod audio is distorted on loud passages when hooked up to my Dodge Durango with the factory stereo installed. When the FM transmitter is hooked to my Subaru's top-of-the-line McIntosh stereo, the audio is good.I believe this product is overpriced, and should be sold with a caveat: Not useable in and around major cities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not good enough","review":"I SO wanted to love this thing. I have an iPod that I am seldom without, and my car isn't iPod compatible. I bought a Monster Wireless FM Transmitter/Charger so I could listen to my music on the way to my class reunion.

I don't live in a huge city (maybe 60,000 with farmland all around), but only two of these stations were available. Although I was able to tune in to my iPod, it wasn't crystal clear. In fact, it wasn't even plastic clear. The static sometimes overrode the music, which drove me nuts. This is like a fax machine - the original may be spotless, but the fax will be a little fuzzy.If you have a cassette player in your car, there are adapters that go through the cassette player and are much better.

Sometimes I get a little static but overall it works. Sound is not bad at all. I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I think this is an exceptional fm transmitter for ipods. For those looking for decent quality products, spend a bit more and get this product. This will work great on a daily use basis, if you travel within a city.If you do a lot of interstate travel you may face problems with changing fm frequencies regularly. But understand that this problem is going to be present in all fm transmitters because of the way they are made to work.It allows to set 3 freqencies that i can sqith between very easily. However, changing a preset frequency is not very easy and not recommeded while you are driving.Overall great product, great clarity (i think better than normal fm radio if you happen to find a free band on ur fm)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!!!!","review":"I was so excited to get this thing and jam out to my iPod in my car. I read all the reviews saying how good it was, but it just didn't work for me. I bought a DLo Transdock and it works 110 times better then this piece of junk. I couldn't get any clear station but DLo gives me alot more static free stations and bangs the iPod loud!!!! Monster gets 2 thumbs DOWN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"Yes, the biggest problem is the poor sound quality you get from this unit. Then there's the problem of station selection. It gives you 8 possible choices for stations to use. If you live in a large metropolitan area like I do, it is extremely likely that every one of those stations is going to be picking up a signal. Only one of the stations is usable in my area and I still get occasional signals from radio broadcasts.Do yourself a favor and avoid the FM transmitters. If you can't get a direct aux connection to your car stereo system and you have a cassette deck, get a cassette adapter. The sound quality is much better and they're much cheaper too.If you must get an FM transmitter, don't get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap Product!","review":"If you want to listen to your music with a bunch of static and white noise this is the product for you!

Not worth the $40 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of static","review":"I was excited to see that I could buy what looked to be a highly rated fm transmitter for a reasonable price but have been very disappointed. No matter where I am and no matter what station I use, there is a LOT of static. It sometimes clears up for a few seconds when I hold the cord where it attaches to the ipod but as soon as I let go, the static returns. Not worth the money even though it is cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you need for the 2nd gen nano.","review":"I had gone through 2 previous FM transmitters trying to fit my daughter's 2nd generation nano. After contacting the Monster's e-mail support, they confirmed it would work.It does.It works well, although we haven't had a huge amount of time with it as of yet.Only reason for 4 stars, is the difficulty in determining the newer nano capability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sar Far, So Good!","review":"A couple of years ago, I bought an iTrip by Griffin. It worked beautifully exactly one time. After that it would not pick up any frequency without so much static that it was worthless.I decided to try again with the Monster iCarPlay Plus. I have only used it a few times, but I have to say that the sound is excellent and there has been no interference to speak of! I live 25 miles north of Philadelphia and 65 miles south of NY City. Virtually every frequency is used or picks up the frequency next to it. I still get clear, uninterrupted sound.I don't know if it is related, but there was one instance when I used the iCar & my iPod froze and I had to reset it . . . . I hope it doesn't have anything to do with the iCar. Time will tell.Overall, tho, I am extremely happy with the Monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I gave this as a Christmas gift to my son-in-law and he was extremely excited.

I was surprised to see all the horrible reviews it got. It works fine if you find a station with no interference at all. Even if there is nothing on the station, that does not mean there is no interference. It takes a while to find a perfect station, but once you do, this works very well. Personally, I don't believe anyone that says that this broke after a few days. This is made by monster, and everything they make is good, thats why it costs so much more than other FM transmitters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after a year","review":"I bought this product after reading several reviews online and also after receiving recommendations from friends. It worked great for the most part (major cities like Seattle gave me some problems) and did fairly well...and then it died after only one year and shortly before I was about to make a 10 hour road trip from Florida to Georgia. When I buy an electronic product I would like to know that it will last me for a few years rather than having to replace it on an annual basis.To those customers who highly rated this product more than a year ago, I would be interested to hear what your current recommendation is for this FM transmitter.Is the life expectancy of these things only a year? If so that seems rather ludicrous to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product!","review":"I just received this product and really enjoy it. I have been looking for a way to listen to my iPod in my truck and didn't have a way to connect it into my radio. I had to try a few different stations and found a clear station. The quality is good, however I do hear a small amount of static noise between songs when it's quiet. The music comes through clear but if I move it around I get some static but most of the time it just sits there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two have stopped working for me","review":"I have had two of these. Monster was nice enough to replace the first one, but the second one has failed as well. First I noticed the display was off. I thought it might have been the dimmer so I tried to 'un-dim' it but to no avail. Without the display I tried scanning stations to see if only the display had stopped working but FM was also shot.The signal strength was high quality while it worked.Also, this doesn't charge an ipod touch or iphone, but it does broadcast through the FM with these devices. (while it lasts). Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for Itouch and FM only marginal","review":"I bought this to use with a new itouch. The connector fits but the itouch won't charge.

So I bought another Belkin and it was no good, too much static. Switched over to the Monster cable and it worked perfect for my area. I've tried using it out of the country and it works well, but in some places all the FM stations are in use so it was not so great.

Must have been from all the tugging and pulling, getting caught on things. I feel lost without one, so...time to buy another!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Product On The Market","review":"This is easily the best product on the market for playing your ipod in your car. All that nonsense that I read about it not working in an urban area is just that, nonsense. I live in New York City and go driving through Manhattan (it does not get anymore urban than Manhattan) and the reception and quality is fine. No, it's not CD quality, just what the radio plays but depending on your speakers and sound system and ipod sound settings, the sound would be up to par with CD sound. I've tried other products from griffin and everyone else, by far and away this is the best and gets a 5 star rating. Oh, and if you should get some static, put it closer to your car antenna or raise on a holster or something and the static will go away. And unlike your tape deck, there is no hissing, assuming you have found a good and clear station."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than expected","review":"Perhaps I just had unrealistic expectations, but I haven't been happy with this product.

My wife travels extensively and is in a rental car all the time and it is the best thing ever. Actually I have three units one for each car at home and the one my wife has for travel. We, I, never have a problem finding a channel, and the signal is much stronger than the old versions. I suspect you could put it in the back seat if the cord was long enough and it still would perform excellent. I highly recommend it. It is also nice that you can pick up your Ipod and change songs easily with the long cord. Can't say enough positive things about it.

What killed it was the gold color part that sticks out of the devie - which you plug into your car outlet. This gold surface area conducts electricity which gives power to the cable.

The sound quality through this device sounds like two cans and a wire in between. By the way I also screamed at Porsche for not having an AUX plug in for Ipods. Porsche has made this a standard feature in 09 models. So if you need to have a IPOD hookup and your use to top quality sound.

It's really nice that it charges/powers the iPod while using it, so you don't have to worry about the battery. The included instructions are clear and short, no need for complex explanations.I have used Griffin and Belkin products before (that hook into the headphone jack) and they just don't compare to the audio quality of this Monster transmitter.The dock connector is a little catchy when removing from the iPod, but not enough to actually be a problem.This is a great product and I have already recommended it to a couple of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Pleased","review":"Couldn't have been more pleased with my purchase.

The first is a huge amount of static that it couldn't overcome. In fact, the static was louder than the MP3 I was trying to play.Second, the station options are written so small on the device, they are very difficult to read. I have 20/20 vision and had to hold it up to my face to read it (not very safe to do while driving!).Thirdly, if its dark out and you yet again have to try and find another station to play over the static, you have to turn the car's interior lights on to read the tiny letters, as they are not backlit.Overall, this is a poorly designed product that does not work well at all.The best experience I had with this product was returning it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute junk","review":"I bought two and had to return both of them.

So it will not work on any station higher than 90.1. Also, while it will work with 87.9, it is staticky to the point that it will drive you crazy (husband has older one that plays beautifully in my car on same station). The only station I can use it on is 89.9 and we live in suburban phillie area. It does work (and it does charge ipod while playing, which is nice), but there is a lot of static, especially noticeable when you turn up the volume. I can't use it for travel outside of my immediate area, not while driving safely anyway since I would have to constantly change the station and setting.You get what you pay for, so if an FM transmitter seems too cheap, it probably is."},{"rating":"1","title":"False product listing.","review":"I suppose the product works just that it's not what I wanted.

There are tragic twists and turns, as well as some hilarious moments -- and even a miracle here or there. The story is infused with descriptions of the meals cooked by her grandmother, used as a device to show how much love the author felt coming from that quadrant. It's not a brilliant plot, but the novel is written in the grandest tradition of irish storytelling -- humorous, touching, and very satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"book study tragedy averted","review":"I could not locate any copies where they said to shop, went online and found a new book at less than what the store wanted to order me a copy.

I always got the replacement the next day with a tech to put it in, even though I have installed many myself. One hard drive was a Maxtor, one was a Western Digital and one was Seagate. A hard drive crash is not Dell's fault and I have NEVER had an issue with any of the 7 monitors I have had from Dell, including this one. Would I buy Dell again? You bet I would!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little monitor","review":"Got this monitor rather quickly. Came as advertised, no issues with shipping.

Maybe a bit too bright, but otherwise a decent monitor.Would definitely recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very happy about this order.","review":"Ok I purchase this used, and it was only 29.00, but after shipping price, it would be around 54.00. When it arrived it was very dirty and dusty all over, had to use a vacum cleaner to clean it up. The picture seems distorted some aswell. I decided I will use it as a backup monitor just in case my NEC 19\\" goes, and just buy a flat screen later or a newer crt. I have to say this order tops my worse orders list. Don't understand why the seller could of atleast clean this monitor up before shipping it in the mess it was in."},{"rating":"1","title":"dell 17inch monitor","review":"I was very dissapointed with the style and appearance of this item and would like to return it,but did not because it is to heavy for me to lug around, and I did not save the packaging. This is a very old monitor, the color is dark, it has to be resized each time I sign on. I emailed the seller for tech support and got no response as yet. There was no manual or any written help included in the packaging.I would rather have spent the money on a newer model."},{"rating":"2","title":"This needs to be released on DVD....","review":"I watched this probably 15 years ago as a kid. And I LOVED it. And when a pre-teen loves a cleaning video, you know it has to be good :)Don Aslett is actually incredibly funny in this while he points out the things that tend to literally clutter up our every day lives. (If you have not read his books, start with Clutter's Last Stand -- he makes you laugh and cringe at the same time).In this tape, he offers practical cleaning advice with tips on how to de-junk -- while pointing out the stupid stuff we do that add to the mess (like holding on to pantyhose that have a rip in them - no one wears them, but just about every woman has at least a few pairs of those, right?)I really wish they would release this on DVD. I know it wouldn't become a huge seller though. Maybe they could make it available for download though. I would buy it in a second. I know several others who would as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"One use was enough","review":"After I used the plastic cubes for the first time, I put them in a bowl filled with hot, soapy water. I washed them each by hand, rinsed and dried them off, and started to put them away in the freezer for the next use. Luckily I noticed that one of the cubes had sprung a leak and was only 1/3 full. That means your drink or soap suds may end up inside the cubes. I only used them once! I'm taking time to write this review because I wish someone had warned me about these \\"Tropical Flowers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many unsubstatiated statements","review":"I was not too fond of this book, not because I'm a Malcolm fan, but there are too many conclusions that Perry makes with weak evidence. Such as Malcolm's father (and Malcolm himself) setting their houses on fire, Malcolm's alleged homosexual activity, Malcolm asking the Klan why they allowed Dr. King to live, etc. etc. One could see why Dr. Betty Shabazz (Malcolm's wife)told Perry to get lost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Approach With Caution","review":"You have to question what Perry wanted to achieve from this book. He seems to have missed, or overlooked, all of the important issues that Malcolm X stood for.He takes the word of Malcolm's detractors as the gospel truth and diminishes Malcolm's teachings and beliefs by portraying them as paranoid.Perry seems obsessed with highlighting flaws in Malcolm's personality and uses this device to side step the vital lessons which Malcolm was trying to teach - lesson's which still need to be learnt today.By all means read this book, but do so very objectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for interested parties","review":"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I thought that Perry truly succeeded in this biography of Malcolm. I think that one must have read Malcolm's autobiography to appreciate this book; that said, I'm very glad to have read another source besides the Malcolm/Haley classic. This work does take a critical look into the life of Malcolm, and Perry does seem determined to cast doubt upon Malcolm X's own statements, but I don't think that this was to malign or to lessen Malcolm's credibility and accomplishments. Perry provides the reader with a well researched and backed viewpoint to allow for greater discussion and interpretation of Malcolm's thoughts. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has read Malcolm's autobiography, and who would like to learn more about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Execution","review":"This book is highly based on the authors opinions, instead of delivering hard core facts. While reading this book, I found myself questioning the author's intent. This book was written to diminish the image of Malcolm X, despite it being the first biography on him.Skip this. Only Farrakhan could write something with more contempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader","review":"This book was obviously written by someone who hates Malcolm X. He had nothing positive to say only negative. He even went so far as to make the reader feel as though everything that Malcolm ever said was a lie. He portrays Malcolm as a person who hated himself but I believe it is the writer of this book who hates Malcolm and his family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made up by idiot.","review":"Who ever thinks Malcolm X was negative is not getting the information farther of what they know. Bruce Perry is stupid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Insightful","review":"The reads more like a textbook but is full of criticism history alongside fresh thoughts from Dr. Jones. This is almost a must read for anyone who wishes to study the parables of Jesus. He does, as what N.T. Wright does, use the Kingdom principle to tie everything together. The book is well written and clear enough for non-scholars but the thoughts are developed enough for seminary students. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best edition","review":"This reprinted edition does not follow the pagination of the original edition. For classroom or academic purposes, it is generally preferable to use the Prometheus Books edition, the Penguin Classics editon, or the Dover edition, all of which follow the original pagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgustingly lacking","review":"Although the subject matter is interesting, though a bit dense for a novice like myself, this rendering is awful. There is no information about the text, other than the author's name and the title. No preface. No introduction. No \\"about the author\\". Not even the date it was originally published.This bare bones approach was enough to frustrate and disappoint, but a week into my class I learned that the text is also missing footnotes! My professor warned me that James employed extensive footnotes, one allegedly spanning 3 pages, but none are to be see. Clearly, James leans on the notes heavily, and this is real content that is simply missing! I am now stuck using the online full text provided by the University of Virginia, rather than depend on a work missing crucial elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy-Mindedness","review":"This book has been reissued, but this is the particular copy that this reviewer has read and reread. The chapters entitled \\"The Religion of Healthy-Mindedness\\" and \\"The Sick Soul\\" are very illuminating. These phrases can be tranferred to the present time. We have popular music and healthy mindedness and popular music and the sick soul. We have comedy and healthy mindedness and comedy and the sick soul. So too with best selling books and best selling movies. The \\"Conclusion\\" and \\"Postscript\\" are somewhat disappointing because too many myteries remain.

I like the fact that it was in a very good shape.

I was at my wit's end, trying to hold on to Conservative Christianity while studying Philosophy at a small liberal arts college. There was no room to keep my \\"faith\\" in a separate little box, I was there to test it.What I found was validation for my religious experiences AND the variety in James' examples. Religion and it's mystical aspects seem to be a natural, if not universal, experience for mankind which respects no particular theology.James helped my exit from fundamentalism go a little softer. Also, I personally sensed I would like him personally if I'd ever met him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casting a Negative Light on Reusing","review":"While I fully a appreciate environmental satire I feel this book casts a negative light on environmentalism. These pages could have been filled with great ways to reuse the items we so often throw away but instead goffed at this idea. It suggests, to me, that people who work hard and put in the extra effort to reuse are idiots and wasting their time. The \\"unusable\\" items described in this book are just a joke and the world's exponentially growing landfills and decreasing resources are not. I have a great sense of humor but, as a hard working and dedicated environmental scientist, this book just seems like a slap in the face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unappealing projects","review":"I expected this book to show me how to make projects comparable to those found in the \\"ReadyMade\\" magazine: Practical, attractive projects that make good use out of cast off items. Instead, this book shows projects made out of junk that look like nothing more than projects made out of junk. A coat rack made out of laundry soap bottles looks like a stack of laundry soap bottles. The cd racks made out of shipping cartons look like shipping cartons. I was very surprised to find not one item in the book that I wanted to make.Tastes being what they are, you may enjoy this book more than me. All I'm saying is that you'd probably want to look at a copy of it before buying, to make sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I'm a huge fan of chic DIY projects and was very excited about this book. For $25 I learned: 1. How to turn containers for stuff into.... containers for other stuff! 2. Stacking things (and maybe if you feel like it gluing them together) = instant furniture! 3. For just $125.00 and hours of labor I can have a shoddily constructed and unattractive shelving unit! Lacking a chair? All you need is saran wrap (about $3) and a chair!Filled with fluff and ironic hipster commentary, there isn't one thing in this book I would be proud to say I had created. well-intentioned but ultimately a huge disappointment and complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disapointing","review":"I bought the book a few days ago, with hope in my eyes, and I'm re-selling it on craigslist today.I can only define it as a \\"book for people who shop exclusively at WestElm and have an urge to \\"slum it\\" by occasionally making things to keep up their egos and illusion of street cred at parties.\\"So sorry, ReadyMade.

I find some of the projects to be hideously ugly, but some look like they would be fun to make. My problem with many of them is that they would require the purchase of the base materials! If the stuff is lying around the house, it's already being used. I was under the impression that this book would contain projects that I could make from stuff that I already had lying around. I don't read ReadyMade magazine, though, so perhaps I just didn't know what I was getting into.I liked the little informational sections on the history of the base materials (paper, wood, etc) more than many of the actual projects. I'll hang on to this, but I'm not sure how often I'll end up making anything described on the pages (if at all)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not many projects and kinda silly","review":"The projects are kinda silly and you probably won't build them for you house unless you have multiple triangle packages from fedex and hundreds of yellow page books.

Glyn literally invented many of the romantic conventions we see in books today. Her sense of humor and sharp critical eye enliven what might otherwise be rather standard love stories.But here, most of what is truly extraordinary about Glyn has been edited out. The resut is a standard, cut-to-the-chase love story that could have been written by almost anyone. If you are interested in writing your own romance novel, this might be interesting as a study in how to move the plot along, but personally, I read in order to read good writing.And, incidentally, the work in question was not listed as being a sharply edited version. So be careful -- one can only conclude that the reader is supposed to know magically that the Barbara Cartland reissues have been chopped to pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre-revolutionary Russian romance","review":"This romance is set in pre-revolutionary Russia, and does a nice job of creating the backdrop for the lives of the nobility here.

I'm very disappointed.I thought this would only have fewer pages but not mini in size.I wish the description explained that it was mini in dimensions length x width, and not leaving for one to possibly assume that it was only with less pages, but in the regular dimenstions a book would be.Too much money for what I received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice version of the classic rhyme","review":"I teach young children and I really like this version of the traditional rhyme. Children are familiar with the basic rhythmic chant and enjoy repeating it. The pop-up cookies make it fun for children to look at and easy for them to count. (I count on every page.) They make the animal sounds as the story goes along. The ending, where everybody shares the last cookie, is nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"My daughter, 20 months, picked this book out herself at the bookstore. She loves counting the cookies (well, she loves when I count the cookies). She also loves saying the names of the different animals who \\"stole the cookie\\". The illustrations are easy for her to follow and on the last page, when everyone has to share the cookie, she loves pointing at each of the animals and saying who they are.

If you want to build your own .Net language and Compiler then you must have some understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of compilers - scanners, parsers, intermediate representation, etc.This book not only skips the required theory, but avoids any technical depth to the degree of being nothing more than 400-page description of a crappy BASIC interpreter the author wrote.Even if you want some lightweight reading on the subject of compilers or .Net in general, there just isn't enough meat here to justify picking this book up off the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of paper and $$$","review":"I have to agree with the \\"waste of time\\" review below. This book reads like a C-student's CS notes on compiler technology. Having created compilers for other platforms, I hoped that this book would shed some light on compiling to MSIL. Unfortunately, coverage on this and other key topics is quite sparse.In the book, the author refers to Aho, Sethi and Ullman's classic - \\"Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools\\" (The \\"dragon book\\").

Furthermore it's really NOT very helpful as it barely dives deeper than beginning level. But for beginners, the quality of the material is low & written in a confusing manner. There are much better books than this one available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I really thought this book was going to help me learn more about the subject, but it's really a fairly transparent attempt by the author to make a quick buck or two off of the .NET mania. The writing is painful, to say the least, with a heavy dose of hand-waving thrown in. A lot of claims about proper compiler development which are not followed up in the so-called compiler he developed. It doesn't actually generate proper .NET code, so the whole thing is a fraud, and should be recalled. Don't waste your money on this thing, it should be recalled. Apress used to have a reputation for doing better than this charlatan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Mr. Nilges presents the subject matter in a clearly understandable text.

There is no danger of leaving that one plugged in.The product is great when it works, but the company is WAY less than accomodating. They should provide some sort of compensation for the headaches.

It's a pile rubble. History. From what I understand, Farberware products have been made in China (or somewhere outside US) for several years now.Now I don't know if this has anything to do with the quality of Farberware products - but they don't seem to be holding up to the Farberware products my parents swore by.Despite the mixed review of this coffee maker, I purchased it. It lasted about a year. I love the design, especially the electrical base which allows for the transport of the hot pot of coffee without unplugging. I also love perk coffee. Unfortunately, the machine did not hold up.The glass bulb at the top is no longer glass, it's plastic. It broke off. Also, the buttons on the base have begun to crack.Now I'm back on Amazon coffee-maker shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee at first, until.........","review":"I received this coffee maker as a father's day gift last year (2001). At first everything went ok, coffee tasted excellent, then one day it decided to not work anymore. The clock still works but thats about all. I'm pretty good with my hands so I took it upon myself to see if I could repair the coffee pot. I too found corrosion on the wires. Upon closer inspection I also found a melted piece of something around two of the six electrical connectios inside the pot. I don't know what those burnt pieces were but I can tell you that the coffee pot is in the garbage. For the amount you pay for this you would think that the product be more durable and not so cheaply assembled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faberware Perculator","review":"This perculator lasts only a few months.

First one lasted an astounding 2 whole years before no heat - purchased in '02. Thinking as others have, I assumed a lemon and bought another in May of \`'04 - this one didn't even finish the year before not heating the coffee.UpDate Feb. '06 - Make this 3-Dead Ones. The unit is no longer making hot coffe and requires a kick in the pants with the microwave. I have emailed Farberware for a return - Again. We will see where it leads...The only reason I am giving 2-stars is that there was no hassle with the warranty. A pre-paid shipping label was provided and a new pot is on the way. I do believe I will research quality drip machines for my next purchase. They have the same (or better) features as this unit. Probably better - as I have always found it kind'a convoluted the key sequence you enter to set the brew time on the Farberware unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yummy coffee for 9 months...","review":"First the plastic top broke off at 6 months.

The first two were the older models that you plugged in and left on. Number One lasted under two years, and Number Two lasted just over a year. I figured that this new version with the base would be the ticket. Well, a month ago the see-through plastic top popped off. Luckily I had learned my lesson and kept various of the other parts to the other two models. So I pulled out the top from the last one and was ready to go. A week ago it started making lukewarm coffee, and then as the week went on, it stopped heating enough to even make coffee. We are using a bodum teapot to make our coffee until the french press coffee pot I ordered arrives.

Other reviews are saying the same thing. It seems to have a life of about 1 year.I bought a drip coffee maker at Target to replace this one. The drip coffee maker (Mr. Coffee) lasted for ONE POT and now it is dead.

I thought the ones that were complaining about the poor quality after a few months had just gotten a bad pot. WELL, IT IS TRUE WHAT IS SAID !!! This pot gave us GREAT coffee for about 6 months. Then it will sometimes not perk the coffee and most of the time it is just lukewarm coffee. NOT the HOT coffee it gave the first 6 months. I had even bought 2 of these pots and my friend's pot went out before mine did. There is something SERIOUSLY WRONG with this pot. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive piece of junk","review":"We bought this coffee maker a little under two years ago. Wonderful coffee for the first nine months until the see thru plastic percolator top snapped off. My husband raised enough hell with Farberware to finally get them to send a replacement lid. In the meantime we took the broken pot back to Fields and they gave us a new one. So we thought this was great because we would now be prepared with a new lid when this one broke. Well it is now about another nine months and the lid is fine but the coffee is luke warm at best.

Coffee machines just do not make a hot cup of coffee. This is the best. The problem with this is that it is a sensitive machine.

Yes, ours did last longer than a year. I assume it died for the same reason that so many have stated about the wiring. It definitely made hot flavorful coffee.

I bought this product with the hope that I could have a piping hot cup o' tea as soon as I got out of bed in the morning. The biggest drawback of this percolator is that there is no way to set the perk time. It only perks until the water reaches boiling and then stops, where my old percolator would perk until you unplugged it or it boiled dry. When making tea, it's imperative that water continue to flow for three to ten minutes, depending on the tea leaf blend, after reaching a boiling temperature for optimal flavor and richness.The other problem I had with this percolator is that no matter how many times I cleaned it out with vinegar or soap and water, there was always a hint of plastic/new electronics flavor added to my tea. This can't improve the flavor of coffee either.Avoid this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Father and Sons Hobby dreams do come true Gary Joe Story","review":"When Dreams Come TrueThe Book tells life about the man who achieved dreams of opening hobby shop...The story is a Heartwarming tale of a man who fulfilled his dreams and enjoyed a happy relationship with Jean tells the story of her time with Gary ...Also the travled halfway across the country to achieve his dreams of opening a hobby shop in CT ...How the author have detail of the time that they spend together with Gary ....and spreading the tales how they love each other and his family and his children...Most of all the story is uplifting and memoires of happpiness and love ....and true story ....had been told in this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father and sons hobby Dreams do come true Gary Joe story","review":"It is a wonderful story that been written and told by the authorand the story is very inspires story that I really enjoyed alot.Most of all it is a true story about Gary and Jean and they were in love and Gary accomplished his dreams ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"father and sons hobby dreams do come true Gary Joe story","review":"Gary joe I hear yours voice that speak to melisten to the words of songsomeone is prescise to me.I want to hold him tonight in my armswhen i am alone i want to cry.but i see himi feel alive my dreams are real.That poem touch my heart when i read from the book ....what a wonderful book to read ....a love story between two lovers ...love it very much ....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father and sons hobby dreams do come true Gary Joe story","review":"It is a very touching story and also sad and happy feeling ...Love story ....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father and sons hobby Dreams do come true Gary Joe story","review":"My friend gave me this book for Christmas and I started to read it and the story make me cry for the Man in story....How he was alone and his children visit him ... and how he loved them ....what a really story and I do love it very much .....And I will tell a friend to pick up the book it is very good....The cover is eyes catching like that Person is alive ... and smiling at you ....

It is intended to teach CS1 (the first computer science course) using Java as the language but it will NOT teach you enough Java. AWT, Applet are cursory covered in a chapter each. Multithreading and networking are mentioned in ONE example for each topic in the Applet chapter.If you have absolutely no programming background, then I guess it will be fine for you. But if you really want to be a Java programmer, spend your hard earned money on Deitel's \\"Java How to Program\\" book, more bangs for the bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is hideous","review":"The only reason why I bought this book was because my teacher chose it for his class.I ended up reading and re-reading the chapters and supplementing it with a more practical book like, \\"Teach Yourself Java\\", Lemay, et al.There are few examples, and the explanations were hideously twisted and academic. If this book were about breathing, it would explain the finer points of vaccuum differentials while we would all be blue and dead on the floor. Java's not easy, but it's really not THIS hard.The fun started in section 1.7 where it began to slaughter classes and methods, and those letters starting turning into cyrillic and jumping around the page while I sipped caffeine to stay awake to keep my professor happy.

It is impossible to list every single difference between the different dialects of former Yugoslavia. I have studied and taught this language for over ten years, and there are too many differences to be pointed out in a dictionary. You must understand that this dictionary was written when there was a \\"knjizevni\\" serbo-croatian language. That is the language that this dictionary is based on.

Just like the 60's as bands were singing against Vietnam, the Redwalls modernize this message.

If you like the \\"Brit Invasion\\" style of music and don't care about the \\"untouchability\\" of great artists that came before then you might end up liking the Redwalls.

When I gently pushed the bolt carrier on my AR-15 until it was home & the bolt locked, I got one reading. When I pushed the freebore tool into the chamber by hand, I got a different reading - shorter! I finally decided to try letting the bolt carrier slam forward normally. When I pulled back on the charging handle, the cartridge wouldn't eject. I had to use a cleaning rod to eject the tool.Perhaps this will work with a single shot bolt action rifle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im looking for a song they sang was friend of mine","review":"i AM LOOKING FOR THE NAME OF THE CD THAT THE TREBLE CHARGERS SANG THE SONG FRIEND OF MINE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Very Good","review":"I bought this book to help me with my Master of Engineering study in aerospace engineering.On each and every subject, the book jumps quickly into mathematical methods and derivation without sufficient physical or engineering description.It may be considered as a good reference for the formulae and equations for composites, but never a good book that explains or teaches the engineering or physical aspects of the mechanics of composites.It is a classical problem with engineering professors and authors who are more in the \\"calculus world\\" than the key engineering concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.

TRhe problemof the story is that the boy in the story named Mick has to build a monument for a city in Kansas,but everyonein the town has to like it. The main characters are Mick, Rachel, and Micks dog Rocky. The rising action is whern mick is getting to the deadline and he has to hurry up. the climax of the story is when problems arise and by the time they clear up the deadline is already there. They make it but they almost dont. The resolution is when all the people see the art and admire it. This connects to me because last year we had to draw pictures and the whole school had to like them. We made it in time and we got to have the joy that mick got in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book has little plot and is lacking substance. It is abouta pathetic young girl who's only friend is a dog. And if you think that'slame she meets a man by seeing him with his pants down so from then on in they become friends. Mick the artist with his pants down influences the main character to be an artist and the lameness begins!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to remember","review":"Although it is a simple story, it is probably my favorite Gary Paulsen book so far. It talks a lot about art, but the real point of the book is a minority, handicapped girl who learns how to see life in a new way and discovers that she has a talent of her own. Along with that is a town that comes together to make one decision that will help it heal and then grow together. This book is short and easy to read, but makes a lasting impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Monument By:Gary Paulsen","review":"This book is about a girl named Rachel Ellen Turner who was adopted by two alcoholic parents. They are loving though. They adopted her despite of her leg being stiff and her skin color being darker than their's. Rachel had no freinds at first, but then she met Python, a dog. They were inseparable.One day the town that she is living in, Bolton, Kansas, desides to have amonument put in the town in honor of the people who died in war from Bolton. The town hires a man named Mick to build the monument. Rachel and Python met Mick and they all became best friends. They would walk around and Mick would draw everything he saw. He ended up teaching Rachel some artistic pointers.I did not really care for this realistic fiction book. I thought it was boring. I think it could have been more interesting. I think elderly people would enjoy this book. I didn't like it because it wasn't action packed. It also didn't have anything to do with athletics. It just wasn't my type of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to teach?","review":"I am a junior in college, working for a degree in elementary and middle school education. I read this book for my \\"Teaching Young Adult Literature\\" class. The Monument is a great book for teachers to utilize in their classroom--especially if they would like to do a unit on books where the protagonist has a disability. Gary Paulsen does an excellent job of developing his charactrs, thus, creating empathy in his readers. I appreciate the advanced ideas he is able to portray to younger readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Monument","review":"The Monument takes place in Bolton, Kansas,where a young girl named Rocky struggles to fit in her new town.

Mick is a very artistic kid who was chosen to construct the town monument. Rocky and Mick become great friends, and they learn to respect each other.I thought this book could've been better written. It had a couple pages where it got my attention, but sometimes became dull.

When I got my newest rat, I ordered this book on-line with high hopes. After reading the book cover to cover I was bitterly disappointed to see that it had little information on how to train your rat to do anything interesting. This book covers every possible thing one could want to know about caring for pet rats, and for that it is a good book. But to be titled: Training Your Pet Rat, and then almost no info on training, well, I can not recommend this book to anyone interested in learning how to train you pet rat."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy only if you haven't trained any animals","review":"While it is a cute book, for anyone familiar with operant conditioning, this book is a disapointment. The care info and ideas on toys can be found in other books and on various internet sites. Probably the one thing that stood out was the clarity of the explanation of the differences between training males and females. There's very little meat on training actual exercises. The training ideas given are pretty standard. There's really nothing on working complex behaviors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged product","review":"I ordered Oneida Mooncrest service for 8 flatware as a gift for Christmas. The item arrived after the guaranteed next day deliver and was late for Christmas. The product arrived in an undamaged box. When the product was taken out of the box, over 50% of the utensils were scratched or nicked on the handles. Very disappointing and embarassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No nickel means likely to corrode.","review":"People need to learn what the 18/10, 18/8, and 18/0 stands for. The first number(18)stands for the chromium content and the second number (10,8,0) stands for the nickel content. Chromium keeps it from bending and the nickel keeps it from corroding. Therefore this product is likely to corrode after several runs through the dishwasher. Only get this set if you plan on immediately hand washing and drying after use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Surprise","review":"It was the other reviews that tipped me to purchase. Such a reasonable price...could there be some real quality for that price? YES! The positive reviewers were right. This stainless has a nice weight to it, easy to handle and a simple but beautiful look. Cleans up easily. After recieving the 45 pc set, I went ahead and ordered the 4 place setting set as well. Love it!Didn't give 5 stars only because we have been using the stainless for a short time (1 1/2 months)..so can't really speak to long term/durability...but looks/feels like a product that will wear well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time for company","review":"Overall nice and clean appearance. These are used as the everyday silverware and I have no problems with them. Silverware always looks great when it's new, but I don't know how they will hold up from long term use.

What a mistake. Within months we had rust spots showing up so I returned the spotted pieces. I ended up doing this several times. The entire set after just a couple of years looks worse than our old set (wish we had kept it). I learned from the customer rep at Oneida (very helpful and sympathetic) that the set which I have was made in Viet Nam. Sadly I think Oneida is marketing their products on their old reputation. Save your money. Try another brand or just buy something cheap, it can't be as bad as Oneida."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but need polishing after washing","review":"Very nice. Unfortunately, they have water spots on them after you take them out of the dishwasher.

Good weight with no sharp edges. The serving set was an unexpected bonus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and disappointing","review":"I was so excited to bring these home but after the first wash in the dishwasher there was rust! Amazing!!!! And it just grows and grows. At first it was the knives now more and more pieces are rusting. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUSTING WITHIN JUST ONE MONTH","review":"Bought in September 2011. Rusting by October 2011. Oneida needs to get its act together and bring production back to the U.S. They are ruining their formerly good reputation. I won't be buying (or trusting in) the Oneida name anymore after this. It's totally unacceptable and so hard on the planet to be making junk only to fill landfills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusting reviews are true - beware","review":"I LOVED this set. LOVED it....and used it for less than 3 weeks when I noticed that there were pits and rust stains all over many pieces. If it was one or two pieces, I could have lived with it and just ordered replacement pieces - but the entire set was rusting after a few weeks of very gentle use (just me and the hubby). Very sad but I have to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this item","review":"Hi all,I have purchased this item 6 months ago and I have just start using it.I have used it just couple of times (less than 10 times) and its color or finishing start fading!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the weight/qualit","review":"I like this item, but have mixed feelings on some of its features. I love the weight/quality and the fact that the design continues on the underside of the flatware. The pieces are longer than my old set and the salad forks are nearly as large as my old dinner forks."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH cheaper at Walmart!","review":"November 2012 -- I just purchased this exact set for $50 at Walmart, as opposed to $80 here.I've owned Oneida before -- it's always been a terrific product, so I'm giving it five stars, for now. However, this is 18-0 stainless, which is not as good as 18-8. Many reviewers say it corrodes, but others say it does not. It comes with a lifetime replacement warranty -- IF you have the receipt. I'm going to make a photocopy of the receipt (because store receipts fade after a couple of years) and keep it under the organizer tray. If it corrodes, I'll lower my rating, and Oneida will have to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mooncrest flatware","review":"Lovely, I needed to replace my old set of flatware because it marked my china with metallic stains. Stains that required a cleanser to remove. I've found that Mooncrest does not have this quality. The weight of the ware is excellent, I'm very pleased. I hope for more options of serving pieces and specialty items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honest warning.","review":"I am baffled and frustrated by all of the good reviews this flatware has received. Baffled because I received this set in early April and less than two months later the majority of the pieces have rust spots - which only continue to appear. Frustrated because I put stock in the positive comments, which ultimately led me to make the purchase. The flatware does look nice and it is sturdy and solid, but it rusts, which far outweighs any positive aspect. There is a reason the set is so cheap...it is cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of glaring reviews","review":"I bought this set based on the glaring reviews in here. As soon as I received I put them in the dishwasher. I guess that's all it took, but a few pieces were RUSTED when I was going to transfer them from the dishwasher to the silverware drawer. Obviously this might be a one-off production glitch; however, I'm simply amazed at the vast number of 5 star reviews. Of the pieces that didn't rust, about half lost their luster and polishing -- again after ONE wash. Five stars? Really? After all it clearly advertises it is DISHWASHER SAFE and STAINLESS STEEL, in my case I got none. Absolutely unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"It rusts, beware","review":"Followed directions, and it rusted after first trip through the dishwasher. Returned item.

After 1.5 years of very mild use, the left side stopped working. For a toaster of this price, I should be able to give it to my children when they leave for college. Ironically, their expensive espresso machine was buggy as well, so I'm really skeptical of the KitchenAid pro-line products now. Will look elsewhere, and recommend you do too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Toaster","review":"I bought a 4-slice Artisan toaster and half the slots failed just out of warranty and the plastic handles also shattered within six months of purchase.

The principles are shot to hell here. For example, you don't wail away and overpower your opponent with brute force, you feel your way over the bridge and strike efficiently. His movements are wasteful in the extreme, his stance and center of balance constantly leaving him wide open to a real wingchunner's strike. Whatever this guy is demonstrating, it is far closer to MMA than Wing Chun. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I didn't find this video helpful in any way. In fact, the video was more funny than useful.

As I watched this DVD, I could not help feel that I was being punked."},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"Particular\\" DVD Sucks!","review":"I was very hesitant to buy this DVD because the reviews were very mixed. The master has a very extensive youtube channel that is quite thorough so I figured that this DVD would be pretty good. As soon as I pushed play and heard the techno music I knew I was in for a treat! There are a lot of menu choices, but some of them are just highlights of the other chapters. And the practical fighting demonstrations sure do demonstrate the speed and effectiveness of his technique, maybe a little too speedy though. I was waiting for more of a break down of what he was demonstrating, but the only thing you get is to watch him kick the crap out of his student in a choreographed fight. Don't get me wrong, it looks awesome but I don't think it is really effective as a teaching method. I feel REALLY ripped off that I paid for this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wing chun a dynamic art with real results","review":"If there is any doubt in your mind that Wing Chun is the real thing ,it will be squashed in 30 seconds after watching this DvD. Master Wong is very fast and pulls no punches in this one. Letting the art speak for it's self. Takes extreme patience and practice to learn forms from a DvD ,but rewind and examine your technique over and over it is possible to get a vague understanding of the 3 basic forms shown. Which should leave you still breathing after your next encounter.Hands on approach with a certified instructor ofcourse is the only way to become proficient. But this DvD has beautiful examples of the Wing Chun science of fighting. A must have for any modern h-h combat trainee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good stuff !!!","review":"The video is well explained. Have very good lessons that anybody can follow.

I take \\"The Anna Nicole Show\\" as a religious experience, and this DVD is the church of it. People go on and on about this show, without realizing that \\"reality\\" has nothing to do with it. A lot of the gags are set up (as Anna Nicole states on the commentary)-- it's Hollywood baby...ain't nothing real. It's hard to review the show, if you didn't like it on TV you won't like it here.

She has a good heart, is a very good mother, and is great at being just what she is - herself. There is nothing quite as entertaining as watching Sugar Pie hump that panty-clad Teddy Bear.

Within a minute or so, he picked the book up and paged through it again. He was hooked!

The message of this book is simple. It is eloquent. It has power. I devoured it in under an hour and copied out key passages for my closest friend.

They eventually adopted nc-17 as the title of their first release. As is the case with most young indie artists, Treble Charger pays overt tribute to their influences on this disc. The opening track, \\"10th Grade Love,\\" with its discordant guitars and Greig Nori's nasal vocal delivery, borrows heavily from the Dinosaur Jr. songbook, while the ballad-y \\"Red\\" may just be the finest song Neil Young never wrote. Other tracks such as \\"Popcorn Chicken\\" and \\"Cubicle\\" recall the feedback-drenched, drone-rock innovations of Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine. Though Treble Charger never quite rises above the level of imitation on nc-17, the band does manage to produce a few of its own minor gems in the process. ~ Robert Kaups, All Music Guide---------============--------I TAKE NO CREDIT FOR THIS"},{"rating":"1","title":"ripped off","review":"the controller did not work. i contacted the seller and he said to return it for a refund. i never got the refund. he ripped me off. i do not know what to do to recover my money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Controller At First...","review":"When I first started using this controller, I thought it was good.

The vibration function is a really nice addition to the game. It may freak out a friend who's not expecting it (which is quite fun to watch) and adds a nice dimension to games that support it. The analog controls are great, especially for driving games. The more precise control keeps you from veering from side to side. The amount of buttons and fingers used may make people who aren't used to it uncomfortable, but that doesn't seem like it's going to change anytime soon.My only complaint is that this control isn't used enough. Very few games call for the right stick. The one that I know of is G-Police, and it really adds to the game.There's no reason to get a non-analog controller when you can get the analog.

It doesn't need batteries and it doesn't break as often as might be expected. The buttons are sturdy. However, for some old-school gamers the grips might seem somewhat small and the button scheme might seem a bit odd, but, hey, now there are three separate onscreen dimensions to handle! The vibration function is nice (because you can turn it off). This is pretty much the definitive first-party controller.

I'm an emulation gamer, and thanks to SmartJoy's USB adapter I can use a real PS1/PS2 gamepad with ZSNES and Bleem.My only gripes with the pad: A) The Start/Select buttons really should've been moved up after the addition of analog sticks. I'm always finding myself fumbling over the sticks trying to get to Start and Select. B) While the d-pad is very sturdy, it kills my thumbs after a couple hours of play.

I have used an assortment of electronic tuners over the past 15 years at twice the price and have always been disappointed by their performance. I gave this one a chance and was surprised at how stubbornly it locks on to the proper frequency of each note. Tuning up both guitar and my now set up mandolin takes less than thirty seconds each. As they are both acoustic instruments the tuner has no trouble reading their intonation from several feet away and continues to read well after instrument drops below my ability to hear it well. I don't have any amplified equipment so I cannot say how a line in system would work but this is far and away the best tuner I have ever used. It is very light and frail appearing but I have had no trouble in the few months that I have owned it with incidental damage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for my purpose","review":"The Korg CA-30 tuner was just what I wanted--a very basic but accurate tuner that is easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Portable Tuner","review":"This is an excellent portable tuner for most instruments. It's also Chromatic, meaning it has the whole 12 notes of the music scale, not just 1, like a tuning fork.It is very easy to use, just four buttons. Auto Off. You can calibrate the Frequencies to use (beginners needn't worry about this). It also produces tones of any note you desire, including sharps/flats. It has a built in Mic and auto-note recognition, or you can input an electric instrument into the side for tuning in noisy environments.The batteries (2 AAA) last forever.Quick and responsive LCD needle display, plus LED displays indicating Sharp or Flat.The only negatives are that it doesn't stand upright (a business card can be inserted into the back slot to make it stand upright). It is also possible to damage the LCD screen if dropped or stepped on, so take care of it.An incredible value for a very good price. Definitely a great gift for any musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for band!!","review":"I am a high school trombone player, I used one of these tuners for two years and it was terrific! The only downfall was that I had rented it from the school and had to give it back. Then I got a different tuner, one of those all in one deals, it never worked for me or anyone else who tried it. I recently ordered a Korg CA-30 tuner, it works amazingly, and is built strongly. A bargain for such a reliable tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"This Ready Bed was quite difficult to purchase, as it was unavailable or out of stock; when it was in stock, the estimated ship time exceeded a month from when the order was placed.

I have often argued long and loudly that this isn't any more true for the Ozrics than it is for any other prog/psych band. But on Arborescence, the last album by the original lineup, this generalization pretty much holds, as the band hit a creative wall, and the results aren't very pretty. The arrangements are often awkward, the performances tepid, the energy rather lacking, at least as compared to most of their other releases. If you are a first-time buyer I would recommend Erpland or one of the more recent albums (Curious Corn or Hidden Step for starters), as this album will (alas) confirm all the bad things you might have heard about the Ozrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading for Alec Guinness fans","review":"As a fan of Alec Guinness, it gave me additional insight to this great actor's life.

It is perfect for anyone studing dance history in general and is the best book I found for studying Ancient Greek dances. I would have given it 5 stars except that it does have a couple drawbacks. 1. No bibliography; so the sources she used to come to her conclusions in the book are hard to validate. 2. The book is written in a rather formal dry way. At times I found that my mind had wondered off(as usually happen when I read books witten in a fromal dry manner) and I had to re-read many of the pages.

Like the last guy said it's an expensive way to make a cup of coffee. It's a throwaway. So,this time I'll buy the west bend for 35 bucks and when it stops working I'll throw it away.

Not being a \\"blood and guts\\" or \\"looking over my shoulder\\" type of gal, I was amazed at the fact that I couldn't put it down. The way the characters were sketched out grabbed you from the beginning. When you finished the last page, you wanted to find the next book in the series immediately. You didn't want to let Quin and Mike go. This is a definite recommendation for those who love a good murder mystery.

Touch screen is very good also. The only thing makes this device less than perfect is the software. You can select maps from the software but selection is rectangular. Therefore it is usually impossibe to select town by town or state by state because none of the states are exactly rectaNGULAR SHAPE. But Magellan sends you free 256MB SD card preloaded with your region. May be Magellan should modify its software to take care of this problem. But anyway I got the SD card from Magellan for free after registration and I never need to deal with the loading maps or connecting to computer again.

Baime's irreverant yet brilliant biographies on the \\"men behind the booze\\" will both entertain and enlighten. I learned that Johnnie Walker really walked with the stick as shown on the label!

There are no revelations here."},{"rating":"2","title":"males and females, open your hearts and your senses to life","review":"I recently attended a storytelling evening given by the Marion Foundation with author Joan Anderson. I had no intention of purchasing Joan's book, but came away with such enthusiasm that I did indeed purchase her book, A Year by the Sea... When I opened the book a few days later, I devoted the entire day to completing it...I see this book as a wake up call to males and females to open your hearts and senses to life and its wonders. I could identify with Joan as she speaks about taking risks, laughing at oneself, really looking at nature and taking time for oneself! Life can be exciting and fulfilling when we take time to wonder at the world around us. These are the messages I came away with; I see her book not necessarily about her relationship with her husband, but with herself. I want to pass these messages along to my mother who needs to look around her at the wonders of life, to laugh, to take risks and to love herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader from Central PA","review":"Not usually a non-fiction reader, I was struck by the title and description at the book store, bought it, and couldn't put it down. It was amazing to identify with so many \\"after the children are raised\\" feelings as well as have my life long drawings to nature validated. Its been a very long time since I've been so mesmerized by an author, so immersed in her bravery to face new experiences and in awe of her ability to share her most intimate thoughts with others. I feel like I know her, but I want to know her more, much more. This book needs to be shared."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Poor poor pitiful me.\\"","review":"Whine whine whine. SNAP OUT OF IT! The *only* interesting characters in this self-absorbed and poorly-written retrospective are the seals and they had the good sense to be fleeting. Two Pity Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I read this for my book club and wouldn't have finished it otherwise. To help get myself through it I kept a pencil and underlined the most ridiculous metaphors or narcissistic passages. It's hard to pick the worst part but when she made snow angels at the beach when her estranged husband came for a visit is high up there. Give me a break!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Joan Anderson's Writing!","review":"I do not agree with any negative reviews of this book. It is a short, easy read and I feel that Joan has put into words what many of us woman feel, especially during mid-life. I often wonder when my children are grown, what my role will be. As my children now are in school full-time, I felt the need to find my role during the day after the toddler stage was over. I am enrolling full-time in school myself to finish my degree! I understand and greatly appreciate Joan putting these confusing feelings into a beautifully written book. It let me know that as my life evolves and changes, it is okay to be a bit confused and take a breather to figure it all out! We are not expected to always know all the answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I had high hopes for this book...but found it to be very blah blah blah....Sorry but I found it disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"A friend of mine loves this book and reads it again periodically so I looked for it at the library but it wasn't available - which should have been a clue - but I bought it. I was disappointed. It's an easy read but nothing ever happens. I expect her to have an affair or something but she spends a year analyzing herself and her life and then she gets back together with her husband. I felt it was anti-climactic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A year by the Sea","review":"A wonderful book that needs to be read by all women. Joan Anderson captures the truth that many women experiecne when their children have grown and leave home and they are left to continue their life with their husband. She experiecnes and has the courage to do what the rest of us only dream of. Great reading!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Although I appreciate the author's view that she, and all of us really, are \\"unfinished\\", I felt little connection with her. Of course, I am a different person ... single or rather longtime divorced with no children and have been able to focus on what I, as an individual, wants from life. I believe the book simply skimmed the surface of her life and, for me, had little depth. However, I understand why some women would find it appealing or possibly even inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and courageous; author regains identity & power","review":"Very interesting, especially for an older woman who has been married and had children, then finds herself completely devoid of personal identity and angry at everyone else because of it. I don't know if Joan Anderson qualifies as co-dependent in her marriage or not, but she has been the one taking care of everyone and everything and finally realizes how unfulfilled she is. I had a similar experience in my marriage. Didn't take a year by the sea to figure it out, just a pregnancy full of complications including a severe bout of depression -- try wrestling with that with an unsupportive, noncommunicative husband who thinks you will attend to everything just as his mother always did. As is the basis of this book, if/when you come out the other side and realize you can take care of yourself, financially and emotionally, then you have real strength and power. FYI - she swims with SEALS not dolphins (I think the seals deserve appropriate credit)."},{"rating":"1","title":"banal and trite","review":"I bought this book after reading a raving review and I was totally disappointed. The style is bland and common, the topic - finding and understanding oneself, which I believe is one of life most important feat - is treated in a shallow manner. In our day and age, I also found it difficult to relate to a fifties' American housewife type of issues. But, it could have all been bearable if the book had been well written. It isn't, and it never managed to stir a bit of passion, beauty or compassion. I was bored from beginning to end, and I only kept reading the book in hope that it might improve. There are many better books out there that deal with introspection, meaning of relationships, being oneself, or surrounding oneself in nature and discovering life."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAPTIVATING FROM THE FIRST PAGE","review":"This memoir was so beautifully done it simply captivates you from the first page. As you journey with Joan on her adventure of claiming self after years of being a \\"good woman\\" (i.e. being selfless, giving all of your best to everyone around you, ignoring your feelings to make sure others are having a good time, etc.)you find your heart opening. I am giving a copy of this book to all of those nurturing women in my life who tends to forget to nurture herself. Thank you Joan for sharing this LOVEly piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Self-indulgence","review":"In A Year by the Sea, Joan Anderson writes a shallow memoir lacking both style and complexity. In page after page of superficial metaphors that try too hard, she reveals little about who she is or how she has grown and changed during her \\"year off\\". Each day becomes more tedious than its predecessor. She hardly paints herself as an inspiration to the reader nor as a sympathetic character. After a three or four chapters it becomes almost embarrassing to read about an adult babbling on like an unfulfilled teenager. The only aspect of the book that seems to work is her attempt to keep hidden from the reader the reasons behind her resentment and anger toward her one dimensional husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Read by the Sea","review":"Reading this book is a lot like spending a weekend in a house by the sea with your best friend. Women at transitional times in their lives love this book, but women of all ages will benefit from reading about the author's journey. Share it with your daughters; pass it along to your best friend. Or buy them their own copies so you can keep yours and read it again whenever you feel at sea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book was a big disappointment -- filled with cliches and platitudes, and shallow \\"insights\\". Although I certainly never expected it to be another \\"The Outermost House\\" (HIGHLY recommended), I was expecting *some* depth, or at least detailed thoughtful observations. None to be found. The author has read \\"Women Who Run With The Wolves\\" but has obviously not digested it. Pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight and full of self indulgence.","review":"This book was shallow and the author was self-absorbed and self-indulgent. One can find fulfillment in life without running away from responsibilities. \\"no man is an island\\", etc. She makes it sound like raising a family was a horrid chore that excluded her! She only barely mentions her parents. She obviously didn't get along well with anyone, not husband, sons, parents, siblings.The opportunity to care for someone else is a gift. Too bad she misses out. Some people are just meant to be \\"alone by the sea\\", she is obviously one who does not benefit from relationships with others. I don't think she's a roll model for any woman unless you like to whine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have her problems?","review":"This is a woman who spends a lot of time -a year- obsessing over her problems and the changes she needs to make in her life. Her problems include having a patient husband, two successful children, a career, and a second home on Cape Cod. Obviously, I don't see any real problems here! However, there are insights that can be gained and shared by someone who spends a year by the sea, and I really tried to be open-minded. I know that time spent alone can be rejuvenating and time spent by the sea can be miraculous; but what we have here is time spent whining , and it is so tedious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan Anderson: The Wise Friend I've Been Waiting For","review":"I am fortunate to have plucked Joan Anderson's \\"A Year by the Sea\\" from the myriad of books in the \\"Women's Issues\\" section of a Milwaukee bookstore. I was on a cherished break from mothering two toddlers. I sat in a chair in the bookstore, began to read and two hours vanished. I completed the book at home, well into the night (giving up precious sleep). I have often wished and pleaded for a wise woman mentor to help me through the delicate and confusing issues of wifehood and womanhood. Where does the constant giving end? Where do I began? Joan became that woman mentor/friend through her book. I am eager to read it again and write down the wisdom she offers. Peace without answers, peace in not having answers...this is the greatest gift I have received from \\"A Year by the Sea\\". I am telling all of my female friends to read this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Puh-leeze!","review":"Maybe this woman should have tried living in a homeless shelter if she wanted to find her strength.I've met many courageous people who continue to serve others even while facing incredible obstacles. Living in a cottage by the sea while being supported by a husband (who, incidentally, was good enough to pay the bills yet not worthy of her companionship) is hardly a challenge, except to the husband.Most guys would have found a new girlfriend in about six weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent, self-pitying twaddle","review":"No doubt Joan Anderson was serious when she wrote this silly book about \\"discovering herself\\" but really, she is so smug and self-centered that her troubles are laughably trivial. I just hated the way she congratulated herself every few paragraphs for her fake humility or for some trite insight she had. She keeps telling us how \\"selfless\\" she is, but folks that's the lie of the century. This woman's ego is HUGE. It's all about poor, pitiful, martyred Joan and her 25 cent \\"insights.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps a year wasn't long enough","review":"The Kirkus review gets this book well. Joan Anderson comes off as a self-enthralled and rather preachy individual. Despite her complaints about lack of fulfillment she seems entirely too full of herself. The book wears thin, I expect the author would too.Unlike Doris Grumbach she is not someone I could imagine spending and enjoyable afternoon with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touched a Place in My Heart","review":"I loved this book. Joan's questions about her self-worth and place in the world touch upon questions that are present in many women's lives. Marriage often does not turn out to be the \\"soul mate\\" relationship the media sells. The question is, what then? Joan had the courage to ask, and answer that question through a period of introspection devoid of her customary support system. I found the book to be honest, compelling and thought provoking. I plan to read it again and was profoundly touched by her insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stay at home mom escapes to the Sea.","review":"I read this book almost a year ago and still remember the feelings of escape I experianced while reading about Joan. I became her in my own desire to escape to Cape Cod. It would be impossible for me to actually follow her actions at this time in my life having two small children, but at least I could experiance the desire to through the author. At least now I know A Year By the Sea is not implausible! Thank you Joan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I related to this book","review":"Finished this book in 3 days. Wondered if I'd like it or not after reading good and bad reviews about it. I really like it and found a lot of things she said really hit home. Will probably read it again and as someone said highlight the important parts. I felt like I was right there at the sea and sand etc. with her. Couldn't understand why her husband couldn't put the water heater on a charge card when she asked him for the money. It's not like she was asking for a luxury, it was a necessity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seals, simplicity and self-discovery","review":"In the first chapter she moves to Cape Cod and persuades a local fisherman to drop her off on an island filled with seals -- how could I NOT love this! It is a nicely written book about a woman who takes a year off from her marriage and moves into a beach house on Cape Cod. She was once a successful author of children's books but her collaborator has moved and she needs an income so takes a job in a fish store and takes up clamming.I have to say I really identified with a lot of her thinking even though our lives are very different. But her feelings about independence, attachment to family and its obligations, conflicted feelings about sex, are all things I've been thinking a lot, too. Some of her ruminations got a tad tedious but it was easy enough to skim those. Overall a very thoughtful, lovely and rather unusual book about being a woman \\"of a certain age.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"Joan Anderson needs to spend some time volunteering for people who have real problems. I read this trite book in two days because I kept hoping there would be something, anything, that I could find likable about this woman. It doesn't take \\"courage\\" to go to your beach cottage for a year. She is a pampered & priveleged upper class woman who has too much time on her hands. The one redeeming thing I can say is that it made me thankful for my working class Mother who met challenges with grace, strength and humor. She was always aware of our blessings...even when things seemed difficult. Creating a strong family, service to others, taking time off when you need it, perseverance...these are praise-worthy qualities. Joan spent a whole year at the sea and still doesn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect 'Companion' for my own journey","review":"At barely 41 and going through my own major upheaval of family and personal life, I happened upon this book in a quirky little tourist-trap town in Arizona. I was at the beginning of my own journey of transition and the reinvention of self. This book sat high in the upper corner of a bookcase nearly obscured by the larger, glitzy-er titles, but somehow it found it's way into my possesion.On more than one ocassion has this book brought tears to my eyes. Partly because of my empathy for Ms Anderson's accounts, and partly because they seemed to be ripped right from the pages of my own life's story.Her insight and wisdom are profound. She has much to say that needs to be heard. I would heartily recommend this book to all of my friends. It's become like a spiritual roadmap for me through the storms and challenges of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read if you're in transition","review":"Joan Anderson wrote this book to help herself out of a tough life transition.

I envy Joan for having had a year to be able to take this journey. Although I don't have a year to do it, I find that I need to take the same journey a little at a time each day -- I try to get away from everything to just sit and contemplate whether it be 5 minutes or 5 hours.

Her attempts to \\"find\\" herself, such as frolicking with seals, taking a job in a fish shop, and befriending another self-obsessed older woman, are stereotypical \\"enlightening\\" activities -- in other words, the so-called talented writer can't rise above the pedantic.

Once, only the imperial elite could enjoy it. Now, everyone can. Celestial Seasonings' Imperial White Tea, with a peach flavor, is now delicious drinking tea for everyone. It's fruity enough to be iced tea in the summer, and it makes a calming hot drink in the winter. In a sense, it is like the Spring and Autumn period. The fruit flavor is delicate but not overpowering and sickly sweet. There are hints of peach. The white tea makes it especially delicate and refined. One can sit back, drinking this and watchingThe Last Emperorand listening toChina: A Romantic Journey. It's THAT relaxing and soothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is delicious tea.","review":"My gf found that the antioxidant value of white tea is higher than green tea.

Because they operate for profit, that's the argument. Yet, Mcquaig also does not have much respect for government, unless, the government does what she wants it to do. Indeed, when reading this or any other McQuaig book on must ask: why does she still have faith in government? By asking this question one can come to only one conclusion: McQuaig is just as selfish as anybody else in the world (ie. she wants to the world to run according to her rules).

It is easily chipped on the exterior and the specialized lining on the interior is not worth the \\"hype\\" since the metal underneath is already exposed and rusting. I found the wire basket--which is included with it--unable to hold wide mouth quarts.

Only a couple games u have to spin your gameboy all around, but over all it has great gameplay. Also, the games are not just spinning your GBA, it consists of spin, spin+A, and just A games. I enjoy the fact that there are more \\"games\\" in Twisted (\\"Games meaning things like paper airplane (not in twisted)). There are even random things such as pianos that you can play, and figures you can move, and records you can listen to, and stuff like that.

The Kona tablets are pretty good - the cola flavor is mild but authentic, and it has just a bit of sweetness. It's also one of two Nuun tabs that have caffeine, the other being an Arnold Palmer flavor that I have not had, but have read is not as good. The 20mg of caffeine is not a lot (according to the Mayo Clinic's website, an 8 oz serving of coffee is 100-200mg), but that little bit of boost can help with a long workout.The cola flavor DOES turn your drink light brown. It also, for whatever reason, takes a LOT longer to dissolve than other flavors. I've tested this side by side: lame for sure, but wanted to be sure I wasn't crazy.Top flavors of Nuun are Strawberry Lemonade and Triberry. I'd call this a Tier 2 flavor.

It is a very interesting look at how the laws of physics come together to make for an interesting world, peopled by interesting folk. It is a HUGE, squat world that is spinning very rapidly. Therefore, the sensation of gravity is much, much greater at the poles that at the equator. Heavy gravity poses all sorts of interesting predicaments. It is set in the distant future but written in the 50's; it's fun to see how anachronisms sneak in completely unaware to the author (e.g. the scientists whip out their slide rules when some quick calculating is needed). This is a \\"must read\\" classic of science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Dorsey home run!","review":"Whenever I want a light, humorous read I know I can turn to Tim Dorsey and not be disappointed. Once again, Serge Storms has left me laughing out loud as he goes all over Miami in search of clues to his grandfather's death and a small fortune in stolen diamonds. Good buddy Lenny is along for the ride as well and provides some of the best dialogue--he and Serge really are a comedy twosome on par with anyone.This book has kidnapping, mob violence, shot-up limos, stake-outs, the FBI, the CIA, loads of Cuban exiles, a plot to re-take Cuba from Castro, deadly energy drinks, a homicidal microwave, more Miami trivia than you might ever care to know and lots of flashbacks to the 60's when Serge was a small child and in the care of his grandfather (you'll quickly see why Serge is the way he is).Another home run by Dorsey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is something to be said for escaping reality, ya know.","review":"So, it's over the top, outrageous, ridiculous even.

It's not cartoon-y, more of a futuristic Keystone cops on bad dope, perhaps?Anyway, the Florida historical information is rich and believable and Dorsey includes enough truth in his work to make you think maybe the Sunshine state residents are sniffing the Coppertone a bit too enthusiastically.If you need an escape and can't afford a plane ticket or the time to get away, try this book (or any of the other Dorsey novels) and you'll emerge refreshed and perhaps a bit stunned, but you'll know you've been somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Hiaasen","review":"Sorry, but I couldn't read this guy.

Instead, the author interviews the religious leaders then stabs them in the back by defamating them. Take the Anton LaVey article, for example. The author claims LaVey's name was fake, he was not born where he claimed, he never met Marilyn Monroe, he never slept with Jayne Mansfield, etc. Yet he provides absolutley no evidence of this. Just word of mouth. Yet to this day many people believe Mr. LaVey did indeed live a lie. It's interesting that most people who read the article never question this.Mr. Wright is no better than the people he supposedly exposes, and is at least as hypocritical. His lack of evidence severely taints his credibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"No saccharine ending","review":"Lots of people say that The Baby-Sitters Club books have saccharine, happy endings, and this is usually true. Sometimes the ending is good only because the girls live in a happy little world where everything turns out all right, but this book is an exception. There is a happy ending, but you don't know whether things turn out all right. The story ends with Stacey making up her mind and sending a letter to Laine, not with the two of them making up, not even with breaking up and Stacey being content with Claudia (her Connecticut best friend). Sending the letter makes her feel good, but it doesn't have anything to do with luck, almost as if it weren't in a BSC book. Maybe more of these books should end like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This has long been my favorite work by Goethe. It is very readable, which most people don't expect from Goethe, connecting him to his poetry and to Faust, etc. But the book reveals so much about him (the reader gets a sense that the man knows he will be evaluated by people hundreds of years hence) and it also leaves so much to the imagination.

I always order 6 boxes...my family and friends love it also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasteless and bland...meh.","review":"I bought this based on it's many good reviews since I've tried and enjoyed many rooibos teas. To my dismay, other reviewers tastes and mine do _not_ agree. I found this tea to be almost tastless, no real vanilla flavor that I can discern. I even tried using two bags and it didn't help.Adding milk and sugar just made for a mug of sweet-tasting slightly tea-flavored hot water...quite unappealing. Like another reviewer, I also noticed the slight \\"good tobacco\\" odor when I opened the box, very weird for a tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madagascar tea","review":"This tea has a smooth flavor. It is nice to have any time of year. Not a strong flavor but is flavorful."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS TEA!!","review":"I found this tea in a local supermarket once and loved it...but couldn't find it again until I saw it here.

I can recommended this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm one of the few that don't care for this tea","review":"After reading the review by \\"That Chatty Gal\\" I have to agree with her. I really wanted to like this tea. What's better than Madagascar Vanilla and Tea? I love both so this seemed like a wonderful choice. Unfortunately for me, the tea smelled like tobacco (good tobacco if that matters!) but had a syrupy sweet taste and no real depth of flavor. I also tried it with soymilk, honey, sugar, milk, and both cold and iced. Still, I was unable to even drink one cup because I just didn't find this to be a pleasant experience. I used about half of the box trying to make it work, but it didn't.On the other hand, my children really enjoy this tea so I think this is one of the teas that you either love or hate. As for me, I'll stick with Celestial Seasonings Chai teas if I'm in the mood for a sweet tea with milk and sugar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Tried rooibos tea recently and loved it. Nearly drank my parents' entire supply while I was visiting over the holidays (sorry mom and dad)! So far locally this Madagascar Vanilla Red is the only rooibos tea I could find. Well I'm sorry to say I'll have to keep looking. I'm even sorrier I bought two boxes. Not only is there no rooibos taste, there is no vanilla taste, and in fact not much of a taste at all. Celestial Seasonings is my brand of choice, but they have disappointed here."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I imagine dishwater tastes like...","review":"I love tea. I was so excited to try this, because of health benefits, as well as the supposedly delicious taste. I bought the whole case with the intention of enjoying some myself and giving some as presents. The reviews were so positive, and I thought the vanilla would have to make it wonderful no matter what. But, I was wrong. To my taste, this tea is awful. It's nearly tasteless (which I do not consider a benefit in tea), but what I did taste wasn't very nice. After one cup, I threw away the box I'd opened and put the unopened boxes where people could take them if they wanted. I wouldn't have given it to anyone as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOKS STRONG TASTE LIKE VANILLA WATER","review":"I TRIED THE RED BUSH POMENGRANITE AND IT WAS QUITE AWESOME. FULL OF FLAVOR BUT NOT THIS TEA I HAVE PUT TWO BAGS AND LET IT SIT FOR 20 MINUTES AND IT STILL LACKS TASTE ON THE FRONT END. YOU CATCH THE VANILLA ON THE BACK AND IT IS VERY SUBTLE TO THE POINT OF WHERE IS THE TASTE? I AM DRINKING IT AS I WRITE THIS AND STILL FIND THAT RED BUSH TEA HAS VERY LITTLE REAL FLAVOR. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE USED TO BLACK TEA OR EXPRESSO IT WOULD BE A JOKE. I ONLY DRINK HERBAL TEAS BUT I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TRY ANY OTHER FLAVOR. THE BENGAL SPICE AND POMEGRANITE ARE EXCELLENT. I HAVE TO DESCRIBE THE TASTE IS SORT OF A LIGHT TOBACCO TASTE(NOT A SMOKER)WITH VERY MILD VANILLA AND LACKLUSTER FLAT TASTE(PLAIN OR WATER DOWNED) BASE EVEN THOUGH THE COLOR IS DEEP RICH AND RED. I LIKE THE HEALTH BENEFITS AND WILL KEEP BUYING RED BUSH BUT NOT THIS FLAVOR."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thank you","review":"I love tea, drink A LOT of it, and just really cannot stand this Vanilla Red tea. It has a soapy or waxy component to the taste for me. Perhaps it's the flavoring or perhaps it's the red tea, but I cannot tolerate the tea at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll get the wrong flavor","review":"Don't trust these people to be competent enough to deliver the flavor tea you ordered. They sent me the wrong flavor. Screw them if they can't do something that simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful tea","review":"I originally bought a box on clearance at the local drugstore. So glad I did!It's a nice mellow tea, lightly fragrant with vanilla. I leave the teabag in as long as I can for the robust flavor. Not citrusy, so I can add milk. It's perfect for the fall/winter season. And I like getting the antioxidants as well.Don't know why it's not in the stores anymore (at least not here on the west coast), but I'm happy to have found it here on amazon, it actually works out cheaper with a subscription than if I did buy it in the stores anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly!","review":"The Madagascar Vanilla in this tea is phenomenal! The smell and taste are excellent! Especially so, if you're one trying to stay away from sweets--this hits the spot!

They're perfect for his BDUs."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish this book","review":"After about 75 pages into this book, I was done. I've decided I'm not a fan of lyrical writing or short stories with no clear connection or flow between the chapters. Too disjoint for me, and some of the characters were too bizarre for me. This is my first attempt to read this author's work: I would be hesitant to try any of her other novels. This will go in the \\"donate\\" pile for my local used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't rate it....","review":"I never got this text! I ordered four books, this one has yet to be delivered to me. I have sent emails to the seller and have never gotten a response, same thing when I emailed Amazon.

After I received it I realized that I had read it yrears back and that is about all that I remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"wake up America!","review":"The dilemma of the colonized in search for an identity which is neither static and backward-facing, nor imposed by the worldview of the colonizer is the subject of Erdrich's Love Medicine. Her winding, free-flowing storyline mirrors her endorsement of the fluidity of family connections, one of the most significant difference between Euro-American and Ojibwa cultures. Defying the strictures of the novel, the anthology, or any other established writing style, Erdrich refuses to abide by the rules of Western traditions of fiction. A slap in the face to any notions of the superiority of such traditions, Erdrich's tales demand attention by being undeniably honest, and evoking empathy for even those characters who represent everything which is in opposition to Western culture, and zeroing in on the painful truths of America's imperialist history without subjecting the reader to a history lesson. One of the most important books on the Native American experience I've ever encountered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I gave this book my best shot. I wanted to like it but it was too disjointed and abstract for me. I don't mind a story that goes back and forth as long as I know which direction I am going in. It is almost impossible to tell in this book. I also like positive and hopeful messages, not dismal ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"love medicine","review":"Book had no markings inside but had minor X on outside indicating its used status.

It reads like interlaced short stories. Two Native American families: Kashpaws and Nanapush. Lazarres and Morrissey French blood mixed in. The characters are exquisitely drawn. The story is tragic, bewildering, full of hate, overarched with love. This book will make you anxious, scared, sad and guilty. You'll be rooting for these people. The writing is surreal, sorcery, naked truth, poetry. What a book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great story","review":"Love Louise Erdrich stories. Have read every one she wrote. Love Medicine is so funny in parts that I hurt my sides laughing, then found myself in tears in the next chapter. Erdrich paints the lifestyle of the American Indian in terms that bring their culture and lifestyle into focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tendentious Agitprop","review":"The acting is strong, the plot is initially intriguing, and it's enjoyable for about the first hour. But then it descends into cliches -- upright workers who care about craftsmanship and their fellow man, heartless management without values whose greatest pleasure is eliminating jobs -- and the plot becomes schematic and hard to fathom. There's one black in the factory, and it's of course him that befriends the oh-so-earnest lead character, as if blackness confers moral superiority. You know where we're headed, and it isn't a Tea Party convention.With an RT rating of 97, most viewers will undoubtedly enjoy the film. But there's probably 20% like me who will intensely dislike its jejune politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Flately is not Irish step dance","review":"As an Irish step dancer who is always trying to set the record straight about what exactly we do, this movie is really frustrating. Riverdance, and even the first Lord of the Dance, were much better representations of Irish step dance. This \\"Gold\\" is not. ... Michael Flately *used* to be the best we had to offer.... To any serious Irish dancer, he's a joke. Yes, he's brought Irish step dance to the forefront, but most of what he does personally is a combination of many different styles. At least in Riverdance, he kept to mainly Irish choreography. Movies like this give such a wrong impression to anybody who is not personally involved with Irish dance. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Flatley: Gold","review":"I found this DVD to be extremely entertaining, if not a bit long. (2hrs, 10 mins.) The only concern I have is that though the film is not rated, some parents might find a couple of the scenes objectionable for viewing for young children. I saw the Feet of Flames World Tour live here in L.A. when it came through. Personally it was very enjoyable, but I was downright embarrassed in the Stolen Kiss scene when Flatley stripped that girl and she jumped on him. It reminded me a bit of some trashy Vegas show, complete with seductive guitar riffs. There were YOUNG children in that audience!Yes, Flatley is a genius, and as an Irish dancer I am in awe of what he has done for my sport, but I felt he could have left his midlife crisis out of an otherwise wholesome performance. If as a parent you are concerned about what your child will be watching, I would recommend watching the DVD first or skipping tracks. Otherwise, Gold is a rare treat that can't be passed up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it ship......","review":"I'd like to actually write a review about the book but, it takes 3 months to ship the book.

As a writer with some experience in aviation history as applied to women, I realize both the process her actual words went through to get on the page and the fact that her husband had a great deal of impact on the outcome of her last book. Still, \\"Last Flight\\" is in keeping with material published before her death, when she did have more control over the process. \\"Last Flight\\" gives each one of us the opportunity to make our own decision about her life and her end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it","review":"This is almost entirely in A.E.'s own words. I did not realize until I read this book what a terrific writer she was in addition to being a pioneer aviatrix. It is a wonderful account of the history of her experiences as well as a display of who she was personally. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading memoirs, autobiographies, or reading about history, aviation or engineering, or has an interest in women's studies. It is well worth the money spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Hummel Does It Again","review":"Chicago Blues has for many years been absolutely done to death by white Blues enthusiasts. At this stage of the game I wouldn't be suprised if there are more white guys playing the Blues than there are black guys. As a result, you have to be pretty damned good to stand out among the crowd.Mark Hummel does exactly that with this latest CD. Playing out of California since the 1970's, Hummel shows that he has learned his chops from listening to the masters and isn't scared to surround himself with musicians of a high enough caliber that makes him sound even better. There is a hard edge to the songs on this album that harken back to the Southside Blues clubs that I love visit from time to time. Hummel's harmonica playing is reminiscent of Junior Wells on a good night.If you're a fan of Chicago-styled amplified Blues harmonica, I definitely recommend that you give this CD a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Leonard Griffith is a very good christian theologian and i strongly recommened this and other books by him for anyone interested in christianity."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was very informative.","review":"I chose this rating because the book was helpful and informative.

It took ALOT of nerve for him to actually publish this silliness. HALLOWEEN LIVES !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not informative on facts on Halloween","review":"I would not reccomend this book on Halloween and related elements because of the author's evangelical/fundamentalist Christian bias. What little factual information is presented is done so in a sloppy, haphazard way and he has many factual errors, particularly in the section on symbols.The author advises \\"Christian\\" parents to use \\" alternatives\\" to our culture's celebration of Halloween that, while good, are a poor and pathetic imitation. He even suggests bobbing for potatoes instead of apples. Once again the horrendous mistake of calling the peace symbol the \\"Cross of Nero\\" when it is in fact a semiphone for \\" total nuclear disarmanent\\" by Bertrand Russell.Areas covered are pathetically light and he makes claims he does not support with factual documentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?","review":"Wow. Christians stole another holiday and still don't know what to do with it. Maybe they should pray for my sins on Samhain(Halloween)."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero is a better rating","review":"this book is more evil than what it is degrading. the ideas are ludicrous and very much like reading a nazi hate manual. halloween is important because it is good for children to socialize and have fun with other children. let's face the facts, the babble...i mean bible does not say anything against the holiday and people who act on their own accord are against the bible's origional teachings, such as \\"Judge not, lest ye be judged\\".

It contains every notable piece of music from the film, including the amazing casino title sequence and the Hong Kong docks motorcycle chase. Not to mention the sounds of perhaps the finest martial arts fight ever put on film: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.While this 1991 CD is sadly out-of-print, replaced by the incomplete 2003 or 2004 French releases (both paired with the score from Night Games), it is a gem worth purusing. The only problem is the disc must be handled quite carefully, since it comes in a miniature LP sleeve.Chinese music lovers should note that the CD also contains two rare songs by Roman Tam.Hopefully, this will be re-released soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"The movie was good, but the soundtrack stinks.

A little girl in a foster home finds out that family isn't necessarily your birth parents. She finds friendship in nurturing a rabbit, probably because she missed the nuturing from her own birth mother.I only gave it 4 stars because they pick the rabbits up by their scruff every time they handle one.

They are an exotic and this needs to be done before you take on a pet any pet.Like other people a passion sparks the collections. If one likes cats you sometimes collect cat items. My passion is rabbits. I collect rabbit things...like movies. The Christmas Bunny is a good story. I see some flaws...a few things I resent. First the make someone who loves rabbits appear to be a freak or a crazy rabbit person. That is not true. I also see that the boy characters in the movie do something that compromises the safety of the rabbit...AND they are not punished for it or even put straight on what they did and why it was wrong.Overall a good story and a must have for the rabbit caregiver to own for fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traduttore traditore","review":"I don't read German, but I do read poetry, often in translation.

These translators are not translator; they are editors with a strong bias and specific agenda. If you are interested in reading Rilke for what he actually was, I would look into another translation. GREATLY disappointed with this edition. Rilke is one of my favorite poets and I wish I had never bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This work is the result of two poet/translators wanting to ride Rilke's coattails. Read the other one- and two-star reviews. They are more insightful that the gushy five-stars and more accurate. I am adding my 2 cents just to echo their thoughts. This book was disappointing after reading other. more credible translations of Rilke."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to trivialize and impoverish Rilke","review":"I love Rilke, but this book has little to do with him. It is, rather, an exercise in how to trivialize and flatten a great poet. It does not even merit the title of \\"translation,\\" since the authors freely modify Rilke's rich imagery, metaphors, and phrases, and replace them with simplified formulas. Occasionally they even omit entire parts from a given poem, under the pretext that these parts are not good enough!! What a violent pretentiousness in relation to one of the greatest poets of the 20th century.For those who want to read Rilke, I strongly advise not to bother with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"I first read this book as I was going through a major depression. I pretty much stopped going to all of my classes and instead started reading a \\"great\\" or inspiring book every day [I went through the dhammapada, the bhagavad-gita, fear and trembling, etc.]. By far, this book was the best I read.I was a little hesitant about these translators -- seeing as Mitchel is really the authority on Rilke... but I think they did a fantastic job. It's a bilingual text, which is always a bonus for translations.My favorite lines were: \\"Each thing // each stone, blossom, child // is held in place.// Only we, in our arrogance, // push out beyond what we belong to // for some empty freedom.\\" I was reading a lot of existentialism at the time, and Rilke just resonated with me so much more than Sartre. His god was the god of darkness... a god I could relate to and believe in, at least in the Nietzschean or Hegelian way.Reading Rilke has totally changed my life. I hope he does the same for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure to seriously TRY to translate, really...","review":"Weak and floppy translations. For people who want poetry--and probably everything in life--to be easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like the translation","review":"Rilke is my favorite poet, but this translation does not do justice to him. I think it is very unfair for modern translators to assume that a contemporary reader would find meter and rhyme \\"too singsong to convey accurately the seriousness of Rilke's meaning\\" (quote from the translators' \\"Notes on the Translation\\"). Rilke's subject matter and ideas are captivating on their merit alone, but one cannot separate meaning from style in poetry. I believe that to change Rilke's style in a translation is to depart completely from what he felt about his own work, and to drastically weaken what gives his poems their power. Therefore, I prefer the work of stricter translators of Rilke's poetry, such as C. F. MacIntyre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irish Jersey Girl Reading Rilke","review":"I read poetry in different voices in my head. I hear the best poetry in the Irish brogue of my Grandmother.

This condition was not as originally advertised, and did not occur after the package was sent, as evidenced by the inpeccable condition of the package exterior. I was saddened to see scripture in such condition but will keep it as I feel that my faith and love for it will heal it. It is disgraceful first that this book was damaged in such a way and second that it was sold under false claims.

This CD is definitely for those people who want some soft music with a powerful voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"His weakest CD but his voice saves it","review":"On Love & Consequences, Gerald LeVert makes a few overtures to hip-hop, but he remains, in his heart, a sensitive loverman -- which is both a good and bad thing. LeVert is a powerful, soulful vocalist who can deliver love ballads as well as any of his contemporaries, but he doesn't always exhibit much musical imagination. \\"No Sense\\" may have cameos from rappers Layzie Bone and Ken Dawg, and \\"That's the Way I Feel About You\\" is a duet with Mary J. Blige, but they only illustrate that LeVert is from the old school and doesn't really have the desire to bring his music into the present. Which means, of course, that Love & Consequences isn't much different than any other LeVert album from the '90s -- it has a slight modern sheen, but it's a quiet storm album at its heart. It doesn't offer any surprises, but LeVert is a professional -- and that means there are enough solid songs here to make it enjoyable, but not quite enough to make the entire album memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerald Levert is the greatest male soloist of all time!","review":"When I play this CD, I feel like Gerald is singing every song just for me.

It is Levert's life's testimony set to song. He's definitely been there and done that. As usual he knows what to say and how to convey. No one address these consequences of love quite like him. \\"What About Me\\", is a track to die for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful photography; Well constructed basic overview.","review":"Contains information on lifestyle, structure, anatomy, senses, and snake locomotion. Most of the book provides a basic overview of several groups of snake (e.g. elapidae, boas, sunbeam snakes, vipers, etc.). Brief descriptions of each family are provided along with some specific details on a few individual species. The wonderful photos are included throughout the book. The \\"did you know\\" type boxes, found in each section, were of particular interest. This book neither intended as a species guide for snake identification nor for regional identification. However, it is well worth the price. Overall, well written & full of interesting facts + excellent photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition of the soundtrack should be avoided!","review":"If you are seeking this soundtrack, the best possible version can be found on iTunes. It's done by the great artist, Peter Thomas and his Sound Orchestra.

I've long loved the music of this film and I cannot stress how poor the import version above is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belushi?...by Woodward?...","review":"I read this book soon after it was published, mainly out of curiosity. Having come from the same town in Illinois, Woodward paints a fascinating and tragic portrait of the SNL funnyman. His rise and fall is the stuff of Hollywood legend and this book covers his childhood, professional life, relationships, and death by heroin overdose, despite the efforts of friends and loved ones to intervene. An interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The life and death of Bluto","review":"Bob Woodward's account of the life of John Belushi is an excellent piece of journalism in that it is a quite believable story that is vivid in the telling. Unfortunately, it ultimate is pretty depressing. That an intelligent guy like Belushi could fail to see where he was headed and waste his tremendous talent is good lesson about the hazards of fame. \\"Live fast die young and leave a good looking corpse,\\" so the quote goes. Belushi wasn't the first or last show-biz star to live his life by that mantra. And his story is probably fairly representative of stars from Jim Morrison to River Phoenix.One note: the book \\"Wired\\" is far, far superior to the travesty of a movie it later became."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for the price paid","review":"Great book...wanted to read it for a while. Nice price and good quality from the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic and biased.","review":"This book only shows the dark side of John Belushi. A good alternative to this book is SAMURAI WINDOW by John's widow, someone who actually KNEW Belushi, not a journalist such as Mr. Woodward. Woodward saw Belushi only as a get drunk do drugs sort of guy, but he had a very soft and tender side to him that only his true friends and family could tell about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sad Story","review":"John Belushi was a funny man but his story was not very funny. Bob Woodward does an incredible job of dredging up Belushi's life from a scared high school kid trying out for a play in Chicago to his coughing fit right before he died. It seems Woodward only focuses on the negatives in the book, but John Belushi's life was too short to have too many ultimite highs. SNL was a huge hit, so was Animal House, and so were the Blues Brothers. Belushi barely made 5 million dollars in his life and he spent that quickly on cocaine. He loved life so much, he never wanted to sleep. Woodward details all of it, in gut-wrenching detail. At times, Belushi's behavior gets redundant and Woodward's journalistic style gets a tad boring, but it is a good, quick read. If you can find the book and you were ever mesmerized by one of Belushi's characters, this book is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't feel this book was well written.","review":"I thought John Belushi was an extremely talented performer. I read \\"Samurai Widow\\" and enjoyed it. I also read \\"All the President's Men\\" by Bob Woodward and thought it was very thought provoking. So I looked forward to \\"Wired\\". I was very disappointed, both at Mr. Woodward's choppy and chaotic style of writing, and at the very negative image it portrayed without showing any of Belushi's talent. I got about halfway through the book and decided that it wasn't worth finishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money!","review":"there is a reason why Judy and the Belushi family have shunned this author and this book. this is not a true reflection of what John is and as a lifelong fan of John (and James) I will not read this and I suggest you stay away.

We have wood floors and she is able to follow our dogs all around the house. I truly believe she LOVES being mobile. The only thing about this walker I would change are the toys that come with it. I immediately trook them off because they are seriously lacking. It is very difficult to get them to make noise and on one setting (when they are supposed to make the animal noises) the elephant actually sounds like a little kid humming a tune. It's very odd. I put her own toys on the tray and she seems perfectly happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for use on carpet","review":"Well my daughter didn't get much use out of this because it was hard to roll on carpet. While it was a cute walker and easy to assemble I found it to be very bulky and hard for her to use. My daughter did enjoy the toys and the animal sounds/songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Walker!","review":"This walker is great. I bought it for my daughter when she was 8 months old, a little older than most people do, but she loved it. Once she got the hang of it she was scooting across the house super fast. Some of the other reviewers stated that it was hard for their babies to move on the carpet but she never had any problems, even going from carpet to lenoleum. The only thing I did not really care for was the tray of toys, she never really used it, and it did not really work that great. The stops worked great the were really sturdy and once locked in they did not move. Also I bought it because it did not fold down, I never trusted the style that folded so this one was perfect because it locks in at 3 leaves. I would definately recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly Awesome!","review":"I bought this walker for my 9 month old son - after reading it's reviews, i was impressed by all the positive reviews, and more importantly, that it rolled well on carpet and tile..All those reviews were right on! We live in a house, in germany, where everything is tiled - and we have an area rug on the floor of the living room - this walker is awesome on both. My son is a speed demon, and loves to chase the dogs around - they all get their workouts!I can't recomment this walker highly enough - we did super saver, and got free shipping to our APO address (which doesn't work for everything...) and within one week, the walker was here. Putting it together was so easy and while the toys are nothing particularly special, my son still loves playing with them - this holds his attention for about half an hour at a time, which is a MIRACLE, and a gift when i am trying to cook dinner!It might not be the coolest walker out there, but it is awesome in it's own functionality - A+++"},{"rating":"2","title":"happy mom & grandma","review":"This mobile entertainer is great.

It is a great and I would recoment it, \\"HIGHLY\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right","review":"This book really helps with the special needs of a Himalayan kitty. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"I wanted to like this movie, but the main character Channing Tatum, seemed more like a dopey kid with a big neck than a Roman commander."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I could write a 10 page review however, I actually have a life. I am a big fan of this genre, thus why the disappointment is even greater. The main actor CAN NOT carry the role. He did not make me believe he was a strong character. The acting was poor and the dialogue even worst. I guess anyone with a camcorder and a mediocre actor can make a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Movies with gladiator fighting always mean a lot of cool action. This movie was not exception. It was full of Roman myth and interesting plot line when it came to the fiction part. The acting was superb. As usual Jamie Bell was on top of his game and did not disappoint. Channing Tatum played a good leader fallen from glory. And it was cool to see Donald Sutherland in this movie. I give it top marks."},{"rating":"2","title":"One I know my movie group will enjoy","review":"This is a Roman epic which should appeal especially to those who enjoyed GLADIATOR and the like. The story is that of a Roman soldier and his Breton slave on a quest to find and return a golden eagle which disappeared with an entire legion of Roman soldiers. There's enough action here to satisfy action fans, but there's also a strong theme of bonding between to men who would ordinarily be enemies. The disc includes, as a bonus feature, an alternate ending which is well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!!!","review":"Just watch it and you will give it 5 star rating.......movie is outstanding......have you on the edge of your seat......."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable movie experience","review":"I enjoyed this film very much, being an ancient history and military history buff. I thought Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell were perfect for their roles, and brought the movie to life. I was impressed that everyone was believably shown to have both light and dark in their natures; neither the Romans nor the Britons were absolute heroes, nor were they total beasts - brutality, honor, callousness, piety, devotion to family and devotion to friends were all present in all the characters. Definitely worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"I didn't read the book... I thought this movie could have been better if they casted more credible actors. I hate watching movies or shows which are supposed to be during a certain time and the details are incorrect. Some reviewers compared this movie to Braveheart... that is unacceptable. The attention to detail and casting for Braveheart is not comparable to this film. I do not dislike any of the actors but I think this story would have made more sense if the actors at least spoke the dialogue of the time period they are attempting to portray. At one point during the movie a native american (sounding) score was played which reminded me of a cherokee chant.Also the angles were adjusted to excessively minimize the costs of production. It was no fun to watch since the camera tended to cut away when someone would get injured in the fighting scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not faithful to the book, so don't expect much!","review":"I read the book and two days later watched the movie, expecting to see how the movie dealt with the freeing of Esca and Marcus' friendship and treatment of him as an equal(it doesn't, and he's only freed at the end); how they would portray Marcus' friendship with the young girl, Cottia, which in the book almost came across as indecent due to the age discrepancy (she isn't in the movie, aside from possibly being in the crowd in the gladiator scenes); The tame wolf-cub (didn't see him); Marcus' deceit in acting as a Northerner and speaking their language (this is avoided); The burying of the Eagle (The 9th is reformed in the movie, which is silly.)Had I not read the book first, maybe I'd have given this 3 stars, but seeing how the story was changed for the worse in my opinion, I can only give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Waste of $$","review":"If your looking for an epic Roman movie..this is not it!!!..keep looking. dont waste your time or money.

He needs to just pose for underwear print ads and leave the acting to people like Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, Jude Law, etc. etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Adventure Movie","review":"to be brief and to the point, saving the historical backdrop for other reviewers: this was a good adventure historical flick that was well-cast. Despite the general criticism of Channing Tatum, he was perfect for this part: regal and smoldering. And Jamie Bell was an apt companion - I KNEW I recognized him...just didn't realize he was Billy Elliot! Rent and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a bad fantasy novel","review":"I love Roman era films, but this movie was absolutely awful. The acting, especially from the main characters, was stiff and wooden, and I didn't buy most of the performances. Even Donald Sutherland comes off badly. And what the heck is up with the costumes? It's bizarre to me that they would go to the trouble of having the Picts speak actual Gaelic and then dress them up like Mohican Indians. With bones in their hair? Are you serious?! The costume designer should be shot for that alone. They may as well have made them orcs! Pass on this unless you are dying for a Roman action flick and have nothing better to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time, read the book instead","review":"I know a book has to be abridged for film, but they made some really bad choices here. Basically they took the book, ripped its guts out, and stuffed it full of cotton candy. And 'UNRATED?' This version clearly says PG-13. Don't waste your time, read the book instead, or watch 'Centurion.' And I was really looking forward to this . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kind of thought it stinked","review":"The movie was entirely devoid of any emotions - unless you can call missing an Eagle an emotion. People you don't know, and don't care about, are slaughtered regularly throughout the movie, which has a horrible soundtrack of endless sword clicking. The early Scotts are depicted as completely primitive and wearing Mohawk haircuts. I don't know if this is historically accurate or not.If one did not know what movie they were watching, the lack of skill of the production would not allow one to know if they were actually watching Scotts or Iroquois.I believe that Channing himself could have starred in a very good movie of this sort, unfortunately, this was not that movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read the book....don't bother with the movie","review":"Such a disappointment. Can't see how anyone would have a clue without having read the book. However, having read the book, the movie left so much out and changed so much it was disappointing and almost painful to watch. A shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG this was an awesome movie","review":"Okay, I dont want to go into to much detail, but this was an awesome movie, it had a very intense plot and the characters were awesome, especially the slave :) ... This kind of reminds me of the lord of the rings, the slave is this movies version of Sam wise .... anyway the ending is epically funny, if your into middle age lore you should watch this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK enough","review":"I liked the setting of the film and the concept. I felt the script was a little cliche'd. They tried to make it a buddy movie, especially the last lines. I was most struck by the absence of any women. You know the Bechdel test -It includes two women, who have a conversation, about anything but a man. Not only couldn't it pass it, not a single woman has any lines of dialogue. None."},{"rating":"1","title":"Channing Tatum CANT act!!!!","review":"Jamie Bell does a great job. Rest of the cast too. Channing Tatum however was completely unbelievable and tried so hard to look macho and manly. He is still just the little A&F model who best fits in silly chick-flicks. The ending was such a let down and was completely rushed. This movie was not good at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roma Victrix","review":"Simply put this move was solidly enjoyable one for three reasons:good, realistic roman combat(except for the absence of the pila)NO overdone sex, violence, or other unwanted nonsense that doesn't add well to the picturegood acting. Tatum is very believable and Esca is done very well by the other guy. Donald Sutherland's appearance was surprise to me, and very much a pleasant one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie with a powerful message.","review":"What makes this action movie compelling is not Channing Tatum and his chiseled good looks, nor is it the action as part of the quest that he goes on in order to retrieve the Roman Legion's eagle emblem that his father lost to hordes of barbarians. Rather, what makes the movie compelling is the unlikely friendship encased in stoic old-world mannishness and the uneasy alliance that comes to exist between Tatum's Marcus Flavius Aquila and his barbarian servant Esca (played by a fierce Jamie Bell). These two move through many relational phases (owner-slave; slave come to power over owner; mutual admirers; brothers-in-arms; friends and, finally, equals) that are played out with nuance and sincerity and natural connection to the circumstances that they are involved in. As such it is a movie with a powerful lesson: true nobility disregards its powerful station in order to recognize and raise up an equal."},{"rating":"2","title":"What drives a legionnaire?","review":"Brits love to weave Roman drive, ambition and sense of glory into their history. This film provides a glimpse how/why this might be so. If you enjoy a fast action tale along with immersing yourself into the mud/blood/grit of the times, this is for you. I speculate, but given the wave of films that attempt tie Rome to pivotal myths in British history - we'll eventually find a legion's eagle at The Battle of Hastings. This film conveniently plucks fragments of history; Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, Hadrian's Wall and Spartacus into a wet, cold yet cinematic depiction. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disapointment","review":"I have to say that I have been a fan of this book since I was 14, I am now 37. Warning major spoiler alert : From the beginning to about Marcus's surgery followed the book decently well. I liked the scenes of the Roman camp life, and Uncle Aquila's house. At this point, the movie went completely astray. The major themes of the book are Marcus trying to figure out what to do with his life, his friendship with Esca, his dream of buying back his family farm, etc. The movie completely ignored the friendship he developed with Esca, as well as Esca's manumission ( being set free). The recovery of the Eagle wasn't a random snatch and grab, it was very carefully planned and executed. I won't even start about the Legion re-assembling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preview hell","review":"Despicable packaging, I don't even care if the movie is good or not because I'm just pissed about loosing all control over previews. You can't stop, pause, rewind, forward or skip the previews, of movies that I now dispise because of this tactic. Heck I might have even been interested in the movies being previewed but not anymore. I will be on the lookout for every such release and avoid them like the plague.On the spelling mistake I actually did use spell check but forgot it doesn't review words in all caps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I'm not articulate enough to really explain what is wrong with this movie besides the acting. First of all, the Romans were the bad guys. Why is this film putting you on the side of the bad guys? And why does the Celtic slave suddenly change his mind and decide to help the Roman? It was a completely spontaneous moment that made no sense. And why IS it noble for a slave to have loyalty to his keeper against his own people. Just stupid.Also, let's be clear. The Picts were not Native Americans. The inappropriate co-opting of Native American imagery to dress up the Picts was annoying. The mohawks and tomahawks were out of line. It was like Dances With Wolves against the Pawnee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great costumes and scenery","review":"But, wooden acting and unbelievable character motives. How does this happen, that most of the acting was bad to mediocre. Were they rushed through production, have problems on the set, not getting along, strung out on coke? In the first scene the actor playing the subordinate officer seemed to have just learned his lines or was reading them off camera.The main character acts like a less than intelligent protagonist and I found myself fast forwarding to get past the drawn out ..gee it's not hard to guess where this is going and how could he possibly believe that or think that...next scene.If you can watch the movie without thinking you may enjoy the realistic costumes and sets, the fantastic English country side. Maybe if you turn the sound off it won't seem so terribly hard to buy into. I have seen fantasy movies that were easier to believe in. Awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A clean shaven Roman north of Hadrian's Wall","review":"A fair attempt at re-creating life in Roman Britain circa 140 A.D.; however, the Roman empire was already by this time firmly in decline and disintegrating, being bankrupted by its zeal for putting garrisons everywhere in the known world. The most unbelievable segment of the movie has a clean-shaven and (obviously) Roman Aquila moving about Pictland north of Hadrian's Wall without being challenged! Anyone who was clean shaven would have been an obvious target to the natives, yet somehow the audience is expected to believe that clean shaven Romans are welcome everywhere! This and a plot focused on a gold-plated eagle figurine allows for only 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Eagle has A BROKEN WING","review":"The GOODThe first 15 minutes are filled with exciting fighting scenes.The mountainous and river scenes look spectacular.The BADThe rest of the movie is so far-fetched that I lost my interest. For example, 2 guys tried to infiltrate a tribe to steal back the Eagle. Two guys tried to fend off the whole tribe with 2 swords. And yet, one of the guy had been honorably discharged from the army because of serious injury. At the end, they all survived. Yeah, right!In short, it has its moments but mostly it's bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um....","review":"The characters were not well formed. One scene they were fighting the next they were traveling. The characters had no substance. They had allot of close ups of Channing. Not a great movie. It's worth a rental but not to purchase.

During a time entrenched corruption of the Democratic political machines & the NYPD, that still controlled large cities in the early postwar years. This dissatisfaction, along with Lindsay's reputation as a reformer, helped win him the mayoral election of 1965 and helped pave the way for Giuliani to ease into the role of conservative mayor.This book (728 pgs) sat on my bookshelf for years staring at me, begging to be read. I didn't realize that between Cannato's excellent writing style and the fact that it is much more about NYC politics and corruption than the mayor himself, I would not put it down for 72 hours.

Also, right out of the package it looks like it has been used before, there was dirt in the seams of the plastic and there were marks on the body like it had been used in a car cigarette lighter already.

Bought two and we use them with our W580i's. Includes a LED light and a clip so a passenger can use them to read a magazine or book while in the car at night. Only problem we had was the clips were broken on both of the chargers we received. Not sure if they came from a bad batch or what. I superglued them back on, and they seem to be ok now. Should not have had to do that, but I didn't buy them for the light anyway.

I have been listening to this recording non stop for the past few weeks now, and it continues to surprise me. Despite being an older recording, the quality is excellent thanks to the work of the brilliant Ward Marston (any time you see his name on a remastered recording, you know the work is top-notch). He knows how to clean up the sound without distorting or destroying it. At the price Naxos offers, there should be nothing to keep this out of anyone's collection, even if you already have a few recordings of this opera. The primary cast is excellent, and I have been especially pleased to listen to the beautifully high-voiced Don Ottavio on this disc--generally the sound of Ottavios on other great recordings is weak at best (the Siepi recording suffers from this)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still never received anything","review":"I wish I would get my magazine.

But to call the entire album \`crap' just seems so very hasty and wrong! To do that you'd have to ignore the incredible gems Rowboat, Spirit moves Me, Crystal Clear Beer, Puttin it Down, Satan Gave Me a Taco, Tazergun and Modesto. Many of these tunes are on par with Mutations and Sea Change material and are a fine display of that undeniably masterful and kooky Beck edge that draws us to his music. Consider this album an essential part of your Beck collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck's most electric","review":"Before \\"Mellow Gold\\", there was \\"Stereopathic Soulmanure\\", which has been around for a while, but just was re-released. The whole cd is much more electric than Mellow Gold or One Foot in the Grave, both before Beck became a household name for himself.Buy it, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Material","review":"This album is different from beck's ever-popular \\"Mellow Gold\\" which skyrocked him into stardom in March of 1994. This album, (which was originally released before Mellow) is much like \\"one Foot In The Grave\\" There are clear folk tunes and country tunes as well, and you're thinking 'wait a minute, country??!' Yes Country. But to the devout Beck fans, they praise this album. It is a truly brilliant album, when I first heard it I really didnt like it, but it was so hilarious, I could barely put it down. The best songs include 'The Spirit Moves Me', 'Satan Gave Me A Taco', 'Cut Blues', 'Puttin' It Down', 'Ozzy', and 'One Foot In The Grave'. Equally funny are the soundbites which are too numerous to mention. Beck fans could be divided into two halves, the half who like his new material, and the half that like his old. This is definitely an old album, and is worth it's weight in gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing together the street & random ideas is Beck's Forte","review":"You can listen to Beck's formative years with tons of different styles sometimes badly juxtaposed and musical sketches that show-up in his later works. The sarcasm and exaggeration is really funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the real Beck-fan","review":"This album has got some real excellent Beck stuff, like 'Rowboat', 'Crystal Clear', 'Puttin'it down' and 'Satan...'. I would rate it at five stars but for some tracks that just aren't good enough. I do listen the whole album without skipping tracks, but some 'songs' do annoy me. But, it's still an excellent cd. Must have for Beck-adepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is better than a sixpack of beer","review":"This is one of my favorite CDs by BEck, or by anyone. It is so diverse, ranging from noise punk, tender folk ballads, and country rock of the quality not seen since gram parsons. \\"the Spirit Moves Me\\", for example is one of the most haunting, naive, ethereal songs i've ever heard. It reminds of me of Neil Young. The songs on the album transport you to another world where everything is unexplored, surreal, beautiful and seen thru the eyes of a child, with a smirk on his mischeivous face."},{"rating":"2","title":"if I could give it 6 stars I would","review":"Beck's best & most varied, & IMHO 1 of the best albums ever made. Me & a friend have done Puttin It Down for a tribute tape that may or may not end up being completed but it was fun doing it nevertheless. Fans of this should check out early Zappa stuff & Ciccone Youth's Whitey Album. A taco is the best food anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beck plays a joke on his fans","review":"This seems to be Beck's stab at playing an Andy Kaufman-esque joke on his fans and the music industry at large. At the height of his fame and artistic reputation, he slaps together a collection of random recordings that were justifiably never included on previous albums.I suppose true fans appreciate the glimpse this gives us of the artist in development, but it reminds me more of those embarrassing audio tapes your parents made of you as a kid. \\"Geez did I really say that?\\" Lucky for him, Beck's not an easily embarrassed sort, but don't fall for his cleverly-disguised prank. There's a reason the words \\"pathetic\\" and \\"manure\\" are in the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"StereoPATHETIC!!","review":"Don't waste your money! Worst CD I have ever purchased.

I went through the chicago cassettes (once again, yuk) and when i went to sleep, i listened to this.I don't think I will ever be the same from listening to this. it's my favorite now.1. it starts off with \\"Pink Noise (Rock Me Amadeus)\\". it has very distorted guitars and it rocks on. 5/5 2. next track is \\"Rowboat\\" which is very good. it is a kind of a country ballad. 5/5 3. i really hate the song \\"Thunder Peel\\" but I think it is important to me in some sort of way. 2/5 the rest of the songs are really good. i recommend you buy this.

Do not judge others, and you will not be judged ! This command refers to rash, censorious, and unjust judgment. See Romans 2:1. Luke 6:37 explains it in the sense of \\"condemning.\\" Christ does not condemn judging as a magistrate, for that, when according to justice, is lawful and necessary. Nor does he condemn our \\"forming an opinion\\" of the conduct of others, for it is impossible \\"not\\" to form an opinion of conduct that we know to be evil. But what he refers to is a habit of forming a judgment hastily, harshly, and without an allowance for every palliating circumstance, and a habit of \\"expressing\\" such an opinion harshly and unnecessarily when formed. It rather refers to private judgment than \\"judicial,\\" and perhaps primarily to the customs of the scribes and Pharisees.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"rating":"1","title":"Packed with lies and anti-Catholic propaganda","review":"This is the most anti-Catholic film ever produced.

I think the reason why so many people give this book 5 stars is it is a relative value compared to other textbooks available.Pros:The grammar explanations of this book are fantastic as are the vocabulary building sections in the beginning of each chapter.Cons:As others have mentioned the dialogues on the CD are are difficult to comprehend for a beginning speaker. More exercises and examples would help to illustrate various uses of phrases and expressions.I personally think a better series of books for the comprehensive study of Korean is the Integrated Korean series published by Hawaii University Press. The Integrated series stretches the language over a five-level, ten-volume series of books rather than trying to compact the entire language into two textbooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot to take in for a begginer....","review":"I ordered this book after having become semi-fluent in Japanese and being used to the romaji of Japanese (as well as the kana and kanji) . Once I opened the book, I was very overwhelmed with the Korean system of romanization, I found trying to read the romanization more challenging than actually reading the Hangul. The writing system takes very little time to learn. I also agree with what people say about the CD. The male reader does speak WAY to fast, but the female speaker speaks slow enough that even if you are new to the language, you can clearly hear all the sounds. Overall, it was a very good book, but I recommend learning Hangul with its pronunciation and not even looking at the romanization if you have ever studied Japanese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I worked my way through most of the book, but while in the process I found a website for teach Korean.

I am confident that each recipe is excellent and therefore do not need to spend the time testing the recipe first. Also, you can do all your holiday baking from this book, no need to have a separate book for holiday cookies.

The book covers everything from cookies to cakes to fancy desserts to yeast breads and coffee cakes. I have had this book for at least ten years now, and I have found many of the recipes to be 'tried and true'. They are thoroughly tested so you get very consistent, yummy results, and now that I live at high altitude, I really appreciate the adjustments included for every recipe. That has helped me learn how to adjust other cookbooks' recipes for high altitude too. The glossy pages withstand the occasional batter spatter, and the pictures make you want to try all the recipes! Like others have mentioned, my book's binding gave out too and a good chunk of the pages have detached. Still, it remains my favorite baking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is a fantastic book for people who love to bake.

I have recommended this book to so many people I can't count them all. Quick tip for banana bread: wash your metal mixer bowl with VERY HOT water and cream butter and suger together while it is still very warm. Makes a big difference! The warm bowl makes the butter and sugar cream beautifully. When it is baked, the bread rises very high and the texture is outstanding. That's the only improvement I could make to this recipe!

After studying the entire book, taking each practice question at the end of each chapter, I passed the CLEP Biology with ease. This book does have one short coming.

TO tell you the truth this books sucks. It has almost no imformation and unless you are some genious you would wanna look at this book as a quick review. This book teaches you like you are a third grader. I am taking ap exam in two days and was reading the molecular biology section and it did not cover how enzymes worked; and stuff like that. I also brought an barron's book and was looking at that. It covered everything like you need. Cliffs book sucks and don't buy it; buy something else. It skips a whole lot of stuff. IF you wanna get a 4 or better get another book. THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just that great","review":"It's better than its Kaplan counterpart. It's easy to understand and has what you need to know. The figures in the text are easy to understand and reinforce the explainations. Get this book. Now there are many factors that go into getting a 5. The review book is not the only factor. So when people say, \\"I got a five because of this book,\\" they are either lying or ignorant. The two main factors I have found are: is the teacher hard and demanding, yet cares for his students? You may not like how they teach, but come test day you'll be glad. Number two is: Do you actually read the text and take notes? You kind of have to do this. If your bio book is still in the original skrink wrap then you're in trouble. Don't get a complex that you're the best at biology, it will screw you over. I got a 5 and this book helped, but was not an overwhelming factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"This is a good book, the price also makes it a good deal. The summaries are detailed and will help you a great deal. This book CAN'T be used as a substitute to reading the textbook. The nature of the subject of Biology is that there are so many details that pretty much every sentence in the text has a vocabulary word. This book has great summaries when it comes to general concepts. If you're having trouble telling the difference between all kinds of hereditary terms this one will be helpful, can't remeber the biochemical cycles? It has neat diagrams and flow-charts.Overall, a great buy, as long as you use it as an aid not a textbook"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutely amazing review.","review":"Just go and buy it.

There are groups of people who are not now interested in music from this genre, but may become more interested because of this release. That is my reason for granting two stars.On the other hand, those who enjoy period performance will be disappointed by the 20th century treatement, eg: \\"pop\\" style slurring, etc.Call me a purist, but many of the elements that awaken interest in early music for some (vitality, historical sound, etc) are missing from this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the purist","review":"Despite Amazon.com's comments to the contrary, I suspect many early music lovers like myself will find this album either amusing or somewhat annoying. The Baebes sound like a well-schooled high school choir, brought up on folk music, attempting some serious music for a change. It could make for pleasant background music, I suppose, but I'll take my early music straight, thanks. For those interested, check out any Anonymous 4 CD's, the relatively inexpensive Medieval Experience set on Archive, anything by the Hilliard Ensemble, Philip Pickett's work, and from a somewhat later period, the incomparable Tallis Scholars and The Sixteen's Eton Choirbook series, before it disappears with all other Collins Clasics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Deceptive Description","review":"I ordered what I thought was a saxophone stand with an OPTIONAL peg for my 12 year old son for Xmas.

If you are a trader and in need of motivation, you should definitely see this movie. What I liked about it was that it showed the ups AND downs of trading, hence a bit of realism. For instance, what is a trader's life like when he is unemployed? It can be grim, as depicted. However, the realism is balanced by a somewhat implausbile scenario where US T-Bills went from 98.00 to 88.00 in less that 10 minutes. I don't think that kind of volatility has ever hit the US bond market. Nonetheless, a great movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.

Several pages had me laughing out loud, especially Mowat's account of drinking Screech, an alcoholic beverage of near deadly strength.While this book is classified as a \\"children's\\" book, I think it is far more suitable for adults, who may appreciate some of the humor here with an adult's perspective.

Its a true story but written and obviously embellished (as are most stories) by a writer with a wicked sense of humour and a way with words that gets us to read a book about finding a boat, buying a boat, and sailing it off...somewhere.....encountering many mishaps along the way. If the writer had just said precisely that, well it would have been another boring 'man goes boating' tale.

It tells the story of his experience in buying a fixer-upper schooner with a friend with the idea of bringing it back from Newfoundland to Ontario. It becomes an effort that takes years and he never does quite make it to his goal.Anybody who has ever owned a boat that seems to have a perverse streak of obstinacy will relate to this story even if it were to be stripped of the distinctive writing style. The style of the author, though, just makes it that much more delicious. He envisions his boat as a real being that has actively set out to thwart his desires. Even so, he comes to love the cantankerous old bucket. The reader will as well. It's a fun romp."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all you would-be boat owners","review":"It has been said that the two happiest days in a boat owner's life are the day he bought the boat, and the day he got rid of it. Nonetheless, the adventures in between provide ample story-telling material for years! And Mowat is good at it. I was sitting in McDonald's one day reading the book, and broke into uncontrollable laughter as I read down the page. I finally straightened up (with giggles ready to reappear at any moment). As another woman in the restaurant left, she passed by me and commented that it was good to see someone really enjoying a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The boat that wouldn't float","review":"Great read...laughed myself nearly to death!

The first half of the novel takes place over one summer, and then suddenly years fly by and there is too much crammed into the last few chapters. It seems almost as though Mowat got bored of the story and decided that he'd better finish it. However, that was the only thing about this book that I didn't like. Mowat has a delightfully sarcastic sense of humour and I enjoyed his optimistic adventures thoroughly. Even the boat has a personality all her own, and his creativity was refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellow 11 watt light bulb","review":"I was given the task of trying to find replacement bulbs for a jukebox and I took a chance with this one.

I don't know if they fit with the trim piece back on because I haven't put it back on due to me breaking it when I took it off (DOH!) But they put out some pretty clean mids and highs but they have absolutely ZERO bass. Which is fine if you have a subwoofer to pair it with. Another think I noticed that the passenger side speaker may sound a little weaker. It looks like it has a little less excursion as well but I might just be imagining this. But yes, overall these speakers are pretty good if you have a subwoofer for your bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent speakers for a the price","review":"You are limited in your selection with 4x10s, and also limited in what they can phsyically put out, regardless of the price.

In my humble opinion, his rendering of the concerti exceeds that of Holliger's.I do hope that Schneemann will record the remaining 3 concerti of the opus and perhaps the remaining eight of the original 14.No other record company has been bold enough to venture on this man's work. Channel Classics is to be truly commended.

I must admit that \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes\\" is a beautiful rendition, and a small handful of others appear to be indestructible songs (although I always thought that \\"Deportee\\" was indestructible too). However, the whole concept of Nanci singing backup so often on her own album strikes me as extremely odd. My recommendation is that the diehards pick it up (of course, I'm sure we all already have!) and other curious parties start with \\"Storms\\", \\"Flyer\\", \\"One Fair Summer Evening\\", or the original \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't had such a good time in a LONG time ...","review":"I think it helps to listen to this four or five times in the car.

But this cd will always be important for collectors, in it you'll find the best version of Guy Clark's Desperadoes waiting for a train, with a cast including JJ Walker, JD Guilmore, S Earle, Guy Clark,other in this cd include Lucinda williams, Tom Russell, Richard Thomspon, Ian Tyson, a great cast of songwriters and singers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Differing Opinion.....","review":"I loved \\"Other Voices I.\\" But, while that album had a natural, settin'-round-the-campfire feel, \\"Voices II\\" sounds forced -- as if Nanci's trying to cram too many singers and songs into one CD. For example, \\"Desperadoes Waiting for a Train\\" almost sounds like a Highwaymen song, with no less than six singers trading leads, sometimes in the middle of sentences, never harmonizing, never connecting. I admire the range of material and singers represented -- an \\"A\\" for effort. But, as far as pure listening enjoyment, well, I have to rank this significantly lower than that....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes You Shouldn't Make a Sequel","review":"As much as I like Nanci Griffith, I really cannot tolerate this CD. Some of the songs, e.g., \\"Wall of Death\\" just aren't that good. Others are good songs, e.g., \\"If I Had a Hammer\\" and \\"You Were On My Mind,\\" in which Nanci's rendition pales in comparison to the original. Others are songs which have recently been updated by other artists in far superior fashion, e.g., compare Los Super Seven's version of \\"Plane Wreck at Los Gatos\\" or James Taylor's version of \\"Hard Times.\\" Having seen her several times in concert, and having several other of her CDs, I'm stunned that she could have produced an recording so bereft of interest. If you're a long-time Griffith follower, this CD will add nothing to your collection. If you're new to Nanci's music, look elsewhere. Otherwise, you might wonder why she has such a devoted following."},{"rating":"1","title":"a flop","review":"if your into more of Nanci's folkabilly work, stay away from this cd.

Oh well, one stinker out of many greats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aggravating, disappointing, inconsistent","review":"I'm glad it's not just me who finds Ms Griffith's pronunciations affected & aggravating. They make me think of someone striving to sing cool, tripping over a mike cord, & falling flat on their face. Some of the tracks are beauties, although most of those are just such wonderful songs that it would be tough for almost anyone to screw them up. Unfortunately, the take on Guy Clark's \\"Desperados Waiting For A Train\\" is not one of them. Even having Guy & Jerry Jeff, who I first heard do this 30+ years ago, don't salvage this. I see now why it was so cheap used."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is as Bad as Other Voices Other Rooms was Excellent","review":"You get the sense that she was forced to do a follow up by her record company and she was gonna teach them a lesson. Other voices, Other Rooms is one of my favorite Albums of all time. My kids grew up listening to the Beatles, and Other Voices Other Rooms. Nancy owes the world a Re-Do of this album, this time with a straight face. You feel like you're listening to an inside joke, that just isn't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and damned-near unlistenable","review":"I love a lot of Nanci Griffith's work, including the first \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms.\\" On this CD, however, several of the songs make my skin crawl. What in the world has she done to \\"Wall of Death\\" with her bizarre counter melody? Anyone who can listen to Nanci sing \\"You Were on my Mind\\" without wincing has a much stonger stomach than I. A lot of the songs are good, and I guess if I programmed the CD player to eliminate the stinkers this would be an enjoyable disc. But, like the little girl with the curl in the middle of her forehead, when Nanci is bad on this CD, she is horrid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many truly wonderful songs","review":"Before writing this review I went over to my CD collection to pull it out, there I saw about 6 of Nanci's CD's at least 2 of them better then this. Does that mean you should pass on Other Voices Too, definitely not. Yes I agree with some of the other reviewers that Desperados is weak but there are many truly wonderful songs on this album, Summer Wages, Wall of Death, Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Mighty Storm, Canadian Wiskey, and the list goes on... Yes you might have to skip a couple of songs but don't we (those of us who remember vinyl)all have favorite albums that we only listen to one side of . Don't miss this album because 3or 4 songs out of 19 are weak, just skip them. Buy Other Rooms,Other Voices, and Little Love Affairs first then get this one and enjoy some wonderful folk music. (PS Read my Gram Parsons GP review.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Griffith's versions of most of these songs sound forced and overwrought (\\"Wall of Death,\\" one of my favorite songs, is particularly terrible here). At least most of the songs on the first CD match her style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nanci's Vocal Affectations Ruin Otherwise Fine Outing","review":"It's always refreshing to hear new takes on favorite songs. The arrangements on this fine selection of tunes by a sterling collection of writers are wonderful. The playing, while not inspired, is more than competent. What ruins it for me is the weird vocal affectation Nanci brings to so many of the songs. Not only is it irritating, it's not even consistent. Nanci - if you're going to pronounce \\"friend\\" as \\"frayund\\" at least do it each time. I own each of Nanci Griffith's CDs but, frankly, if I'd heard this one before I bought it, I'd have skipped it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe you didn't make it to song #18","review":"I agree that this cd isn't as good as the first Other Voices, but to me, that one was a masterpiece. In my opinion, Nanci's versions of Darcy Farrow and He Was A Friend Of Mine on this cd rank right up there with anything on the first Other Voices and alone make it worth the purchase. Hey, it's Nanci. Gotta love her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Other Voices, Other Rooms, but still worth it","review":"The first time I heard the disk, I was a little disappointed, but then I began to recognize many, many songs that I grew up with (having a father who is and was a die hard folk fan). While I agree that this recording of Desparados is not even close to my favorite and Los Gatos is a little too rolling for my taste, it still does a good job for those of us that know some of the \\"less beaten path\\" songs and artists. Ian Tyson is every bit as compelling (Summer Wages) and powerful as Arlo (Tecumseh Valley) and John Prine (Sound of Loneliness) were on the first disk. This disk is not for everybody, as the first one really seemed to be, but I found it, overall, a wonderful collection of new twists on old memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme disappointment for a devoted fan.","review":"I have followed Nanci Griffith's career for years. As a singer/songwriter, I have the utmost respect for Miss Griffith's soulful performance and writing gifts. I am also in awe of Other Voices, Other Rooms. This second venture, however, was a disappointing buy for me. More often than not, Nanci was overshadowed by lackluster performances of other artists. Many of the harmonies were quite painful to hear. I will continue to follow and support Nanci's career. Let's have another Flyer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one ...","review":"From a fan who has most of Nanci's CD's, this one is extremely disappointing. Her guests overshadow Nanci's voice on almost every selection. A more appropriate title: \\"A Bunch of Mostly Mediocre Songs on Which Nanci Griffith Sings Back-Up\\". If I could give this CD zero stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I heard that Nanci Griffith had produced a sequel to Other Voices, I rush out and purchased it. A mistake, but I have made them before. The choice of musical selections has an uncertain feel to it. It has the feeling as being made up from selections that should have been left on the editing room floor. The performance of the Stephen Foster selection was unflattering to the writer and was work to listen to. Emmylou Harris did a much better rendition in her Live at the Ryman album. This is the first dud that I have purchased that Nanci Griffith released. It can be summed up as \\"Not up to Her Quality.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible disappointment.","review":"If you liked the first \\"Other Voices...\\" you might be tempted to buy this sequel without delay. The original was one of the best singer/songwriter albums ever. The follow-up is a dud. Arrangements are bewildering - \\"Deportee\\" is sung like a barroom anthem, not a wistful lament. I know arrangers and performers are always looking for a fresh way to present older material, but they have gone too far in this overblown attempt to recapture the brilliance of the first \\"Other Voices\\". I have been a Nanci Griffith fan for years and I will still buy her recordings, but I actually regret having bought this one. In fact, I regret that she even got involved in it. It's really not good, brothers and sisters - not good at all, and it could have been wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal, at best","review":"I had previously purchased the first Other Voices, Other Rooms CD, and was mostly impressed with the song selection and presentation of material. With that in mind, I purchased the second Other Voices, Too, but was sadly disappointed. For an artist who has written, performed, and recorded so many quality pieces of music I couldn't help but wonder why Nanci chose the selection of music for this CD? In addition, I found it incredibly annoying when Nanci would force country twang and/or drawl on select lyrics. If you're thinking of buying this CD, try to listen to it before you pay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"After many attempts at trying to like this album, in accordance with what the other reviewers were saying, I gleefully commit this album to the trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic and Grotesque","review":"Nancy Griffith and these dust balls of folk music should know when to lay it down. Nothing worse than forced emotion and voices.

But then I listened to this piece of trash. Disappointing doesn't begin to describe my feelings. What happened to the brilliance displayed in Other Voices Other Rooms? Her voice went south, her arrangements went south, and her harmonies went south (Bountiful must be in the South). This CD is a dud no matter how many times I have listened to it. Save your money and hope she records another CD (I wish I had). It HAS to be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great teaser","review":"I would like to thank Nanci Griffith for having the courage to record this and her previous compilation, Other Voices, Other Rooms. On these recordings are none of her songs. They are comprised of her recordings of other people's songs which, if it weren't intentional, I would not appreciate as much (I began to respect Joan Baez much more when she started writing most of her own songs). However, Nanci's roots in music are obvious in her own writing, and so it is wonderful to hear some of her own interpretations of the songs which meant so much to her as a musician. And the songs are all very well done. Probably the thing I appreciate about this album the most is that it is intentionally a forum for listners to be introduced to other songwriters who we might not have heard of, and to go out and discover their music on our own. All in all, a wonderful listnening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOME SAY BEST EVER !!!","review":"SOME SAY THIS IS DO OR DIE'S BEST ALBUM ,BUT I DON'T THINK SO PERSONALLY.THIS ALBUM \\"VICTORY\\" IS GOOD DON'T GET ME WRONG ,BUT IT'S MISSING TRAXSTER BEATS.BUY THIS ALBUM IS WORTH YOUR MONEY.CHI-TOWN , WEST SIDERAP-A-LOT RECORDS"},{"rating":"2","title":"DO OR DIE 3RD TIME AROUND !","review":"I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO DO OR DIE FOR AWHILE NOW AND I COULD ACTUALLY SAY THERE NEW STYLE IS BETTER.THEIR LYRICS ARE OFF THE HOOK.THE BEATS ARE KILLA.1,2,5,7,9,10,11,13,16.TRACK 13 IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE.BUY THIS CD THEIR FROM CHICAGO IF YOU DON'T KNOW.YOUR CAR WILL BE BUMPIN.\\"HEADS OR TAILZ\\" WAS THE BEST FROM DO OR DIE.SECOND BEST IS \\"VICTORY\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get my money back please?","review":"What the hell were they thinking?

For example, they say that the earnings on college 529 plans are subject to taxation once you start withdrawing from the account. I did a little more research--this is just plain wrong. Until the year 2010, all gains are, in fact, completely sheltered.

Kent can't let go of this, and Bolitho improbably hangs his flag on a small frigate, to get that frigate action that Aubrey could never let go of. The best thing about this book in the series is the almost soap-opera relationship with Allday, Pascoe and Herrick.Bolitho finds a new woman, a carbon copy of Cheney, in a most unbelievable way. We still do not get enough of either the wardroom or the lower decks, except from Dick's ever more removed view. I do not like Admiral Bolitho much, not as much as I liked him before he became an admiral; but he is still more likable than the irascible Nathaniel Drinkwater (Woodman).

Compared with past RWYNS discs, this is a weak effort and replay value is minimal. Again, the topics covered are not as compelling or funny as previous editions. It's such a shame coming from a good cast. I've always considered it strange that these RWYNS discs are released singular from a complete season set for the respective season when the RWYNS Dvds should be and are the bonus features found on similar tv show boxed sets.

Listen to the beauty of the lead work on the old Curtis Mayfield love song \\"I'm So Proud\\" on the Beck Bogart and Appice LP. Listen to the intrumentals on the older Jeff Beck Group LPs, and hear him make a slide guitar sound like an angel weeping. Jeff used to have a sensitvity that I considered unmatched on electric guitar. But he has lost his way. I don't know what happened...but he has simply lost his way. He has become a techno noise machine. Push a button and hear Jeff make more noise. On the A@E BB King special, he could not even play a decent simple blues lead ....he just kept doing little tricks.....making little noises. More tricks...more noises...no melody..no taste.(sighs)"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and for sale","review":"I am Jeff Beck Fan.

Although he deserves some credit for the speed he takes, the sound quality and intonation is lacking from what I have heard. Almost everything is sharp, and his sound is not focused enough for everything to come out clearly. I would recommend Midori's recording of these over Perlman's, because of a beautiful sound throughout all 24, and almost completely perfect intonation."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a violist's point of view","review":"I have played the viola for 10 years now and have been given opprotunities to hear a broad variety of artists in the string realm. That one is able to play any one of Paganini's Caprices competantly such that there is adaquet sound from the instrument without scratching or losing contact in the upper extremes says more than words are able to about a player's abilities. Paganini's Caprices are lively pieces that challenge a string player's dexterity and quickness in both the left and right hands. These performances show his technical mastery. Itzhak Perlman is able to master each caprice with unsurpassed quality. That Itzhak Perlman can perform such that he retains the sound as does a jewel in the sunlight on all 24 caprices is of a quality that is beyond measurable boundaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art, technique and music","review":"So what can we say about Perlman's technique? With his sweet tone and carefully controlled speed, Perlman's playing of the Caprices is simply flawless. One may critise that his playing lacks the spontaneous excitment which Rabin offers, but it's obviously a trade-off.To me, Perlman is very smart -- in the sense that he learned from but not copied from Heifetz. He has never tried to make his playing as fast as Heifetz's. The smartest thing is that he knows the difference between a studio recording and live recording. If you compare Perlman's concerto perfromances (studio v.s. live) then you can immediately note the difference between their speed and the amount of pressure given. A recording with too much stress can't stand repeated listening although you may call it dazzling at the first glance.Buy this CD and compare it with Rabin's. You will love Perlman's honey-toned, technically flawless playing -- once you realise this is Perlman's art and Perlman's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fragrance","review":"This is the perfect fragrance.

Very few cuts are tolerable enough to listen to the whole way through. Even with guests such as Snoop Dogg, Mystikal, and Master P, the \\"Killa Corleone Capone\\" himself (among others), this album still only stands at half mast. While the days of \\"3-2-Murder-1\\" and \\"Git Paid\\" on the freshman album, are still bout it, bout it, Kane and Abel have just became even more sloppy and chauvenistic than before.

Her out-of-breath croaks did not deserve radio play, I'm so glad the PCD version is all they play. The production is also a little crummier than PCD's, the backing track just doesn't sound as good. I'm glad PCD included Busta on their version, because the beginning of Tori's version is tediously long, and plays nothing but the backing track for like 40 seconds....PCD at least fills that dull stretch out with Busta's raps. I think some people are just bitter over the fact that PCD got famous over a song that essentially wasn't theirs (but did Tori write this...?

The re-mastering the last couple of years has made many of those recordings gems to be treasured, but not this one. None of the singers are up to the roles, at first I thought it might have been a balancing problem but then I realized it wasn't, the conductor was holding back the orchestra because it was simply swallowing up the singers, none of whom have the vocal power to sing the parts. The tempos were odd to me too, the whole Klytamnestra \\"Warum\\" series was sung the fastest I've ever her it done and I think it totally ruins the impact of the section.

Simply stated, it is the musical equivalent of the Sistine Chapel.

No other recording of this or any other piano concerto comes close, not even Richter's legendary recording of the Rachmaninov #2 nor Zimerman's perfect recording of the Liszt #2.In this astonishing performance, Michelangeli raises the outer limits of pianistic accomplishment and artistic expression to a level no other performer has ever achieved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing playing","review":"This CD is an all-time classic.

Our hero is gifted with some special abilities and as the title suggests, will eventually become an apprentice to an assassin, however, these elements of the story take a long time in development and there is very little payoff leaving the reader to assume that the real action will take place in the books to come. Fortunately the writing is excellent and the author is skilled enough at her craft that the protagonist can go into long periods of brooding and self assessment without making the reader want to throw the book out the window.

Royal Assassin has 752 pages, the setting is just Buckkeep, and for about 500 pages Fitz is just whining over what happened in book one. Assassin's Quest has 837 pages, and while the quest theme increases the pace a bit, the book does in no way live up to expectations. The charming 11 year old hero Fitz of book 1 develops neither brains nor balls, and Hobb has no idea how a 16 - 20 years old boy thinks or reacts, or has forgotten it. (Read the 1- and 2-Star-Reviews of R.A. and A.Q.!)

The story is interesting and the world is unique enough to catch the interest of seasoned fantasy enthusiasts. However, that's about it. Almost everyone in this book is loathsome, and the likable characters end up dis likable in the end. The ending is the most frustrating part: go ahead and murder or cripple people. Nobody will care in the end and there will be almost no consequences. It's one thing for the bad guys to get away, or to wonder 'who done it?' so you have a reason to read another book. It's a completely different story when everyone knows who the bad guy was, he was caught, and nothing happens to him.

It was that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Storyline","review":"Having read a lot of fantasy, I can honestly say this is a good book w/ a nice storyline. One of the things I enjoyed about the book is the level of power is limited to a few. Those few with power are still susceptible to the common cloak and dagger, diplomatic intricacies of a normal individual living in such an environment. I'm not sure how the rest of the series goes, but I found this book interesting. Not to mention, the price for the Kindle version made it an obvious choice for my most recent reading selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic but Original","review":"I finally read Robin Hobb's Assassin's Apprentice two years after it was first recommended to me. I regret not getting to it sooner. Robin Hobb is an excellent author, and the Assassin series is fantastic. It does not conform to traditional fantasy archetypes, which is refreshing. The story is not as positive as other novels and is dark at times. The darker aspects of the story are true to life, and the author does not seek to sugar-coat anything. If you are looking for one of the best authors and series in the business, look no further than Assassin's Apprentice and its sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full series review...","review":"I actually really enjoyed this series once I sat myself down and dedicated myself to it.

The world was very well constructed, the characters were interesting, the plot kept moving and I was practically in love with the Fool (what a great character). The thing I love the most about his series was the ending - it was technically a happy one, but every character had sacrificed so much to get there so it was very bitter sweet.I look forward to reading more from this author in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH! The names did me in!","review":"I couldn't get past the first few chapters of this book. I enjoy worldbuilding and characters with interesting names. Hobb named her characters after virtues in her world, due to custom which ruined the book for me. King Shrewd? Prince Chivalry? Prince Regal? Prince Verity? Every time I read one of their ridiculous names I wanted to throw the book at the wall and finally did. I have some friends that love this series and give it 5 stars. I have no problem with her writing style or her story building just her judgement. I WISH SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER CHARACTERS COOL NAMES INSTEAD OF ANNOYING ONES! Maybe I would have finished the series. Some things I just cant ignore when I'm reading LIKE INSANELY ANNOYING NAMES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Hope For Redemption Is Lost","review":"This series is truely awful. I have never felt sick to my stomach as after reading this series. The main character goes through so much turmoil, pain and loss that its almost unbearable. The payoff for the pain (for the character and the reader): none. Leaves you feeling empty and disheartened at the end by the cruelty and unfairness of the world. A happy ending is one thing, an unhappy ending is another, the ending to this series is just downright depressing. Avoid. I was put onto this by George R R Martins recommendations, stick to Lynn Flewelling or just wait for teh next Martin book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed","review":"Hobb writes deeply flawed novels, but they're amazing. Read anything she puts out; you won't be disappointed. This novel (and the related series) are flawed, but that just adds to them. Like anything else, it's the small imperfections that really makes these stand out."},{"rating":"2","title":"An author you have to grow to like.","review":"The first book I read by Robbin Hobb, I hated. Her style is very choppy and it made me dislike her books. But I read a few more and now I have gotten used to the way she writes. After your reach this level, you begin to see what people see in Robbin Hobb. She is a very good author when you get to that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer's Apprentice","review":"Starts out with a promising idea that soon de-coheres and becomes tedious. Hobb has bitten off more than he can chew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money - don't bother","review":"This has all the makings of being a great series, but the execution is terrible and this is being nice.I struggled to get through the book and by the end wondered why I bothered.It just leaves me feeling empty and I certainly will not read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped soon after puppy companion \\"killed\\"","review":"Sorrow, Pain. Sorrow. Pain.After the boy's puppy companion is supposedly killed, I endured a bit more and then stopped.If I want never ending sorrow, I can read the news online or check for how much further in debt my nation is or...What is the point of unrelenting sorrow novels?"},{"rating":"1","title":"downer","review":"I have read all of Robin Hobbs books ,while well crafted, NOTHING GOOD ever happens. I can get depressed all on my own. I don't expect Pollyanna's tales but these stories will make you want to get a script for Zoloft,and if you already have one ,up your dose ."},{"rating":"1","title":"when bad things happen to good people","review":"Ms. Hobb creates an engaging protagonist, and treats him so terribly one is compelled to buy the next book in the series to seek relief from what happens in this one. Each book repeats the pattern. They're cliffhangers, of sorts, and that's the secret to the series's success. Also, there's a certain intellectual cache that comes with unhappy endings.My problem is that in this narrative, and in all the books in the series, a great deal of contrivance is marshalled to create its unhappy ending. Smart people, like the protagonist and his friends, must behave irrationally, and dumb people, like this novel's main villian, turn out to be inexplicable masterminds.I give the book 2 stars because the first two-thirds of it draws you in. Ultimately, however, it's unnecessarily depressing, a cynical exercise, I think, on the part of the author, and a masochistic one for the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I started reading Robin Hobb about a month ago due to reading a recommendation on George R. R. Martin's website. I was pleasantly surprised! It didn't take long for me to get hooked. I finished this book and immediately picked up the 2nd and 3rd of the series. Do yourself a favor and get the whole trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I enjoyed reading \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\" by Robin Hobb. The story line was well planned and executed, and the characters came to life fairly well. The denoument was somewhat dissappoining in that the level of activity did not seem to intensify as it should have. All in all a very entertaining book, and I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well written chronicle of an unworthy protagonist","review":"I started reading this series based on the glowing reviews that it received in this forum. I continued to read the whole series because Hobb has a rich writing style. I was extremely let down at the end of the series because the hero remains nothing more than a pawn and a victim to the end of his days. He never utilizes all the skills and gifts that he is given, and doesn't take one proactive step the whole story. Really Mr/Ms Hobb... in today's term, how could a character with so much game turn out to be such a punk?"},{"rating":"1","title":"My 2 cents","review":"Honestly I just wanted to put a 2 star review to lower its overall rating, I am a avid reader of fantasy and found this series to be pretty bad. The characters are to damn dumb and the book moved way to slow. I didnt hate it (I've read worse) but 2 stars is more than fair I believe and warn people off this series. I read the first, audiobooked the last 2 and there is no payoff it just goes slower and slower. Havent read Hobbs other books but I heard they are better>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a sixth star","review":"A classic of epic fantasy. It is hard to say which is more engaging: the world that is nearly as richly realized as Tolkien's (and very different), the well-drawn characters, or the action of the plot. The story drew me in from the first page, and the climax hit like a hammer-blow. Parts of the book also work well as dog-stories. I notice that books 2 and 3 have dogs on the cover, and I hope very much that the covers say something about the contents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"Don't know how i missed it as a regular scifi fantasy fan, but I'm glad I found it... Detail, intrigue, colorful. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Assassin's Apprentice","review":"Very good book. I thought the character development was outstanding. The plot was filled with twists and turns. Just when I thought I had everything figured out I was thrown for a loop once again. Great pacing, backstory and foreshadowing. Come join the bastard son of Prince Chivalry as he tries to find his place in the royal family. Will his training help save the kingdom? Or destroy it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I have read a lot of fantasy, I mean a LOT, from old Tolkien and Salvatore, to Jordan, Martin, Sanderson, Weis, Rothfuss, Lynch, Erikson, Abercrombie, Donalson, Lackey, Bucther etc. I found Hobb's books bland and boring. They sure haven't failed to put me to sleep at night. I just couldn't understand what people saw in them. It's like a constant wait for things to pick up and they never really do. Ordinary characters, ordinary plot, ordinary writing. Wasn't my cup of tea, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully constructed, I couldn't put it down.","review":"What a fantastic read!. It's been a long time, in fact since I first read Dune some fifteen years ago, that I have felt that I have known characters as well as this. The imagery is very potent and the plot is woven with true class. What a book!."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous beginning to a fantastic trilogy!","review":"This book really suprised me. I thought that this would be a fairly boring book based on the lack of creativity on the book's name. (Robin Hobb could probably have come up with a better name than Assassin's Apprentice!) The book turned out to have extremely complex characters with a mesmerizing plot. The book had a few flaws(a couple of things weren't all that clear) but all in all the book was a winner. I'd put Robin Hobb on the level of Tolkein, Goodkind, and Jordan(my three favorite authors)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THIS SERIES, ONE OF THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I loved this series, it ranks up with Maggie Furey's Aurian series. There are many things I liked about this series, including the definition of magic (very important to me), the action, and Fitz's job and motivations. The diversity of the charachters is a great additive also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a series worthly to rival \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"","review":"Robin Hobb is a master of story weaving. I am not especially fond of fantasy, but a friend turned me on to this series, as well as the Liveship and Tawny Man series. To maximize the effect of these interwoven novels, read them in that order (ie., The Farseer Trilogy, the Liveship Traders Series, and the Tawny Man Series.) The depth of the stories, as well as the richness and development of the characters easily rivals my all-time favorite series, The Lord of the Rings. Robin's work is truly a mastery of story telling. In fact, the only complaint I could conceive with her books is that they are too detailed (much in the same fashion of The Lord of the Rings.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good series","review":"I found the book and series a little involved and slaw, but generally enjoyed them. The author certainly is worth putting on a favorites list"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Average","review":"I must say that I am new to fantasy books. I started with Lord of the Rings and I guess I am spoiled. I loved Lord of the Rings and I just can't review fantasy books without some reference to it. I've also read works by C.S. Lewis that I thought were good. However, this book was not necessarily boring but I just couldn't get attached to the main character. I don't particularly understand the \\"Skill\\" or the \\"Wit\\" and I am not really interested in assassins. I can't decide if I wish to continue in this series. I have the other two books but I just can't seem to care what happens to the character. Perhaps I will come back to it someday but this particular story was not interesting to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Fitz","review":"The characters and story compelled me to forge ahead with this novel but Fitz, the main character, was so abused in every aspect of his life, he should have just laid down and croaked. Poor guy seemed to have so many things going for him but he just couldn't get a break. When I finished the book I just thought \\"huh\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite","review":"The book is in a Middle Ages setting with unique atypical kind of magic. If one looks at the whole series and also her other two trilogies with the Fool and Ship series it is a very complicated with elaborate storyline with no loose ends. The main character is multi faceted and believable and worthy of respect and pity. I put Hobb as one of the masters of fantasy along with Robert Jordan/ Piers Anthony/George R R Martin/R A Salvatore. Her new series the Shaman has bee met with excitment and pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic fantasy at its best","review":"This book is one of my favorites. Robin Hobb has a great talent of taking her characters and making them real, making her plots lifelike. She begins to exercise this in \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\". Not all of Fitz's plans work the way they're supposed to--in fact, very few of them do. Such is life. That's what's so great about Robin Hobb. I could expect any of the things in this book to be real. An engrossing book, original, and lifelike. But beware, those of you who plan to read on: it gets dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"So real you can smell it.","review":"Robin Hobbs (as she wants to be known) writing is superb; second to none. When I first began reading this, I thought, Oh no! not a first person narrative. But the writing is so excellent that I immediately forgot I didn't like first person and before I knew it, I'd reached the end of the trilogy and a week had vanished. The story is completely original as far as I can tell and the characters are so well portrayed they seem to jump off of the page. IT'S JUST SO DAMN REAL! I can't see the strings at all. This is going to be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tale!","review":"This is a wonderful tale. I found myself reading until the wee hours because I couldn't put it down. If you like fantasy you will like this book. There is relitively little magic happenings in this book but it is still a good book. You won't find dragons or elves threatining the people. Fritz does learn to comunicate with animals. This is a good book to help you escape reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Fantasy!","review":"This book is a great example of how well and alive good fantasy still is. Assassin's Apprentice is obviously the story of a young boy learning to be an assassin, but there is much, much more to it. Secrets of a troubled kingdom, the enticing magics of the Skill and Wit, the mind of young Fitz-all of these factors help brew up a delicious, can't-put-down book. Hobb also brings strong charactor and setting descriptions into it to offer a very intriguing and realistic look into the world of the Six Duchies. This is a book I'm going to read again for sure-I recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"My (adult) son bought this book and that's how I ended up reading it. Which is not to say I don't read a lot of fantasy but the title of this one probably would have put me off otherwise. The title sounds juvenile but the book is not. The story develops slowly so there's no great-big grab-ya moment, you just get sucked in. The main character is easy to empathize with. He's not perfect but he does the best he can given the circumstances. And the plot is full of surprises that--and this is the really good part--are actually surprising and make sense within the confines of the world and the story.This is not a book that is going to change your life, but it is a book you will enjoy reading and will think about for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character driven, plot twisting fun","review":"I downloaded this book to my kindle because it was offered for free and I thought I would have nothing to lose even if I hated it. I loved this book. I read it in two days and then I immediately downloaded the remaining books of the trilogy. I dare say book 2 is even better and the books get better with the turn of every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Excellent writing, wonderfully complex characters, but mainly, a compelling story. I can't wait to read the second book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good read","review":"This story starts off a little slow but gets better the further in you get. The characters are believable as is the story premise. I will read more of this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character Fantasy","review":"This review takes the entire trilogy into account. Hobb does a fantastic job with the characters in this series. They are all living breathing people. I am not normally one who likes the first person narrative but Hobb masters the technique. The magic in this series is original and intreging. Book one and two were excellent, the third book drags alittle and the ending left me feeling slightly cheated but over all these three books that any fantasy fan will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three cheers for a depressing fantasy trilogy!","review":"I read this while I was in bed with meningitis and a bad case of self-pity, and it really cheered me up (in a depressing kind of way!) Fitz is a character who is some way removed from the kind of tediously upbeat born-with-a-sword-in-his-hand type of hero you too often find. He suffers from a good deal of self-doubt, and his accident of birth seems like a curse that he cannot cast off, making for a gently melancholic mood. Some of the other characters are intriguing too, especially the Fool (who is developed more in the last volume of the trilogy). Almost the best fantasy novel I've read recently (the best was CJ Cherryh's Fortress in the Eye of Time, which also has a rather tormented hero)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"If you're a happy person, and enjoy life, this series will make you want to kill yourself. Slowly. Painfully. I literally burned my books and was violent with rage after reading this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for; writing style jarred me","review":"OVERALL FEELING: Too slow; I read the first 40 pages and then skimmed ahead to be sure I wasn't missing something . . . it was in first person but not enough interesting things happened . . . sometimes the narrator glossed over things that could have been interesting. Too detached; too vicarious; not enough conflict; not enough surprises or interest.If you think I'm being too unfair and have some good reasons for giving her another chance, email me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter dreariness","review":"After reading all the rave reviews, I am left completely confused. This book is not good. If ever a book could be judged objectively, this is it. In this book nothing happens. Bad things happen to the protagonist and he whines about it. Then, other characters react in completely unbelievable ways. The prime example being Burrich abandoning Fitz for using the \\"Wit\\", without so much as an explanation as to why the \\"Wit\\" is a bad thing. Basically 400+ pages of depression with no pay off.The readers who actually liked this book must have been \\"Forged.\\"SOME ONE PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY YOU CAN LIKE A BOOK IN WHICH NOTHING HAPPENS SAVE MEANINGLESS DEPRESSION??!!!??Go die Fitz Chivalry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"The series is entirely unreadable.The plot line moves at a snail's pace.I would suggest trying the liveship traders series, if one is intent on reading Hobb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the names...","review":"I bought this book, because I was looking for something to read while I wait for George RR Martin's next book to be published. It received really good ratings overall here on Amazon, but I don't understand why. The names are awful. If one cannot come up with creative names, how can the story be creative. I did not get past the first chapter - 'Prince Chivalry'?? You may say I did not give it a chance, but there are so many other good fantasy books out there, I did not want to waste my time on a bad one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect any twist or surprise or, actually anything...","review":"So, this is book 1.

I too truly enjoyed it and look forward to reading the entire series. Very creative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather good","review":"I picked up this book by recommendation in my wait for the next book in A Song of Ice and Fire, and it turned out to be pretty good. The main character Fitz is akin to to wronged protagonist of many fantasy novels, yet the books avoids cliches common to the fantasy genre. A must read for science fiction and fantasy fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing up isn't easy as a bastard assassin.","review":"This novel takes us into the life of Fitz, the bastard son of the eldest prince.Dropped off by his grandfather at the steps of the castle, Fitz is taken in andraised. Along the way, he becomes ensnared in the deepest workings of the royal intrigue.This novel does a wonderful job of showing the underbelly of royal society, and to show thatit isn't always a good thing to be the son of a prince!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hobb must have been paid by the word","review":"Do not read this book. This starts as a somewhat charming story about a royal bastard who is disliked and used by everyone. However, it is almost impossible to like the main character. He does nothing but whine for the entire trilogy except when he is bonded with a wolf. The actual story was OK, I just wish he had left out all that stuff about dragons in the last book. The entire trilogy consumed around 1700 pages in all--Oh what I would have given for an editor's pencil. At one point in book III, the author takes 6 pages to describe a group of questors climb over a rock slide in their path. This scene didn't advance the story line, it was just there. By the time I slogged through all three books, I was so tired of the author's verbosity that I couldn't wait for it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book of all time.","review":"This very well could be a magical, enchanting trilogy however the author has made the terrible mistake of making it so BORING in the beginning. I am on page 220 and NOTHING HAS HAPPEND. I repeat NOTHING HAS HAPPEND. This book is terrible, the names alone are laughable (Patience, Regal, Chivalry, Fitz etc..).Why would any author want to NOT grap the attention of its reader, this is a huge mistake this author has made. This is the first time I have ever actually put down a book with no interest whatsoever of finishing it. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Heaven","review":"If you like depression, stories where nothing ever goes right for our main character and he is never happy (unless it's so that happiness can be tragically yanked away from him), by all means, read this book. It is so unrelentingly, unrealistically depressing that I listed to a friend everything that happened to our main character, and she couldn't believe I finished reading it. Angst is substituted for depth and dreariness is substituted for reality (even in the real world, things DO occasionally go right, if only by accident). Take my warning -- stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful","review":"The Farseer Trilogy and the next installment of 3 books in the series written by Robin Hobb is an excellent read, however, the MP3 format of the Audiobooks is a bust. It does not \\"play on most modern electronic playback devices\\".

My mom is an author (published)and she totally loves this series. She even dedicated on of her books (that never ended up being published) to Fitz. But, I liked it, but it wasn't like my favorite book ever. I don't know, maybe I don't appreciate the true art in it because I'm a stupid teenager or something.So, it was good, and it's free, so I'd recommend buying it, and maybe you'll see some sort of greatness I don't. And if you're like me, no harm done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Hated the trilogy. Read the first 2 books waiting for something interesting or exciting to happen, didn't bother with the third book.

I guess I just don't understand what was being said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, enthralling and frustrating.","review":"In many ways this is a difficult book(s) to summarise. They start slowly and you really have to bear with it for a while. The further you get the more involved you get (as you should), but there is a downside. You feel increasingly frustrated by Fitz and his seeming talent at making stupid decisions and ending up bruised and battered. Robin Hobb seems to spend a LOT of time with Fitz on the doctors slab and after a while it wears a bit thin. Surely he'll win a fight some time soon... Overall though a really engrosing and entertaining read, well above the usual mediocrity of this tired genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleasant find","review":"It is nice to read a writer of current fantasy, that does not feel like they need to tell a story from the viewpoint of 6 or more major characters. Written in the first person, this book clips along at a very readable pace, while at the same time imparting a great deal of information. Alot of novels out there have alot of fluff in them, but very little of this novel was not important to the development of the main character, and the story itself. The main character, Fitz, is one that is familiar to alot of fantasy, the child who has great powers that will soon be called upon to 'save the world', but the similarity to most other fantasy novels ends there. Fitz is a flawed character who one can care for, but we learn quickly that not everything he does is 'the right thing' as in so much other fantasy.I'm very much looking forward to reading more of Hobbs novels, and would happily reccomend this novel for anyone who enjoys SF or fantasy.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively wonderful","review":"I have a small fetish for reading about assassins (Don't even ask) so naturally I picked up the book at learned more about it online. Robin Hobb is such an amazing author. Her talent for creating abilities regarding the Wit and Skill mirrors her immense imagination. By trial and error, FitzChivalry realizes his place and gaines knowledge, making friends in the least predictable places, such as with Molly, the Fool, and especially Chade. You will quickly take sides against many characters, and will learn to dislike them as much as Fitz does, as Robin conveys emotions extremely well. I remember crying at two parts in this book. (Hey, I'm female...) Characters like Rusrick and Verity are very unforgettable-they'll stay around your mind. For those people who can't bear the first chapter or so, please stick with it, I promise you won't regret it, especially with the fast pace ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for book lovers!","review":"I have read this series over and over. More times than I can count, and not once has it lost its ability to pull me into the story. So much so that I find myself feeling and relating to the characters. You are drawn into the depths of Fitz's life. His joys and sorrows, triumphs and losses. Robin Hobb is truly a master of her art. I doubt I will ever tire of this world of hers. I still end up feeling lonely when I finish the series. Like I've lost a good friend. If you want a really good book that entertains and makes you think, this is it. Bravo Robin!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless great read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Very well crafted written in 1st person from the main character. It's a hero's journey (with a well developed emotional arc) filled with political intrigue, well defined characters, a touch of romance, and great obstacles with clever plotting. Not many ideas are shockingly original, however, Robin Hobb expertly weaves character and plot together so that the story as a whole is a fantastic addictive read that kept me up many late nights.Addendum: I just finished the Tawny Man series, which concludes Fitzchilvarly's journey. It is a fantastic ending to the life of Fitz. If you decide to take this adventure, make sure you finish; it's worth it! There are a couple books (the last book of the Farseer Trilogy is the worst, and the first book of the Tawny Man is a slow start) that weren't so great in this series - don't give up because of them; the rest of the journey of Fitz is a joy and pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this cookware","review":"My only regret is not discovering the Oneida cookware sooner. I did research with a trusted test kitchen and this cookware beat out ones that were much more expensive. I think the only reason it didn't get higher marks was because of the handles.

By the end, I guarantee you'll be asking yourself, \\"is that all there is?!?\\" It's like the filmmaking team simply quit at the halfway point and just figured they could throw in any predictable, boring ending. And that's what they did. I suggest to my friends that they not waste their money on this film, despite the packaging and the trailer.SPOILER ALERT: Al least half the movie is spent wandering aimlessly and (with one very very brief exception) through a disused outdoor plant \\"labyrinth\\" utterly without any kind of surprise or \\"horror\\" or, really, anything interesting. You WILL fastforward several times during these tedious scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"English subtitles makes more sense than the Japanese version","review":"Been waiting for a while to get the series since my buddies have the japanese versions and the english subtitles just doesn't make sense at times. The rough translation sucks. Saw the S.A.V.E. editon on netflix and the voice over and subtitles makes sense and now it is better watching it and understanding what is going on. Searched for it on amazon and Bam! found it.If you like anime or this title, get it in the S.A.V.E. version. You won't be disappointed. Fourth stage have more races to enjoy.Hope they make a 5th stage or a feature on his dad Bunta when he was young and driving wild back in the days. That would be awesome. 24 episodes, 4 discs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular picture","review":"This is a great TV, especially for the price. I have an LCD and a DLP, and assumed the picture would be roughly comparable. Not even close. This set blows away the others. For less than $1500 (I think it is now down to closer to $1300), you will be amazed at how remarkable the picture is. As noted by other reviewers, the sound is also surprisingly good.As between the 5064 and the cheaper model, I would go for this one, even if you don't need the anti-glare screen. The Wiselink function that works with the USB port is great. It seemlessly processes .jpg and .mp3 files to create unbelievable slide shows with background music. Your high-megapxel family photos will look absolutely outstanding on this screen -- clearer than your 8\\" digital picture frame.Buy this TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV","review":"Our new 50\\" Samsung 5064 arrived the other day from Amazon. The shipping was fast and the guy from Eagle wouldn't leave until the set was plugged in. Our new entertainment center had not yet arrived, so I just unboxed it there on the floor and plugged it in. After the Eagle guy left I finished removing the packing from beneath the TV and found that the base was defective. The metal was broken underneath the plastic base cover and the TV was leaning to one side. The TV itself was working fine and I determined that all I needed was a new base. I called Amazon and the customer service lady gave me the toll free Samsung phone number and said \\"if Samsung doesn't take care of your problem we will\\". I then called Samsung and explained my problem. They sent a new base for the TV which was very simple to install...Great TV and customer service from both Amazon and Samsung."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Television; Perfect Price","review":"The television was delivered on time as promised.

Comes with a stand but I mounted mine on the wall and it looks great. Loads of setting options you'll definately find something that suits your situation.

It shipped the same day and was delivered by a 3rd party delivery service about 4 days later. Superfast! They unpacked it, and took all of the packing materials away.

The computer went out in the TV. HP replaced the TV as they could not fix the problem. The technician, (whom was wearing an HP shirt and name badge), that installed the new TV said that with the new TV my warranty resets. He told me this because I expressly asked \\"what happens if the new TV ends up having the same problem?\\" Less than 9 months later the new TV also broke with the same computer problem. I contacted HP technical department and I was told that the warranty explained to me by the HP technician was incorrect. They went as far as to try and say that the technician was from a 3rd party and didn't work for HP. I asked for the 3rd parties name and was told that HP wasn't required to give me that information.

They would have connected the set and checked to make sure it functioned correctly had I been ready for it to arrive. It came 3 days earlier than estimated.I have had no problems with any of the inputs, including the computer and wiselink ports. They all function with no problems.My only issue would be that the factory default settings really emphasize the greens. I had to tone them back to get a realistic looking picture, but that was very simple.

Well paced & thought-out (with story notes in & around the introduction), and only slightly hindered by a lack a familarity with the players and an unintentionally funny remark about the un-likelyhood of Spielberg winning an Oscar.

A nun of her conviction not returning to the convent?The story had promise... history repeating itself, and a celebration of the internal strength of women. But I felt sad and cheated in the end. The fate of Beata and Daphne should not have been left hanging. Amadea assumed they died, and they probably did.

It was as if, she got to a certain word lengthn, and simply quit writing the story because she'd written too much already.

I couldn't put it down. I cried alot. I lent it to my mom and she finished it in 2 days. She loved it also. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best.","review":"I initially listened to this book and then went out and boughtit to have in my library. Quite honestly, I am not the biggest Danielle Steele's fan, but every now and then she writes a bookthat gets past her standard brief romantic fiction novel. This was one of those books. I also, however, gave her a four instead of a five due to the failure to address the issue of what happens to her mother and sister. The idea, I suppose, was to assume that they perished. However, it is possible that one or both survived. It would have been more interesting, however, to hint, at the end, that the sister had survived. This, in turn, would lead to a sequel. What a sequel, it might also be, if shefinds her sister, but the sister immigrates to Israel and becomes involved in Israel's beginning in the late 40's. But it is a wonderful book, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Tripe!","review":"Put your wallet away! This book was amazing...ly bad. The story itself had possibilities (had it followed a more believable vein), however, it was poorly written in the extreme. My high school English teacher would have run out of red ink, had she graded this novel. (Shame on Random House! Did an editor ever even glance at this before it went to print?) My main complaint is the complete lack of basic language skills, demonstrated in print, and inflicted on the unwary public. This was my first, and last, Danielle Steel novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"This book could have been so much better than it was. I applaud the direction of the book but there are so many gaps and no real depth to the story. This book is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Composition for Compost","review":"This is the saddest book I have ever read. I don't mean sad as regards the story, I mean sad as regards the composition; there is none. I gave it one star because a negative rating was not available. \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" (the original primary reader) has more of a plot. I've seen better writing on a subterranean cave wall in France. I read four lines from every other page and had the story down cold, that is to say I was shivering cold from the ague this book gave me. The title refers to the word \\"stupid\\" that continues to echo in my head for buying this book. Anyone who purchased this book should get a tax write-off as an educational expense for the subtitle that should be on the cover; \\"The Complete Idot's Guide\\".* (*Registered trademark of the Penquin Group)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Loved this book","review":"This was my first Danielle Steel book that I have read. I loved it so much it was hard for me to put down to go to sleep at night. I like to read books about Germany, and the wars and to see how the authors charactors get through the book and just to see what all will happen. But I would recommend this book to anybody who has thougth about reading a Danielle Steel book. I will continue to read her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive to a Fault","review":"While I found the story to be good.....the actual writing was not good. I thought it was extremely horribly repetitive. We know she has blue eyes, we know she is beautiful, we know it is a waste that she is a nun because she is so beautiful. We know because we are told over and over and over.Also, if Amadea was such a devoted nun, so true to her calling, she sure found it easy enough to fall in love with not only one, but two men in this story.At one point Amadea gives a guy a little shove, he trips over a tree root and falls. Just like that he is dead. How convenient to the story...but terribly unrealistic.At the end you never find out what happens to Gerard Daubigny or if Amadea ever sees her Uncle again.This story leaves one wondering if Danielle Steel couldn't sell it 20 years ago and now anything with her name on it will sell. I felt like the editors didn't even bother going over it.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT HER BEST BUT STILL A GOOD READ","review":"This is one of the better books that Danielle Steel has written lately. I enjoyed most of the book but agree with others that it would have been nice to find out what happened to Beata and Daphne unless Danielle Steel is planning a sequel to tell us what did happen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tale of Cold War Doom or Valid prediction for Tomorrow","review":"I read this book when it came out in 1959.It left a lasting impression on me and I have been somewhat a survivalist ever since.As it was written then about the real proximity of Global thermo nuclear war it has since drifted into perceived irrelevance.Unfortunately, I beleive its true relevance is actually greater now than it was then and also unfortunately it's gloomy outcome even more likely.Things truly do not end well in this book.I fear with our over appropriation and misuse of resources and our trusting of governments, institutions and especially corporations to be better than the people who make them up we have left ourselves vulnerable to an inevitable and cataclysmic outcome which is already beginning to unfold.This book represents a solid worst case scenario for our own near future as well as it did then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still giving me chills 40 years later","review":"As a child, I devoured every science fiction book at our local library. I was confined to the Juvenile section (Mushroom Planet series! The White Mountains! A Wrinkle in Time!) until age 12, when youthful patrons were allowed to cross the divide and browse for books in the (gasp) Adult section.Rather than provide a review, I will quickly share that the book is perhaps too intense for sensitive (e.g. younger) readers. Someday, I may read it again, but sadly I had nightmares for years after reading the book as a child. It was my first encounter with post-apocalyptic literature, and the themes presented in the book seriously affected my rather naive world view.If you're a parent of a precocious reader, you may want to take a look before little junior dives in so you can be prepared to answer questions and discuss the implications of nuclear annihilation. It would have been comforting to me to have had a little guidance on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old book, Very cool story","review":"For a book written in 1954 this book is really well done. In fact If I had not known it was written in 54 I would not have been able to tell. This book is written from a journal perspecitive of a minuteman that goes 4000 feet underground. It has many dark perspectives as this button pusher explores his own feelings on the \\"End of Times\\" and killing billions of people with just a few buttons. I really thought this book was a fun read. It is only about 200 pages long so if you like the short book this one is for you. It is not super action pacted but I still gave it a 5 star rating as the button pusher explores some darker elements of human kind and there ability to destroy the world with the push of a button. I also thought it was great how he never says USA vs Russia, He has a way of avoiding that distinction. He leaves it open. There is also an underlying theme here about total destruction. Read and find out what happens, if the end happens and if it did who survives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once I started reading this book, I could't put it down","review":"I was stationed in Scotland at a nuclear sub base during the 60's. I don't remember how I came across this book but once I started to read it, I could't put it down until I finished it. This book really makes you realized just what could happen in the event of an all out nuclear war. The author covers every aspect of what life would be like on earth when most of the earth's surface is wiped out. This book should be made into a movie. When I read it, it was during the Kennedy and Kruschev era when we lived in fear of a push of a button. This should be a must reading for all students world wide."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Nuclear War Parable","review":"This isn't a novel as much as it is a parable (or a fable) warning of the dangers of dehumanized war -- push button destruction. The characters are two dimensional, but the funny part is that their government actually recruited disfunctional sociopaths for the job, so maybe they really are two dimensional!Both sides in this conflict use the most out of control, frightening versions of nuclear weapons to make sure they do a thorough job of destroying the earth. Even so they think themselves safe, but of course noone is safe in THIS kind of war.I thought the ending was a little hard to believe, but it was still quite interesting to read.

I must disagree. Szpilman describes life in the getto and life in hiding quite vividly. He talks of his amazing circumstances, his thoughts of suicide, feelings of loneliness, his wishing that he knew his little sister better but knowing that it would never be, and how he survived these incredible circumstances. He helps us, those who were not there, to better understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angst and Redemption of a Pianist in Nazi Poland","review":"This is the unbelievable true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, who lived in Poland during the Nazi occupation and subsequent annihilation of its Jewish population. His survival amidst incredible brutality and cruelty is an astounding story, told with the objectivity and impassiveness of one determined to survive. I could not put this book down, and was very moved by this story of one man's determination to live amidst Nazi murder and mayhem. It illustrates the horrors of war, hatred and racism vividly, and has an uplifting ending. This is a book not to be missed, a classic for all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAD BUT NECESSARY READING","review":"For the student of the Holocaust this eye-witness account, orginally written in 1945, is sad but necessary reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do You Like Being Amazed?","review":"Out of literally millions of Polish Jews this one man, the author,survived and stayed in the same geographical place while all others were sent to death camps.

This is a small book with a big story."},{"rating":"2","title":"RARE LOOK AT LIFE IN THE WARSAW GHETTO","review":"The are several books detailing the horrors of the Holocaust and although each and every person's story is important, this book is very unique. One man's story of survival in Warsaw during World War II offers a new perspective on the Holocaust. Although this perspective is none the less chilling, it does help break stereotypes which continue today and shows that good and evil existed among both the German and Jewish populations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that should be feautured in the top 10 books to read!","review":"This book is one of the best true stories of a Jewish Man's struggle to live in Warsaw during the II World war. It was really was an eye-opener and gave me a real insight into what life was like in the ghetto during this period that no historian could.The story was depressing and horrifing throughout, with tradgic events occuring all around him. But in the end to come out of all that and still be alive is amazing in itself. Also to write this story just after the event even better!!! This is as all the things that took place during that time would be fresh in the mind and so to would all the feeling assoicated with them.The thing that really struck me was that thought the book there was no mean / horrible word said about the Germans. No hatred towartds them, even though they were the root of the pain he suffered in the book.I would recommend this book as a must for this summer!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful testimony","review":"I was not aware of \\"The Pianist\\" (the book) until I saw the movie, which won Oscars for best director, best actor, and best adapted screenplay. After seeing the movie, I wanted to know more, so I read this book. Wladyslaw Szpilman provides an amazing accounting of his ordeal during Nazi's invasion & occupation of Poland. This book is for those who think they know everything about the Holocaust. Most coverage has focused on Germany or the death camps, but this book has a unique point of view: a Jew who, against all odds, survived the Nazi occupation of Poland. Humanity's capacity for evil and capacity for hope & survival are all displayed here in Szpilman's book. It is heartwrenching to read, but I think absolutely necessary and vital so history does not repeat itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror as it was lived and not in retrospect.","review":"The reviews of The Pianist appearing here are all good and accurate. There is little I can add except to say that it is salutary to read something written before the dust of political correctness can settle. This is, despite its unrelenting decent into horror, an optimistic book especially to those open to the possibility that the answer indeed might lay in Jesus admonishment to love one another.A footnote: My son, a Catholic priest, shares the same name with the then Mayor of Warsaw mentioned on page 38.A book for those who take encouragement where ever they can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Be Honest...","review":"I do feel that this book is good, but the detail in this book is far to scarce for a subject so strong. Sometimes the lack of detail makes you skip over very imprortant parts of the story, and the writer just made all of the events feel like nothing happened, and he never tell you how he felt in that situation.A good book, but not quite there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear and Indifference","review":"Through graphic depiction and sincere emotion, Szpilman recounts the period of his life filled with pain, death, and destruction during the Holocaust in Warsaw. Szpilman recalls the ghastly remorseless actions of German soldiers and Jewish police officers in his attempts to escape execution. Through his travels from dark attics and abandoned flats, Szpilman encounters the ultimate tragic flaw in the human psyche, indifference. After fleeing from one place of hiding to another, Szpilman learns of the radical change in the German war effort, their defeat. Through Szpilman's descriptions and emotional portrayals of family, friends, and the inhabitants of Warsaw, he teaches the reader the true beauty of existence and art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful off-course read!","review":"Reading this book makes one think this acutally happened!

I can never thank him enough ! This is without argument one of the finest books I have read and it is an amazing effort by J. Michael Veron. For anyone remotely passionate about golf this is a must read. This book transports you to another era, to when golf was in it's infancy and our nation was as well. The name Bobby Jones has always conjured up images of insurmountable golf achievements, this book brings to life the man and his unshakable devotion to someone seemingly unworthy of his cosideration. Loyalty, True Friendship, Devotion, Respect and Honor are all attributes that emerge in this captvating book. Anyone who reads this will forever have a deeper appprecation of the above traits and an increased fondness for the essence of the great game of golf."},{"rating":"2","title":"What If?","review":"This book was fantastic. I read it in about one day. I found myself actually rooting for Beau Steadman while I was reading the book. The book moves like a thriller, and for golf enthsiasts, it is a must read. Read this book and live it along with the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Veron writes like a lawyer","review":"J. Michael Veron apparently sat down to write The Greatest Player Who Never Lived in the same manner a trial lawyer would write a closing argument. He tells us what he's going to say, then he says it, then he sums up what he just said. There was very little tension in the story, only piles of documents to sift through along with the main character. It is at times laborious reading with a pleasant twist at the end.

After turning them on, I couldn't believe how flat and lifeless they sounded. I gave them two weeks to break in, but they never improved. I had MTX coaxials before and they sounded pretty decent. These just didn't have any definition or \\"sizzle\\" to them at all.

Little new light is shed on the topics Professor Fukuyama purports to cover.

It ruins the listening experience to have to adjust the volume between tracks. One track can be so very soft, the next disturbingly loud.Subtract one star for the ridiculous price of this CD, considering the poor quality described above.For the insert explaining the songs, despite the typographical errors, leave a star. Besides, this rating system won't allow for zero stars.This is not a comment on the artist, only on the label. I have collected all of his work, even though it is a bit too westernized for my taste.

What's missing are \\"quizzes\\" to help figure out what temperament you are and helpful hints on working with others of different temperaments. The information is presented in an easy-to-read conversational style.

As an escape attempt, his expedition failed - what he had learned from books proved inadequate in the field and he quickly began to starve. The generosity of Swazi strangers, who laid out food in remote places once they realized that he would not approach them for help, kept him alive. Eventually, he got to know his neighbors, and became a sort of cultural liason between archaeologists and the descendents of local ancients whose artifacts were riddles to the scientific community. Lyall Watson's slightly imaginative biography of this prodigal spirit is rich in anthropological detail and illustrated with simple but evocative sketches of some of the artifacts that Adrian's interviews with rural healers and magicians have helped to explain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor and Crime","review":"Of course another great book by Danny.

The gobble won, and it was gone all too soon.Firstly, I want to echo all of what Pen Name said about it. Yes, that review was all true and right on.Secondly, I want to add that as a transman, it was very validating and perhaps normalizing to have so much of what I've experienced in transition described with a depth and accuracy that's been missing when I talk with other transmen about it.When i asked my partner to read the book and give me her take on it, she complained that she'd already watched me go through transition and there was nothing new to be gleaned.

I recommend reading other Welsh fiction first such as Sharon Kay Penman's series starting with \\"Here Be Dragons\\". Then you will be familiar with welsh names, places, georaphy, and history; otherwise you can become confused as many Welsh names are unfamiliar. I know that by reading her series first, this book went smoother as I could concentrate on the plot. There are power struggles between kingdoms as well as between ruling families, constant deception and intrigue-- never a dull moment as something you thought you were following-- suddenly changes.

It's probably less factual than the film version of John Dillinger's exploits that director John Milius made in the seventies. So why do I recommend this film over Milius' more polished account? Well, this film in a campy, over-the-top way is just so entertaining. Secondly, Lawrence Tierney in the title role is such a magnetic screen presence. His tough ferocity keeps the film's campier elements in check and grounds it in some semblance of reality. There's also a good supporting cast here with gangster veterans Marc Lawrence and Elisha Cook Jr. (seems like he's in all these noir-gangster flicks) on hand. The story is told here crisply and in an economical 70 minutes so if you have an hour plus to kill there's worse ways to do it. Oh, John, if only you had the two bucks to pay for the drinks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dillinger","review":"Poverty Row Monogram's biggest hit dealing with subject matter the major studios agreed not to touch. The budget was so small they had to lift the big heist scene from Fritz Lang's YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE, but the taut little script is well cast. Tierney radiates menace and Edmund Lowe as his jailhouse mentor does a nice deterioration from commanding to sniveling. Nice bits of jarring violence, even if off-screen: a face-mauling w/ a broken beer mug, a gunning down of a sweet old couple, and an ax murder. Good, clean fun. 7/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Dillinger's Deadly Game..","review":"Lawrence Tierney is convincing as John Dillinger in this 1945 gangster film \\"Dillinger\\", based on truth and fictional events. The film starts with Dillinger as a small time hood who is put away behind bars for a robbery, building up to his public enemy #1 status. John Dillinger becomes the country's most wanted outlaw. The film doesn't waste any time getting to the point, running a short seventy eight minutes. The story covers important exploits of the notorious gangster,although the film also portrays a couple murders that Dillinger never actually committed. Lawrence Tierney does his part, but not the same impact of Warren Oates in his career best performance as the outlaw - \\"Dillinger\\" is an interesting look about a man who lived dangerously and drove down the fast lane to the fatal end,accompanied by the lady in red,(Anne Jeffreys).

At Morland Place in the north, James's wife, Mary Anne, spends as much time away with her father as she does at home and while there on a visit, suffers the consequences of mixing with the poor and diseased who are battling cholera.

Lastly, the recipes were made by an expert and thats all that can make these recipes, seasoned experts. In my opinion, the worst cocktail book out on the market today."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an annoying book!","review":"This book was lent to me when I broke my leg last month \\"to make me forget my pain.\\" What pain? Claire, the narrator, is one of the most annoying characters I've ever met in fiction, self-absorbed, flighty, superficial, drunkard, shop-aholic, and we're supposed to sympathize with her antics? Not to mention her crazy sisters... The husband character in the story changes from being one of the most wonderful guys in the world to being a nit-picking jerk, which demonstrates either what a dim-wit Claire is at having so misjudged him, or a real flaw in the writer's skill. I stopped reading the book short of the last couple of chapters, it's just too painful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic waste of time!","review":"Don't bother with this book - it is truly an insult to one's intelligence - I can't beleive this trash was published as a \\"bestseller\\"!I had to force myself through it in the hope that one of the numerous (badly timed & totally irrelevant) asides would actually have one iota of humour.You can't sympathize with the main character (or indeed give 2 hoots about ANY of the characters) because they are so transparently paper thin & predictable.Don't waste your time. I know I have. This was a very disappointing offering from a usually quite talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!!!","review":"I bought this book based solely on the reviews I read on Amazon. What a disappointment. I love a good romance, but I think too many romance readers out there are too easily pleased. As long as the author manages to string a few coherent sentences together, it's reviewed as \\"THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!\\" Maybe I'm too picky, but I know I'd certainly appreciate reading more critical reviews.That said, I want more from a book than one dimensional characters who seem to have only one genuine emotion -- lust. This novel's heroine is beyond vapid -- she's stupid and annoying, and her love interest isn't much better. I'm not going to re-summarize the plot since I'm sure another review already has. Let's just say if you enjoy cotten candy, this book's for you. If you're looking for something with more substance, I'd keep on searching.Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Irresistible","review":"A page turner that keeps you up all night. Impossible to put down.Funny with wacky characters that you would adore to have in your life.Irresistible and wickedly hilarious.Truly compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beach Book","review":"This book is very funny. I really enjoyed it. It was a light read and entertaining - perfect for summer. I did find the fact that he left her right after she delivered and his blatant lack of interest in their daughter TOTALLY infuriating. Claire seemed to focus more on the fact that he left her and not as much on the manner in which he left her.For those of you with kids - can you even imagine being left hours after you deliver?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to Maeve Binchy-style","review":"I love Maeve Binchy and was looking for recommendations of similar writers/stories -- this is NOT it. Other than having \\"family in Ireland\\", that is where the similarities ended. There was no depth to any of the characters, just a lot of surface generalizations, i.e., Mom can't cook, Anna is a \\"flower child\\", Dad is a pushover, Helen is spoiled. I wasn't even able to muster up much empathy for the main character (really? you're 29 years old and you run home to your overly accommodating parents to wallow in self-pity for over a month?) I spent so much time skimming over the imaginary conversations this character kept having in her head and kept wishing there was more meat to the story. Perhaps if I wasn't expecting so much, I wouldn't have been so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I wasted my time on this book!","review":"I thought this book was terrible. It was an absolutley typical story about love and loss - done 1000 times over. There were so many little sub stories that began to develop, only to disappear and never be seen again in the story (i.e. the crazy gardener). The ending was SO predictable. Frankly I can't believe anyone agreed to publish this piece of garbage. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A feel good story that will make anyone laugh out loud!","review":"The slightly neurotic main character Claire is someone every woman I know can relate to. Her personal problems and quirky personality make her completely lovable. I couldn't put the book down. Even though the end of the book was semi-predictable and sugar coated....I LOVED IT!! If you want a great summer time read that will leave you feeling refreshed, \\"Watermelon\\" is exactly what you need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IRISH HUMOUR AT IT'S BEST!!","review":"OOPS, SORRY - I goofed (see previous review) - \\"Watermelon\\" has nothing in common with \\"Lucy Sullivan's . . . .\\" It is Ms. Keyes's 3rd book (available from Amazon.co.uk)called \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" which introduces another sister of Clare's. Very funny, also sad - a must-read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"After reading \\"Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married,\\" which I found mildly entertaining, I thought it might be worhtwhile to pick up another of Keyes's novels. I regret the impulse. We are introduced to Claire as she, almost simultaneously, gives birth to a daughter and is abandoned by her husband. Not to worry, though -- in less than two months she's back in her pre-pregnancy clothes and back in the sack with a new man. The baby seems incidental; every so often Claire remembers that she's a mother and acts accordingly -- for about two pages.In attempting to create a delightfully fey, girlish character, in fact, Keyes has given us a raving narcissist. Grindingly repetitive interior monologues stand in for character and story development. It's a shame, because Keyes is not a bad writer on the whole, and she shows occasional flashes of real wit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Stop Laughing!!","review":"I laughed until I cried... This is the first and the best of Keyes' books. I've read three of her other books, and they pale in comparison. \\"Lucy Sullivan Gets Married\\" is decent, but kind of long. Trust me, you'll laugh until you cry with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent first novel to be followed by Lucy Sullivan got Married and then Rachel's Holiday which will leave you holding your sides in parts. Buy all three."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"The fact that her husband tells her he is leaving her the day after the birth of their daughter is the only original thing I could found in the book. For the rest... a shallow, selfish and immature woman's ego trip. And the end! Her husband cheats on her because he loves her too much? Oh, boy! And predictably, she has fallen in love with someone else... in a month!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, and Entertaining","review":"This book was great! Marian Keyes has a awesome way with characters. I couldn't put it down. The walsh family is a classic. I'm waiting for the book about Helen. I have read all the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"New baby, wayward husband, crazy family...","review":"Claire really has it all! This is a nice beach reading book. Our heroine is very sympathetic, her family is as eccentric as they are well-meaning, and her spirit will NOT be defeated by any of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her worst book","review":"Having started this book eagerly after \\"Is Anyone Out There?\\", I was amazed it was the same author. This book had a good story line possibility: however it never filled out. I didn't like Claire by midpoint of the book, and it didn't get better. She was so wishywashy about everything! And by the time she and James were meeting to talk, I felt she deserved him. He seemed a bit of a sociopath to me, and many parts just didn't seem to add up at all. At the end I didn't care what happened to her. I had ordered this book along with several others.Thankfully, \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" was next, and renewed my faith in Ms. Keyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, easy-to-read book","review":"This was my first Marian Keyes book and certainly won't be my last! I picked it up at a friend's house to avoid dying of boredom during a basketball game and was quickly absorbed and giggling. I love Keyes' wry wit and easy to read language.I rate the first half of the book 5 out of 5 stars, but the second half is not as good and does drag on a little. I definitely laughed more during the first half. The end is fairly predictable but perfect for this kind of book.All in all, a fun, entertaining book that I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read, kinda predictible but great language","review":"Well, I have to admit I wasn't all that surprised by her husband leaving her in the first chapter - that was made pretty clear on the cover. The character goes through the expected anger, denial, bargaining, etc. and the ending was WAY too convenient but the internal dialogue that the character had was a HOOT to read. It reminded me of a kind of female version of \\"High Fidelity\\" - in a \\"is that what we really think?\\" kind of way. I really enjoyed reading about the quirky family in Dublin. Indeed, the main character is neurotic, obsessed, and very similar to Bridget Jones and Ally McBeal but that seems to be the trend in female characterization - not something I'm overjoyed about but, hey, it's fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made me laugh and cry, it was great!","review":"Watermelon by Marian Keyes is one of the best books I have read in the past few years. The plot was very true to life with such a positive outlook to the future! All of the characters were so unique and quirky. They all brought something special to the story. I highly recommend Watermelon to anyone who wants a heartfelt, funny book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent, Laugh Out Loud Funny","review":"Marian Keyes has done it again. Watermelon is such a great book. This book follows Claire and her newborn daughter on their journey to survive after Clarie's husband James leaves them. Unsure what to do, Claire returns to her parents' house in Dublin where her two younger sisters still live. The plot that follows is touching, funny, and highly unexpected."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem.","review":"This is the book that got me hooked on Marian Keyes. In this fantastic story, you meet a family portrayed with such vivid detail - warts and all, and are introduced to the sisters who you will learn more about with each Keyes book written hence. She's hilarious, and covers some dark material too. I have given this book to so many friends -- if I knew you, I'd give it to you, too. If you have a Saturday or Sunday to spend, pick this up and read it from start to finish. It'll steal a day of your life, but it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like to read about whiners, go for it!","review":"It was absolutely painful to get through this book about a self-obsessed young woman who can't see beyond her own pathetic life. I wanted to shake her and slap her into reality. Pages and pages of heartache about her forlorn lovelife are just plain depressing. I really felt such hatred for this character that the \\"humor\\" fell flat for me. There are far better ways to spend your time than reading such drivel. This book is so bad that I won't even try to sell it at my garage sale. I'd hate for someone else to waste their time with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First Novel-itis","review":"This book has \\"first novel\\" written all over it. It's desperate attempts to come off as hip and clever, merely seem precious. The characters are not believable, the comically \\"quirky\\" family is contrived, the \\"hilarious\\" sex girl-talk is just embarrassing. Maybe her other books are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read and pleasant","review":"This is the first Marian Keyes book I've ever read, given to me as a gift. It made for pleasant reading before bedtime, but took me a month to finish -- it definitely didn't keep me intrigued enough to keep me reading when I was tired, unlike some other really great novels. But, I'll read more Marian Keyes in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Hilarious Book","review":"Excellent and very funny. The 3 books she has written are marvellous & its about time she wrote more"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book!","review":"This book was wonderful. I enjoyed reading every word of it. I laughed and cried. I felt that Claire and I shared the same thoughts at times. The characters were so real. I hope to read more of Marian Keyes books."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Realistic","review":"I found the main character and the story to be unbelievable. There were also so many things that did not add up in the story. On one page she had gone for her 6 month check- up after the baby was born and on the next pages she said she had the baby 8 weeks ago. There were many more of these instances and it took away from the story. Her husband's explanation as to leaving her was written very poorly. She never once woke up in the middle of the night to feed the baby. It was almost as if the baby was an after thought. The whole book was a big waste of time. Rachel's Holiday was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book.........","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but alas I came away rather disappointed. I just did not find it as laugh out loud funny as many of the reviewers. The writing is weak, the plot predictable and the characters rather shallow. I am a huge fan of British humor, but I would advise readers to give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"After having read \\"The other side of the story\\", which was complex and multidimensional, I assumed all the other books by this author would be similar. Unfortunately, this one was the opposite - very predictable and boring. And the main character was too neurotic for my taste. I still liked the writing style, that's the only reason I finished the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I could not stand this book. I never met a character that talked so much. It was just so horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good juicy beach read for all fans of chick fic","review":"Well well well. What can I say?

Marian Keyes is hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have to say I bought this book with great expectations - maybe this was the reason for my big disappointment.I've watched a TV series based on Keyes' book Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married and enjoyed it so much that I was sure her other books would be funny/interesting as well. But this book was boring. It took me about 3 months to finish it, and I started reading a different book while still reading it, because it was too boring for me. Only a director with a lot of imagination could turn it into a lovely TV series..."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes and then ...","review":"Starting the book was mainly fun but 2/3rds through it began to drag. At the end I just felt sorry for the main character and wondered why I am reading it.

But never the less, if you like reading books and dont mind leaving it go after 60% it is fun to read ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"The main reason that I purchased \\"Watermelon\\" is that I really liked \\"Lucy Sullivan is getting Married\\" by Marian Keyes. But \\"Watermelon\\" is such a bad book. I found the main character Claire Webster to one of the unlikeable characters ever! And don't even start me on her crazy family. I couldn't even keep their names straight. I just don't understand how this book could be such a bestseller.Unless you are a fan of Marian Keyes, you may want to skip this book at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Marian, hurry with your next one...","review":"Leaving my home country I bought Rachel's Holiday as one of my leaving presents from my old work (book token). What a delight! I lent it all around to my friends and when my sister came to visit she read it during her holiday. Then... to my delight she bought me Marian's 2 other books respectfully for Christmas and birthday. Although Rachel's was my favourite, Watermelon and Lucy Sullivan are top also. All very different but what a great connection - the writing style and Ms Keyes' great descriptions. My favourite in Watermelon of when Claire is expecting to see James returned, sitting there in a dinner suit, hair greased down and smoking from a long cigarette holder...\\"my wife I presume\\". MK please please hurry with your next one, all the other authors are poor substitutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny...","review":"and surprisingly touching. I would highly recommend this book. The Walsh family were greatly entertaining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book stole a Sunday from me!","review":"I bought this book yesterday morning and stayed up until 2:30 reading it. It was a great read! I loved the character development, I was rooting for Claire, I despised James and got nervous every time a scene involved Helen. My particular favorite part was Claire's description of being a waitress. That was so accurate and hilarious!I grew a little impatient at the end and must admit that I skipped a lot of Claire's self talk and scanned the text for quote marks so I could get through it faster. But I have already bought this for someone else, I've recommended it to everyone at work and hope to read Lucy Sullivan next Sunday! Thank you Ms. Keyes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous romantic comedy--the ultimate \\"chick\\" book.","review":"The book is great fun. The characters are vivid, the humor wicked and the pace of the book is frenetic. If some of the plot elements are a bit predictable--and they are--no one will care as the vitality of the story and the writing overwhelm whatever minor flaws the book suffers from.This strikes me as the ultimate \\"chick\\" book similar to Nick Hornby's High Fidelity being the ultimate \\"guy\\" book. Both are exceedingly funny and can be read by \\"the other side\\" and still be apprciated and enjoyed immensely.A fast, easy enjoyable read. Take it with you on a plane trip--this book will relieve the unending tedium that travel now entails. Or better yet--give it to your significant other as a gift at Valentine's Day or a birthday. You can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh...","review":"This book had so much potential because the story is interesting and the characters endear themselves to you. Keyes, the author, ruins her book in the following way. She has this irritating tendency to explain her punch lines as though her audience consists of thick skulled neanderthals. Also, I found her rambling on style to be tedious. The heroine over-reacts to everything and mulls over and over-analyzes everything to the point of nausea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I enjoyed \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" and decided to try another book by Marian Keyes. I'm sorry I chose this one. While there were some amusing one-liners, I found little else to like. Nothing rang true - not the characters, not their relationships, and not the situations they found themselves in. I sympathized with Claire initially, but her self-absorbed babble wore thin all too soon. I got tired of the book about halfway through and skimmed to the end. I was almost sorry I did, because the scales were ridiculously tipped by the husband's behavior (though his description of Claire seemed pretty much spot on to me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, funny, and sad.","review":"Watermelon was a fun book to read -- I finished it in a day. But after reading Keyes's Lucy Sullivan, I was disappointed in Watermelon. Although both books had many of the same elements, I had a hard time relating to Watermelon's Claire. Claire's husband tells her that he is leaving her while she is in the hospital, having just delivered their first child. Claire flies home to her parents and sisters with her new baby and begins to heal. Only Marian Keyes can make a plot like this with laugh out loud humor. This is a book about heartbreak, survival and the importance of loving and supportive family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer read!","review":"I read this book last summer while my mother and I had a three day yard sale.

It's a very playful story that went too quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny fast read","review":"I was looking forward to reading \\"Watermelon\\" as I have been in a similar situation to Claire myself. I found it to be a really good light (but not trashy) read. The book is written as if Claire is talking to you, which means you really identify with her and all her insecurities. It was great when Claire realized that she was fine just the way she was and that she didn't need anyone in her life who couldn't accept that. Claire's family were excellent secondary characters, I can't wait to read \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" to hear more about them. Adam seemed a bit too good to be true, or maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places! The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have also read \\"Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married\\" and it had quite a lot more plot and was heaps longer than \\"Watermelon\\". Marian Keyes' books are so enjoyable to read, it's disappointing to have them end as quickly as \\"Watermelon\\" did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Funny, Funny!","review":"Watermelon is an excellent first novel. The main character, Claire, tells the story of how she learns to move on with her life after her husband, James, leaves her the day she gives birth to their daughter. Claire is a lighthearted character, and even when she's in tremendous pain over the deception and betrayal of her husband, she tells the reader all about it in a very comical manner. Claire's family, an odd and entertaining bunch themselves, are very supportive and loving while she heals from her pain and waits to see what will become of her marriage. And Adam, a handsome, younger man also helps Claire heal and see herself in a very different light. Claire has a witty, endearing voice that will make you love her immediately. The story itself is very interesting, and is told in a very comical manner, so you won't be able to put the book down. And the ending is very funny. Watermelon is an excellent summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"irritating","review":"This book is far too long for what it is trying to say. The writing is really really annoying, esp. the parts when different emotions like guilt and shame have conversations. Its so silly that it makes u feel like a nit wit.

I expected a wildly funny book. I don't get it. I thought the book was slighly humorous but mostly very dull. I finished it because I try to always finish the books I start, but it was really not very good. It is written first person with conversations with the heroine's subconscious. Some aspects were cute. But the characters were just weird and the overall story was not very good. It was a let down after the reviews. After reading Watermelon I would certainly not read any other books by Marian Keyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"watermelon","review":"A very whitty, and entertaining book. I love the characters, and I only gave it 4 stars because I know Marian Keyes has done better in other books. But if there was such a thing as 4 and a half, that's what I would have given this book.

The majority of characters are caricatures of old standards, and they all contain that particular quirk or eccentricity particular to characters in novels of British origin.

Perhaps it was the clever title...but at any rate, I'm glad I did. Lots of attractive characters, two murder victims who get what they deserve, more victims who don't deserve what they get, and a light touch throughout. I was especially charmed by Charlie.I finished \\"Monkeewrench\\" the same day I started it - always a good sign - and will look for the authors again, definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!! What a fantastic first effort!","review":"I have to say I was intrigued when I read the synopsis of this novel in a BMC magazine and quickly added it to my must read list. I sure am glad I did. This book had everything one could possibly want in a story, drama, mystery, humor, plot turns and twists, characters rich in personality, and a great story line. The book is sooooo well written! It was a sheer delight to read.The suspense was wonderful and just when I thought I knew who did it...surprise! This happened a couple times. If this is their first effort, I can't wait to see what is to come. Hopefully they won't change their writing style. More authors need to take notice. The story flowed almost like watching a movie, and it was over so quickly. Speaking of movie, this story would make a great movie. I just can't seem to say enough about it.

I can't imagine you would regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's got a feeling of reality to it.","review":"ok, it's not that i think that the plot of this book would actually occur...although nothing would surprise me. it's that this book centers around a couple of cops in - what - minneapolis? versus nyc, l.a. or vegas or some other csi-ish location. the cops feel like real people and i like that. the story is a good one, too. i wouldn't call it a page-turner, but it certainly kept me anticipating what came next and did a good job of laying out story paths i could assume i was on only to be surprised later that the story went in a different direction. that's fun for me and i liked it! i read \\"snow blind\\" out of order and liked it, too. i am looking forward to reading the rest of the series from this inspired mother/daughter writing duo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand the accolades","review":"This is the worst book that I have finished in five years.

This would have been a higher-rated book if it wasn't for the derogatory remarks about weight throughout the whole book. This person was fat, this person was huge, this person was giant and on and on. At first I thought it was just descriptive writing so the reader could visualize the characters, but soon I realized remarks would be made about characters middles throughout the whole book. I have never read a book that so blatantly displayed the authors disdain for people who are unable to control their weight! I can't believe I read as much of the book as I did, and will not read any of the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut","review":"It's incredible that this book is a debut novel; it's that good. Richly developed characters and intriguing mystery make this a speedy read. The gang at Monkeewrench, a software gaming company, are hiding from a former tragedy, all rallying around their leader, Grace. She is deeply wounded and so closed off that it's amazing she's brave enough to venture from her home. That she does makes her the character that steals every scene she's in. While the majority of the book follows the homicide detectives (both likable), it's the passages with the Monkeewrench gang that make this mystery engaging. Grace is like no other heroine in current mysteries. Give it a try.

I have found a new favorite author (actually plural,a mother and daughter team no less.) This book was an incredibly interesting first attempt in the serial killer genre. I honestly was hooked by the end of chapter 1. As the story shifts from Wisconsin to Minnesota, with similar characters in each locale, a computer game dealing with a serial killer has been designed by 5 computer geeks. Their history goes back to college 10 years before. As their game is played out in reality, we cannot guess the perpetrator or the motive. I loved this book...a 2 day read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters, Great Storyline","review":"This is such a great book!

This combined effort didn't work for me. I know this was ficton but so much was too unbelievable. The friendships between the main character Grace and her friends was hard to accept it was too extreme. The way Grace lived if you called that living didn't make me feel empathic it just annoyed me. Their secret past, the 2 mysteries and the past mystery didn't hold my interest. The authors tried too hard to make a complex suspense.There was no suspense, no build up because I figured it out before page 75 and I wasn't even trying. One simple sentence gave the plot away. From them on it was down hill.

The Wiggles in the car are... not right. My son said it best when he said \\"mommy, why are the Wiggles mad?\\" They have horrible expressions on their faces, like they all look like Dr Spock with weird raised eyebrows and skinny long faces. Very weird.I ended up using it for his cake, but I'll warn you that if I had known what it was going to look like, I would have bought something else or figured out a way to decorate it myself.Do Not Buy This Product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wiggles Cake Topper!","review":"My first son had this on his second birthday cake.

At this point...I did have to glue Jeff's head back on and the paint is chipping...but he still LOVES it. I plan to get another new set for him for his second birthday.There are VERY few sprinkles.

When I saw the album on amazon.com I decided that was what I wanted. I ordered it and it is perfect. When I listen to it I can see Andy in my mind and it's like he is right here with me.

Born without arms, she never saw herself as handicapped, but as a \\"normal armless person.\\" She's one amazing woman. I'm proud to say I've known her for over 20 years and consider her my \\"surrogate\\" mom.While I knew much of her story from countless mornings at her kitchen counter, there were certain stories that she chose not to share over the coffee cups. This book filled in the details for me and made me even more aware of her triumph and spirit.Morton's writing style is often choppy and mostly narrative. It would have been a stronger story with more quotes from the loved ones in Mary's life, or recollections from Mary herself. Even with that minor distraction, I really enjoyed reading the story of a woman who never gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Inspiration","review":"Great, quick read.This well-written book underlines the fact that life is what you make of it. Any time a challenge approaches, hit it head-on knowing that the human spirit is capable of overcoming tremendous odds.

It was informative and accurate of the current treatments etc. but to be honest I am grateful I read this book after I had researched many forms of therapy.Otherwise I would have been utterly depressed and without hope for my future. All the 'treatments' offer is symptom relief. There is no mention of improving immune status or joint repair i.e. healing. The list is endless, with the added bonus of all the drug side effects! And what about non invasive forms of pain relief like a simple heat pad? I thought the writers could have offered a lot more for sufferers.Most people flick through the tech stuff to get to the 'how to get well' section, let's be honest.As a health care professional of traditional background, I am realising that there is a huge wealth of info from Alternative Medicine that I once dimissed like my colleagues.

Serling's book on the electra is fascinating for two reasons: one, it is essentially the only published in-depth account of the airplane's accident history and two, it's rarity in both hardcover and paperback. It's destruction was due to \\"whirl mode\\", a combination of the harmonic frequency of the propellors and wing at cruise speed. If turbulence weakened an engine mount, the prop acted as an unstable gyroscope, transmitting different frequencies to the wing. When they matched the wing's harmonic frequency, it caused metal fatigue, resulting in structural failure. Aircraft engineers had not encountered this before.

English is evidently not her first language, grammar and spelling errors are the rule rather than the exception. The book is inadvertantly hilarious in places but does make a nice afterward or forward to Amy Wallace's more compelling and better written tell all. If you're interested in the rise and fall of Carlos and his inner circle you'll want to read FILMING CASTANEDA. Keep your expectations low and you might not be too disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise!","review":"I enjoyed reading this book immensely. I did not expect to find an engrossing story written with expertise about the author's interaction with Carlos Castaneda, the man of many mysteries. Having never met Castaneda, but only read his books, it was tremendously interesting peeking into his everyday life and seeing photographs of him and the people surrounding him.What struck me was how Carlos never noticed the two people following him around secretly for two years. And realising the all to human end of the magical creature that I had assembled in my mind was sobering, yet somehow comforting. I also appreciated the restraint of the author of not adding any second hand information to her book. All in all, I can heartily recommend this book.

It was actually quite good. The writer gives us a sneak peek at what went on in the underbelly of Castaneda-Land. For anyone who has followed this guy for the last 30+ years, it is interesting to know about such details. Same goes for the book by Amy Wallace. Both dish out a good taste of reality. Once you get beyond the initial shock you'll be glad you read them. You may also want to check out the website dedicated to the ongoing debate (www.sustainedaction.org). This will leave you hungry to buy more books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Filming Castaneda","review":"I found filming castaneda to be the most compelling book I have read for quite some time. It really gives a glimpse into the life of Castaneda. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is curious about the private life of Carlos Castaneda and his inner circle. The Author keeps you on the edge of your seat with her adventure of spying on castaneda.

Mr. Kelly was indeed involved in developing one of our history's most extraordinary vehicles, perhaps the most extraorinary of them all.

Never-the-less I enjoyed the book. I, like many other people, first heard of Tom Kelly through \\"Chariots for Apollo\\" by Charles Pellegrino and Joshua Stoff. While Tom Kelly's book didn't actually go into the level of detail as Pellegrino and Stoff it served as an additive piece and gave an insider's view of the demands both personal and professional made on the individuals that gave up a decade for a great cause. By the end of the book I came to appreciate the fact that Kelly wasn't a professional writer and instead shared a little of himself and others. I recommend this book, and \\"Chariots\\" to any person interested in one of the greatest periods of exploration; Apollo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great technical book!","review":"I loved this book and I was sad when I finished it (I wished there was more).

The very convincing duet with Margaret Whiting in \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" displays Johnny's emotional and expressional range well. His emulation of black voices and speech patterns in his then-popular \\"Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive\\" tells me that he had more than just a good set of pipes, but also an excellent ear for contemporary speech and music. What great lyricist would not? Many of the songs in this album I knew only by their lyrics-- I had never heard them performed to music. In listening to the song \\"Personality\\", performed with the Pied Pipers, one gets the feeling that one is listening to a live broadcast, back all those years ago. With 10 selections in all, this is a gem of an album. I only wish that EMI-Capitol Music (Johnny's own label) had included more selections.

I hope this trend continues.Wife/family murdered and son kidnapped Van Damme (or V.D. as I like to call him) is out for revenge. He shoots up a bunch of stuff, runs a drill through a guy's kneecaps, wrecks some cars, cries a few times, drives a motorcycle through a mall, hugs some people, electrocutes a cop and shoots a triad who's tied up point blank in the face with a shotgun.Honestly I liked this movie quite a bit, the ending was a little anti-climatic, but the cinematography was cool. I'd watch it again which is more than I could say for DOUBLE TEAM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Damme has grown","review":"Now you know action/adventure actors are never highly regarded among the hollywood who's who.

In other words he ROCKED and so did Yam. Loved the stunts too."},{"rating":"2","title":"HE'S BACK","review":"Van Damme has a good movie here. Be ready for some violence though there is a scene where his cohorts torture a guy to death thats pretty bad. Van Damme seems to be acting alot better though. The thrust of the movie has his son being kidnapped by a hong kong kingpin. JCVD has his daughter and he wants her back.Van Damme is a mob killer in this movie. He acts as such when they kill his wife so he and a buddy kill them. Eye for an eye.The movie comes across to me as gritty,dirty and desperate. All involved are bad and yet Van damme gets us to pull for him. Worth renting at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard science and plot combine to teach the reader.","review":"Sci-fi has always had the intention, either primary or secondary, of chanllenging, undermining or destroying the reader's world view. In \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\" it appears to be secondary, despite the author's obvious Marxist sentiments. Because life on the moon is not life on earth, Heinlein is freed by the science of space to create a fictional social order where, at the outset, air is not free. The juxtaposition of science and plot continues until the reader should see that he or she is in fact learning something of physics and astrophysics. Of particualr interest is the book's description of weapons systems crafted by, sare I say it, crafty moon residents. A mass driver that takes advantage of the disparate sizes of the moon's gravity well as opposed to that of the earth is a wonderful \\"Popular Science\\" gizmo. Also of note is the clever cell system administered by computer for the lunar revolutionaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Probably not so much of a little kid novel, but really great for teens.

Of all that's been said about Heinlein, both positive and negative, most is true. But this book is Heinlein at his best.Historical parallels, challenging ideas, realistic examinations of what a successful revolution looks like, and an ultimately cynical look at the way human beings use and abuse power over each other make this a genuine classic.I've read damn near every book Heinlein ever published. Some I liked, some I hated, some I've been lukewarm about. But this book is the one I always recommend. It's one of the four or five books that permanently altered how I view the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Finest Science Fiction literature I have ever read...","review":"Robert A.

Heinlein will leave you begging for more... after all, we are all a little loonie.

My biggest complaint (and surely many other readers') is the character of Wyoh. When first introduced in the book, I thought: aha - a strong female character! Several chapters later, and my hopes were dashed into the wall yet again. Avoid this book. No, really, I'm serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Moon could be harsher","review":"From the time I started reading this book I was intrigued. The story is excellent. The libertarian revolt of the moon was a novel idea that is yet to be bested. The only problem I had was the broken english that the main character kept speaking in. It did add a bit of flair to the book, but it did become cumbersome. Other than that I would recommend this read to any science fiction fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sci-Fi","review":"...some of the most enjoyable [and timely] perspectives are the ones related to free-market economics.

His books are filled with fascinating ideas and philosophies, and this book is not an exception.I can only imagine what life would be like on Luna. While this isn't happening now, Heinlein makes it sound believable, from what he reveals to us of Loonie life, and the philosophy also makes sense. This book is also full of practical knowledge and commonsense, and it seems that our own government could learn a thing or two from this book. It's also a good romp as a simple sci-fi novel. I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you like sci-fi and philosophy, you will too. If you're not really into either, then oh well. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unforgetable classic","review":"Trying to review this novel is like trying to violate Godel's theorem. How can you encompass a complete world in a short review? The characters are compelling, enduring, and valiant. The action, while perhaps unlikely, is believable by anyone who has witnessed the political and moral blunders of the twentieth Century.When read with another Heinlein masterwork, Revolt in 2100, this novel presents an uncanny manual for revolution in the media age. Younger readers may have difficulty with the 20th century context, but this is a novel which will be remembered in Science Fiction circles with War of the Worlds and From the Earth to the Moon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd forgotten how good it was","review":"I read \\"The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress\\" over 40 years ago and although I had fond memories of Robert Heinlein as an author I'd forgotten just how good a book it was. The story is told with the voice changing for multiple characters and it flows along as naturally as if you were reading it from text. I don't know why I'd stayed away from audio books but especially with this author I'll be getting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely unreadable","review":"I'm not a knee-jerk science fiction hater. I love Tolkien and I've read several other very good ones. But I've found the majority of science fiction to be excruciating writing combined with constipated narratives that could only appeal to the lowest strata of humanity. \\"The Moon is a harsh mistress\\" is probably one of the better ones, but it's still awful. I couldn't even get through the first half of the book, it was such a terrible chore. And talk about boring. I suspect that this book mostly appeals to libertarians who have been indoctrinated to support it because of its pro-freedom message, and to sci-fi poseurs who want to seem superior to their Terry Adams reading bretheren. Stay away from this book, and be afraid, be very afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic reading?","review":"I finally got around to reading this 'Classic', and what a let down. I love Science Fiction, and I don't let the fact that it talks about outdated technology turn me off a story, but when a story is simple and the characters shallow, I have trouble taking a liking to it.Mannie gets involved in a revolution, a life changing decision, quite easily, no real intrinsic motivation there, just one meeting. The Professor seems to have all the answers and the Computer can handle everything. Really, is this the stuff of a good story?Daniel Upton explains it better than I can, so I won't repeat his comments. It's just not a good story - how did it become a Hugo-Award winner?"},{"rating":"2","title":"If Heinlein's name is on the cover, just buy it!","review":"In the classic Hugo Award-winning book, a one-armed computer technician, a radical blonde bombshell, an aging academic, and a sentient all-knowing computer lead the lunar population in a revolution against Earth's colonial rule. This book details Cell group organisation, and the basic mechanics of winning a revolution, set in a Science Fiction background.Tom Clancy has said of Robert A. Heinlein, \\"We proceed down the path marked by his ideas. He shows us where the future is.\\" Nowhere is this more true than in Heinlein's gripping tale of revolution on the moon in 2076, where \\"Loonies\\" are kept poor and oppressed by an Earth-based Authority that turns huge profits at their expense. A small band of dissidents, including a one-armed computer jock, a radical young woman, a past-his-prime academic and a nearly omnipotent computer named Mike, ignite the fires of revolution despite the near certainty of failure and death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is good book, scan?","review":"Have been reading SF for 20 years, seen this one many times, some cobber recommened, no dice.

No big huhu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Surprisingly prescient. I don't know why Heinlein isn't as well known as Orwell. This book presents a view of revolution at the higher levels of organization. Other books in this vein will make you want to load magazines and march on the capitol. This book makes you think. It puts you in the role of a statesman rather than a foot soldier. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 100 SF","review":"While all of Heinlein's novels explore sociopolitical questions through science fiction, there are two that stood out for me: The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Starship Troopers. These take a cold, hard look at the political system, democracy and justice that is timeless - as well as being good reads, like all Heinlein titles. Heinlein, along with writers like Huxley and Orwell, could spin a great yarn while making their point - something any writer ought to look at more closely."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the classics","review":"I'm a bit shocked it has taken me this long to read this one of Heinlen's. It really is one of his best, in my humble opinion. If you are already familiar with Heinlen you probably don't need me selling this book as a good read to you. If you are not then I highly reccomend starting with this one or \\"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls.\\" This is a great book - it is written first person by a \\"Loonie\\" (meaning a resident of the Moon) and he has something of an accent. Some of the grammar actually reminds me of a friend who has a Russian accent. It may take a bit to get used to this as at first it seems as if the author has reaaallly bad grammar. However, once you get used to it, it adds to the story and I found it interesting. This is a tale of revolution, politics, history and understated heroes. One of the best around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolution How-To","review":"At the suggestion of a colleague I placed this book on my summer reading list. Perusing the internet I found that it would be of greater interest to first pickup Heinlein's other masterpiece, Stranger in a Strange Land. Between the two I am now beginning to consider myself a Heinlein fan. The man's work is simply stellar compared to others in the genre.This novel, although using character dialog which de-emphasizes Heinlein's grammatical excellence, entails the idea of revolutionary tactics from the perspective of a penal colony on the Moon. A great read for those who also have an affinity for historical references, as it plans out the requirements to strategically plan a revolution based off of many known occurrences as well as some completely fictional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent SciFi.","review":"Might just be Heinlein's best. All about Luna's quest for freedom from Terra's Federated Nations. A futuristic David & Goliath story if ever there was one. Characters are so well developed you feel you know them, and Mike the computer is as real as his corevolutionists. The suspense, along with the action, builds continuously from beginning to the excellent ending. And not the slightest bit outdated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolution and Government","review":"This book is almost a how-to-guide on colonial revolution. In it the colonists devise an integrate network of control and intelligence. At its head is Mike, an AI computer, to make optimal decisions for the rebels. The protagonist is Mannie, who is closest to Mike, and has a thick \\"Loonie\\" accent which is difficult to read at first. I am always impressed by Heinlein's enlightening views on goverment, and in forming this new lunar state he gives us plenty of new ideas to ponder."},{"rating":"2","title":"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch!","review":"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch; and that's the truth of it!

And, to be fair, one of the novel's most important characters, Pfr. de la Paz, speaks flawless English. But nitpicking over the occasionally missing \\"a,\\" \\"an,\\" and \\"the\\" makes no sense when discussing this novel. Consider: Heinlein portrays a lunar colony so well thought out, one wonders why it hasn't been built already. And the plot's construtcion is airtight: follow the course of the revolution detailed in this book and by the end, you'll share in the characters' patriotism for their fledgling state. Nowhere else do you get such a concise picture of Heinlein's \\"You get what you pay for\\" philosophy. Definitely my favorite work of Heinlein's and one that stands up to repeated rereading.

It is essentially a retelling of a number of revolutionsin recent and not so recent history. As with a lot of good SF, it really seems tosay more about the present and the past than it does about the future. Tellingthe story of a lunar colony, rather then setting it somewhere on Earth in thepresent or past allowed Heinlein a lot more freedom - his comments onmarriage and other societal norms, for instance, don't seem as wild in this context.They certainly do make great reading, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with order","review":"initially received correct book, wrong style.

It shouldn't be. His interesting libertarian and sociological ideas notwithstanding, the book has flat characters and a predictable plot. Everything goes wonderfully for the freedom fighters from start to finish, and the villains are bumbling idiots who never understand who they are up against. The good guys are too good, unwavering, and simple. The bad guys are too stupid and incompetent.I kept wishing the plot or the characters would turn into something interesting. They didn't. Sadly, this book suffers from the malady that separates science fiction from literature or even good fiction: substituting a fascinating view of the future for good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, not so interesting execution.","review":"I found the plot creative and interesting and was really excited to get into it (as I love politics and dystopian novels), but I am not a fan of the execution. For me, this book was very interesting in the beginning, climaxed around the middle, dragged on for the second half of the book, and finished in disappointing fashion. The first half of the book felt entirely too rushed and the second half of the book felt entirely too drawn out. The narrator's broken English became quite annoying about a third of the way into the book, as well.Some parts I found very interesting (certainly creative) and kept me reading, as they were either exciting or had outcomes I didn't expect, but as a whole the book was slow and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva La Revolution!","review":"It's 2076 and the inhabitants of the moon (loonies) are planning rebellion from their Terran masters. Similar to Australia the Moon started as a penal colony, but because the gravitational difference makes returning to the earth very difficult physiologically, any sentence is a life sentence. And not just the prisoners; workers and children born there also cannot live on the earth. For them the Moon is home and the Earth just a blue sphere in the sky. As a result the loonies have developed their own unique culture, and with the help of a sentient computer, hope to gain their independence from Earth.Another good effort from Heinlein, with the usual recipe of sociological and political musings mixed with a solid helping of engineering. Heinlein's creation of a lunar culture is excellent, and his ideas on revolution very fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"You absolutely, positvely, (Must I go on?) must read this","review":"In my very biast opinion, this is one of the best books ever written.

But I'm reading to be entertained.Highly recommended, but don't take it too seriously please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This is a very inspiring story about human freedom and also the quest of a computer for personhood. I have never been moved for a computer before, but in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress you will be. Heinlein interesting narrative structure allows for a very interesting first person narrative in the form of Manuel to share not only the plot action but also commentary on the action. Some people struggle with the way he talks but I didn't and actually found it fleshed out his character better. Heinlein is a master of both technology as well as theory about revolution. That alone makes the book interesting, but what is moving is the way he bonds his characters together and makes their cause worth fighting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure joy","review":"If you are a science fiction fan, then this book is among the best there is. period. The quality of the book, its characters, classic setup and clean science all make this a pure joy to read.The plot is the age old story of colony-fighting-for-independence-from-its-mother-country except that the colony literally stones the enemy to independent!The author uses a specific style of writing (mix of English slang with Russian mix) that unsettles you a bit early on, but actually becomes very much a part of the theme.Mike (our co-protagonist) even surpasses HAL (2001 Space odyssey) in terms of character depth. The part where \\"s/he\\"tries to think up jokes is really hilarious :)Just pure joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the top 5 ever written in the genre","review":"One of Heinlein's talents is making his worlds seem so real you feel like you're walking alongside the characters. This book is a prime example. The styleis a pure delight (OK, so you do have to guess at some Russian words), the story, excellent. This book won both Hugo and Nebula when it was published, and neverbefore has this double award been bestowed on a more deserving entry. You'll love the characters, especially Mike the sentient computer with a budding sense of humor.And Heinlein does pick up some of the line in his other books. A true classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book. A true classic. Heinlein was way ahead of his time. A great read for anyone. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noooooooooooo!","review":"Where's the freaking Kindle version of this - Heinlein's best book? Where? Garbage like I Will Fear No Evil has a Kindle version. I'm trying to replace as many of my paper books as possible with electronic copies and I would love to have this - one of my favorite books of all time - in my collection. What do we have to do to get it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tells, Doesn't Show","review":"I know this is a classic bit of science fiction writing by one of the masters, but I hated it. I don't read much SciFi and now I know why: I just don't get it. I found this to be a very, very longwinded and boring political screed. Heinlein tells the story but doesn't show us any of it. Showing is what makes fiction fiction and great writers great. But hey, what do I know. Heinlein is a master, or so they say. Just don't do like I did and take it as a beach read, comrad, because then you're bound to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck","review":"I've now read Heinlein's 2 \\"greatest\\" books, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Stranger in a Strange Land.Heinlein is a truly terrible writer, I honestly don't know how he is so highly rated and praised. I really tried to give him a chance but his writing style is like reading a book for tweens. It is broken and disjointed, for all of you out there who like him, my hats off to you but for myself I will not read another Heinlein novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"After I heard so much of this book I thought I had to read it. But it was a big disappointment! The book is BORING! I think in the sixties it was funny but no more today! I hate this book!

Although this book is purportedly about a libertarian revolution, I was so bored by the story and so annoyed by the dialog that I kept wanting to put it down. Basically, in the language of the \\"Loonies\\" (one who lives on the moon), there are quite a few words missing. They speak like someone might write a telegram. Like the pitiful nonsense created by James Joyce, I think this book is given more credit than it's due because it is weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTE: No LCD Monitor on this model","review":"Since a photo has not been posted yet (as of 3/18/02) I did some research on this model on the Panasonic website.

After having suffered through 3 decades of the Wright Amendment years at Dallas Love, I wanted to know the rest of the story what was wrong with GSW airport, and how did it get so messed up in the first place.The answer I found can be summed up with one name alone - Amon Carter. It is a hugely sad story of politics gone horribly wrong, and twin-city rivalry taken to inexcusable proportions, resulting in a worthless airport being constructed in the wrong place, and having to be razed in less than two decades.This book covers all of that, in minute up to the minute details of who the players were making the decisions, and why it took 3 decades too long to finally come up with a usable shared airport for both Fort Worth and Dallas to benefit from."},{"rating":"2","title":"My rheumatologist is Dr. Mark Horowitz","review":"I was so happy when I finally read this book. Dr. Mark Horowitz is one of the best rheumatologists out there and when he diagnosed me with Lupus 3 years ago, I never thought I would understand any of it. Thank goodness he took the time and effort to participate in this book and actually sit and explain everything to me. Any time I have a question, I have no problem going back to the book and if it is not there I call his office and he explains anything I want to know. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for some answers and not because my doctor wrote the book but because it is a GOOD book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good info for starting out","review":"When I was first diagnosed, and had little to no clue about lupus, I bought this book. More because of the pink edging on the cover than its applicable title. It turned out to be very useful & filled with good information. Think of it as a \\"starting off\\" point though. It isn't as \\"nitty gritty\\" medical as it could be, nor is it a female empowerment book.

I would have actually enjoyed a bit more details in places, but at the same time, occasional jumps forward in time keep the pace of the book moving.

It's almost an insult to the buyer.Secondly, Reel Enterprises have cut a lot in this film.In the original version we can see how sexually active Miss Evans is, even to the point where she gives head.But I guess that later on Miss Evans regretted her spontaneity and applied to the courts for an injunction against these sexually explicit scenes.

The CD is like a soundtrack to some surrealistic existential movie. It is kind of a mix between jazz and electronica. Some important things to know before you purchase are there are typically only one or two musicians playing on any given track and there is no percussion. At first this bothered me. One of the things I like most about listening to jazz is hearing the interactions between different musicians. Typically there is some electronic keyboard, or guitar line that creates a background, which Arve solos over. After listening to it for what it is rather than what it is not it has really grown on me. Arve has more or less created a musical documentary of the landscape of his youth.

Minnie Driver and Chris O'Donell shine together and both perform beautifully. It reminds us how valuable friendship is and how love should always be based on friendship. Circle of Friends is such a classic, which is hard to find now adays, and I recomend it to everyone who likes a movie about friends and love. If you loved this movie as much as I did I recomend reading the book. It's just as good and allows you to go deeper into the story and town of Knockglen.

At least five characters were left out and there was no focus on the town or the upbringing of the two (what were supposed to be) main characters. After reading the book I was curious to see the movie. How such a great and interesting story could come up so bland is puzzling. Half the book was about the town of Knockglen and the personalities that live there. That whole part is left out of the movie. The movie barely touched on more than two chapters. Very disappointing.

I was very disappointed. The only word I can think of is \\"fluffy.\\" In the book, the characters and their situations were developed, so that I could really empathize with them, especially Eve. In the movie, none of Eve's spirit and hurt comes through at all, nor did Nan's desperate desire for a better life, or the fact that she was actually a very good friend to Bennie (Bernadette)in the beginning. However, Minnie Driver did an excellent job in the lead role, and she alone earned the two stars I gave this movie.I did enjoy seeing Ireland. I think the Irish music was a bit much, actually taking away from the mood of the movie (if there was a mood to begin with). It felt like a Lucky Charms commercial. I would have liked less music, more story detail.I do not recommend this movie, but I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters","review":"I think I loved the book so much that I enjoyed the movie just because it let me think about Binchy's characters in different situations.Yes, the book is completely different from the Pat O'Connor film (esp the ending and the Coldagh/Fonsie storyline...which were two of the best things about the book for me) -- but it can still be enjoyed on its own. What made me want to own the movie was the scene between Eve and Nan in Eve's cottage kitchen. I loved Eve's monologue, and it still gives me chills. The casting for Eve, Nan, Sean and Benny was perfect.The DVD itself does not offer much by way of extras. I was hoping to see some deleted scenes, but the only bonus features available were the trailer (which made the movie seem much more dynamic and interesting than it actually was) some promotional spots, and a mini \\"featurette\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unlikely love story.","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. The story follows Benny(Minnie Driver) and her best friends Eve and Nan as the discover their own sexuality. Growing up Irish Catholic they have been taught to repress any of their feelings. Benny gets hooked on the cutest boy in school Jack(Chris O'Donnell). And Jack falls for big-girl Benny because she is so easy to talk to. Nan gets involved with an older, rich man Simon(Colin Firth). Benny's parents want her to marry \\"Creepy Sean Walsh\\"(Alan Cummings) but Benny refuses to go with him because she is in love with Jack. When Nan gets pregant she changes everyones lives. Defiantly worth watching. Enjoyable, and a great look at Catholics view on Sexuality. And Chris O'Donnell is looking exceptionally good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointment","review":"I'm amazed how they could have completely destroyed the theme of such a charming book when adapting it to the screen. The novel didn't focus on the love story of Benny and Jack, but more on how Benny becomes to love and accept herself through her relationship with Jack. Maybe one day someone will make an honest adaptation of this great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm","review":"It's not an everyone movie, those who have been cheated on can really feel the pain that the characters in this movie causes. An those you haven't, you'll wish that you will never feel this way. Other than that, it's full of forgiveness and starting over."},{"rating":"1","title":"not realistic","review":"After reading the book which was fantastic, this movie was awful. Minnie Driver was good,but there is no way the sexual antics of anyone would have been discussed in UCD in 50s, the Archbishop of Dublin would have had the place closed down.Saffron Burrows was very good as Nan Mahon, and Colin Firth as Simon Westward was excellent.The story leaves out a good deal that was in the book, such as Simon\`s little sister Heather who becomes friends with her cousin Eve Malone. Alan Cummings was superb as the slimy Sean Walsh.However he does not try to rape Benny in the book, although he is stealing money. If you have not read the book then it is a good film in terms of the acting, which was excellent and scenery.However Ireland in the 50s was not like the film,it was far more repressed. The ending was terrible, in the book Benny tells Jack that there is no chance of a relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to do with the book","review":"So much of the charm was lost in this film translation, and so many of the wonderful, real characters and relationships. Far worse was the radically changed ending. Don't read if you don't want to know, but they altered the end of the movie to give it a Hollywood, fairy tale, boy-gets-the-girl ending. The most wonderful point to the book was that Benny does NOT take Jack back at the end - she realizes that she deserves better for herself. A valuable lesson obliterated in the film version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Irish Fairy Tale","review":"This story is structured very much like an Irish fairy tale. It is about three girls who are best friends since early childhood. All but one live in poverty. They grow up and go to college in Dublin. Two of the girls fall in love; the third wants to marry for money. Bennie, the girl who lives in relative comfort, falls in love first with a boy named Jack. Her parents, however, want to set her up with a sleazy man who works for them in her father's shop. Eve is being brought up by nuns in a very strict environment. The third friend lives in dire poverty with an alcoholic father. It is she that wants to marry for money.The movie is sweet and poignant, with the inevitable ups and downs of girls in love, betrayals by each other and by men. The photography is beautiful and made me want to return to Ireland again.I recommend this movie for an easy viewing pick. Get some popcorn, set yourself down and have an enjoyable two hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minnie Driver is wonderful!","review":"One of my top-ten favorite movies and my favorite romantic comedy. In order for a romantic comedy to work for me, I have to be able to fall in love with the girl. When I first saw Minnie Driver on the screen, I thought: \\"No way!\\" But Benny won me over and is my favorite romantic comedy character. How can such a plain, frumpy looking girl radiate such incredible beauty with her smile and character? I am happy to see Minnie Driver has gone on to a modest degree of success and an Academy Award nomination. She has certainly earned it but Benny is still her best character. I highly recommend this movie to romantic comedy fans. There are some serious issues involved in this movie and they are handled very well.

I like the variety presented, but think it lacks some of the energy found on the other Passion CDs. Songs that stand out as the best on the album are \\"Make a Joyful Noise\\", \\"Kindness\\", \\"We are hungry\\", and Matt Redmon's version of \\"Did you feel the mountains tremble?\\".If you own and like other Passion CDs you will enjoy this one also. If you do not own any Passion CDs I recommend that you purchase \\"Passion: Better is One Day\\" first. Lastly, if you are new to Christian music, any of the Passion, or Revival Generation CDs can give you a glimpse of awesome current praise and worship music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite worship CD!","review":"This CD has some stunning moments. Stand out songs include, \\"Salvation\\", \\"Did You Feel the Mountains Tremble?\\", \\"Jesus, Lover of My Soul\\" and \\"Break Our Hearts\\". There really is not a bad song on the CD.

Recently a friend of mine introduced me to Rosario+Vampire, and it is one of the best things I have read and watched. Alot of people don't like how the animae strayed from the manga, but I think it is nice to have a different spin on things, or else what would be the point of reading and watching both? The only thing I do not understand is why the anime failed to include the art teacher, because she is the cause of both tskune being found out as a human by the safety commitee, and why Lilith's mirror was used, so I don't see why a big character would be left out. The dubbing is superb, no delays in mouth or sound, they did an excellent job matching the two. I like the extra comedy that the anime includes, little tidbits here and there not found in the manga. This really is a great job, I just hope the come out with a Capu 3, because it is so good, and there is so much more to include."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Anime","review":"Great show, everyone one should watch it :) DVD was excellent with good graphics.

It is mobile enough to take along on a flight to watch a DVD (which we did). The DVD controls are located on the left side of the keyboard and handy to use. It came with Windows Vista Premium and is very easy to understand and use. The one time I had to phone Toshiba about a question, I actually spoke to a real person.

I was a bit nervous about installing the wireless internet, but mine came with a free router (D-Link) and I was able to set it up myself. I mainly use this computer for e-mails and internet use.

A month later I received it back and it seemed to work. A year later, again lines. This time I sent it to Toshiba and they replaced the motherboard. Another year, lines again. This time Toshiba told me the computer was out of warranty so it was my problem. When I insisted it was a manufacturer defect, the Toshiba technical supervisor yelled at me on the phone that it was not a manufacturing defect. If you want these kinds of problems, buy Toshiba.

The vaunted media capabilities of vista don't work with it. Leaving you with a pretty useless machine. By the time you purchase the necessary additional software to get what you need to make the machine even marginally useful (word processing and spreadsheets), you are at the price of a basic Mac.

It's a pity that the author had to torture his characters just to come up with stories. \\"The Black Stallion and Flame\\" is another medicore work that boasts an workable plot that is far from spectacular.

I need to replace all, as I have used all 4 sides, and it will cost me roughly $650 to do so! Grizzly offers no volume discount on carbide inserts. Whether you buy 10 or 1000, the cost is still $6.30 each. It is almost cheaper to replace the cutterhead with a Byrd (certainly cheaper in the long-run).

It was, however, an ejoyable read.-indifferent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book had 3 major things wrong with it. First, the 2 main characters from the other Full books were nothing but minor characters in this book. There were so many characters in this book, that none of them had any depth and were all superficially written. Second, the 2 lead characters had so little interaction that you had no idea why they were attacted to each other. When they got together, the reader feels like she somehow skipped 50 or so pages. Third, the ending was rushed and a huge letdown. Evanovich did the same thing in Ten Big Ones. She used up her allotted pages and tied up all the loose ends in the last chapter. I think Janet Evanovich is trying to churn out too many books and the quality has really dropped in the last few years. Skip this book and save the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bloom wilted","review":"Full Bloom was my introduction to author Janet Evanovich. I found her prose a bit juvenile, her dialog uninspired and her humor slapstick. The characters were mostly wacky caricatures, the sexual tension was asserted but not convincing and plot, if it ever sizzled, finally fizzled.The reading level is upper-elementary/junior-high school, but the sexy atmosphere would not (I hope!) be appropriate for that age group. Events often seem improbable and the characters rarely act with logic or intelligence.Silly, outrageous, wacky, slapstick and forced. My first read of Evanovich will likely be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing...","review":"This book lacked the chemistry between the characters that all the other Evanovich books have. It left much to be desired and is a disappointing sequel in the otherwise AMAZING \\"Full\\" series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading with lots of laughs","review":"Full Bloom was not only easy reading, but one of those must be devoured in one sitting books. Janet Evanovich always has plenty of laughs in her books and this one didn't miss the mark!As soon as I finished the book I loaned it to a friend. This will be her first experience with a Janet Evanovich story, but I know it won't be her last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"Nothing to see here, folks, keep moving. Jamie and Max barely appear, and the plot is thin as broth. I think I'm over Evanovich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you're desperate for something to read...","review":"Very disappointing compared to other books linked to Evanovich. The plot seems inconsistent. So much time is spent on showing a character's personality only to have them do something completely unbelievable and out of character. Suddenly, in the middle of the book, the cat develops some need to just play dead, which I believe was meant to be an attempt at some funny, but was just plain creepy. I think Evanovich just threw her name on the book to help her friend Charlotte sell more; there is very little that is written in the Evanovich style."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-A-D","review":"I love Evanovich, but this collaboration is so bad, I can't go on reading. It's like an elementary school primer. He nodded. She nodded. He did an eye-roll. She did an eye-roll. He looked at her. She looked a him. We're told every motion they make in three word sentences or less. There seems to be few paragraphs of real writing.I realize Evanovich is a big name. I have read every single one of the Stephanie Pum novels and like them a lot, but I just can't figure out why people are buying this particular collaborative series, unless it's merely to try one of them out, like I did.My advice = Save your money! Wait for PLUM !(You can bet I'll be looking that one over carefully before buying it, after trying this poorly-written book out)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying way too hard...","review":"I am a big fan of Janet Evanovich and the quirky individuls that populate her books but this one tries way too hard to be goofy and cute and ultimately fails at both. There are too many and they are all way too eccentric - it would have worked better if they had taken the silliness down a notch or two. And the romance between the main characters was totally unbelievable. About half way through I skimply skipped to the end to see \\"whodunnit\\" and tossed it into my \\"books to give away\\" pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Janet E.","review":"This is an entertaining book like all of Janet E.'s books. I enjoyed it as \\"light reading\\". All of her books fit a \\"format\\" and are similar, but I still enjoy them. I must be a hopeless romantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bloom has wilted","review":"I was really beginning to enjoy this series of books until the writers decided to drop the main characters and story line. Just when I was getting to know Jamie and Max and their mad group of crazy friends and family everything changes. What happened? Did they get tired of Jamie and Max? What could have been an enjoyable extension of their last book left me just plain wondering....It would have been fun to see how Jamie and Max coped with a murder investigation in the midst of their big wedding plans and Dee Dee's baby's arrival, but instead they were just kind of stuck in as an afterthought. I don't know about other readers, but I get invested in the protagonists I look for books that continue with those same characters so I can watch them grow. What could have been the next Nick and Nora Charles series is now, for me, a sad goodbye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still entertaining","review":"Full Bloom, another in a the \\"Full\\" series by Janet Evanovich and Charlotte Hughes carries on with the humor and romance of the rest of the series.I fully enjoyed the mystery, the romance and humor of this book--often laughing out loud. I'm really glad my mother introduced me to this series of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe someone else liked it","review":"I tried her other books because Plum's were so wonderful. I just couldn't get into them like the Plum's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as good as Stepheny Plumb","review":"Good. Less graphic language which I like. I liked the way she kept you guessing all the way to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites","review":"the is my favorite book out of the full series by janet evanovich and charolotte hughes i also like the first one in this series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Bloom","review":"again this was not for me but my mom she a big fan of this other, her books are cheap her the our books store so i get them online for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sagging Bloom","review":"The authors kept my interest with the frolicking escapades of Annie, Wes, Destiny, Doc, and company, in the anticipation of a somewhat thought-out, acceptable conclusion. Not so. At the climax of the story, when the reader would expect the characters to \\"grow up\\" and the story to come together, it just goes from insane to ridiculous. Extremely disappointing. Would not recommend this book at all. It is outrageous slapstick, without the humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need more Stephanie Plum Mysteries","review":"I absolutely love the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich! I quickly read all of them and wanted more! Then I found the \\"Full\\" series, including this volume, \\"Full Bloom\\". I was really disappointed to find that this is just an average romance, not very well-written. The humor, which just flows in the Plum novels, is very strained. A better choice for Stephanie Plum fans who are waiting for the next installment might be \\"Bubbles in Trouble\\" or any of the \\"Bubbles\\" books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lorelei King can bring anything to life","review":"I have listened to the Stephanie Plum's series read by Lorelei King and enjoyed them and didn't think it would be any different with this audio. I love her characters and how she is able to distinguish them all. As for the story I was truly surprised at the end. Great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa....it keeps geting better with each listen","review":"Their best work since Fully Completely. I can set the repeat button on my CD player and listen to songs like \\"Save the Planet\\", and \\"Poets\\" over and over.....heck, come to think of it, I've been doing that with the entire track listing. If you're the least inclined to liking these guys, this would be a \\"Must Buy\\". If you've never heard their stuff...you couldn't pick a much better offering (except maybe Fully Completely) to start with. Great job, Good stuff, keeps ya comin back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hip album yet!!!","review":"After listening to this album for the first time, I was in awe of the hip's amazing evolution as a band and their uncanny ability to reinvent themselves with each release. The hip's distinctive sound has reached it's apex with this record. A pleasent surprise were the frequent Canadian references, differing considerably from Trouble at the Henhouse. The hip are returning to their roots, acknowledging their role as Canadian rock icons. High points in the album were: \\"Poets\\", \\"Fireworks\\", \\"Membership\\" and \\"Bobcaygeon\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new album by the Best Band you've never heard","review":"A terrific follow-up to Trouble at the Hen House. Intelligent, clever lyrics with more attention to melody (though nothing on it quite matches Ahead by a Century). This is an album with a depth sorely lacking in most releases these days.With all the pseudo-alternative one hit wonders floating around, its a shame the U.S. hasn't turned its attention to the best rock band in Canada. Buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Poets\\" is a good first single","review":"Haven't heard much but this cd looks good so far. Released onJuly 14, buy it. Poets their first single sounds amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This may sound corny, but its power is phantom","review":"Phantom Power, is definetely their best album yet. Their songs are moving now and give you a feel, compared to their older tracks. The CD is a great mix of rock/pop, and they sound matured as a band. When Gordon Downie sings, he really puts you in the position that's being described. All the tracks flow together and make a perfect mix. The best part of this album, and TTH as a whole is the way that they can convey emotions, with the jagged vocals. The album leaves you feeling full, and is at the right wavelength. It's not too mature for you, like classical, but it's not too low for you, like rap. This is a great CD. End of story"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album has TH one good song Poets","review":"This is the album that actually has one good song on it hence the 2 stars. Every other album is just a mix of messy bland attempts as music with the dying goat vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock?..or not.","review":"Ew...The Hip is starting to become lame and generic...Sure Poets is the best Hip song in years but is was written years ago. With that in consideration you have to wonder what they are thinking with this. The Hip rocks when they rock but this attempt was far too lame for a rock fan. Lyrically sound but who gives a rat's a$$...Hip rocked they do no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!","review":"A truly fantastic album - especially if you're a Canadian (even better if a Kingstonian of course!). Phantom is the most listenable of Hip albums and also sounds great live. The only problem is that Gord insists on playing that guitar. Keep it in the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"I should know!","review":"Phantom Power is just another incredible album from The Hip. Then again, I wouldn't have expected anything less from the band that went to my high school, Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute. And if you have ever lived in Kingston, Ontario, seen the guys on Princess St., and heard them play in their hometown, you would appreciate how real they really are (musically). It's too bad the rest of the world doesn't know this band the way their original fans do.The more albums you listen to, the more you will appreciate them...And that includes PHANTOM POWER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing album, from an amazing band.","review":"This CD (like all HIP CD's) was brilliant. Anyone can appreciate the sound of the HIP even if you aren't a fan. If the HIP keeps pumping out tracks like \\"Poets\\" and \\"Something On\\" their name will live on for generations. It's sad to think that most people in the States (Yes, I'm from Canada) haven't heard about the HIP, because they can't experience the magic that these boys create with their lyrics. Oh, well...its great to be Canadian! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hip Rule","review":"The Hips latest effort, is truely an amazing album. Although it took a month to fully love the album. Track # 1 and 3 will catch your attention immediately. I can't believe the Hip are not huge in the US yet. Oh well, it only means better concerts here in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diverse and Driving...","review":"Phantom Power is the most diverse Hip release yet. With Don Smith at the helm for the strongest tunes on the album, the sonic quality of Up To Here finally meets up with the psychotic purpose of Gord Downie's words. Poets really kicks the album off on a strong note...with Johnny Fay providing a strong groove. And the beauty of the hip is that I never know what Gord is talking about..."},{"rating":"1","title":"POETS DRAWS YOU INTO MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"Listening to Poets is very distracting from the rest of the songs. It's an absolute classic rock song. However, as I listened to the rest, I was totally disappointed and bored out of my mind. If you like Poets and haven't heard any of the other songs on this album, don't expect anything even nearly as good. I bought this album, listened to it a couple of times and returned it to the store. Listen to it before you decide to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me explain","review":"Ive only given them 1 star because Im afraid that if more people find out about them in the States, I wont be able to see their amazing live shows in small venues any longer. This is a really great band that puts out superb after superb CD. I didn't think they would be able to top \\"henhouse\\", but they have. All told, one of the best unsung bands of the 90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"OK. I'll give it a generous 2 stars because musically, it's pretty good. But the vocals?!?! Oh my goodness---the vocals. Worst I have EVER heard. I could sing better. To Steve Walsh I would like to say brother, when it gets this bad, do us all a favor and go get a job in the private sector. At least they include \\"Dust In The Wind\\", and bring Kerry Livgren on stage to sing it. Kerry sounds pretty good on it---except for the high notes. Walsh introduces him as \\"an old friend\\". That's a laugh. Livgren was and always will be Kansas. The band basically threw him out, due to \\"artistic differences\\". Pretty sad when a guy's Christian influences in the music lead the band to pretty much boot him.If you are going to get some Kansas CDs, get \\"Leftoverture\\" or \\"Point of Know Return\\". However, if you want to spend $6.98 for a nice coaster, then I'd go with this one.Oh yeah---did I mention how bad the vocals are on this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn the tapes!","review":"The short of it: Just hated, I mean HATED this album.

I've been annoyed by TVs in public places for a long time. Too bad it's a worthless piece of crap.In testing it on my own TV at home, it was unable to affect the TV when anything was in the way- so I couldnt turn it off with it in the pocket of my pants or jacket. Second, it wont turn off the TV unless it's directly facing the TV, and finally, you have to be directly in front of the TV. That's right - there's no way to be surreptitious about it - you need to stand directly in front of the TV, extend your arm with the TV-B-Gone in it towards the TV, and hold down the button for 60 seconds. Then you get to answer questions about why you turned off a TV in a public place. Nice.And that's IF it works.

I should also mention that you can use this with laptops as well, it turns my Macbook Pro to sleep.It's pretty funny to be able to freak out your friends with. A little pricey, but it's worth it for the a good gag gift or gadget for the collection. They only issue I had with it is the first one I received was faulty.

I'm not sure that I ever really grasped why it so important to the protagonist to become a bone-fishing guide that he would risk death at the hands of a comptetitor, but he seemed to be controlled by Destiny in a manner reminiscent of a hero of a classical Greek tragedy.

Find yourself a nice courtyard patio or take a trip to Bahia Honda, cover yourself with sunscreen, and go to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, start to finish","review":"Other reviewers gave this book a very positive review. I found it to be poor on all dimensions. I would have put this book in the trash after the first chapter, if I had not been on a day long airline trip with nothing else to read. While the author offers some interesting desriptions, most are poor at best. As far as plot, suspense, etc... I found none. If the author is trying to convey some point, I did not see it. Books such as this push me back to reading classics and contemporary works by well known authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dense and Absurd","review":"1.5 stars. If you like novels that are verbose and nonsensical, you might like this one.

Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate A1A roadkill","review":"Once upon a time, I'll wager this book was brilliant. That time has past. There are strokes of intelligence-- deft turns of phrase, bull's-eye accurate description, razor-tongued social commentary-- but all-in-all, the value of this book lies in its being a 1970s time capsule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable","review":"I had high hopes for this book as I am in love with Key West and fishing.

Although the writer knows how to write, he does not know how to concoct a believable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book -- part of a classic series","review":"The STRANGE SEED series is one of my all-time favorite series of horror books. They are about children/adults who spring from the ground. They look exactly like people, but aren't quite right--and that's where the horror begins. These books are masterfully written, full of atmosphere and psychological chills, and they explore the very nature of existence (another way to describe them would be to call the novels \\"existential horror\\").There are five books in the series, as follows:1. Strange Seed2. Nursery Tale3. Children of the Island4. The People of the Dark (1984)5. Laughing ManEach of the books works as a standalone novel, so they can be read by themselves or even out of order--but the best experience would be to start with #1 and read them all in sequence. These books build on each other in a very satisfying way--instead of being diluted, as can often happen with sequels, their meanings become deepeer with each book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing frightening here folks!","review":"If you are looking for spook to the bone kind of story, this is not it. It takes about 100 or so pages until something happens. And normally that completely fine however this book is a very short, about 280 pages. Unfortunately, this book, though a short read, does not leave much to the imagination and is very predicatable. Though this book should be described more as a psychological thriller, the \\"People of the dark\\" within the book are not explored enough to be feared/chilled by the reader. The synopsis of the book gives more chills than the actual book itself. And moreso, The People of the Dark is more sad than frightening which is unfortunate..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"The only good thing I can say about this novel is it's a short, quick read. There is no tension, nothing frightening, and it makes little sense. A young couple buy a small farmhouse and are plagued by strangers who appear out of nowhere and wander over their property. Eventually someone in the town tells them the people were sprung from the earth and are going back again, whatever that's supposed to mean. No one in this book acts or speaks the way a real person does. This novel is 300 pages of vague descriptions and nonsensical conversations. And then it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"... this book is one big waffle ...","review":"I'm trying not to be cynical, but this book is one long waffle.

Great concept, needs something more."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite books!","review":"I was just looking for this book because I wanted to share part of it with a therapy group I have this evening and I couldn't find the book. It's around here somewhere. I was really surprised to see all the negative comments. The technique I was looking for was about finding that special place inside your mind--a safe place of your choosing, a place where you can invite someone in to monitor you and someone else working out an issue, or a place where you can just figure stuff out on your own, a private and safe place. It's a very powerful exercise. There are other useful techniques to ponder also. I read this book many years ago and keep it in my library of favorites.My two cents...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspired Dizzy Nonsense","review":"I first read superlearning in 1984 and have had a look at this recent publication. As a teenager, it did inspire me to wonder about my own mind's potential. It also gave me some good excuses not to study so much, and some great excuses for why I didn't do so well in exams etc.The one thing I kind of like about it, is that it talks about many different tricks. It is an exploration of methods, and really doesn't give enough away about any particular method. I have read other similar books that give detailed steps that seem tailored to leading you off an examination cliff.The way it is written is unbelievable, and since maturing and learning about real learning strategies, I realize this book is mostly harmless.If you want something more workable, go for Kenneth Higbee instead.Browse through it at a library somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"Though the book helped me with my insomnia I didn't give it the highest rating. What even amazes me more is that I obtained around 60-beats/minute-pulse rate from an average rate of 82 beats/minute. Also I never thought the book would be able to help me get over some of my anxieties-but it worked! A lot of information is noted on the FIRST HUNDRED PAGES-these would give brief concepts on the important theoretical points. They are as important as the exercises themselves because it helps one to relate to the vast valuable implications of the ancient practices.

Benson will never be Fleming but will just be Benson."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Moonraker, not original stuff.","review":"Yes, I know they already made a film of \\"Moonraker\\" which had basically nothing to do with the book, so they're free to use plot elements. But it's almost shameless to use this many plot elements. A space weapon (only it's called \\"Icarus\\" instead of \\"Moonraker\\"), a \\"zero-to-hero\\" public persona for the villain (as well as his being honored by the Queen and not at all what he seems), the villain's blonde secretary who's a double (British S.S. and his secretary), a showdown at a club...I could go on and on. Why waste $$$ on this novelization when you could pick up Ian Fleming's original \\"Moonraker\\" at a library or used book store?

The last few have been far too serious, but this definitely adds that element of fun, a hint of sci-fi, and absolutely fantastic action scenes, characters, and the best villain's lair since the volcano-base.

The authors have skillfully put together a readable and brief account of the origins of the present conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Most readers (hopefully) will find it remarkably well-balanced and accurate, neither demonizing the Israelis nor the Muslims, but frankly stating that this is a disagreement with more modern roots in politics and a clash over land, rather than an ancient conflict of religion. Harms and Ferry have given us a good work to introduce prospective students or new initiates into a very important field of study. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overview","review":"I got this book because the Palestine-Israel conflict is always in the news, and yet I knew almost nothing about it. I thought I knew where my sympathies lie, but I did not know the origins or the historical context. After reading this book, I know much, much more than I did before. The context, the history, important names and dates -- these are all covered in. I am in the process of doing additional reading now because this book really is just an overview, but it was a great place to start.I would say the book is balanced and neutral, at least as much as it is possible to be about such a charged subject, and certainly more so than many other books. It is short, but it packs a lot of information into the pages. Finally, it is well written -- it is not dry or boring. I highly recommend it to those who, like me, know little or nothing about the conflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"Higgs' \\"Thorn\\" is lovely!","review":"I'm a fan of Francine Rivers, but I've read all she's written.

But wait, he is able to climb into the marital bed and impregnate her within 7 days! And poor, poor, Leana. She just loves Jamie with all her heart and is willing to endure all manner of humiliation. Her love is enough to change him and the world! When Jamie realizes she's carrying her son, well, he will finally realize how much he loves her. Oh Please!

I made it to 1/4 and felt as though I was hard pressed to get that far. I skimmed the rest of the book and was grateful I chose not to read it. None of the characters seem to have any redeeming qualities. The Christian values one might expect from a Christian novel are completely lacking. Not one character seems to be of strong moral fiber. I felt as though the whole purpose of the book was to describe the beauties of Scotland and encourage readers to disregard personal values, if the end goal was reached. Lying, cheating, adultery and over descriptive intimacy are all here for the taking.The main character Jamie is a spineless wimp who does whatever it takes to please others. I won't read anything further from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start but leaves you glowing...","review":"Though I understood at the outset that this story paralleled Rachel/Leah and Jacob of the Bible, it still started out too slow and detailed for me so I skipped to the part where Leana pretends to be Rose at the wedding. From that point on the story was truly addicting. I wanted to pull an all-nighter to finish it. The end left me satisfied because I wanted Jamie to love Leana and not spoiled Rose, and he did. I couldn't wait to read the next book, fearing the parallel to the Biblical account and wondering how it would be pulled off without being a thorn in my heart. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I've enjoyed everything I've read by Liz Curtis Higgs, but her fiction is my favorite. Reading Thorn in My Heart gave me a whole new perspective on the characters in the familiar Bible story of Jacob, Leah, and Rachel. Her unique device of placing the saga in a different time frame and setting was entertaining, thought provoking, and informative.How surprising to enter another period of history and a foreign culture but to discover the characters struggling with many of the same choices we battle today. Liz has a way of weaving a story line (familiar, yet with twists) and painting multidimensional characters that haunt my thoughts.My only regret is that I have to wait for her next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Download/Publisher Proofreading Errors","review":"I am half way through the book and have been surprised at the amount of spelling errors that have been found in the Kindle Version. Very distracting. I am an avid reader of Christian fiction and have downloaded many books on my Kindle. I enjoy my Kindle and read from it daily. This book was the first were I found an error on almost every page that I have read. Higgs work is being sadly misrepresented by the publisher when read in the Kindle format. Proofreading from the publisher in this instance was minimal at best. Interfered with my ability to fully enjoy Higss story or the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and heart felt","review":"The story line grabs you and you feel as though you are seeing the story unfold in front of you. Higgs paints the scenery like a painting and the pain and joy the characters feel soon become your own. I am already 150 pages into the second book just a day after finishing this masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Liz Curtis Higg's non fiction books, and was excited to see this series. Alas, I found the story to be forced (yes, I know it's based on the Biblical story of Jacob and Esau). For me, the way Ms Curtis-Higgs chose to update the story just didn't seem realistic...many parts didn't seem plausible at all! I had to force myself to finish the first book. Unfortunately, I'd purchased the entire series. I gave the books to our church library as I couldn't bring myself to read them. Apparently, others have felt differently as there are plenty of positive reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Language on CD Too Hard to Understand","review":"I couldn't understand what the reader was saying on the CD. Her accent made her speech nearly indiscernible to me. I had to start over again and again. When I did understand the basic plot and recognized it as a version of the Bible's story, I thought the story was slow. It gained momentum about a third of the way through when the protagonist sought a wife. It didn't match the second Biblical story, however, that the author started to portray (Jacob hoping to have Rachel for a wife and getting Leah). It was impossible for it to match since men could not take two wives in the culture of the author's setting. So the author just \\"fixed\\" it and ended the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handbook for College Admissions by Hayden","review":"This book explains the rules for entering colleges.

I'm not sure if this was the right one to test that theory with, as \\"Angel Cop,\\" while dark, gritty and bloody, is also a pretty standard tale from the cyberpunk genre. (The characters are morally questionable, they are working for bosses who are corrupt and getting ready to screw everyone, and in the end, pretty much everyone dies.)I do like the fact that this single tape contains a complete story, but I was still left feeling as though I wanted something a bit more original. Maybe \\"Angel Cop\\" just isn't a tale that holds up well because of the passage of time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring anime.","review":"Angel Cop is a typical action flick. Lots of violence and just enough plot to justify all the blood and gore. That can be interesting if done right, which is not the case here. Everything is just repetitive, to the point that mindless violence does indeed become mindless violence. Take the final fight sequence for example. It takes nearly 2 episodes out of total 6 to kill the final boss.

I suppose I can soak this in water overnight and maybe the glue and paper will come off, but this is an unnecessary annoyance.2. The opening of the bolt that attaches to the pole, on which the baffle rests, is too large for a common pole size. So it tends to slip down. Yes, the product states that this bolt has a certain dimension, but it's an inconvenience to have to measure the diameter of the pole.

Unfortunately, the picture that I got with the Arsenal connector was unsatisfactory. The picture was too fuzzy and blurry, much worse that the S-Video connection that I had used previously. I tried several different pairs of component video cables, but to no avail. I found a cheap, multi-system high-definition connector at my local video game store and it works just fine. I'll be returning the Arsenal kit to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An uplifting and funny story","review":"When Miguel's crazy Tia Lola comes to visit from the Dominican Republic, he instantly knows that his life is never going to be the same.

She should stick with historical fiction for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beauty of this Music","review":". . . Strangeness is a true American Beauty; everything about it smells like a rose. This music, largely instrumental, crawls into your sensorium and then starts radiating outward. The archaic symbols that the churning tunes awaken within oneself is comparable to The Power of Myth. And if popculture is your bag, as it is mine, then imagine a three-prong attack of Apocalypse Now, God Emperor of Dune, and Axis: Bold as Love prodding your mind into visions like a cerebral trident.The flow of this disc creates an effortless balance between the grounded and the ethereal. It is both the lion and the lamb! And Sparrow Orange is the third Aphex Twin! If you enjoy the works of King Crimson or The Residents, you should like this, and appreciate the value of its artistic direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment, did nothing for my feet","review":"I only walk barefoot at home, never outside. I use a foot cream every night, and then put on a pair of footies. I also use a foot file in the shower a few times a week. I'm not as concerned with price as I am with keeping my heels smooth as I live in the south and wear sandals and open-heeled shoes all summer.I'm trying lots of different brands to find the best. So far, I have tried DDF, Gold Bond from the drugstore, Qtica and Kerasol. Qtica's foot balm is absolutely the least effective of them all. I used it for 10 days, every night. My heels still looked, and felt dry.So far, the best product has been Kerasol. Second place is DDF."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite by Taylor Caldwell, Favorite book, period","review":"This book is a little bit different from her usual descriptive style, it is very direct, to the point and resonates beautifully with her readers. Yes, it is irreverent, also poignant as it relates childhood experiences that shaped this wonderful author. Only Taylor Caldwell could tell this story and tell it so well. We might call hers a dysfunctional family, and as a friend always tells me, \\"It can make you bitter or it can make you better. This is not a Polyanna tale that glosses over the bad. Rather this is a humorous little book that shares what went on along with exactly what Taylor Caldwell thought of what went on.

In Anthony's interpretation, it is phantasm of simplicity and a purified expression of classical manner, one so important for understanding of Mozart works that later go through certain maturity and evolution toward a new era ( a- moll tandem, sonata and fantasy), some ten years later.Anthony's choice of instruments is a special curiosity. Two claviers are employed, depending of Anthony's preferences to certain works. Beautiful and very exciting.Eternally thanks, Anthony.Mirro"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pump Noisy and Getting Worse","review":"This is a loud pump you can hear the noise inside while driving with he windows down, Replaced with another pump and it is super quiet.

On \\"Crystal Clear\\" and \\"The Sound of Dying,\\" they slow it down a bit, in which case they go for exteme heaviness. Either way, it all works, and every song on this album is quality.

There are 93 illustrations in this book - most of them are her paintings.

Further that \\"This volume begins with Spear and Fang, Howards first professional fiction sale, and condludes with Red Thunder, a gripping sword and sorcery tale.\\" Spear and Fang appear NOWHERE in this book and while Red Thunder is in the book, it does not \\"conclude\\" with it.In my opinion, leaving OUT Howard's first professional fiction sale and NOT concluding with Red Thunder (BOTH AS ADVERTISED ON THE BACK COVER) doesn't speak well of the \\"meticulous\\" alledged restoration alluded to.While containing almost two dozen Howard pieces, I somehow doubt the dedication, attention to detail and/or the \\"expertise\\" of the publisher as to authenticity or accuracy that should be a hallmark of a series of this sort.

Unfortunately, Dunning stumbles badly here with a plot that is too tedious and convoluted to hold the reader's attention. Even worse, all the characters are flat and spout neo-noir dialogue that isn't the least bit believable. The relationships that develop between the characters in this novel aren't in any way realistic, and I eventually had to put the book down mid-way through.If you're a bibliophile with a strong interest in book collection and bookmaking, this book may be worth a try, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody else."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment after \\"Booked to Die\\"","review":"As good as \\"Booked to Die\\" is, that's how lifeless this second volume in the Janeway series is. The characters are flat and poorly developed; the prose is fat and unrewarding. (Chapter 42, for instance, is a 15-page summary of what a secondary character discovered in her travels--despite the fact that the book is from Janeway's first-person point of view.) Much too tedious for my taste. Had to force myself to finish it and even then I felt as though perhaps I shouldn't have bothered...Mr. Dunning, please give us a Janeway closer to the first version next time around--a Janeway who is an interesting fellow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Great Price!","review":"Once again, a great book at an even better price.I collect books--but I don't just collect, I readthem again and again! DUNNING is a goodauthor and has good books. Amazon sellsthem all for good rices in good condition. Ilook and I find them again and again!Why not repeat a good experience? I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Honest Reviewer by A. R. \\"Rusty\\" Rustebakke 12/5/11","review":"See my review of the more recent THE BOOKWOMAN'S LAST FLING. Since I gave that a 9 or 10 rating, I'll have to give this a 12 which is outside my rating scale. Oh well. Except for specifics, most of what I said about BOOKWOMAN applies to this earlier book.Same hero, same rare book stores, similar mystery involving lots of violence and killing, different set of women involved to sustain the sexual interest. Different rare and pricey books are here too. Different locales, but Denver stays the hub of operations. Although I read all of WAKE, i was starting to get bored a little past halfway. So, no more Dunning or Bookman reviews from me. Others may want to read the whole series, and I can see why. Variety is the spice of my life, and too much of a good thing is very likely in my world."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed.","review":"I was not at all impressed with this novel. I have read far better mysteries; this one seemed trite and contrived. Granted, the parts relating to book collecting were interesting, but the actual mystery left me completely uninterested. I didn't even really feel compelled to finish the book. The dialogue was stale, and the characters were poorly developed and unbelievable. In my opinion, if you're going to read a mystery, you should try someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas...","review":"What a disappointment, after the bright promise of Dunning's first Janeway mystery. This is just too long, too overblown. Apparently the author thought that more was better, and he just piled it on. Blame some of this on the editor at the publishing house. If about 100-150 pages had been omitted, this might have been worth reading. As Gertrude Stein told Hemingway: \\"Prune, Ernest, prune.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"This book is flawed by dialogue full of cliches, and most of the characters are foul-mouthed. The mystery itself is so convoluted that I lost track of what was going on, lost interest, and only finished the book because I hate leaving one unfinished. I had read Booked to Die and found it to be ok for light entertainment, and the insight into the bookworld was a redeeming factor. Not so with Bookman's Wake. I have got to believe Mr. Dunning can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating facts on books, but sophomoric writing and plot","review":"This book provides some interesting insights and fascinating details on book making but, as a mystery, it's dull and far too long. Dunning takes paragraphs and full pages to describe scenes that could be dealt with in a line or two. If ever there was a book in need of editing it's this one. It seems he's also determined to put in every trite phrase and hard boiled comment he's ever read in the Chandler and Hammett mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliches and Claptrap Mar a Perfectly Good Essay","review":"In a word -- nauseating. It's a shame that author John Dunning felt it necessary to hang an implausible and downright annoying plot, filled with detective-story cliches and inconsistent cardboard characters, on the bones of a fascinating essay on the world of rare book dealing. The book would have been half the thickness without all the claptrap, and a far better read besides. To quote the character he calls \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" (eeewwwww), ... The only thing that kept me reading, after the first couple of chapters, was that core. The man knows books, and loves them -- and makes the reader love them as well -- but he's no mystery writer. P.D. James is safe for the forseeable future, methinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twists and Turns to the very end,Still keeps you guessing","review":"This is the first Dunning novel I have had a chance to read. I intend to go right out and pursue the other volumes. As a die-hard quality mystery fan who does not go in for spy stories or blood-n-guts volumes, I find this action filled book a delight to my English sensibilities. There is the obligatory violence, though it's minimal and not too graphic. There is the romance. There is the thoroughly dislikeable villain. Binding these all together is an intellectual plot and a thorough love of all things related to book collecting that keeps you on your toes throughout the book. Even on the last page, you are still wondering what will happen next. You will NEVER guess whodunnit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent and unusual mystery.","review":"The locale for this mystery is North Bend and Seattle, Washington. The genre is the rare book trade. The theme revolves around a fire, a dead author and a family who wants to keep their skeletons in the closet."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a gem","review":"my criteria for a 10 in fiction are: interesting, informative, believeable characters, engrossing, satisfying. add a valid sense of place, good theme, ironclad structure, useful and/or unique insights, entertaining and, folks, that works for me. Mysteries are seldom 10's for me, I normally listen to them as books on tape as I do chores or commute.If you love books. If you like well-crafted mysteries that are not transparent in their outcome from chapter 4. If you'd like to feel like you've not wasted your time just being 'entertained...'Buy this. Rent this.

Donna Summer actually REMINDS me of Céline sometimes. On the whole, not bad, but I'd rather stick with sexy Mr. Bocelli's version."},{"rating":"1","title":"why this song?","review":"While Donna Summer gives a terrific performance of the arrangement, such an arrangement should never have been made. The beats are un-original, the mixing- barely passable. Moreover, such a banal and trite cover is a gross injustice to the original Italian art song. It seems the only benefit was the creation of a piece of rhythmic fodder for the dance club circuit. This track represents all that is wrong in the world of popular music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish you hadn't done this, Donna!!","review":"Her version of \\"Con te partiro\\" just ruined a beautiful Italian song. Her English lyrics of this song ( I don't think she translated eventhough CD cover says) is BAD!! Some people might say this CD is fun, but music arrangement is also terrible. They could have done much better. This is the worst cover version of any other kind of songs I have ever heard before. I'm very disapoited. Sorry, Donna this is your \\"Last Dance\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a ripoff","review":"This lady totally kicked out the TRUE meaning of Con Te Partiro, with is Time to Say Goodbye, which was originally recorded by Sarah Brightman and Andrea Bocelli...The beat to this song is horrible! Listen to the original version...It's really nice....You can find it on Andrea Bocelli's Romanza, or Sarah Brightman's Fly or Time to Say Goodbye...Hope you see the REAL meaning of Con te Partiro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donna's got the right translation","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable bit of disco beat - slightly overdone by having nine (9) slightly different versions of essentially the same thing. But at least the translation is correct. Con te partiro does NOT mean \\"time to say goodbye\\" IT MEANS \\"with you depart\\" ie: \\"I WILL GO WITH YOU\\". As much as I like Sarah Brightman's version she has taken considerable license with the translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donna Summer is Tops!","review":"Donna Summer has been and always will be the most talented, passionate and gifted vocalist of our time. Her rendition of \\"I will Go With You\\" is overflowing with emotion and power. I strongly recommend this song as well as any of her other musical works. I look forward to adding any of Donna Summer's future productions to my current collection of Donna Summer material. She is the Top!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love to Love Donna Summer Even More...if that's possible!","review":"Donna Summers' version of the Italian masterpiece is taken to a even greater ecstasy! \\"I Will Go With You\\"-con te partiro...is living proof disco is not dead, but alive & well..with living proof in Donna's beautiful sultry vocals. Another winning song from the First Lady (from Boston)!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was just amazed to hear it in english and with techno!!!","review":"I first heard this song at my Aunt Ceci's wedding in Peru about a year ago. I thought it was great. Too bad I didn't understand any of the words since it was in Italian. When I heard it again in Houston I was blown away! I was like: \\"wow! they can really revive these songs and give them a new twist!\\" I was determined to find out who redid it. I kept tuning into the radios and asking if someone knew who sang it. I found out after a while of wrestling with key words in yahoo for a while. I really enjoy the song and I am really glad someone with as much talent as Donna Summer could redo a song like Andrea Bocelli's \\"Con te Partiro\\" so well. I mean, I could've redone that song and it would come out sounding more like a group of alley cats meowing in the middle of the night. Too bad I have no talent in the composing area!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the line!!!","review":"Not to put too fine a point on it, but I'm afraid the previous (and sole, to date) customer review is uninformed, to say the least.He apparently was disappointed that he could not copy DVD's onto Super VHS. Well, NO VHS recorder is capable of that little function, due to an unbeatable Hollywood-approved copyguard system. As well, an \\"eject\\" button the remote is superfluous, since you have to walk up to the machine and remove it manually in any case.I have two JVC video recorders, one VHS and the other Super VHS, and they are simply incomparable in terms of quality vs. price. JVC INVENTED the VHS system, and for this fellow to give it's Ferrari version only one star boggles the mind.

They asked me questions based on the facts they found in the book. It is short, the first page describes the Massachusetts quarter and explains the origin of the image on the back. In less than thirty pages, the history of the state from the first arrival of European settlers to today is covered. Several pages are devoted to Massachusetts's tourist attractions and short biographies of significant people who were born in the state. The last page is devoted to a recipe for cranberry muffins, a favorite of Massachusetts's residents.My children enjoyed this book, within five minutes; they found at least twenty questions to ask me regarding what has happened in the state since the Pilgrims landed in 1620. Needless to say, I wasn't able to answer very many of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman fleece blanket","review":"This blanket was purchased as a gift,but i got to use it for myself one night.

That being said, I have not been a long time fan, nor have I all of their recordings or any of the things that a hard core fan could say. It's just that I really love these guys. They have a passion and have this hard rockin/Bluesy thing goin on that I really dig. As for the DVD, I am very satisfied with the performance.

Everyone who likes rock will love this concert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny, and More!","review":"If you're a fan of The Black Keys in any capacity, you must own this DVD. It captures their stage presence perfectly and showcases what's become one of the best up-and-coming bands around. Lead singer and guitarist Dan Auerbach's gritty voice and effortless riffs combine in perfect unison with drummer Patrick Carney's impeccable timing and rabid pace.This is a must-buy for any serious rock or blues fan - and in my opinion for any serious music fan. This band will prove to be an important evolution in the world of music and every opportunity should be taken to see them whenever, wherever possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment and latent plagiarism","review":"You may love Jack White or not, but if you have viewed the White Stripes Blackpool video, you have already seen this one. Meg's drumming was basic enough but evidentally not poor enough to dissuade Patrick from performing at a lower level. An arguement can be made that Dan Auerbach can outplay and outsing Jack...it's really a taste call. Personally I'll always go for the original copier rather than the copy copier. So I say we all chip in and get Dan a decent drummer that knows the genre...ok, let's hire Cody Dickinson of the N. MS. All-Stars. After a few rehearsals, we'll send the boys out on tour and shoot a video. But let's arm the videographers with state of the art equipment and warn them against making it look like they shot it in 1972. We'll have a better product than anything the White Stripes or Black Keys are capable of. Dan Auerbach deserves better than this video - demand better from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Great concert footage, audio and video quality is top notch.

As it were, it is a hell-bent-for-leather 65 minute performance by drummer Patrick Carney and everything else Dan Auerbach. They don't stop. They don't drink water. They don't wipe away sweat. They just motor on from song to song. The Portland, Oregon location is dark as you might expect, but this DVD looks pretty decent in the up-converted mode. The sound unfortunately is only 2.0 stereo which may be what the boys intended. Dunno, but kind of a disappointment in this day and age. One thing is certain. This is some fine rockin' blues played by a couple damn fine twenty something musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD","review":"If you have never been graced with seeing \\"The Keys\\" live, then you should probably pick up this DVD. I'm not sure it captures the emotion or heavy air of a real show, but its still a good watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Leviathan Storyline Begins","review":"Dark Shadows 17 wraps up the 1897 storyline and the Leviathan storyline begins! My only complaint about the 1897 storyline is that Magda wasn't used more towards the end or in the final struggle with Count Petofi.I have heard some people disliked the Leviathan storyline, but I really enjoy the nice change of pace from the 1897 storyline. The Leviathan storyline is mysterious, creepy and weird (all good things)! I also enjoy Barnabas being evil again, with Julia working to put the pieces together.It's also great to have Marie Wallace and Dennis Patrick (who played the slimy Jason McGuire) back in the cast.A few bloopers to look out for (with spoilers): The window falls apart in a scene with Charity and Tate (either DS 16 or 17 set), Maggie Evans trips going up the stairs, a stage hand is seen pouring dry ice on the set while the credits rolls. Also there is no way one of the items could have fit into the Leviathan box!Can't wait to start Collection 18!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Shadows","review":"As a child I watched this every afternoon after school, as an adult it brought back a lot of great memories.

The residents loved it especially for the illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid-looking knockoff","review":"This is a knock-off of the RBC3 replacement battery cartridge for the APC BackUPS 600 (and will possibly fit other models). This time the cartridge was a perfect fit and did not require shoehorning into the UPS like some past replacements I have bought. So far, it is working fine. It remains to be seen how long it will last, but given the price disparity between the knockoff and the genuine APC cartridge, it should prove an economical substitute.I would have given this item five stars except that the wire connecting the two cells was of a smaller gauge than the original. Because of this I chose to reuse the original wire. Shipping was prompt and the cartridge well packaged. I would buy from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, but worth it!","review":"The Road to Serfdom is a book that you see recommended on many reading lists, and for good reason. Hayek shows the reader, from many different directions, why socialism is doomed to failure. He carefully explains why socialism in its pure form leads, inevitably, to totalitarianism. Hayek's illustrations and explanations are quite clear.I found myself somewhat challenged by Hayek's writing style. Make no mistake, this can be a somewhat difficult book to read. Keep in mind though, that it is a book that should be read a little at a time and pondered upon. The first chapter seemed to be the most difficult. If you can make it through the first chapter, then you are home free.In the end, I was fascinated by this book. Hayek's ability to see in 1944 what became apparent only many years later to most of his contemporaries, is remarkable. Even though this is no easy read, its more than worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading for all Students","review":"I adored Hayek's points about the linkage between Stalinist Russia and the National Socialist in Western Europe. It helps the American/British right debunk the myth that Hitler was of a conservative mould.We should not forget the power of the free market. When man can no longer control his own economic future, then there is no freedom. Milton Freidman's 'Capitalism and Freedom' is another great work displaying the erudition of economics that every College Student and most High School students should be aware of."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timely book","review":"This book warned about the dangers of socialism in the 1940's, and the dangers are still present, as the Obama administration moves in that direction. This book should be required reading in every high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road To Serfdom","review":"Although 60+ years old this book reads like a study of current events. The man was precsient in his conception of the world about him. My son has this book and I will recommend it to all my children as a way of preparing themselves for what can happen to them even as we speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reactionary nonsense","review":"One of the most hyped books ever. Hayek proves to his own satisfaction, if nobody else's, that any state that takes any care of its citizens is doomed to become a totalitarian monster. So he sees Britain's wonderful National Health Service as a harbinger of doom, rather than as a highly successful organisation to reduce avoidable suffering. So Bush's grotesquely hopeless attempts to cope with the effects of Hurricane Katrina would be fine with Hayek, because Bush's policies are laisser-faire, ie do nothing, pass by on the other side. In sum, don't bother with reactionary losers like Hayek; read humane thinkers like Keynes or Marx instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must read for understanding pseudo-fascist libertarianism","review":"Von Hayek's concept of freedom is the right of the fist. If your not rich, you don't count. If you stand up for a better society, through a union or something else, you are a defender of atrocities by Hayeks account. How you ask, how could that be? Well according to this book, Any public insight in how the society should be run is wrong, and should be left to our bosses and other \\"experts\\" to decide. Hayek don't even consider that the worst offenders of freedom isn't the public, common man, but the corporations with their top down hierachy. The only people Hayek, Mises and all other libertarian thinkers serve is the elite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reactionary propaganda","review":"Von Hayek was for the welfare of the capitalist class and against the welfare of ordinary people. His concept of freedom is freedom for only the capitalist class.Market forces which he loves so much only give freedom to the big players, that is those with market power.Von Hayek was against economist John M. Keynes and the welfare state because they curbed the power of the capitalist class.His ideas are in vogue with the capitalists today because his ideology justifies their exploitation.This book is pure propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish!","review":"What outdated nonsense.

Hayek truly proves to be one of the best economists of the 20th century. His critique of Keynesian politics was way out of his time when he wrote this. I wished he were alive to see how his ideas and opinions influenced our society today and opened up the way to great improvement in world economies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing!","review":"Hayek's case cannot be refuted. There is a reason why people still read it almost 60 years later: the contest between socialism and free enterprise is clearly stated.... ...Mises and Menger are nowhere to be found. ...The true worth of this book can be seen in the ignorance and desperate angst of the negative reviewers here. This book's value is in direct proportion to the vituperation. Read on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a 'must read' for Americans","review":"The best thing about this little book is the absolute clarity of thought Mr. Hayek presents in discussing his theories. Not only do they make such good sense, they are easily understood. Personally, I believe all High School seniors in America should have this text as a part of their required curriculum for graduation. This edition on Hayek's classic is a good one and is very affordable. Get it, read it and expand your understanding of political theory even if you are not particularly interested in these matters. It will change the way you see our world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hayek is a hero!","review":"I found this book in Amazon, read the reviews and bought it. At the end, I was very embarassed by the fact that I had a Master degree and yet I lacked the knowledge that this work existed. I had heard of Hayek, but this book alone, with the most wonderful words on freedom and common sense, turned me into a very big Hayek fan. Buy your copy and read it right now, for if you do it later you will regreat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hayek Understands the Totalitarian Mind","review":"I would've given the book 5 stars had it not been for the last 7 pages of the book. Hayek is thorough in his dissection of the totalitarian mind and its support of monopoly and eugenics. Often, while reading, I felt he could've been dropped in to modern times and not have to change a word. A good book is entertaining- a GREAT book- holds the test of time in how the author's ideas remain true and proven. We are dreadfully close in 2009 to reviving failed ideas of the past. In regards to the last 7 pages, I was disappointed that Hayek agreed that there needed to be a world federation system. After piling on pages upon pages of how tyrants take root...I felt his support for a one-world federation was quite naive and absurd. Nearly as naive as the idealists he so accurately discredited. But this shouldn't sway anyone from reading such an insightful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important book","review":"The book is simply great, on whatever side of the political spectrum you may reside. Hayek ably shows that the chosen road will not lead to the desired endstage described by Marx but to a authoritarian nightmare in which no one is free except a few of \\"the ruling class\\".Do not expect to find a treatise on libertarianism vs. socialism as some of the reviewers think, since the author himself stated that he doesn't want to attack Marxism. For that there are other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most important book of the 20th century","review":"This sums up all the lessons that need to be learned from the 20th century.

I used one pump to fuel two 331 Imperial Hemi Marine motors that have twin single barrel carbs. It provides plenty of fuel for both motors without making too much pressure bypassing the floats, flooding the motors. I always start my starboard engine first so I put a oil pressure switch on that motor for a fail safe device. Switching to a electric pump made the engines start easier as they don't have to grind on the starters till the bowls fill if the motors haven't been started in a while since the tanks are 40' forward of the engines. It is a USCG approved unit and has been very dependable so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ON NOVEMBER 22, 1963?","review":"Jim Garrison's powerful book, \\"On the Trail of the Assassins,\\" is important reading. In it, Garrison recounts his investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and a possible cover-up of the real facts of the case. It questions the validity of the Warren Commission Report, and provides startling evidence that the Central Intelligence Agency may have been involved, and that Kennedy's assassination was a coup d'etat. The evidence Garrison presents leaves little room for doubt.If there wasn't a conspiracy involved to assassinate Kennedy, then why does the U.S. government, OUR government, withold information in connection to the assassination? I think that we have a right to know who killed Kennedy, why he was killed, and who benefitted.\\"On the Trail of the Assassins\\" is a superb book. A great resource for those new to the conspiracy theories, and a great companion piece to Oliver Stone's \\"JFK.\\" Grade: A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good \\"read\\" and an above-average book","review":"Jim Garrison's book \\"On The Trail Of The Assassins\\" was one of two books used as the basis for Oliver Stone's movie \\"JFK\\" (the other was Kim Marrs' \\"Crossfire\\"). On that basis alone, highly recommended (for it led to the JFK Act and the ARRB). That said, this is a very good but not a great book. I would put James DiEugenio's book ON Garrison ahead of this one. Still, a good \\"read\\" with some good moments.Vince Palamara"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ONLY TRUE INVESTIGATION OF JFK ASSASSINATION","review":"I have read this book several times..plus read many other theories, but I find that Mr. Garrison's investigation was the most thorough of any government investigation. He new where to look and who to look for, since he was right in the middle of the New Orleans scene, during the trying times of the Cuban problems. This book goes into great detail about the search and contacts of many of the witnesses, plus gives numerous cases where witnesses for the case were killed or never found. I am with Mr. Garrison, I believe the government knew about the assasination and were involved with it in covert operations. This book really elaborates on all the fine details of cover-up at it's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presents an interesting perspective on the assassination...","review":"What makes this book so remarkable is that it was not written by a historian detached from the events, but from a former District Attorney who was involved first-hand in the events regarding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Jim Garrison had access to information that not many other scholars of the assassination had, and therefore he presents new theories that extend beyond what other researchers have been able to reach. Although after this reading this book one might be just as confused as they were before reading it in regard to who actually did it, and more importantly why they did it, Garrison seems to be an individual with moral values, and for this reason his work should be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK FOR ANY REASON!","review":"Garrison's easy, relaxed prose sucks you in, until you believe everything he writes. DON'T! Garrison constanly ignores the true facts about the Clay Shaw case. The whole story has absolutely no basis in fact. For the true story, read \\"False Witness\\" by Patricia Lambert, a very enlighting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, give me a break!","review":"Hey folks, this is a very interesting read. But pay it no more creedence than you would any other work of fiction. I give this book one star, not because of it's lackluster showmanship, but rather that it masquerades as the truth that it is clearly not. Garrison relies heavily on evidence that has been discounted, witnesses that have been shown to be uncredible, and enough hearsay to drown a fish. The problem with this book is that people read it and think that it is in some way a definitive source on the Kennedy assassination. It is most certainly not, you would be well advised to do more research on the subject before taking this work of fiction at face value. An excellent suggestion is the highly researched book Case Closed, by Gerald Posner, who took the time to check his sources. Posner also spends a good deal of time addressing Garrison's, as well as other conspiracy theorist's, \\"evidence.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want wacky, Garrison gives it to you....","review":"This is in a tie with Lane's Rush to Judgement for worst book on the subject. Written by a man who is clearly mentally disturbed and the books shows it. He went on a case based on almost no evidence and lost the case because of this. He lies consistently about witnesses and belittes the people who disagree with him. Skip this and read Posners Case Closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"GARRISON HAD THE RIGHT IDEA","review":"It seems the majority of people dissing the book are the same ones who blame liberals for the evils of the world.About this book, I think Garrison was on the Right track ,but could have spent more time investigating the Dallas connection to the JFK assassination. He had some of the key players down, but spent too much time on Clay Shaw. Worth reading if you can still find a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nuttery Kookery","review":"Really, this is for the unhinged, hate-America crowd. I give it two stars because it was entertaining enough to read a half dozen times over the years--but this is a book that brings to mind the line about Capt. Queeg, He is a freudian delight, he crawls with clues. Poor Garrison yawps and waves his arms in a disturbing manner and howls of a conspiracy for several hundred pages--and proves no such thing. What he omits would fill twenty-plus volumes--and does: the Warren Commission, whose let's-get-to-the-conclusion-LBJ-wanted report is flawed but gets to the heart of it: Oswald had the means, motive, and opportunity. If you are serious about this business and want to see the REAL Garrison, please read the Lambert (False Witness), Bremer (The Garrison Case), and especially the Kirkwood (American Grotesque) books on Jim's case (all available on Amazon.com). If you can read them and still think of all doubters of the doubters as CIA plants, well...."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Do not read this book until after False Witness","review":"Take this all with a grain of salt. A thorough investigation does not bear out what Mr. Garrison says. In fact, he contradicts himself in this book many times.

I have had no problem with it whatsoever, and it always passes the automatic self-test with flying colors.

So far so good!Would place more orders in the future!!! Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit","review":"I bought this to replace the battery in the APC Battery Backup that protects the server in our office. The item arrived quickly, in excellent condition via United Parcel Service. After some initial dismay over not having any instructions as to how to get into the battery compartment (you almost have to take the entire UPS apart on the 1500 series), we got the new battery in place. It already had some juice in it, so we didn't have to wait on the typical 24 charge time with new units."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good replacement battery for your APC UPS!","review":"This battery was a perfect fit from the standpoint of how the case fit into the UPS housing, and a very nice and perfect tight fitting plug. Handy recessed areas in the case of the battery allow you to hold on to this heavy brute while you gingerly work it into the battery compartment. Make sure you get your connecting wiring in the right place before you slide the battery into the case. Once installed it and buttoned the case back up, I plugged up the unit and presto...the dependable APC UPS unit circuitry recognized the battery, and the green light was on...once again. Fast shipment and packed really well. No need to replace your UPS, just get a fresh battery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly functional replacement","review":"Works fine in my APC SmartUPS 1000XL. Its cable connector mated precisely with its opposite number within the UPS housing. After sliding it into place and refitting the retaining plate, it charged right up. As it happens, I wanted to reseat the battery in the housing after I had installed it. Then, I realized that the flexible plastic tab glued to the base of the battery was on the same side as the cable--so it was buried within the housing and of no use in extracting the battery. A small matter, to be sure.The included literature encourages you to recycle your old battery, but it is quite expensive to ship these heavy items back to the manufacturer. Local recycling is really the only practical choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economical alternative to APC's RBC7","review":"After spending considerable time researching replacement batteries for my APC SmartUps SUA1500, I decided to give this one a try. I'm glad I did. Its fit and finish are every bit as good as the original battery pack, it installs easily, and it performs just as well. I used APC batteries while my UPS was under the extended factory warranty, but now that the warranty has expired, there's no reason to continue paying the higher cost of the APC battery, which is almost twice the cost of this one. I'm completely satisfied with this battery pack...and the shipping was very fast into the bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product and delivery","review":"This item was received in excellent condition and is exactly the same as the original.

As far as I can tell this means the UPS is fried. The old battery just causes the unit to indicate that the battery is dead, so I don't know what the problem is. Perhaps the UPS is dead, perhaps this battery just doesn't work. However, given that this battery is NOT RETURNABLE (I didn't notice that when I ordered) I am out $150 for this useless thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufactured When the Dead Sea Was Only Sick","review":"I didn't really believe a company like Amazon would send me a product like a battery that is almost a year and a half old!

While some information is timeless, other information is just: WRONG. Laws and regulations have changed, on some matters of pharmacy practice quite dramatically, since this book was published, even since the final online update (no longer available) for the book.

I couldn't wait to tell you that it had me smiling, cheering, and angry. I was happy that Nina got a man she could love and respect. I loved the fact that she and Kyle adopted Topaz's and Sean's love child. (I must admit, I was hoping it was Germain's, so they could live happily ever after.) Speaking of Topaz. What a \\"bad\\" girl. I couldn't believe she flirted with Sean even after she got back the man of her dreams. Keisha is the \\"glue\\" that holds these people together. I was glad she had a son to complete her happy family. And poor misunderstood Jade. If the girl had just gotten off her high horse and given Sean the \\"TLC\\" he wanted and so desperately needed, there never would have been...well you know. Anyway, I loved the book, and of course you left it open for another sequel. I CAN'T WAIT! Keep on doing what ya doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"an affair to forget","review":"Maybe I set the bar too high but I cannot understand the hype about A Chocolate Affair. The book seems to be about...what is this book supposed to be about? The back of the book reads like it's a juicy \\"sister friend\\" book but the words between leaves much to be desired. I do agree with others who recommend reading Chocolate Star so that one can become familiar with the characters but I cannot say that I would recommend this book at all. There is more name dropping than plot, no kind of character developement and the writing just seems a bit dry. There are times that I found myself rushing through the page in an attempt to get to a better part.If you are truly in need of boring yourself or just want to see what's next for Topaz and the gang then get a copy from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great sequel!","review":"Because there was a lapse between the releases of Chocolate Star and A Chocolate Affair, I read Chocolate Star once again before reading the sequel. Ms. Copeland did not disappoint me! What a page turner. I read it in two sittings, (neglected a bit of housework) but it was absolutely worth it. I gave it 4 stars because I did not like being left hanging at the end but otherwise it was an excellent read. Keep up the good work, Sheila Copeland!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooooo Anxious!!!!","review":"This Sequal is off the meter*** The characters are vivid, close to home, and they pull you into the story keeping you anxious for more. My girl, Topaz is out there, I mean, she needs Jesus! The book is honestly a tease...it's shorter than Sheila's first one, \\"Chocolate Stars\\", and once again Sheila leaves us hanging at the end. The story line is intimate and riveting, full of satire and irony, a real page turner! I read it in under 4 hours. Sheila Copeland leaves you wanting more, and as for myself, I'm Sooooo Anxious for the followup to the sequal~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glitz and Glam and more Perfect People and Greeennn","review":"If Sheila Copeland's character's or books could be described with two words they'd be \\"Green Perfection\\". These people are unrealistically wealthy and perfect. With minor family problems and hidden agendas. All of them are just so irresistable and why doesn't Sheila find another color other than keep mentioning how much Green the main character wears. We get it Sheila...All of your character's are rich, talented and beautiful with little imperfections and minor character flaws. Give me something a little more believeable next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather empty","review":"Maybe I'm just not feeling it, but I don't understand what all the raves are about. I read Chocolate Star, which wouldn't have been bad if it was written better. The author mercifully cut back on the brand names and food descriptions (or maybe this time she received better editing), but the story line here was very thin. It essentially resolved around setting up The Incident between Topaz and Sean, and then its aftermath, which was a cinch to predict. Apparently, with the cliffhanger ending, the author intends to publish a series a la E. Lynn Harris. I'm glad to see that so many are eagerly awaiting the next installment, but I won't be reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wise and Witty Women Bookclub","review":"Wise & Witty recommends this book to others. If you read Chocolate Star you will find that the drama is not over in Chocolate Affair. Things heat up and it a scandalous turmoil. Jade is not as sweet as she seemed in the first book, Topaz, you want believe the changes she made, Keshia is a strong woman who has many talents and Nina will surprise you!!. The men in this book will shock you with their weakness and strength. This book leaves you wanting to know what is next in the lives of these ladies. I think we will find out in Diamond Life. Happy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"...truly enjoyable...","review":"This is a must read. I truly enjoyed the way Ms. Copeland linked all the characters together. The friendships that emerged are the kind that we all try to have in our own lives (at least I do minus that of Topaz :-). I read this book in one sitting. I could not but it down. Even though I did not read A Chocolate Star, I felt like I knew all the characters, especially Kiesha and Nina, who were my favorite \\"girlfriends\\".I was a little peeved that Topaz was not content with all that she had.

It will, in each issue, usually cover a non-traditional weapon such as a new 1911 or a bolt action rifle. As I said, the focus is mainly law-enforcement, which some people may not like.

Sadly, true wits like Bromley and Dave Barry are turning into an endagered species--columnists who actually know what humor is, and use it to tell their stories.\\"Daddy Dumbest\\" is a quick, easy read and it's full of life's little moments that we all share. I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud so many times from reading a book.I hope Bromley continues writing some books in addition to his column, because this is a young, very talented author and wit that you are going to hear a lot more from in the future.

This scenario gives Stout ample opportunity to present greed and jealousy as a motive from suspect to suspect to suspect, and I did find myself wondering \\"whodunit\\" and how until the murderer's identity was finally revealed. There's also a wonderfully witty plot twist at the end that made me smile. And I also came away thinking that Robert Parker should curl up with a few Wolfe mysteries. I used to love his Spenser books, but now the banter between Spenser and Hawk and Spenser and Susan has become tired, old, and often childish. Rex Stout manages to take the familiar characters and remain both true to the interpersonal relationships (Wolfe/Archie, Archie/Stebbins, Wolfe/Cramer, etc.) and consistently entertaining and readable. Stout is a master of this genre and perhaps it's unreasonable to expect another author to reach such heights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Costs Too Much","review":"Why the large variation in the prices for these books ?

Only Nero Wolfe can solve this crime but can he solve it and still get paid? Ah, that's the rub.Good but not as good as some of the books.

Always minimalistic and staggering in its approach, the album's power derives mainly from trance-inducing and repetitive keyboards from Marty Rev and unpredictable, howling vocals from Alan Vega. Not bad sounds coming from what mainly started with a broken down Farfisa organ and cheap-o drum machine. And tracks like \\"Ghost Rider\\" and \\"Frankie Teardrop\\" have proved to be timeless and greatly influencial even by today's standards. The live tracks taken from different shows of the era only prove how often controversial and violent this kind of music was taking it's only influences from the doomed and claustrophobic climate of the late 1970's in NYC. HIGHLY recommended and a leader of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge to life","review":"Suicide were the first punk band that didn't have guitars, drums and bass in its setup. This box set contains their groundbreaking debut album and two live performances at different locations. Their self-titled debut is still one of the most acclaimed and innovative records in the history of electronic music. Alan Vega's manic vocals with their unpredictable whoops, hollers, and shouts mix perfectly with roaring Moog synthesizers and machine-generated, up-tempo beats. But it's not sheer confrontation and threat. In fact, this record is very listenable and comes up with lots of good melodies. I'd rather describe it as tension-filled and bittersweet. The first part of the live section offers another bunch of classic songs like \\"Mr Ray\\", \\"96 tears\\", and \\"Harlem\\". The Brussels performance is nearly unlistenable, there's too much background noise and other distortion. All in all, this is a very good and recommendable album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant but Underappreciated","review":"I first heard this album 5-6 years, and I thought to myself \\"This pretty lame. What do people like about this?\\" I listened to it again a couple of year later, and I was blown away. Two guys, one with a menacing vocal presence and another with synthesizers that sound like they were bought at a yard sale, pulled off an incredible album with this one. It's absolutely incredible what a singer and a guy with old synthesizers can do. The music is spare, dark, edgy, and even pretty scary sometimes. The song Frankie Teardrop is legendary not only for its subject matter but also, in my opinion, the scariest visceral screams that any singer has produced. All the other songs are also great. The music pulsates and Vega interjects with singing and screams throughout the album. Absolutely incredible! If you're a fan of post-punk bands like Joy Division, you'll love this album. If you don't like punk or post-punk, you still may be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect book on Oleanders","review":"I had never before seen a book on the Oleander offered for sale.

Five or six months later the gang appears in Arizona in big touring cars and wants the hot money. They kidnap the sister and shoot her brother. The ranch hands ride to the rescue and the gangsters are ambushed and killed or captured. Everyone lives happily ever after. Ho Hum. Regarding the Alpha Video DVD, the source 16mm print was in good condition and there are few lines, glitches or missing frames. Contrast is slightly light. I rate it 7.5 out of ten which for Alpha is great. The script is pedestrian at best and the action is slow even for a 52-minute film.

Also, the inside has all the extra stitching hanging out.

He's on the slick side, but doesn't delve into torturously overwritten psychological epics (ala Kenny Chesney or Tim McGraw...), but prefers to keep it melodic and simple, with uptempo country-rock tunes, songs about broken hearts and an optimistic search for love. In many ways he reminds me of old Eddie Rabbitt and Eddy Raven (indeed, before I looked him up online, I thought from the sound of his voice and his phrasing that Warner was from Louisiana...) This is probably too slick for the indiebilly crowd and too plain for the new Nashville scene, but for country fans looking for something nice in between the two, this disc might fit the bill. Worth checking out if you're a commercial country fan with an adventurous streak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Begin here","review":"I agree with the other review of this book, theBagby article is wonderful in its insight and alsoits discouraging the adoption of riffs from contemporarycultures (a la \\"world music\\") while finding inspiration and advice in them.

It has untainted romance, drama, song, wisdom, and even tips for athletes! :) Most importantly, it tells us how we were made by a perfect God Who requires perfection; when we fell short of His perfection, he didn't simply condemn us to hell--he actually became one of us; and not even a prestigious one of us. He bore our sorrows, was fully acquainted with all the grief we take, yet didn't even stop short of death. Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconistent","review":"This book tells you to use adapt the \\"eye for an eye, tooth for tooth\\"-philosophy, while at the same time telling you to \\"turn the other cheek\\" and not strike back. Now how are you supposed to do both?I think the main reason for this, and many other inconsistencies (did I spell that right?) comes from the fact that it's not really one book, but a whole lot of books, written at various times, and then hastily thrown together by the monks/priests or whoever it was that was supposed to be the editors of this short story collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute","review":"I thought that it was occasionally entertaining but I really thought mostly it was repeatitive and boring.

I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.\\" -- Genesis 32:30\\"No man hath seen God at any time...\\" -- John 1:18It also gets the formation of the universe all wrong, evolution of humans, etc. Overall it seemed to get a bit loopy in parts, and to drawl on in others. Also highly sexist (wife should obey her husband, etc.), racist, promotes slavery, anti-gay.I don't see how anybody could believe it to be the definitive source of right and wrong when it implies the age of the Earth is on the order of 10,000 years old when it's obviously around 4.5-4.6 billion years old.2 stars for originalness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ersatz Bible","review":"For scholarly study and analysis of the Bible, described as a \\"surpassing wonder\\" by historian Donald Harman Akenson, there are thousands of resources to which I can go. However, sometimes I desire only to read through passages in the Bible - particularly the Psalms, prophetic books and the Gospels - merely reflecting and drawing on the spiritual riches to be discovered therein. So, I don't want pronunciation marks, notes, references, red-letter text or other things to distract me. This Bible meets this need for the most part. I only wish it included the Apocrypha as well.The type is large enough that even my over-used eyes read over the text with minimal strain. The lack of \\"helpful\\" diacritics and the other items described above make reading this Bible a pleasure to hold and read. Like all Cambridge Bibles, this too is well made and beautiful to behold.

I was so excited to give these to him since it's his favorite show, and was sooooooo very disappointed when I got them in the mail.

It has great information about medical procedures in simple language, and some advice about what to expect with a dying child. Overall, this book could have been more. The authors get too wrapped up in themselves and fail to deliver to parents what they keep promising to give. It's a nice book for supplemental reading, but there are better titles out there that will offer true counsel and detail about disease and the effects thereof (On Death and Dying, etc). Also, if you are a parent that is truly struggling with these issues, take full advantage of the Child Life Educator/Specialist staff at your hospital.

Some people feel it lost momentum and its edge when the writers had turned arch-enemies into allies and also weakened their threat. That could have been remedied with some good writing. thank goodness for the invention of Dvds to keep this show alive at home in the least.

Then I purchased a package of jewel cases to put the discs in, to protect them from further damage. I haven't had any issues with playing the discs yet, but I'm sure some of the life of the discs have been reduced from the damage.REVISION: I have now played a total of three discs out of Twenty-six. Each disc played had at least one error on it, causing lines on the video displayed, hick-ups, and skipping to the next chapter. One of the three won't play an entire episode.

Roughly 3 of the disks were damaged and some episodes wouldn't play. You can see a lot of message boards talking of similar problems.The Atlantis set takes the poor planning a step further. It is broken up by season, but uses the same glossy paper, and now a hard gel-ish holder for the middle of the disc which is both unnecessary and annoying.

I grew up in the 70's in England and so I was familiar with the \\"troubles,\\" in Ireland. However, it was amazing to read from a first hand view what really happened. It was a gritty no frills story which rang true for me. Martin Mcgartland was obviously a really brave boy (18 years old at the beginning). He paid a heavy price for his involvement.

He was a giant of a man - both literally and figuratively."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BOOK BY A GREAT MAN!!!","review":"I met Jean-Pierre in 1963 on the Island of Tahiti. I was very happy to spend some time with him out in the lagoon doing a little bit of spear fishing. The stories that he told about his life in the Belgian Congo were to me at that time unbelievable. I thought \\"well this guy can sure tell some tales.\\" We spent a few days until I had to leave for the Island of Bora-Bora and I didn't see him again until 1967 in San Francisco, California. He was to give a speech at the San Francisco Press Club, and then he autographed his book \\"Congo Kitabu\\" the same day at a book store. He did me the honor of giving me that book which I cherish proudly even more than 30 years later.

The songs on it are staples for the band, and it's a shame they didn't get much radio play back in the 80's and 90's. \\"Only A Memory\\" is my all-time favorite song from the group...I first heard it watching the song's video on MTV, and I haven't stopped loving the song since.

The only reason I gave this book a \\"4\\" is because the characters are off at some points. I can see it all in my head, except what they say sometimes doesn't fit their character. But all in all, a great book. Thankfully, Deep Space Nine came along to save the Trek franchise from TNG, and later Voyager. And along with it comes a whole new series of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad Amazon doesn't have a \\"zero stars\\" rating option","review":"A couple summers back, I bought a handful of Star Trek novels to pass the time.

You have to hand it to him, this one is another in his long series of great ST books. Even reading this after Deep Space Nine is finished, it rings true to much of the characters at that time. So read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great.","review":"The Siege was an excellent novel, especially considering it's the first original DS9 novel. All right, so characterization and some of the shapeshifting tricks might be a little off, but Peter David didn't have a lot to work with. But the novel keeps your attention, is interesting, and keeps fairly good characterization overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"A smash hit! (Pun intended)","review":"Contrary to what many previous reviewers have said, I do NOT like tons of gore. I pretty much ignored those parts.

Well, they were in the first 10 minutes and then the rest of the movie dragged on and on.Storyline was disjointed and I would have just walked away but hoped Yul might return. The stars you might have wanted to see were gone in a wink. It wasn't worth the small amount I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERENCE YOUNG, OPUS 23","review":"Well, well, well. If I'm not mistaken, this film must be the only fiction movie produced by the United Nations. Actors didn't get paid and Ian Fleming supplied the idea for the screenplay. Cinematographically speaking, there are two or three good scenes in The Poppy Is Also a Flower like the attack of the Iranian army in the desert or the surprising death of one of the U.N. inspectors long before the end of the film. Otherwise, the film is rather educational and the point of view not so objective as no one speaks about why there is such a Demand for opium in the civilized world.

I particularly liked the \\"high church\\" vs \\"low church\\" conflict that permeates the entire story. However I found it necessary to do some research on the Church of England and the various clergy members and their rank. There is a bishop, archbishop, archdeacon, warden, vicor, curate etc. There is also the political appointment of the bishop that resulted from a change in the government. Once all of that became a bit more clear I could enjoy the story. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Jane Austen or George Eliot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story About 19th c. Ecclesiastical Power Politics","review":"After a slow start due to the language and writing style, I enjoyed Barchester Towers very much. The plot is exquisitely interwoven with the many well-drawn characters coming together in the last third of the book. The humour and satire is gentle as we revisit characters from Trollope's prequel, The Warden, which isn't necessary to understanding this novel. Barchester Towers will not be an easy read for many people, but this British classic is well worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penguins all have tiny type! Oxford editions are all MUCH better","review":"My review I about the Penguin edition, not the novel. In order to save space, Penguin editions are printed with type size so tiny that it is unnecessarily difficult to read. I recently discovered this fact to my chagrin when I began reading my copy of the Penguin Moonstone this morning. I ordered it not realizing there was an Oxford edition that is 50 pages longer. The Oxford editions are priced just as inexpensively as are the Penguins but have far more pages and a normal, very readable type size.The Moonstone (Oxford World's Classics)I will now order the Oxford edition of The Moonstone; ditto for the Oxford edition of any other work of literature in future. (Just checked and see that the Oxford edition of Trollope's The Way We Live Now, which I just read, is about 200 pages longer than the Penguin edition.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Immortal Trollope","review":"Despite the criticisms levelled at Trollope for his \\"authorial intrusions\\" (see Henry James for example) this novel is always a pleasure to read. The characters take precedence over the plot, as in any Trollopian fiction and this is what makes a novel like BARCHESTER more palatable to the modern reader, as compared to any of Dickens's. Some readers may find the ecclesiastical terms confusing at first but with a little help (see the Penguin introduction for example), all becomes clear. What is important, however, is the interaction between the all-too-human characters and in this novel there are plenty of situations to keep you, the reader, amused.Do yourself a favour and take a trip back into Nineteenth century where technology is just a blink in everyone's eye. What you will discover, however, is that human beings have not really changed, just the conventions have."},{"rating":"2","title":"loves it","review":"works great with his video now color. he loves the video now but the discs are hard to find. i ordered lots of them and he watched them often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Developmental winner","review":"My grandson has enjoyed this toy since he was 4 months old.

However, there are other versions, such as the Douay-Rheims Bible, that pre-date the KJV by decades. In fact, the Douay-Rheims Bible used more ancient manuscripts for translation and is therefore more accurate. Some people may also find the introduction and other notes of this edition offensive since it spews with hatred towards non-Anglican Christians who had to live in hiding or risk torture or execution. These are the same Anglicans that burned religious books and destroyed many beautiful churches. For a full understanding of why this edition is so offensive, see Cramer's Godly Order, by Michael Davies."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not a Catholic Bible !","review":"While this is the copy of the BIBLE used by most non catholic's,it is not a catholic BIBLE. It is not approved by the church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of historical interest, but not very practical","review":"It would probably be somewhat presumptuous of me to review this book's content, so I'll confine my comments to the version and the edition.I confess that when I want to read the Bible for the primary purpose of understanding its meaning, I choose a modern translation. But I want a King James version in my library for the beauty of its language, and when I want to appreciate the Bible as an aesthetic object. Also, one of my hobbies is composing music, and I've always been interested in setting passages from the Bible to music, but I would definitely want to use the King James text.This edition interested me because it advertised itself as an exact replica of the 1611 edition. Well, that it is, complete with 1611 spellings and 1611 typeface. Alas, it turns out not to be rather difficult to read, because the typeface is so small and so stylized.Don't get me wrong. I'm not sorry I bought it, but I did need to buy another edition as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"In truth its still the same Bible.","review":"After a thorough study on the 1611 edition, I can say there is very little differance between the 1611 edition and the 1769 edition.Using a side by side comparison, I have seen very little differance in the readings.The original font used was 18th century, so the lowercase 's' looked simular to an 'f'. U & V were interchangable (hence why we call 'W' a double-u), and D looked like a greek Delta. Also is the fact that a standard of spelling was not formed, so words were spelled many different ways.In essence, the King James Version of 1769 is only a touchup to the 1611 edition. It's still the same Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have always order my books from Amazon.Com with great success. But I paid for a new Holy Bible : 1611 Edition.

The three months mentioned in the title may be a bit optimistic, but the level of difficulty increases rapidly with each chapter, so you find yourself making quick progress. Each chapter is built up around a backing track on the CD, where you can try out the lessons in that chapter. The backing tracks, which are done in variety of pop styles, are also great for jamming along, so even after going through the material you'll have use of the CD. The book is not a reference book (go to Ralph Denyer's The Guitar Handbook for that), and the course is limited to rock music, but other than that (and the cheesy pick included) it comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Decision","review":"This book is an excellant starter for learning electric guitar. The music disc really helps in bringing the sound and book lessons together. I am still learning, but with the layed out weekly lessons, it makes it much easier to stay on track. The book certainly makes it much easier, but like anything else, it still just comes down to practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad news book & CD","review":"This book has only 1 redeeming quality - it has a great poster showing notes on the fretboard.

Even though my intense interest in history had not included naval history, Mr. Martin made the description of the ships and the battles, as well as the developments of the U.S. Navy very readable. At times it was a little difficult to follow the family lines, especially since the Parrish family members were not included in the genealogy tables.

I corresponded with Mike not long after The Satan Seller came out, so anyone who totally rejects Mike's testimony--and his sincerity--has earned my disapprobation. In other words, I expect Mike to tell the truth, even if it conflicts in some way with his original testimony. See for yourself: Buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"frighteningly enlightening","review":"Down through the ages man has proven that spirits are not real. The proof however has been simply a matter of their own logic. Mike Warnke has written something here that though not proof gives the reader something to seriously consider. Kind of like having a tow rope,ice melter, and 4 wheel drive in the winter. You can decide not to have these things and IF you get stranded you have only yourself to blame, however if you are prepared then chances are you will only suffer slightly. If what Mike relates to us is untrue then he and he alone will suffer for the lie, but if he is telling the truth (I suspect he is) then the reader must make their individual decision. The message Mike delivers is not one of demonism but one of being rescued from demonism. Hooray for Mike"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ministry based on Falsehood and Lies","review":"I read this book just prior to the 1992 article by Cornerstone Magazine which exposed Warnke for the liar he is. His ministry may have touched many but my story is one that makes it all worthless. My best friend and I bought and read this book together, he was not and continues to not be a Christian. We had seen signs of occult activity in the hills surrounding our Southern California neighborhood. We bought this book and read it in order to learn more. Several conversations with my friend saw him on the verge of accepting Christ, then the truth came out about Warnke. His opinion of Christians in general dropped through the floor. I was never able to have a significant conversation with him after that.It is irresponsible for anyone to recommend this book without doing proper research for themselves and informing their friends about the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liar, liar","review":"I give this book one star because that's as low a rating as I can give it.

Warnke tries to mix neo-pagan witchcraft and Satanism in ways that don't make any sense to someone (like me) familiar with both. He attacks the use of ritual in Christian worship as being empty, yet at the end of the book he's engaging in his own brand of Christian voodoo - 'calling on the Blood' and such.A 1992 expose in Cornerstone magazine blew the doors off this author's fictional past. Which is no surprise, having read his obviously fabricated autobiography.I'm rating the book two stars, because it's not badly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asinine drivel by a charlatan","review":"I do not write as aSatanist, but as a Christian. Mike Warnke and his books were exposed by the Evangelical magazine Cornerstone. He is not the \\"ex-Satanist' he claims to be, and his account of that peculiar religion is badly misinformed.In fact, I suspect that the Warnkes, Larsons and Rebecca Browns of this world do far more to drive sensitive and intelligent people into the ranks of satanism than the collected writings of \\"doctor\\"Lavey. Too many men and women have read this drivel, then checked out what the Satanists have to actually say, and then concluded that Christians are liars , and that Satanism makes sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"FORGIVE AND FORGET","review":"I am constantly amazed at the number of people chucking boulders while they live in totally glass houses.

You can definitely tell who are the Christians and who are not. If you want the knowledge of what it is like to have your child messed up with cults or satanism you need to read this book. There is no fantasy. People seem to want to call it fantasy but it is not. This is the real forces of the world. As it is said in the Bible, satan is the prince of the world, and this is a sample of his work. Reference: John 12:31. I highly recommend this book to those who want a glimpse of what Satan can, and does, to the young and the old. Although, it is disturbing reading I would suggest you reading it first before your teenager does. I think maybe people want to call it fantasy because it is too much to handle.

I read this book about 25 years ago and once I started, I could not put it down. It is very well written and a captivating story. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, Warnke decided to pass this fiction as his life story. He was not the first or the last to do something like this, but when a Christian does it, it tends to cast dispersions on Christianity in general. It also derailed what might have been a significant career and witness for Christ. God only knows what might have been for Warnke."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Seller of Satan","review":"I read this book twenty years ago, yea, it made in impact, but these past ten years, Mike has been in deep kimshee regarding his ministry and the embellishment and exaggeration of his book. Before buying the book, plug his name into Yahoo, read the websites that offer information about the inconsistancies on dates, things he's done-- how the people interviewed from his past say that these things didn't happen.

My favorite chapter included an episode of a coven member materializing from thin air to tell Warnke their meeting time had changed. She couldn't call?This sort of trash gave us equally debunked moral panics like the ridiculous Satanic Panic of the 80's. Too bad so many people had their lives ruined before we came to our senses. (Read Remembering Satan)The Satan Seller uses as its selling point a constant message about spiritual warfare and being wary. Faith based in fear. Fear has been used to keep the congregation in line since the first stones were stacked to build a temple. Satans and devils and demons? How believable is all this? Do we ever stop to think how downright silly this is? Why not goblins and elves? Oh right, that's just dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"HOW anyone could find this hateful book enlightening in this day is beyond me. I personally think that Warnke, if anyone, is the Satan seller.This book is hysterical and inacurate. It is a deep insult to the Pagan community--and in essence is also detrimental to Christianity as well. Please...be INFORMED before making a decision one way or another on this piece of work (and ultimately) this issue. Wiccans/Pagans/Witches/et all do not WANT to convert people--but we DO want to be allowed freedom of religion. Everyone deserves that.

It was disappointing when I found out Warnke had been lying all of this time, I had seen one of his videos talking about his satanic experiences, it had left quite an impression on me. But looking back, it's hard to believe that we could have ever believed this nonsense, now that I think about it as an adult, it was all really too ridiculous to believe. I still slightly recommend it because it's well written horror fiction, a very scary read, just read it as a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"For beginners only","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed with this book.

They're only hit, I believe. But, it's a jewel. I have not heard it in over 40 years. For you trivia buffs, back in the 60's this song was made popular in an Alka-Seltzer commercial!

The performance is adequate; the blade manages to cut through branches and does so about as well as my $10 bow saw from a big-box hardware store. This saw can fit in narrower places, but only about as well as the $5 Black Friday special I got at the same big box. The ARS blade is somewhat flimsy, and the handle to blade angle makes sawing something of a chore in some positions. If the saw cost less than $15, I might give it 3 stars.The price is horrendous. I suppose some people pay more for saws so view this as a bargain, but my price point is a lot lower. I got this expecting it to do more than my other saws, and it doesn't. If you have money to burn, this might be the saw for you. There may not be many saws out there that are all that much better, but there are definitely ones as good for less than 1/3 the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super slick, super fast. More than a mere pruning saw.","review":"Have to admit that this seemed like a high price for a pruning saw, but once I saw how fast it cuts and how totally smooth (= fast healing) the cuts were, I decided it's worth every penny.

And the new abilities besides flying/floating/swimming are useless if you want to keep all the coins you have. And thats it. Now for the good points: four playable characters, the search for the Chao emeralds and trying to beat the special stages might take you a while. And lastly EXTREMELY FUN!!! I have played the Extra level about 50 times, and i still play it. And i think one of the coolest features is the tiny chao garden where you raise your chao by feeding it, playing mini games with it, and if you have gamecube you can hook up your GBA to it and transfer the chao in each game to the other system and raise it.

I will not be buying anything \\"new\\" from Demons and Wizards because I'm almost sure I have already heard anything they will ever do."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD","review":"This album blows,do not buy it,there is one good song on the album called Heaven Denies,it's not like it's great or anything but it's good.Hansi does not fit Jon Schaffer's style at all.This isIced Earth riffs with Hansi singing, don't get me wrong I am a huge fan of Iced Earth and Blind Guardian,well not new blind Guardian because I don't like the way Hansi Kursch sings now.This is a boring album."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to Heavy Metal Form","review":"Being a huge Blind Guardian fan, when I heard about this CD I just had to get it and I was pleasantly surprised. In addition to the metal that I knew would be on here, the acoustic guitar parts are beautiful and really mesh with Hansi's voice. About the only complaint that I have is the production, mainly in regards to the bass. The bass is very low in the mix and competes with the furious drums to be heard, losing the fight. My favorite tracks are \\"Fiddler on the Green\\", \\"Poor Man's Crusade\\" and \\"Path to Glory\\". \\"Fiddler on the Green\\" is just an incredible piece of work, very melodic and a true showcase for Hansi's talents. The album is a refreshing, unabashed metal fest that doesn't pull any punches nor does it pretend to be anything glorious or pretentious. All in all it is just a well done slab of traditional metal with incredible vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"Compared to standard Iced Earth/Blind Guardian songs, these are a tad slower but even more melodic. A true delight for the ears. \\"Poor Man's Crusade\\" is especially good."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Rare Find ! ! !","review":"I am 43 years old and listen to AC/DC, Black Sabbath ect. I've checked out lots of new bands on the internet through the years and have never found a single one worth buying, until now. I paid to download both of Demons & Wizards albums and after listening to the excellent side efforts from these two most talented musicians I had to order the actual CD's here through Amazon. I downloaded two albums each from Iced Earth and Blind Guardian and though the music was ok in my old rock opinion it is not even close to Demons & Wizards. I only hope these two guys remain friends and realize what a wide range of people they are reaching. Please give us more of this excellent music in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"PAY THE PRICE FOR IGNORANCE.","review":"Why is it so many regard this as inferior to Blind Guardian and Iced Earth's own efforts? I think Hansi's voice and Schaffer's guitar were meant for each other: the music of D&W is darker, more vicious, heavier (check out the final trilogy), and than anything in IE's or BG's catalog. Schaffer never sounded so bloodthirsty and Hansi's vocals reach unmatched peaks of intensity. In fact, I think this album is better than both those discographies combined. Buy it or suffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal masterpiece.","review":"As far as power metal is concerned,this joint venture of Jon Schaeffer(Iced Earth)and Hansi Kursch(Blind Guardian)is a definitive opus.I leave the rest to the listeners..."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good I think I'M going to cry","review":"This is a awsome cd It has the vocals of Blind guardian,And the rifts of Iced earth,It\\"s a very cool combo,And I heard this won't be their last cd either! I bought this album 3 Months before it was released.It'S well worth it,Bye It please do your self a favore go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great scene study material!","review":"This is a very enjoyable peice to not only read, but to work on as well. Pape has given you some great material for character work, as well as good equally imporatnt ensamble stuff to dig into. Its funny, and Pape writes so that its easy to feel for each character evenly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph of Reason","review":"An excellent collection of essays highlighting the absurdities and potential dangers of the recent fad for the rejection of rationality.The arguments presented are clear and calm. There is no resort to ridicule, no matter how ridiculous the POMO examples are. The only counter criticisms of this collection seem to amount to \\"Boo Hoo, why are you picking on poor post-modernists\\". A bit rich when you really start to understand what the post-modernists have been doing to the pursuit of knowledge.If Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon Haunted World\\" were made part of the high school curriculum, I do not think the POMO academics would have been able to fool so many for so long. They would have taken their righful place beside the conspiracy theorists, channellers, New Agers, and UFOlogists.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in clear and readable accounts illustrating the deceptive and flawed claims of some of the most popular Postmodernist academics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Contradiction without Peer","review":"This book which supposedly supports science and the scientific method often uses trivial rhetorical methods from the school yard. Long difficult quotations are taken out of context, not just that of the book's argument (which most clearly never bothered to try to understand) but out of the philosophical traditions and vocabularies. Such an idiotic method could render any field incomprehensible. This is neither rational nor fair, but it seems deeply contradictory in a book that claims it wishes to hold the standards of ethical academic work! However, that would be bad enough if -- in most cases -- the authors bothered to actual perform an analysis but no. In many cases, they just re- contextualizes a passage and then, with no pause, just jeer. I am horrified to see the praise for this sloppy and self satisfied hypocrisy. Sadly, hubris is the primary tool of this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all this claptrap against postmodernism?","review":"Above all, postmodernism worships the god of the free market. Right wingers should be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"the movie was good and all bu their were a couple let downs,1. the ending was WAY different then the book (not going to spoil it)2. wasn't as scary as you would think3. boring at timesi would recomend the book over the movie any day"},{"rating":"1","title":"A let-down.","review":"Having read the book, which is a classic and truly terrifying, my expectations for this film were high. The idea of a family pet becoming a salivating monster is still a scary thought, but unfortunately the film fails to deliver. The 'cute' scenes involving the young boy and his father really have no business in a horror film. And the characters who die are all so obnoxious you couldn't care less about them anyway. In fact, Cujo, far from being frightening, comes across as the only sympathetic character in the entire mess. Added to that are the facts that the scenes in the stranded car drag on and become tedious, and that the 'surprise ending' is pointless and idiotic, and you're left with something which isn't worth the bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item not received","review":"I cannot comment since I have not receive my shipment since I purchased it on Oct 31, 2006. Still trying to find out where it went to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute boredom gnawing at receptors","review":"just inadequate in all avenues. A disaster of just boredom. It's boring. It's not scary. Give a go ahead nod to Dee Wallace, but people give this accolades of classic and the best horror, yadda yadda yadda, are you $#^@# kidding me man? Are you all from a lemming planet of suburbian mindlessness, as these movies seem to be shared by the same lot of people.Just horrendous. It's not scary. its not suspenseful, its not keen or cunning, its just garbage. Boring mundane incessant drivel. A nominal attempt at scary, done by yet another director who butchers amazing novels. Tommyknockers AWFUL, Pet Semetary AWFUL, Langoliers SNOOZE FEST, The Dark-Half Inadequate, Storm of the Century AWFUL, Graveyard Shift BRUTALLY BAD....but all those books were stunning.CuCant, and Cuwont, more like CUjoke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I liked this movie. Of course if wasn't as good as the book, but what movie is? Several scenes with the dog at the end will make you jump out of your seat. There are a few things that were very important in the book that weren't explained enough in the movie. Very good considering the age and price of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellentI bought this roduct for my son as he collects all Sreven King vidios and books and he said he loved this dvd,","review":"I bought this dvd as a gift for my son who collects Steven King movies and books. I always say \\" You can't go wrong with Amazon\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Buy","review":"I have been looking for this movie for years. I remember watching it all the time when I was little. I would buy this movie a million times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friggin' GOOD dog flick!!!!!","review":"Cujo is one of the friggin' best dog movies! who wouldn't live a movie with violence, horror, and a not-so adorable saint bernard?This movie is basically about a friggin' psycho dog that hates everybody. this movie reminded me about the friggin' psycho dog I came across when i was trick or treating this year. you gotta love this movie, even the kids'll love it. F.Y.I.:I also reccomend Christine in additoin to this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, very bad.","review":"I enjoyed the novel, I really did, but this film is just awful. All the scenes are abrubt and the dialogue is choppy.It was like reading the novel with only a quarter of the events and one eigth of the believability. I can't believe I kept this movie for some many days past its due date. The best actor has got to be the director, who actually convinced a company that he was competent of directing a film. I'm not a harsh horror critic, im a big fan in fact, but this is just unconvincing and bad. Read the book, but leave it at that. Your imagination way outdoes this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maddogg Muttley..*woof*","review":"This has got to be one of the worst made movie of a Steven Kingnovel ever. It's about a St.Bernard that's chasing a lil bunnyrabbit into a hole and then sticks his bignose where it doesn't belong,A Bat Cave. The dog then gets bitten on the schnoz by an angry bat, and yep thats the whole pitcher right there.A slobbering mess of a movie. Watch it if you like Dee Wallace.Otherwise avoid this rabid muttley mess. It's definitley lostit's bark"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned","review":"Contains scenes of woman abusing helpless dog. Obnoxious kid who should have spent more time with the dog. Ending that had the crowd in the theatre cheering and me booing. Wife hit me with her purse and dragged me out by the ear. No happy memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon, have what you're looking for:","review":"There was many times I was looking for a special DVD, or a CD could not find it in most stores I visited, I saw an add with Amazon.com so I look it upon my computer, and found everything I was looking for. Remember Amazon have just what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"still scary as i remember","review":"This movie is a thriller, if you thought Bethovan was bad, his evil brother Cujo. This pooch isn't friendly, and will eat you alive if you piss him off. Go ahead, watch this movie to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early King at his finest","review":"Although the digital transfer to BluRay is far from perfect and you can tell it's release was more to grab a fast dollar then to give the customer a quality transfer I still picked this one up. Price was low and as DVD is quickly going the way of VHS it was a good time to ensure I could enjoy one of my favorite Stephen King flicks for years to come..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sid Burns","review":"I love St. Benards. Although a thrilling movie, it had some educational value because it teaches children to be mindful of the way animals look and behave when something is off-balance in their bodies. They got to see how the stages of rabies progressed. Excellent movie. Thanks for your help."},{"rating":"2","title":"CUJO SCARES ME ANY TIME WHEN I HEAR A DOG BARKING LIKE HE IS GOING TO ATTACK IT REMINDS ME OF CUJO!!!!!","review":"Cujo is one of those scary movies when you are left in a situation where you can't get yourself out of!!!!! When a cute dog goes out one day chasing a rabbit and ends up getting bite by a rabied bat it turns the dog into a killer!!!!!
