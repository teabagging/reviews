This is it!","review":"Believe it or not, this little budget CD contains what I feel are the most all-around enjoyable performances of Mozart's two most famous symphonies. Sir Neville Marriner is the supreme Mozartean--he brings a fresh energy to each performance that makes anything the composer wrote sparkle with vitality. The string section of the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields must be one of the greatest of all time. There are more intense and detailed versions of these two works, such Bohm's or Barenboim's or Bernstein's (the fact they all begin with \\"B\\" is unintentional!), but these digital recordings are the best place to start. Marriner also recorded these symphonies in the early '70s on the Philips label, but those versions (issued in the Complete Mozart Edition) are quite inferior to these.

There are a few high points, but mostly I just find myself thinking, \\"there is no way this song deserves to be nine minutes long.\\" The slide continued on the next record, but fortunately they got it together again on \\"Murry Street\\" and have been putting out great stuff ever since."},{"rating":"2","title":"the new is the best","review":"Hits of Sunshine, Hoarfrost, Karen Koltrane...three of but not all of the reasons that this one is the best.

The plot was a one-trick pony that rode around in an arena, not gettin' anywhere too fast and visiting the same scenery over and over. The Trailsman is shanghaied by a young woman into taking her purity so as to put off this mean, sadistic SOB who only likes his goods brand new. Anyway, it all becomes a three-ring circus of retaliation, and that's about it. Not much western in this. Not really much of anything at that. Only 165 pages. **Also, I'm startin to figure something out about this Trailsman. He's kind of one-dimensional. Not like a Longarm, who is smart, funny, and good-natured. Trailsman is just kind of straightforward and boring.

But for this movie, I disliked it so much, I felt the need to warn others before they decide what they want to rent.How do you make a movie about pedophilia boring? Ask Berry Levinson. Of course, if I'd have known he directed it, I wouldn't have rented it, because I've hated all his movies. All his movies have the following problems, including Sleepers:-Inappropriately happy 60's music blaring during most of the film.-Unbelievable \\"pranks\\" that make you doubt the story and the story teller.-Long boring scenes that go nowhere and don't seem to have a purpose.-People with obnoxiously fake New York accents.-All the women are merely objects or props for the \\"cool\\" males to play with.The only redeeming quality to this film was that Brad Renfro was in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw it in the movie theater when it came out","review":"One of the best movies I have ever seen.

The cast is superb. Kevin Bacon does a fearsome job in a thoroughly repellent role. Robert De Niro plays a warmly sympathetic, street-knowledgable priest, and Brad Pitt does a very compelling job with his role as a prosecutor who sets up an important payback. Dustin Hoffman could not be better in his portrayal of a disgruntled, unsuccessful defense attorney. And he's nothing to look at in the role.

There has been a great deal of controversy as to whether the story is really true or not, but it almost doesn't matter if you are watching the movie for its entertainment value.It is the story of a how a few friends conspire for justified revenge for their horrific mistreatment as children in a juvenile home. The ensemble cast is perfectly suited to their parts and De Niro and Pitt are standouts as their characters are the central pieces to the plan.I wish I could give separate reviews for the movie itself and the product. The movie is 5 stars. The older DVD pressing that I own is horrible, 2 stars at most. It is a two-sided DVD that you have to turn over in the middle of the film. Not sure if more recent pressings have corrected this.

The movie is only 148 minutes long, and there aren't bonuses included on the DVD, so go figure!! ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Society Does Shape Character","review":"Great movie. Broadly, this movie reminds me of how the society that we create shapes human characters for good and for not so good.

There is mutual influence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karma...What Comes Around, Goes Around...It Is What It Is.","review":"Oh my goodness. This movie was so intense and the actors at their best.I have shown this movie to the teens I work with and even though the pay back for what they did the boys was not for their hands to do, but you also can say these men had this coming.

This is one of those gripping stories from beginning to end. While no way excusing what the kids did to get in that juvie prison, they did not deserve to be treated so brutally there. You feel like you could have pulled the trigger on Bacon's sadistic prison guard yourself. And Dustin Hoffman? To me he'll always be an actor playing the fringe type characters--Ratso, Raymond, Tootsie--like this burnt-out lawyer hired by the boys to lose to prosecuting attorney Pitt. Minnie Driver...I love that voluptuous Brit, anyhoo...play accomplice to the Hell's Kitchen crew of friends who essentially fight the system which made them what they've become. They movie shows how they beat the system however briefly. It's a good movie that I wonder how I missed when it initially came out.

Add in the starpower, Levinson's direction and some good visuals, and you've got one heck of a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True story or not, great movie.","review":"The members of an all-star cast in Sleepers give an excellent performance in this disturbing film about the lives of four men adversely affected by the horrors of their childhood. Some have said the story is true, some say it is not. Whether or not the incidents portrayed in the film actually took place doesn't take away from their power on the big screen. The four friends take charge as adults to exact vengeance on those guilty of their abuse as youths. That empowerment, even if the film is not based on an actual event, is a strengthening and vindicating shout for viewers who have found themselves in the place of those four boys. And for viewers who have never been in those unfortunate situations, the film creates enough reality to draw empathetic support from this audience. Sleepers is an important film and a well-produced one. The writing, editing, acting and directing are top-notch. Any viewer's attention will remain fixed throughout the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political drama without characters","review":"If you liked the Shawshank Redemption, this is probably your kind of movie.

This movie has three huge stars in it, and two lesser stars, and it was a total flop...and is a poor movie. The direction and the story are contrived and badly done. You can see every moment what emotion you are supposed to feel (\\"Oh, I'm supposed to be moved here, frightened here\\"). But you don't feel those emotions. It actually has the feel of a high school play, really, in its ineptness. And the fact that the guys you are rooting for murdered OTHERS, makes it a sour ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"This movie was ok, but that's about it.

Not a remake, but a retelling, as were quoted in Reeve's own words"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Respect Reeve, BUT.........","review":"Reeve has clearly been through a lot. If anyone has earned the right to tell his story in movie-form, he has. He seems to have had two choices: He could have made a straightforward film about the plight of the paralyzed, detailing the million and one things that go into a new life in a wheelchair. Or he could have made a film in which the wheelchair is not an issue, where Reeve simply plays a person who happens to be paralyzed.Unfortunately, the film tries to do both, and the result is a hopeless botch. As a story of one man's experiences as he learns to live a new life in a wheelchair, it never really gets going, because it has a thriller plot to keep running. It fails as a remake of Rear Window because it has to adhere to the classic Disabled Hero TV Movie Genre, and cannot generate any tension.Sad. It could have been interesting if it had chosen one direction. Instead it goes in both directions, and pulls itself apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the real REAR WINDOW?","review":"Alfred Hitchcock knew what he was doing when he made Rear Window.

Though he's a whiz with language and knows a lot about theology and philosophy, his ideas about masculinity, sex, love and need are abhorrent to me. He places women in a role where their only option is to 'ascend' to man's carnal desire, to become victims of the human plight which we are all heir to.This story is set in a parish and deals with a minister who becomes defrocked because of promiscuous behavior with his parishioners. Updike appears to idolize adultery and the need for sexual exploration/exploitation at the expense of sensitivity growth and responsibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Questions","review":"Updike is not usually this difficult to read. In terms of its prose, this is one of his more spectacular, elusive and confusing books. A lot of the time, this book reminded me more of Anthony Burgess than John Updike. What is distinctively Updikian about it is its engagement with certain problems in the Christian faith. Among the questions the book seems to ask are: Is God detectable or undetectable in the fabric of our lives? Why does God apparently allow suffering (that old chestnut)? Above all: what exactly is the relationship between Christianity and sexuality? Is sex sacred or prophane? The book answers and fails to answer all these questions and more in its complex, uncertain unravelling. I myself did not really feel adequate to its challenge and I did find the language pitched too high for me. But it's a fascinating book all the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imitation Nabokov","review":"I found this perhaps Updike's worst novel, because here, rather than writing as John Updike, he makes an ill-advised attempt to become Vladimir Nabokov. This novel reads like what a college English major might produce just after they had read LOLITA for the first time. Updike's Marshfield is a pallid Humbert. The effort, to reach for what Nabokov did with LOLITA, is transparent. Updike's attempt to be arch, witty, and erotic, like the earlier book, is clumsy. This novel is embarassingly derivative. If you want real Updike, try THE CENTAUR, or the Rabbit series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clear Insight","review":"The nature of business and organizations has changed radically in the last 150 years.

You might rewind after 15 minutes if it weren't for Cynthia Geary's performance. A pathetically lean script (McCarthy says about 100 words in the whole caper) guarantees lots of overacting.

On this maxi-single you'll get two versions that Orbit worked on (the original album version and the \\"Liqued\\" mix). In addition a version of Sasha Digweed's \\"Ultra\\" mix is found on this single, however it is Victor Calderone's tribal drum remix that takes the prize in providing a non-stop, heavy drum-laden track that will take you there and back.

I played it on my CD component player, my computer, my DVD player, and finally my walkman with the same result, skipping and hanging at the same point of the CD. Hoping that it was just a lemon CD I returned the CD for another only to find it had the same error at the same point of the recording. However, after close inspection under the right light, I was able to see a smudge/ripple on the outside edge of the CD.

Leigh sets out to find her man and finds danger along the way.Chassie West has created some terrific characters in KILLING KIN. Tank and Tina are especially funny yet realistic.

So I don't really know what went wrong. It sounds as though both artists are trying to make the music TOO Romantic; sure, Mendelssohn was a Romantic composer, but he was still Mendelssohn. He was lyrical, but he never \\"gushed,\\" as is the case here. It also seems as if Perlman and the orchestra are never quite together, which is hardly noticeable but disturbing nonetheless.

You can schedule how often it updates virus and spyware definitions or even only do it when you say. It does not drag down my 3 computers at any time - even while it is scanning for viruses and spyware.

I did a hard shut down on both computers and then booted them up again, only to freeze after the first ten minutes. This was a waist of my money (and time). Oh, and when I tried to contact ZoneAlarm (they have this funky 'live chat that isn't live chat' thing and then it told me to email them). So, I emailed them and wait, no response.

When doing a virus check with only 25G in use it would completely stop all other use for over an hour (I could play solitare if I didn't change games)."},{"rating":"1","title":"My laptop will never be the same","review":"Yikes, I had read some great reviews on this product and as it was time to renew McAfee I figured go with a higher reviewed product. Bad idea. I don't know if deleting McAfee screwed up my laptop or if Zone Alarm is just poorly written, but I had nothing but problems. And to make sure they drove me nuts their Tech department doesn't speak to the customer they send random emails...how's 24+ hours strike you for response time. Stick with your current internet security suite, Zone Alarm may work for you, but then again it may not..but happily, and kind of oddly, their customer service department moves QUICKLY when asking for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"a freind told me about this, and its very fast and simple to use, I have windows vista basic. and it never shut down on me!!! or crashes,, always a good feeling to know your protected!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shut's down computer","review":"I am running Windows Vista Home Premium. Every time I try to install Zonealarm Internet Security Suite, it shuts down my computer. The only way I got the program to install was in safe mode. But, after restarting the computer it would immediately shut down once zone alarm began to run. I liked the previous versions, but this one is a big disappointment.

Boot/shutdown times can hit the 7-10 minute range if you have certain other software installed on your computer. What other software - every day software like Nero Burning ROM and a variety of others.Spend some time searching the ZoneAlarm user forums reading about the boot/shutdown issues and will find that many other applications you may already have on your computer don't sit well with ZoneAlarm causing ZA to be extremely slow.Normal every day software causes ZoneAlarm to be slow? Doesn't sound right but it's not a joke. This formerly great product is now completely down the tubes. The ZoneAlarm forum moderators post their canned responses to this issue and Tech Support recommends you uninstall the offending normal every day software or make registry tweaks to improve performance.Bottom line: ZoneAlarm is no longer a good product. Choose something else like Kaspersky, Norton, or McAfee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zone Alarm; Once a great program, now not so good.","review":"Having used Zone Alarm since it was owned by a small company in San Francisco over 4 years ago I have seen the product decrease in it's ability to function severely over the years.

ZoneAlarm ISN'T it!!!Help!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance and Upgrade Headache","review":"Based on reviews and recommendations, I tried ZoneAlarm for the last two years. Upgrades have almost always had problems. These are well documented in the ZoneAlarm forums. They seem to push out updates, sometimes automatically, before they are well tested. Specifically, I've had to continually workaround a known conflict with the Cisco VPN software that I use. The performance for the ZoneAlarm software has gotten increasingly worse. I have since switched to the latest Norton Internet Security 2009, which appears to be a HUGE performance improvement.

I bought ZASS after seeing that it scored highly in several 'reputable' publications and websites(which I'll now take with a hefty grain of salt from now on). Seemed like a good deal until I installed it. The constant warnings and alerts were annoying but expected. What wasn't expected is the way ZASS totally takes over my pc on startup. I have to wait anywhere from 1 minute to over 5 minutes for ZASS to finish loading up, initializing, scanning...whatever it is. Even after the initial startup I experience lock ups lasting a minute or so. A minute might sound like a minor annoyance but when you're on the internet or running a program having your pc lock up a half dozen times over a period of a couple of hours it becomes more than a 'minor' problem. For a supposed finished, non-beta product that you paid for it's inexcusable. No renewal from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reality most of us do not want to go to","review":"I saw this movie in the theater alone. Two other people were in theater at time. I saw that it had two thumbs up by siskel and ebert. I tend to go to movies when both were in agreement. This movie really messed with my head. The movie was so well done that you actually understood how a person could be lie that. The reason it was so disturbing is I entered a consciousness that was very dark.

It is hard not to pay attention to a film like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Faberge designs","review":"This book reproduces 2 original faberge design books found in St Petersburg. They cover the years 1909 to 1915. Before Faberge sold an item they drew it in these ledgers in watercolour and noted all the details of the stones and materials it was made of.Many of the designs are for tiaras, fans, broaches etc. In some cases they have been matched up with the original pieces so you get to see both the drawing and what was actually made.This book is interesting for the different view it gives you of faberge objects. It is also a new source of information. It is not heavy on text and instead concentrates on reproducing the ledgers in colour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & White from the pro","review":"It is always great to have the chance to glimpse the work process of the masters in photography.

However, I think they forgot a few things in this book. Some of the dwarven and elven histories are changed and you aren't really given enough info on alot of other races and classes of Krynn. Minotaurs are included under the ogre heading and thier history is very limited. I think Margaret could have done a much better job if she had broke the book down in order to actually give the players more information. If you already have D & D Monsters Manual and the Players Handbook, this book isn't even needed to play in Dragonlance.I caried my book back for a refund.."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"This book is great, it provides all sorts of cool stuff about the dragonlance campaign. New monsters, new races, new classes, new prestige classes, new spells, everything. However, its art is mostly terrible, theres only about 3 good pictures in the book. But if you are looking for a campaign setting, this one is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"DragonLance is Awesome","review":"I love this campaign book. My favorite are the prestige classis, but I also enjoy the history. I just wish it went into more detail about the Dragon Overlords. But, that is probably in another DragonLance book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alkan made bland","review":"Smith worshippers will damn me for bringing this up, but Smith's first (1968) recording of the first movement of the Concerto was abridged with cuts of Smith's own invention. At least that is rectified here--the 1977 version is complete. However, whatever virtues this collection might possess, for me they are nullified by Smith's merely adequate performances. In the simpler pieces, he's OK, but in the horrendously difficult Concerto and Symphony, Smith seems to have his hands so full merely playing the notes, that \\"interpretation\\" is beside the point. Perhaps Smith's Alkan appeals to those who find Alkan too sinister, threatening and bizarre--but that's precisely what makes him interesting--Smith manages to make him bland. Get this set only if you want the other pieces in the collection, but get someone else's Symphony (Lewenthal or Hamelin) and Concerto (preferably Hamelin-who leaves Smith behind in the dust both technically and interpretively)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master of Glen Crannach","review":"I ordered Master of Glen Crannach by Linda Howard.

The stories in Brother are more fantastic (one story could almost be considered a \\"ghost story\\", and another is loosely based on a Japanese fable) and feel less \\"real\\" than the earlier Hobbema reserve stories. And where the earlier stories often had a surprising twist and showed some surprising sides of the protagonists, these stories are more predictable. Conflicting Statements, especially, reads almost like a college student's writing experiment. (Mind, I would still have given it an \\"A\\".) It's almost as if Silas Ermineskin himself has matured as a writer, but at the cost of his originality. Kinsella does hit the nail on the head once or twice, though, as Silas remarks: \\"Stories aren't about events, they're about the people they happen to.\\" Kinsella does remain true to that adage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Pictured Item","review":"You will not receive the pictured item that is no longer available but will receive the newer, larger, stackable climbing block.

The recurring theme (a single sweater draped over the subject being photographed) makes a trite and heartbreaking display of the lengths washed-up stars will go to in order to get their face back into the public domain. The quality of poses range from a droll tolerance to a sad, (almost<i>Sunset Boulevard</i>-esque) rapaciousness for attention on behalf of antediluvian former-entities.\\"The Sweater Book\\" is a mawkish monument best left to be forgotten.

Harrison is honest and does not let his own view point skew the evidence, no matter where the evidence leads. This isn't to say that he doesn't put forth his views, but when he does it is merely supplementary.Harrison is faithful to a conservative view of the Old Testament, taking it at face value and justifying his position authoritatively and empirically.

Well, Ferdinad was that book for me. It was one of the first books I read by myself. I first fell in love with this book back in the 1970's.

Not only does the story relate Ferdinand's preference for a peaceful life in the country rather than the boisterous sport of bull-fighting... the story supports the need for each individual to find his or her own life style. Robert Lawson's drawings marvelously convey the sensibilities of all the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this story","review":"I ordered this book for a friend and read it myself first. I had only seen the disney cartoon before. The story was the same, and even some of the drawings were similar to the cartoon.

ANYTHING she appears in is made worse as soon as she moves into frame. If her last name weren't of a semi-famous sort, she would not even pass the audition.

Seem to be a lot chewier than a regular gummy which is why I give them 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"Haribo makes a wide range of candies, including some world class goodies, but this is not one of them. The frogs are made of a hard gummi, and are all green except for a thin white layer on the frogs' bellies. You might not recognize them as frogs unless you're told. There is no discernible taste or texture difference between the white and green substances, and in any case, the flavor is unidentified, unidentifiable, and not very good. It definitely is not lime, as advertised. Maybe somebody likes this stuff, but I didn't.

I love these frog candies and always added them to my candy bag when at the candy store. I like them a little less fresh when they are harder and chewier. I just love to gnaw on these things and chew them and taste them and eat them. I can end up eating so many of these and not even realize it so a 5 pound bag for me might be a little dangerous. I love the white bottom that feels like a tough marshmallow. The texture and taste is delectable. Highly recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite since I was little!","review":"I always used to stick a ton of these in my bag whenever I'd go to the candy shop in the mall. They are amazing, and the Haribo version is as good as any. They combing having an interesting taste, with an interesting texture as well. The flavour is fruity, tropical in a way. They are pretty chewy, and not too soft (like alot of cheaper gummies), and combing a smooth, chewy texture on top, with a slightly softer, marshmallowy bottom. I will always like these."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"I don't know about you but I usually like to chew the head off mine first. Can't really stand it looking at you while you are eating them you know. The ones sold here at Amazon are fresh enough that you can get a clean teeth cut.

MacDonald is also sometimes known as 'Hurricane'; this title although more bland, probably gives a better idea of what the book is about.

As with all classic disaster stories for the first part of the story we are given the background of the principal characters, there is a family, a newlywed couple, a pair of businessmen, a recent widow, a counterintellegence agent, and two escaped prisoners.

His account of all the works on this disc (Rachmaninov and Ravel) demonstrates a powerful and near superhuman vitality. The recording quality itself is abundant and up-front (perhaps even too up-front for some tastes). Nevertheless, the listener will never be bored with this disc. These performances, though only samplings of entire Rachmaninov sets, stand strongly among those of other great artists such as Vladimir Ashkenazy and Howard Shelley.This is an excellent value at very low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self-Raised or From the Depths (Hardcover) by E.D.E.N.

His thug vernacular and street cadences play against type to sweeten his pledges of love to his friend, mother and nephew; with his personal marketing energy focused on three other people, the song transcends literally as well as figuratively. Charming as anything. All of which is beyond Sigel. Not that his street scenes aren't \\"true\\" or his delivery isn't hairy enough, but he can't even transcend his material enough to impose narrative on it; I get the feeling his audience isn't thugs so much as the comfortable consumers who get turned on by the mere mention of thuglife.

Alas, Anthony and Gloria possess the same hedonistic materialism that he found in themselves. Regardless of how or why he created this work, I'm extremely glad he did. Fitzgerald is a writer that I enjoy introducing to others, and I'm pleased that most people are willing to know him as more than just the \\"guy who wrote Gatsby\\".Good reading to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Languid : You know what I mean?","review":"Recently sauntering into a Fitzgerald phase, after rereading (or should I admit, like a former lackadaisical high schooler, reading for the first time) the Great Gatsby, I selected a second Fitzgerald for comparison and contrast. The similarities are obvious, a cast of characters ensconced by the status of wealth in the early 20th century. I believe Beautiful and Damned arrived previous to Gatsby, and whereas it has less popularity I would hesitate to suggest that it lacks worthiness. It is heavy in melancholy. It is generous in melodrama, more than Gatsby. An excellent read, a depressing read, it is a Henry Jamsian entreaty on the emptiness of the (dare I type it) American Dream, when coupled with haughty aspiration, and betrothed to hedonistic materialism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Insightful Storytelling","review":"I absolutely love Fitzgerald. And this books written about the Jazz Age are my favorites of his. The characters are complex and the story is intriguing. I couldn't put it down. What makes a book stand out for me is whether or not it made me think, and this book definitely did. I recommend this 100% for any fan of The Great Gatsby or other Fitzgerald novels or short stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"This is my favorite Fitzgerald novel. Because the main characters were supposed to be based on Fitzgerald and his wife, the relationship between Anthony and Gloria was especially interesting. The 1920s are a period that fascinates me, so the background of this story was exciting for me. Fitzgerald's writing is great, and he has his usual sharp insights into society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Among His Better Efforts","review":"As a fan of Fitzgerald's writing, I was truly disappointed bythis book. Verbose and somewhat boring early on in the text, the bookhas none of the best qualities of his better works. His tendency to write the elegant sentence is taken too far too often in this text, having the effect of a continual stream of unnecessary adjectives normally associated with writers below his caliber. The work also seems thrown together, with pieces of stage script and overly-sentimental poetry splashed among the pages. I can't help but think, with respect to how unpolished the product was, that he had an idea and a deadline and the deadline won. Better books to read by Fitzgerald are The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night, and even the unfinished The Love of the Last Tycoon. His collected short stories also offer enjoyable reading. I realize I am at odds here, but I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Narration of a Superb Classic","review":"If you wish to bask in the fruits of F. Scott Fitzgerald's powerful penning, I suggest you avoid this audiobook. While undoubtedly well-meant, the narrator's obsession with enunciation becomes quite annoying when prolonged over a 15-hour period. Passionate dialogue and magnificent descriptions rapidly grow dissatisfying and forced when inflicted with the meticulous pronunciation of even the most common words. Thankfully, there is an alternative in the version rendered (superbly) by William Dufris. It is both cheaper and far more enjoyable than this disappointing interpretation of Fitzgerald's timeless work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"I have never read an F Scott Fitzgerald novel before so thought I'd start with this. Whilst Fitzgerald is undoubtedly an excellent writer, this novel left me cold. The descriptions of the places and the atmosphere of the setting were really evocative, however I found the main characters, Anthony, Gloria and their friends cold, calculating and shallow. Gloria is obsessed by her looks and Anthony thinks of himself as an intellectual too good to have to work. They are complacent, and their apathy towards anything but their pursuit of pleasure and their inheritance comes through. Although I do not doubt that Anthony & Gloria loved each other, they loved themselves more. Their passion for each other was lacking. Maybe the author never intended us to like them, howeverI disliked them so much I didn't care in the end what the outcome would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for any Fitzgerald Fan!","review":"Great book for any Fitzgerald fan!

There are so (or is \\"too\\"...) many available.

A great value IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book, Terrible Quality","review":"The book is a classic, and if you like Fitzgerald you'll like the book. But the binding of this edition is terrible. The whole first half of the book fell out while I was on the first read."},{"rating":"1","title":"god awful reading","review":"I initially downloaded this book thinking that since it was from Fitzgerald's and I had read the Great Gatsby and liked it, I'd like this one as well. Boy was I wrong. I kept reading hoping that it would get better but I found it just awful the more I read. At least I got it free and didn't have to pay for it otherwise I'd be even more upset. If you like main characters who seem not to have a purpose and spend their entire days wondering about their existence and doing absolutely nothing at all then this book is for you. Also, if you're a diehard F.Scott Fitzgerald fan and absolutely love all his writing then this book is for you. If you like your characters to have a purpose even if it's only on the printed page then stay away from this one. I don't care if it's supposedly semi autobiographical, what a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I read the whole thing","review":"Their is no action, the characters are boring, self absorbed snobs. By the end of the book I wanted the two main characters to kill one another. I would have settled for murder suicide. Fitzgerald did not even deliver that. I hope I don't download any more Fitzgerald books. This was simply awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This is the most boring book I have ever read. Fitzgerald babbles and his characters are lifeless and dull. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"This book was just okay. It was pretty boring until about three quarters of the way through. I will probably never read this book again. It is a little depressing, but you can tell that from the title and I didn't love the style of writing. I do like other works by Fitzgerald but this one I did not care for as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical, beautiful Fitzgerald","review":"IT reads like most of his works. Great for those wanting more than just Gatsby and can enjoy the stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I bought this because I love this Penguin collection.

I also bought one as a gift for a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a read","review":"Great story, easy to fall right in and lose yourself.Maybe everyone knows a few people like this- that think they are entitled and above and if so their fall is a bit enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected a much more polished job.","review":"Fleischer's writing is surprisingly clunky; the text of TAKING HEAT would benefit greatly from the ministrations of a capable editor.

To actually ask people to believe that a completely neutered and house trained press was actually giving the Bush whitehouse a harder time than previous governments is a hard sell, but to, for example, completely skip over the unprecedented events of Bush's inauguration as if they didn't happen is revisionist history at its worst. Don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"You won't learn anything new here ...","review":"I tried to be fair and open-minded while reading \\"Taking Heat\\", I really, really tried but ... my, my. You'd think, after reading this book that, according to Ari Fleischer, George W. Bush is the next best thing to God on earth. Mr. Fleischer does nothing to shed any light on the numerous cover-ups, the abundance of misleading information and outrageous lies that have spilt forth from the Bush White House. It would appear that accepting responsibility for his part in the cover-ups, lies and misinformation isn't something Mr. Fleischer is interested in. On another note, the writing was awful - my 13 year-old could have written \\"Taking Heat\\" better. Worse book I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The longest non-answer ever","review":"In his ongoing effort to prove to the reader how clever he was in dodging the media's questions, Fleischer provides the reader with a never ending transcript of his White House Press Conferences and the non-answers they entailed.I have read every book written by previous White House Press Secretaries (Salinger, Powell, Speakes, Fitzwater, Stephanopoulos, et. al.) and Fleischer's is the only one I would NOT recommend reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lost Opportunity","review":"I read this book hoping to get some insight as to what happened in the first Bush Administration and the way the White House sold the war in Iraq. Instead Ari Fleischer, a man so close to these events, comes across as a Bush loyalist who supports and justifies Bush's policies. It was a waste of time and a lost opportunity to give us some insight and help give us some historical information and honest reflection.There is no discussion of how they used the press to manipulate the public and sell the war. For example, he claims the President was careful never to link Iraq with 9/11. But he never addresses why 70% of the American people in 2003 believed otherwise. How did that happen?After leaving the White House, he is still spinning the President's position and blaming the liberal media.

As a staunch independent, the insight into the left-biased media is vindicating for someone like myself who always has that nagging feeling that you're not quite getting both sides of the story. The writing itself was difficult to pick out a linear theme, more of a textbook to be studied than an autobiography to be leisurely enjoyed.

Well, you don't use all 4 or 8 oz. a lot of the time, so you have to guess on how much to put in the thing. I know as a new mom I want somthing that doesn't make me do all the guessing work.

Although we are breastfeeding, there are times when we bottle feed breastmilk. This item is a lifesaver. The directions are so easy and the unit has everything you need! We add two bottles to the cooler compartment and fill the water tubes before we go to sleep. Let me tell you that at 3:00 am, being able to just dump the water in the warmer and add the bottle is a real plus. Even with just the light of a nightligt, it is easy to use. This ease of use means that we can complete the feeding and get back to sleep in minimum time. I love the safety feature of the auto shut-off and you will be amazed at just how quickly it works. In addition, being able to use it for a variety of bottles, milk storage bags and even baby food jars makes it a product that grows with your baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for night feedings","review":"This product is great for night feedings. I used with playtex nurser bottles/inserts. The one thing I do however is check the temp of the formula while the light is still on and the warmer is still going.

First of all, If you don't have to climb up and downstairs to reach the kitchen, you don't need this. You can just use your microwave. Manufacturers suggest not doing so because they say the formula wont heat evenly. Well, thats nothing a little shake can't remedy. Just heat 10 seconds at a time. Second, it doesn't heat the bottle with the recommended water level. It's either to hot or not hot enough. Believe me, I had to run the bottle under cold water until finally I gave up on this product. What a waste. I do however use the ice pack that comes with it when I run out with the baby.

We'd have to put the bottle into the freezer for 10 minutes or so and try to calm a screaming baby because he was hungry and didn't understand that he couldn't eat because his warmer didn't work.

We never overfill the botttles past the 8 oz mark and usually fill the water vile on the warmer right at or slightly below the 8 mark. The end result is always up in the air - sometimes perfect, other time way to hot and of course the random spillage. If we fill the water vile closer to 7, the bottles are too cold, which is why we always go closer to the 8 mark. In the end, we often find ourselves standing at the bathroom sink running the bottle under cold water while our 3 month old is having a fit in her crib. I'm going to try removing the center tube in the bottle to try and eliminate the leaks, but even if that works it doesn't solve the temperature issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible convienence","review":"I love this bottle warmer. We have one of a different brand in our kitchen. I wanted to get one for the baby's room so we didn't have to come downstairs to warm a bottle in the middle of the night, so I got this one. This is much better then the other brand we have. It warms the bottles within 2-3 minutes. Our other one takes at least 5 minutes, and usually longer. When my daughter wakes up for a feeding, I go into her room, put the bottle in the warmer and turn it on (incidentally, I use the tall 8 oz Dr Brown bottles and I find that they fit in the cooler just fine - have had no problems with that). While the bottle is warming, I change her diaper. The bottle is usually done warming by the time I get a new diaper on her. And, yes, she generally cries during the majority of this process as she's waiting for her bottle, but all babies cry when they're hungry. It's only about 2-3 minutes, certainly not a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Help","review":"This warmer is wonderful!

By the time I change my daughter, the bottle is ready to go.It does take a little trial and error to get the amount of water right, but the guide is pretty accurate. I keep a glas of water next to the warmer to put the bottle in if it does get a little too warm.

We had some issues when we first started using it. We ended up boilng the formula! We figured out quickly though the key is getting the right amount of water in the unit. It takes a little effort in the beginning to find the correct water level for the number of ounces you are feeding, but after you get that down it warms consistantly to the same temperature. I highly recommend this warmer, but do suggest taking a little time during the day when you are not soooo sleep deprived to function to play around with the water levels until you are comfortable with the bottle temperature. Not all formulas or breastmilk heat the same so if you change like we had to do (4 times) you will have to adjust the water level again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save ur $$","review":"Save your money and go to a local Walmart and get the bottle warmer by Parents choice.

This is a HUGE FIRE HAZARD! I have contacted The First Years about this problem but so far have not rec'vd a reply. I even searched for information about Recalls on this warmer but found nothing. Maybe it was just a fluke that I purchased the two out there that did this - but if I were you I wouldnt take the chance that there are more with this problem, avoiding it altogether and buy a different brand!Initially I would have recommended this warmer but now I say DONT BUY IT! The on/off switch needs to re-designed before it is safe to use. (I wouldn't be surprized if this gets recalled!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't like","review":"I just don't like this product. Basically it is boiling the water and the bottom of the bottle gets really hot and if you use the Vent Air bottle the water drips out of the bottom is it is really hot.

It takes forever for the formula to get warm by this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst thing that ever happened to us during the night...","review":"We exchanged another bottle warmer for this one and we were incredibly disappointed. The bottle is never the right temperature and the water levels for the side vials are incredibly hard to achieve. It has boiled MANY bottles right over the side and onto the counter, causing a huge mess and horrible smell-think fried baby formula. It has also boiled bottles over onto our bedroom carpet at 3 a.m. Additionally, we have twins and it won't warm another bottle after the initial one for ten minutes. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too long!","review":"I registered for one of these bottle warmers and I never even used it one time! Honestly, by the time you are up at 2:00am and your baby is screaming the only thing you want to do it pop a bottle in the microwave and get back to your child ASAP! Once you establish a time on the microwave, it is much easier and faster to use that than the bottle warmer. Also when warming breast milk I ran it under warm water, so the bottle warmer didn't work for that either! Some people might like bottle warmers,but for me it was a waste of space on the counter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent and Unnecessary","review":"This warmer frequently oveheated bottles to the point at which they were steaming and could have seriously burned baby.

Somehow I thought it would be thinner but this is a pretty thick piece of rubber. My trainer stays pretty still on it and it protects my floor really well.

Somehow I feel it is a bit overpriced but I'm still happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers the ground","review":"I expected to buy something that would cover the ground from my sweat while riding the trainer. That is exactly what I got. It is nicely padded and rolls up and is stored easily when not in use. I would not get a trainer and not have a mat. There are probably cheaper mats but since I bought a CycleOps trainer I just got their mat as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"CycleOps Training Mat","review":"Our basement was newly carpeted and I didn't want to damage it when using my trainer. This works great and doesn't bunch up on the carpet - which is nice. You can, very carefully, move the entire mat with the trainer and bike - you just have to watch what you are doing.

He should replace a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"challenges plausibility","review":"the ending is not very plausible. however, if you are looking for something fun and attention-holding to, say, read on a plane, this is very entertaining. i enjoyed it despite the slight letdown at the end. the characters, while not exactly three-dimensional , were likeable, the plot well-done."},{"rating":"2","title":"More, more, more-----------","review":"I bought this in hardback when it first came out because I have enjoyed this authors work for some time. I was not disappointed. This book builds to a really different and interesting climax and the characters of John Walker and Max and the others were fascinating. Even the murdered woman became real and you grieved with John at her death. The reason for her death enraged you. In all of this, Thomas Perry engaged you from start to finish.I, personally, think John & Co are worthy of a series of their own, but I, unlike some people, do like a beginning, a middle, and an end to a series. I loved Jane whitfield and it was believable that she retired. (I also love Babylon 5-a five year TV series that came to a conclusion) I would like to get to know John Walker better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not his best work","review":"I'm a huge fan of Perry's Whitefield series - I'm always sad when I've reached the end. Not so with this one. Perry's writing isn't terrible, but it's not great either. The first half reminds me of Ayn Rand - it's sparse. She, however, pulled it off much more effectively than Perry. Also in her favor, Rand had a point to make with her plot and her style, which Perry doesn't seem to. The second half reminded me of Robin Cook or Michael Palmer (both of whom I can't stand) in terms of plot. Overall, I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one","review":"This was a great read. Perry has a new character John Walker, not a professional like the Butcher Boy nor anything like his Jane series. I was glad to see Perry branch out and do new material, many of my favorite authors last year seemed to just plug out another sequal setting up another sequal. Though I would like another book about Walker.Walker is pulled from his small cubicle at an insurance company by Stillman a \\"trouble shooter\\" and matures as the case proceeds and expands. At first he resists but since the case involves a former girl freind of his (who seems to be either setup or guilty of pulling of a 12 million dollar insurance scam), he feels the need to see the case through and prove her innocent.All the main characters were well developed and the plot was rivoting. The end was a little quick and the FBI involvement a little weak but all in all a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death Benefits by Thomas Perry","review":"This was a good read.

Oh, but what a terrible dissappointment it turned out to be!The characters were unreal; the plot was weak; the narration was disorganized. It was slow, boring and basically a waste of my time. At times it read like a survelliance report on the characters' activity.In the real world of insurance fraud, law enforcement and trained fraud investigators would have been all over this case----not some shady mystery man assisted by an insurance analyst!I recommend reading absolutely ANYTHING other than this.

I also have trouble figuring out what really happened. If someone want to explain this to me please send me an E Mail.Others have enjoyed these books so I will not give away too much.

They don't seem to melt together when they get warm. The white belly texture is almost like a toughened up version of marshmallowish texture. Interesting on the tongue. The flavour of the frog is interesting as well. Some say a pineapplish sort of green tea pear flavor.

However, it just doesn't work. The cartridges they have set up don't work because as soon as you tug on them at all, the floss becomes loose and therefore won't vibrate - it only vibrates if it's taut. But because of the way they have the cartridges set up, there is no way to make it taut again. It would have worked if instead they had used a roll of floss and let you feed it through yourself as needed, but they were too greedy and wanted to sell lots of cartridges.This would be ok if you got lots of use out of the cartridges, but in my experience they broke halfway through a single use. So... forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this some kind of joke?","review":"I floss twice a day and was hoping this would make it easier to do. No such luck, it's very awkward.

Roughing It is by far my favorite. In it we sense the limitless possibilities of 19th century America. Twain is by turns an assistant to his brother (the Secretary of Nevada Territory), a gold miner, a journalist, and a traveller in the Pacific. The Innocents Abroad, while still good, is more labored than Roughing It - it is clear that Twain was more fertile when writing about his native soul.A word about the Library of America editions - if you are interested at all in America's literary heritage, you can't do better than buying these editions.

At first, I thought I had picked up a skin disease but discovered by searching on the web that a change in the chemical formula brings on such a reaction to many users.I quit using the product immediately, however I am still suffering side effects today - three months later. The swelling on one side has never completely disappeared and the area where I suffered the oozing burned away some of my facial hair.Should I decide to recolor my facial hair I will swallow my pride and have it done by a pro.

Whilst it doesn't boast the detail of Eliade's Shamanism for example or contain any how to information, it is an excellent introduction for those approaching the subject for the first time. It is beautifully illustrated and does provide enough pointers to guide you in the right direction. It is supplemented by a good bibliography and a list of contacts (although how current the latter are I don't know). Taken for what it is, an introductory text, the book achieves its goal admirably. In my opinion it is also a useful supplement to Eliade by countering the dryness of Eliades text. In summary a readable introduction to the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly wretched book","review":"This book is terrible!

The rape scene is difficult to watch of course, but the way the court system attacks women who have been raped is just horrible and realistic I am embarrassed to say.

Renato Cappecchi is a miscast Bartolo, but Raimondi is an imposing Bartolo, if without the nuances that Zaccaria brings to the role or the sheer glee Ramey and Montarsolo do. Levine's tempi are plodding, and Fedora Barbieri shows up in a cameo as Bertha, compleatly ill-equiped. If it were not for Sill (who can do no real wrong) and Raimondi, I wouldn't even bother looking at it. 2/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real joy","review":"It is a great pleasure which what I hear this wonderful recording of Rossini's masterpeace, vividly conducted by a young James Levine and sung by a cast of first-class singers including Milnes, Sills, Raimondi and the unsurpassable Gedda as Count Almaviva.

The first song on the CD is a remix of a song on Volume 5: \\"In Your Eyes\\". Granted it is an amazing song, dramtic, heart pumping and all that - but why did DeVito include it again? Who knows, but unfortunately it is the only good song on CD, what follows is tedious and boring.I have enjoyed over and over again every NYC Underground Party CD until this one - which is just disappointing. And although I have never considered DeVito to be a cutting edge DJ, his previous CD's are fantastic for what they are - mixes of standard, popular dance songs.This CD is so mediocre and I have wonder if it is time for Louie DeVito to find a new line of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF","review":"So this CD has some software on it that doesn't allow you to play it from your computer or put the cd on your ipod.

Number 1, \\"In Your Eyes\\", is a great change up from the beat from the earlier album. However, every track after that is not even a factor. I don't know what Louie is doing, but the song quality is horrible. \\"No Strings\\" does not sound good at all and \\"Love on my Mind\\" is way too short with not enough of the chorus repeating. The other songs are just plain ordinary to awful. I give it 2 starts because of Luz Devina. \\"You Shine on Me\\" is a pretty good song, but on here it sounds very rushed.

It seems that I am the only parent at our school that has \\"grounded\\" my daughter, and taken away some of her privileges. I was feeling like a \\"guilty\\" mom, but I want my daughter to grow up to be respectful, and to know the difference between what is a privilege and a what are her rights. This book gave me assurance that I wasn't crazy, and that some of the \\"old fashion\\" parenting styles are still the best. It's good common sense, but I think parents need to hear it more often.

I can't bear to put it away after the holiday season is over! The voices of the Clare College Singers, accompanied by the orchestra blend together to make a heavenly sound. The songs are so gentle and almost mystical. I discovered John Rutter and the Clare College Singers by listening to the local classical music station, and fell in love with their unique sound. \\"Shepherds Pipe Carol\\" is one of my favorites, but all of the songs are wonderful on this CD.

I am looking specifically for a mini recorder as I have some valuable old mini cassettes to transcribe but do not have a machine to do it with. The micro cassette is a slightly smaller tape and the mini tapes will not fit into the micro machine. The mini machines were mostly used to take dictation in an office setting and new they can be very expensive. This GE was advertised as a Mini Voice Recorder but actually was a micro and I had to go to the trouble of sending it back to the seller.

I don't know what the last reviewers problem was, but if you can't find the databases on the Que Web site, you should contact Que as they ultimately own the book and its contents and are responsible for its support. The author provided me with a number of Zip files with code and databases. The databases for chapters 4 and 5 are so simplistic, anyone should be able to recreate them with the most basic MS Access skills.Again, great book for classroom use, though that is admittedly a niche market.

There's a poignant story about it here.I learned a lot about Nigeria from these stories. Sometimes, the stories seemed to end a little too abruptly, but I guess that's part of the story format: it has to end sooner than a short novel, anyway.Mr. Achebe is a fine storyteller and he has many interesting things to say about the people and customs of Nigeria. I recommend this book, but only after first reading his classic novel about 19th century Ibo tribe people, Things Fall Apart.After reading these stories, I was both attracted to Nigeria and repelled by it (I've never been to Africa).

I just find the poetry to be yucky to read. It doesn't scan, and the rhymes aren't particularly good.

He was so well-suited to autobiography: opinionated, amusing, and clear-eyed and unstinting in cataloging the ways in which lesser beings had wronged him. If you are familiar with his films there's a lot here to deepen your appreciation. For example, the fact that his first job after leaving Vienna for New York was in a millinery shop. It's a brief passage in the book and it was a brief passage in his life, but the imagery was clearly an influence on his tendency to crowd his frames with all manner of texture and shadows. You needn't have seen the films, though, to enjoy bits such as: \\"In this period I made some friends. One of them drowned in a lake while on vacation, and another took me to my first restaurant and made me intoxicated for the first and only time in my life, filled my pockets with ice cubes, and paid for some woman to sit next to me and massage my thighs.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent films, disappointing book","review":"Autobiography (1986)Name changes from Jonas Sternberg (Wien) to Joe Stern (New York) to Josef von Sternberg (Hollywood, 1894-1969) already indicate a pronounced ego and a remarkable career, mostly in tandem with German \\"vamp\\" actress Marlene Dietrich: From the silent hit Underworld (1927), he entered sound with The Blue Angel (1930), and produced in rapid succession Morocco (1930), Dishonored (1931), An American Tragedy (1931), Shanghai Express (1932), Blonde Venus (1932), The Scarlet Empress (1934), The Devil is a Woman (1935), and more.

He just stared at the TV for 5 minutes straight without turning away then he literally brought the potty into the living room, sat down and went for the first time! Then he kept asking to play the song part of it again & again while he was playing with his cars. About an hour later he jumps up, runs over to the potty, sat down and went again! I didn't even have to bring it up! I am just stunned at the moment and had to recommend this video immediately. Just amazing and worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one.","review":"I purchased this DVD after I started potty training and that was a big mistake. It may be ok for the very first introduction, but after that it is no good. For one thing, the child in the video is given the potty chair to play with and has it on his head and is using it like a toy which may be well and good when the child has not attempted to use it yet. I stopped showing the video immediately because I don't want my children to immitate the video. I don't allow my boys (twins) to play with the potty chair or toilet, they are for doing your business and that is it. I liked all of the other videos we used (Elmo's Potty Time, Potty Power, I Gotta Go) which were silly and had catchy songs the kids liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of nice pictures","review":"This is a coffee-table book, and the main use of it is found in the numerous nice pictures of buildings and the landscape. The text by Blundell is useful but cannot take the place of scholarly works. The focus skips about a bit, and I do wish that the section on whiskey did not look so much like free advertising. The poetry section contains a number of typographical errors here and there. There are no examples of Scottish painting, even though it is a pictorial book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I play it everyday!","review":"This is an amazing album. I am a big fan of the Idols and have purchased all of their albums. But I must say Kurt's album \\"I\\" is far superior to them all. Every song is a gem; especially, Smell the Roses, Last Day of Summer and his covers of Ordinary World and She's so High are the best I've ever heard. I can't wait for the rest of America to catch on to him, he will be a big star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"WHAT A WONDERFUL PERFORMER! I HOPE THAT THIS ALBUM IS RELEASED INTERNATIONALLY SOMEDAY. WHEN IT DOES, MR. NILSEN WILL BECOME A SUPERSTAR ALL OVER THE WORLD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A;ll Good","review":"I got curious about Kurt Nilsen after seing him on World Idol so I sampled some of his music on various sites and liked what I heard. I took the plunge and ordered his CD a couple of months ago. I'm so glad I did, in fact I have ordered another import that has an additional song. Kurt has the true soul of a rocker even though the album is more pop in flavor. His highly unusual voice reminds me somewhat of Neil Diamond. It's a shame that this artist has not been marketed in the US by the IDOL machine. A great CD but not really suitable for under 13s due to minor language and one sexual reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a talented, wonderful surprise!","review":"My husband and I were blown away last year by Kurt's win on \\"World Idol.\\" His rendition of U2's \\"Beautiful Day\\" is better than the original. He has a sweet yet rockin' voice that playfully pulls you in with his angst, his strong lyrics and unbelieveable voice. BUY THIS CD!!! It's been in constant rotation at our house for a year, and we are still diggin it. WHY ISN'T KURT IN THE MAINSTREAM? He's my favorite -- he'll be yours, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem of an Album","review":"I've purchased alot of the idol cds, but, I honestly believe that Kurt Nilsen's cd is the most unusual, original, and listenable of all the idol cds available. The album has a euro-feel to it and has none of the over-production sound that you'll find in other idol cds. Three covers and nine original songs penned by Kurt himself makes this cd unusual and very original,as none of the other idols have ever done this. He also played guitar accompaniment in several of the tracks. His style of singing is pop-rock but with a bit of an \\"edge\\". My personal picks are Here She Comes, Smell The Roses, I, Lost In Despair, and She's So High. Actually, all the other songs, especially, the original ones are very good. This album is a gem and a rare find among the many idol cds. Kurt is a multi-talented singer/songwriter and deserves to have a very long and successful international music career."},{"rating":"2","title":"great voice!","review":"I really loved Kurt's performance at World Idol, and so bought his album 'I' when it came out in Canada. I have to admit, the first time I listened to the album I was a bit disappointed. But then after listening to it a few times, it grew on me, and now I really like it a lot, and listen to it costantly, Mind you, not every song is great, but I really like most of the songs. There is something about his voice that is just so amazing, that his album has become addictive. It's a very deep rich voice full of experience, very unique sounding, and I especially love at times this almost haunting quality he has in his voice.Hope that people in North American discover him, he really is a true find!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CDs I have","review":"Kurt's voice shines through on almost every track and what is amazing is that he wrote 9 of the 12 tracks. His range is wide and the tunes are catchy. I have not gotten tired of his songs despite repeated plays. While his covers do not deviate from the originals by a lot, his voice gives them a distinctive flavour. Some have said he is a copy of U2's Bono but a slightly closer listen will show that the similarities are only surface. The arrangement is not the best (perhaps because the album was put out in 2 weeks) but they do not detract from the overall high quality of this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome , not to be missed!","review":"This is an amazing debut album for this singer who really shocked and pleasantly surprised the world on World Idol. I was blown away by his performance and just had to get this album to experience more of his unique talent. Even my local radio station which loves to ridicule the American Idol show and the singers that come from it had nothing but praise for Kurt.Unlike many albums, there are no stinkers on this one. It's a nice mix of songs and does a great job of highlighting Kurt's voice. Yes, he does sound a bit like Bono from U2, but he definitely has his own unique feel and spin on these songs. This is a CD well worth getting, and I sure hope Kurt finds the international success he so much deserves...because I want to hear more from him!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Workout bar","review":"Its okay.

I bought it without measuring my doorways, figuring that it would fit in at least one of them, and it fits on all of my doorways. You definitely want to use a doorway with a strong frame, as that's pretty much supporting your weight. The handgrips are very comfortable, but the ones that rest against the baseboards, have left black smudges that are very difficult to remove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory- not so much in practice","review":"I was very excited to get this product- I wasn't even too discouraged that I had to put it together myself (I'm typically not very good with these things). But I was extremely disappointed when I found out it didn't fit my doorway. I realize I should have followed the measurement guidelines prior to purchasing, but I live in an apartment (standard everything) so I just figured it would work. NOTE TO OTHERS- MEASURE YOUR DOORWAY FIRST!After I got over that issue, I figured I could still use it for push ups and tricep dips. Great for about one rep when the cushioning stopped working and all I felt was metal bar driving into my palms. That was more uncomfortable than the actual workouts!I guess I'll still use it occasionally, but if given a second chance I probably wouldn't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"will not fit all doors","review":"so i made the measurements, and the width will fit all my doors no problem. but there is also a height requirement on this that is not listed. i would recommend at least 2~3 inches above the door frame clearance. this is so that the top of the holder will be able to hold the top of the frame. unfortunately, this did not fit on my doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"pocas estrellas","review":"Mojado's Un Monton de Estrellas is a chance to capitilize on the romantic-Temerario-grupero market.

Although it seems on first glance to have many recipes, there are actually only about a dozen: the rest are only minor variations on a theme. Most of the book is devoted to lengthy discussions about various fruits and spices, many entirely unrelated to mead. In more than one location, a whole section ends with the confession \\"how this applies to mead is unclear.\\" If you want to know what raspberries and basil are, go ahead and get this book.

Minor points off for the first few girls.Minor points off because the ladies don't reveal enough as often as the typical viewer of this fare is going to want to see. \\"It\\" is there to be seen in most cases, but is fleeting and somewhat incidental.I do agree to some extent with the reviewer who said that the models don't really seem as into this as we really would like for them to be. Nothing like a CandyGirl DVD for instance. So, minor points off for that.But that still leaves us with a four, which is darn good. Kudos also for the uncensored trailers in the bonus section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clothes","review":"They were not the same color as in the picture, by far... the shirt is almost a Neon green and the pants have neon polka dots. Still cute, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody had to make the dullest Brahms Fourth on record","review":"Wolfgang Sawallisch can be a proficient conductor who sincerely represents the old Kapellmeister tradition, but why EMI has stood behind him for fifty years is a total mystery. This Brahms Fourth with the London Phil. starts off slow and slack and never changes course. There isn't a bar that sounds inspired and many that sound fatigued. The filler, a mellifluous account of the Schicksalslied, is pleasant without being anything special. If only EMI had thrown their immense resources behind the long list of better condcutors who enjoyed nothing like Sawallisch's privilege: Horenstein, Leibowitz, and Scherchen can begin the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Genius","review":"I only wish I had the opportunity to travel back into time to bear witness to the brilliance that is John Coltrane when this recording had first came out in 1957(I believe).No one was even close to what or where Trane was going-his path was more of a spirtual quest that few have dared traveled.Trane was at height of his mastery of is instrument and with the supporting cast(Tyner,Garrison & Jones),it was a collective that has yet to be matched or equaled in any way.This one of the reasons that I'm a fan today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great singer, not so good live performer","review":"I really liked Norah Jones's CD so I purchased the DVD. During the concert Norah did not smile often, had little connection with the audience, had virtually no chit-chat or humor. In other words, the DVD lacks excitement and vitality. A review in the Star Tribune of her recent Minneapolis concert made similar comments. I chose to not purchase tickets to this concert because of the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the real thing","review":"I attended the NewOrleans concert and it was so much fun to be there in person. This dvd is good but severley edited - and it definitly dosn't match up to the magic of seeing Norah and her band perform live!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon, you can do better.","review":"Don't mix cd's in with a DVD. Bad form. you are usually better than that. This is written by his wife who orders under his name....easier, but it's starting to really irritate me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brutal Vigor of Snorah Jones.","review":"She's just as boring as ever in this new DVD. Granted, it's somewhat a testament to her talent, as she is able to smoothly lull listeners to sleep live just as well as on CD. But the material is just as flat and the style is just as draining. The most impressive thing about it is the fact that the soundman's mixes didn't have to be altered at all in the transfer to a market-ready product. Now that takes talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTIMATE NORAH","review":"A wonderful DVD capturing Norah's gorgoeus and effortless voice, simple yet elegant band. The camera angles capture her talent on key boards, both a standard Steinway grand and moody Wurlitzer organ.My only demerit is for Norah's unsteady and nervous stage presence which is understandable and almost cute, considering her age and meteoric rise to international stardom."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best is yet to come","review":"This young lady is blessed with raw talent and I can't wait to see her evolve (mature) into a refined and polished performer. The sound, video and production of the dvd is first rate and Norah performs in a laid back, confident style. She is very comfortable with her audience and they connect. The only thing missing in her performance is the depth and soul that comes only with some life experiences that she is far too young to have yet acquired. I'm perfectly willing to let her enjoy her youth, but the best is yet to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now see her close !","review":"Just received my DVD. You heard her, and you have seen her on TV...now see her close on DVD. Perfect quality and songs you have never heard, only on DVD, makes this the one DVD you must have if you love Norah Jones. I can write this review at length or just ask you to get this one at that very low price. You rock..Norah !Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Norah Jones - Live in New Orleans","review":"Poor sound mix. instruments same volume as vocals. Vocals get lost and are hard to stand out thru the music. Its like listening to the music in a tunnel with very poor accoustics. Hopefully I can find a better sounding Norah Jones DVD since this one sounds so bad. But based on the ratings this one has I would question if we have the same DVD. We do, yet the average rating is four out of five for a DVD with this poor of accoustics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe the negative critical folks","review":"I must say I had to hesitate buying the DVD after reading how \\"scared\\" she looked. How loud the drums were. How poor the sound mix was. How Norah needs to take lessons on how to be a star front person. The musicians don't improvise.. blah blah.It sounds like your sitting in the House of Blues. I appreciate the DVD quality, both visual and sound. Could the drums be mixed a little lower? Yes, but come on team, it works for the setting.I wasn't a huge Norah fan, but am more appreciative of her after buying the DVD. Love her voice, and a sweet personality displayed. If I were 15 years younger... I will be purchasing the latest release as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to fall asleep?","review":"Buy this or any Norah Jones CD! Incredibly overrated voice and songs, Norah has been able to sell records because people think she's a breath of fresh air when, in fact, she's as boring as they come. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick With The CD","review":"Although young and pretty so she's nice to look at, this is another example of a DVD that really is a waste if you already own the CD with the same music. Norah is so young she really isn't much of a performer, nervous when she talks or tries to ad-lib anything.Thus, after the first viewing, this isn't much more than a glorified CD. Neither her nor the drummer or guitarist in the small jazz combo are flashy enough to bring notice. In other words, none of the musicians are animated nor is there any noteworthy camera-work. It's mainly straight-on shots of Nora singing and playing the piano.It's nice music and she has a calming, smooth voice but don't waste your money on this. Stick with the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"music to my ears","review":"some of your reviewers are correct about here being nervous and voice getting lost....who cares!

This DVD is a must have. When it's playing you will feel as comfortable as a lazy Sunday in your favorite jeans. Buy It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Follow Up to the Grammys","review":"I bought this DVD the day after Norah Jones swept the Grammys, and I wasn't sure what to expect. As a performer she is talented and warm, but refreshingly reserved. Unlike most celebrities who use their moments in the spotlight, Miss Jones seems intent on keeping herself to, well, herself. Good for her.She's got talent, poise, and she's easy on the eyes. Original songs will come in time, and if she continues doing excellent covers, great. (Personally, I'd like to hear her version of Peggy Lee's \\"Fever.\\") I was impressed by her band as well - especially the lead guitarist. The DVD is well done, spare on the features, and sound quality is better than average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norah's shining moment","review":"Norah Jones may not have the keyboard proficiency of Dianna Krall nor the polished vocal range of Sade but she has what the others don't have - eight Grammys. Whether the Grammy was a one-hit-wonder glitch or a confirmation of her talents is a moot issue.What is obvious in this New Orleans performance is her artistry -- no embellishments, just simplicity and grace. Norah exudes femininity which is sometimes hard to convey in a jazz setting; her voice, oftentimes soulful and melancholic, comes across intimately in Lonestar, Bessie Smith, The Painter Song and the surprise encore Tennessee Waltz. Her now familiar \\"Don't Know Why\\" and \\"Come Away with Me\\", performed live, are enough reasons for having this DVD.In the musical world where artistic integrity are often compromised, it is nice to have for more than a 'brief shining moment' a lone star like Norah Jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoke for train","review":"This was the icing on the cake! Seeing my son's face on Christmas Day when the locomotive was flying on the track with the smoke coming out! Priceless.Word of advice - this should be done by an adult.

The author has a clear distain for the mental health profession and other professions designed to assist families in crisis. He offered no clear directives in how to address problem behavior, only to suggest the parents use structure, discipline, and love. This author clearly misses the mark for families who have provided these items to these children and the children are still \\"out-of-control\\".

We attended a court-ordered parenting class, and \\"Parent In Control\\" was one of the recommended readings. Thank goodness!!This book really sees it from the parent's perspective...no glossing it over from a psychiatric point of view, just plain living with a child who refuses to abide by society's rules...household rules...or legal rules.I only wish I had encountered a book like this when my child was 6.This book tackles your child's behavior from a no-nonsense approach in all areas: school, legal system, home, society.

However, it fills and deflates both sides together, and only allows a very small deviation between the firmness one partner selects versus the person on the other side. When one person presses \\"firm\\" for his side--yes, the male is usually the bigger person needing more air to deflect his weight--the woman on the other side feels her side inflate, too. When I (a 100-pound woman) tried to press \\"soft\\" to make my side respond to my lower weight, my husband's side also lost air. So we could never get it comfortable for either of us as the manufacturer claims it will do because the chambers are still very much connected. Customers are able to only control the difference in the two sides to a slight degree. Otherwise, it pumps up and deflates quickly, like any good air mattress with attached pump should. It also has a much nicer pillow top pad than the flocking found on most beds of this type."},{"rating":"1","title":"For your amusement!","review":"Most of this album is just fine and shows Maria Callas in typical form. I'm not a huge fan of her voice, but I do appreciate her artistry and acting. But, the Wagner Liebestod IN ITALIAIN is just too much. It makes me laugh out loud every time I hear it. It's worth the price just for the amusement value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miraculous!","review":"Here Callas achieved something that neither Sills nor Sutherland could do: She sang Lucia's madscene and Lady Macbeth's aria in ONE live recital to PERFECTION!

She is the QUEEN OF OPERA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"But the others were so good...","review":"I have read all the Harry Potter books and have seen all and own most of the movies. This one is just the second in a disturbing trend started in The Order of the Phoenix.Some of the best Tom Riddle's best memories are left out of this one. Harry's inheritance of Sirius Black's home and house elf, an important part of understanding Regulis Black, is also left out. Voldemort's own maternal and paternal histories, as well of what he thought of his mother has been left out. There are so many things left out of this movie that made J.K. Rowling's book so good that I think as fans, we should demand a redo!!!The one bright spot in this movie, however, is Alan Rickman (Snape). In his face you could see his concern for all of the students involved in the inner circles of Voldemort and Dumbledore."},{"rating":"2","title":"a gift","review":"My grand daughter has been watching these movies since they came out.

Thank You Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince","review":"Although making any book into a movie always leaves a lot to be desired, the latest in the Harry Potter saga- The Half Blood Prince- depicts the major parts of the story. Personally I feel each one of these books should have been a two-part movie to really include the details. However, this movie stands on its own as a great one. The special effects are very convincing and the setting ever so beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"Great black friday deal! Love that Blue ray comes with Dvd.

Most of the time I couldn't understand what Daniel was saying, he has a man's voice in a dwarf's body. If he insists maintaining a local accent, I would request the producers not to release the next movie Internationally. Emma was average, so was the kid to who played Ron. For most of the time, the film focussed on sundry lover affairs of the lead players. It was third class and cheap. The girl who played Ron's sister and who is Harry's future smooching partner is a slut in the making. She looks much older and mature and experienced in the art of \\"love-making\\". She looked like a teenage prostitute. Yes, she is that vulgar.

As with the others (movies), if you are looking for a literal translation of the book this movie will frustrate you BUT if you are looking for fun, interesting special effects and for the 3 main characters to continuing on their quest, you will enjoy this movie.

We can't wait to get the last two dvds in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potter Fan\\"atic\\"","review":"I love this movie, but as it was said in some other reviews, I fail to see how they are going to make up for the important scenes that they omitted in this film. So as not to spoil it for anybody who hasn't seen it or read the book, there are some very important things missing from this movie that will have to come to a head in the next one.I didn't read any of the books prior to seeing this film, so I initially thought it was pretty good and set the scene for the next one. After seeing it, I was so curious to find out what was going to happen, I went back and read all the books. Once I read them (they were EXCELLENT by the way) I started to understand what others were talking about. There were so many things left out that I would think it will be quite difficult to find a way to write them in the way the book was written.All in all, the movie is still pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy sound","review":"I'm not that big of Harry Potter fan and bought this Blu-ray for the kids. I'll leave a discussion of the plot to others. However, I will mention that the sound quality on the Blu-ray received was particularly poor, at least through the first 30 minutes or so. The TV volume had to be cranked up to almost full just to barely be able to hear any dialog. After a while, the movie volume improved and the TV volume could be lowered a bit. There were several dark scenes that were too dark, making the viewing quite difficult. For the most part, I don't see much point in buying the Blu-ray version of this movie, primarly due to the crummy sound reproduction and a dark video making Blu-ray moot. This version that came from Amazon was missing the digital copy of the movie, but Amazon has recognized the problem and will apparently be sending out a free copy of the widescreen DVD. Hopefully, the sound quality will be better on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch","review":"This movie is painful to watch. There are many more flaws than even Geoff (another reviewer) points out in his review. I get irritated just by watching it. I thought the first movie was brilliant in every way. The second was very good. Beginning with Azkaban, the movies have gone downhill. I think Michael Gambon, while a fine actor, is horribly miscast as Dumbledore. Where's his twinkling eyes? Where's his mouth twiching when he's amused and trying not to show it? Albus Dumbledore, as we know him in the books, has an almost child-like sense of humor and wonder. Gambon lacks these qualities entirely. The dialogue is terrible. There's almost zero continuity in the film. I agree with Geoff . . this movie is only very loosely based on the book. I bought the DVD because I'm a Harry Potter fanatic and must have all the movies, but I am deeply disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't download for the iPad","review":"I rented this movie to watch on the airplane on my iPad.

My WARNING is about the horrendous quality of the video. I saw the original in a theater, and this Blu-ray version is a sad mess of a transfer. Dark (yes, I know the movie is \\"dark\\"), soft, erratic quality. Most scenes dim and muddy with the rare, occasional cut to something bright and contrasty. I even attempted to adjust the viewing quality twice during playback and nothing made it better.

The movie makers added things NOT found in the book, which alter the events for the future movies, and they left out so many details and points which also changed the movie from the book.Some changes are expected, the first two movies in this series were masterfully transfered from print to screen. The others adequately. THIS was terrible!Not only am I unhappy with the changes they made between book and movie, the production values are awful. I've played blu-ray on my system and this blu-ray simply lacked in every way. Not satisfying, not good, not pleasing in any way.I simply feel that this movie wasted my time and money. I expected a reasonable film, expected things to be darker and stranger, but I did expect a blu-ray to have a better picture than an old VHS tape!!BAD JOB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Blood Prince","review":"I know that it is impossible to translate a full blown novel into a two or three hour movie but come on.... It should be at least kind of close to the original story line and this one just doesn't cut it. As a stand alone movie it would be OK, if somewhat too slow, but as part of the Harry Potter series? There's not much here to justify that claim and quite a lot that simply does not belong. Each movie has drifted farther from the books than the previous but this one jumped completely away from the story line and frankly I don't see any way the final movie can get closer without remaking this one first.

I had intended to wait until I purchased a new computer with a larger hard drive to download the movie (my iTunes folder is getting really big). Why would Warner Brothers behave so poorly?

Has Amazon taken to selling counterfeit DVD's? Dialogue is impossible to make out and the pictures are bathed in mud.If this DVD is NOT counterfeit, the studio should be ASHAMED of itself for foisting such trash on the public!I don't know whether I like the movie itself --- after watching this DVD, I have no idea what the movie was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie itself was okay,","review":"though it seemed to represent far too little of the book.The problem is the disc they sent me. First of all, it was not shrink wrapped. Used? I don't buy used dvd's. And it was shipped by Amazon, along with other free shipping items, so it should have been new. When I opened it, there was a large blue blob on the face of the disc. I tried to remove said blue blob gently, but it did not come off. Since the disc played okay, I guess IO can't complain about the blue crud.This disc was priced the same as the TWO Deathly Hallows discs combined. You'd think it would therefore be twice as good, in condition and in content. Not so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth seeing!","review":"Not for children but if you loved the book you'll likely want to see the film too. That's why I chose it. I did love seeing all the characters actually 'age' in real life. I just love Ron Weasley."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"The entire series of HP movies has been inconsistent at best. The first three were excellent in every way - from the scripting to the acting, special effects, character development, etc. No. 4 (Goblet of Fire) was okay - but gratituous and vivid violence - not a kid's movie. No. 5 redeemed itself somewhat, but felt sketchy and showed little or no character development. Alas - my high hopes for #6 were dashed. Very slow start left me waiting for something - ANYTHING to happen - very disjointed. As I continued watching, I saw a few small redeeming story lines emerge, but the character development was missing. Again, the script was disjointed - and the violence still more mature than a 10-year-old should see. All this movie did was to confirm two of my suspicions about two prominent characters. No - I won't be a spoiler and tell you what happens. We're lucky that the script revealed anything at all! Please, Harry - graduate from Hogwarts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat flawed, but still enjoyable","review":"First, the flaws. The waitress scene in the beginning was unnecessary and took away from other elements that should have been included. More time at the joke shop would have been good.The fire at The Burrow was well done, and added another dimension to the movie. However, the only inkling we got of the relationship between Lupin and Tonks was her calling him sweetheart just before the attack. Very jarring, even for those of us who knew they were a couple.There were a lot of scenes that were very well done, but what made the movie for me was Dumbledore. Michael Gambon finally got the character right and just in time. His interpretation of our beloved headmaster in the previous movies left me cold, and I was concerned that I wouldn't care about the character's final fate. Not so. Those final scenes were everything I could have wished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to the books and to watch.","review":"As our heroes grow older they have invariably grown far less mature. The topics actually covered in the movie are trifling and almost ridiculous (i.e. a group of teachers standing quietly and awkwardly by while two hormone-crazed teens talk about who loves whom...), and the book plot that was disregarded and omitted held so much more depth and detail. This movie is a disappointment for fans of the books I imagine, as it was for me. I find it's treatment of young love insulting not only to teenagers in general, but to the actors and audience as well. I wouldn't avoid this movie as it's a necessary step in the series evolution but it's content is going to be a let down for anyone expecting something with insight or profundity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This review is for the film.. i will updated once i get the DVD.I was incredibly disappointed when i saw Order of the Phoenix. Its my favorite book of the series and they completely butchered it on film. I went to see Half Blood Prince thinking that it was going to be a different experience..and I was right.. it was WORSE! They concentrated too much on things that weren't important to the story (romances are you serious?) and cut scenes that SHOULD have been included (battle in hogwarts). The most disappointment though.. was the ending. Dumbledore death...well.. it wasn't as sad as it was in the book. It was very emotionless to me. What was up with that?It had some good. The visual affects were amazing... and the acting improved quite a bit. Tom Felton did an incredible job as Draco Molfoy. Kuddos to him!! Unfortunately it wasn't enough to save the film. I was more bored to tears than anything else. I hope the last installment its worth watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a fan of Harry Potter so I was so looking forward to this movie when it came out on DVD to add to my collection. Sorry to say I found it to be a very disappointing watch. The story line made no sense to me and left so many loose ends which can only be tied up by another Harry Potter book/movie, which I hear there won't be. I for the first time felt I wasted my precious time watching it. In fact a couple days later I thought maybe it was me so I watched it again, it isn't me, the movie stinks. I am truly sorry that I didn't rent it before I bought it, but then again it only cost $9.99 with the war going on between Walmart, Amazon and Target at the time. If you don't need it for anything other than to add to your collection, don't bother as I think you also will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for Horny Harry to Take a Hike","review":"Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe, he of the bushy, burgeoning unibrow), is no match for Twilight's Edward Cullen. Oh sure, Harry's hormones are raging now, severely compromising his efforts to thwart the powers of darkness that have beset his young life, but it all feels so unnatural, as if the boy wizard's inablility to keep it in his pants is merely a ploy by the producers to fend off the REAL threat to Harry's future: the massively successful Twilight franchise. You've had your day Harry, so take a hike before the vampires come for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry the Wimp?","review":"Among other disappointments with this movie was the ending. In the book Harry is immobilized and cannot do anything when Dumbledore is killed. In the movie he is not even immobilized and he just stands there and does nothing! The Harry Potter I know would in no way have just stood there and let Dumbledore be slaughtered. He would have tried to come out of his hiding place, screamed, tried anything to save him! The entire ending of the book was simply left out, too,as Dumbledore's death is just sort of glossed over. And where were all the questions in Harry's mind as to how Dumbledore could not know that Snape was on Voldemort's side? These questions Harry asks himself are extremely important to what is to come. Finally, is this a Harry Potter story or just a love story? I think the makers of this film wanted to appeal to the teenagers in the audience rather than make a faithful adaptation. I thought this was the worst of the movies yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"As a devout Potter head, I am sad to say that this movie was pretty bad. The only reason I bought it was b/c I want to own the entire series.In sum, nothing happens in this movie, the events are not even close to events in the book, and don't get me started on the important aspects which were left out. Don't purchase unless you need to own the entire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful adaptation...","review":"I have been a huge fan of the HP series both the books and the films. I never have been dissapointed by the films no matter how different they may have been from the books. I understand not everything can be placed in the films. However that being said.. The Half Blood Prince film adaptation was the worst... The book was gripping and exciting filled with all the things we have come to expect from the HP universe.. The film strips all that down and takes away a lot of what needed to be seen... and even adds things that either don't happen until later in other books or things that never happened... The movie was a huge let down.. I only hope they can make up for it with the last two..."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst yet","review":"I could not even believe this was the same story I had read, well I guess that is because it wasn't. If this is not for a collection peurpose I would recommend not buying it. I can not even believe that someone would let a filmmaker destry there book like this. Does J.K. Rowling not even have anything to do with the movies? Does she not care how badly they are destroyed? And they are going to make the last book two parts so they can follow the story, yeah right, I want to know how they are going to get the crucial parts back into the story that have been left out!!! In credible, Terrible destruction of what was a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was good","review":"Wow, I laugh at the people who rate movies poorly based on what they read in a book. Books don't normally make for a very good film in the first place. The best thing I feel to do is to separate the two ideas of film vs. book. Two different thing and therefore must be viewed in two different ways. It's like comparing apples/oranges, Tupperware/tool boxes, Ford Temp/private jets etc.I watched this one before I saw the others so I went back and watched 1 all the way up to this (I finally understand it). In comparison to the first 3 the films do get better as they progress; less character development and more of the good stuff. If you're wondering, I'm not much into reading fantasy books. I'd much rather read a physics text, engineering text, or even a dictionary (something educational). I get my fantasy time from watching movies.Anyway, I thought the film was good and I'd buy the blu-ray for $17"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could actually OWN this movie","review":"When I bought it, I thought I'd be able to download it to my computer, since I travel a lot and don't have access to a wireless network all the time.

I'm NEVER buying another digital movie on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"No climax, insipid character development","review":"The Worst H Potter in the franchise. The movie went nowhere, without any climax and the worst acting/client development I've seen in a film. Why after so many crisis that Harry has conquered would anyone question his intuition or experiences? But his staunchest allies do - both to his and my frustration. The absolute worst movie I've wasted time watching and wished I'd never paid money for the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I really hope the writer of this movie is ashamed of him or herself. This was the poorest movie of the Harry Potter series thus far. It would seem to me that anyone giving this movie higher than a 3 star rating did not read the book. I feel bad for J.K Rowling that this great book was made into such a travesty of a movie. It's an embarassment. Too bad the writer didn't spend more time writing things into the movie that happened in the book rather than writing things out. I would say that if you read the book, just be prepared to be let down. Even if I hadn't read the book, I think I would still only give it about 3 starts. I purchased the Blu-ray set with the digital copy and I dislike the movie so much that I don't think I will even download the free digital copy. Such a waste. All I can say to the writer is...What in the world were you thinking and shame on you. To J.K. Rowling, my sympathy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroyed by Maximum Movie Mode","review":"I have read a number of the reviews for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I was looking in particular for comments about Maximum Movie Mode, which I cannot turn off on my Samsung BD-P2500 player. So, I haven't actually been able to see most of the movie. Why on earth would anyone want to watch a movie with dumb little pop-ups appearing every few minutes? They completely destroy the flow of the movie. Perhaps I will end up agreeing with the negative reviews (this was my favorite HP book and it sounds as though the movie is a big disappointment); but I would at least like to see it in order to decide for myself whether or not it is any good."},{"rating":"2","title":"too bad its ending","review":"i love the harry potter series.. both books and the movies so far. the last two movies i have enjoyed more than the first ones just due to the dark nature of them with harry finding out more about his past and of voldemorts past. i cant wait for the final 2 films!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Full-Screen)","review":"This product never arrived and contact with Elations was attempted with no results.I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE","review":"My wife loved the extras on the second disc.

While the performances and overall look of the movie were well done, I don't understand why the choice was made to give such short shrift to:- the revelation of Snape as the Half Blood Prince- Dumbledore's death- Dumbledore's funeral- the battle scene after the funeralAh well. We have Deathly Hallows to look forward to, and though I'm further disappointed that they chose to do it in two films rather than a longer one with an intermission (they used to do that, you know, when attention spans were longer), one can only hope they'll treat the final installment with a little more respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as the first 5","review":"This 6th movie of the Harry Potter series was not as good as I was lead to believe.

In the movie universe, when the hell did Harry started noticing Ginny, in the books, they gave somewhat closure to the Cho crush, but they didn't show that in the previous film. The other thing is, what happened to the battle, the producers said that they cut it out to prevent repetiveness. That was what some people wanted to see, for me it would have been a taste for whats to come in the final hogwarts battle. Lastly, I got large helping of teen angst, I get that they are teenagers, but if I wanted to see that, I would have watched the CW.

So, if you just want the movie, fine, but if you want the digital copy, don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Half-blood Prince","review":"This DVD was so dark in parts that I felt I was looking at a blank screen, I know the subject matter was dark but it would have been nice to see what was going on. The other Harry Potter DVD's managed to convey the dread felt by Harry without such gloomy film. The producer and director obviously tried the old way of Film Noir and it just was annoying. I hope the last Harry Potter will be more visible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good production at all","review":"OK, so you can't really make a movie too much like the book, not enought time, etc. But it feels like they didn't really even try this time. So many important parts of the book were just completely missing.I understand cutting out things like the funeral. This series is really going into a depressing area, and it really doesn't come out of it until the very end. I think that JKR took a poor path when she darkened the story further than she really needed to. But this movies bent even further in that direction with pretty much the entire production soaked in sepia toned depression, and the morose tone overshadowing the few remaining exciting parts.I would not reccommend that anyone buy this movie. Staring at a wall is less depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Does NOT contain digital copy","review":"Despite clearly stating \\"+ Digital Copy\\" in the title description, the digital copy was for a limited time and has since expired. I bought this version specifically for the digital copy because HP6 is not available on iTunes. I didn't discover this until I opened the package and tried to download the digital copy. I hope Amazon will let me return it opened.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the movie is actually good. However, this product is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Theater","review":"I found this movie to be very lacking and was always thinking \\"What? No that's wrong? Why is that even in there? And where is....\\" I hated this movie and couldn't wait for it to be over. It had nothing to do with the book but shairing the same name. That's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Good Thing is that it Ends!","review":"Easily the worst HP movie of the series, it's almost amazing at how much this movie sucks! It's acting isn't dramatic, it's action scenes felt out of place, the character's are so damn stupid I wish someone competent would come in and just bash their head in!The Good:-Alan Rickman as Snape is just perfect as always-Cinematography wasn't that bad eitherThe Bad:-Harry is a whiny brat-Hermione is totally useless-Ron seems to be the focus when it clearly isn't supposed to be-The Death of Dumbledore isn't done well at all-Draco Malfoy is a whiny b***h who can't do anything without crying-The movie is BORING!!!!-Still have one more book to cover....This is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Almost everything about it just sucks, and the absolute worst part is, there is still two more movies. Yeah, the last HP book is so damn long that it needed to be split into two movies! Hate this movie, dreading the next two."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want 2 hrs of my life back...","review":"This was absolutely the worst HP movie I have seen so far. One does not have to be familiar with the book to see the many flaws of this adaptation - from storytelling right down to acting.The 'high-school' romance and all the potions and all - it was absolutely ridiculous to focus this much on them. And while Ron Weasley's character has always annoyed me for being one pi55y sourpuss, he got even more on my nerves when he started acting all happy.Overall, I felt like there was about 30 mins of important material that was poorly presented and explained, and over 1.5 hrs of filler fluff that was painful to watch.And you'd think Dan Radcliffe would get better with age, acting-wise - he got worse. I laughed throughout pretty much the whole thing, as the entire production is an absolute travesty and cannot be taken seriously. I feel totally suckered into buying the rest of the HP movies, just to complete the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great HP Movie","review":"Bearing in mind that the movie is never as good as the book, (and that I have never read any of the HP books anyway) I found this to be the best Harry Potter movie yet!This is the first I have seen in HD and thought the quality was very very good. The actors sure have grown up and do their parts well. The special effects are second to none, and the \\"how-it-was-made segments are amazing! The other features were also very interesting, using the main actors to show us around the sets etc.I can't wait for the final episode next summer, because this movie has enough possible endings to make it potentially tantalizing!In case anyone is wondering why I have not divulged any of the movie details, it is because I would like everyone to see the movie. Just make sure you watch all the other movies first to understand the characters and the ongoing plot.This gets two big thumbs up from a (Movie only) Harry Potter fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad ending!","review":"Harry potter is one of my favorite movies to watch. This movie was awsome, but it has a very sad ending with a famous wizard getting killed by one of the teachers in the Hogwarts school. Traitor.

He said it was pretty good and he's waiting for the next one.I watched it on pay for view and I liked it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and Prince","review":"Very Poor lproduction. Too dark and disconnected. Worst of the Harry Potter movies thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and darker","review":"The difficulty of transferring the written word to the silver screen has been tackled and won, IMO, with this latest installment of the Harry Potter books. As befits the subject matter of this episode the film is darker and more somber and the colors reflect it. Once again those making this epic series have done a good job of showing as much as possible on screen as movie goers rear ends will endure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adding to the series....","review":"Adding to the ones I already had.....good price, beat everyone else and a good watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth of the Series ... by Far","review":"I'll make this pretty short and simple. This is easily the most uneventful, boring movie of the entire series. By far. I would go as far as to say this seemed to be like some sort of dig at Twilight. Simply because it was so uneventful and boring. Especially for a movie this incredibly long. Absolutely no action whatosever. The Quidish section lasts about 4 minutes and there may be about 15 minutes of action in the title.You do finally learn how Vuldamort has survived so many times and you learn some other things, and there is of course that big moment at the end, but between all that is nothing. Absolutely nothing whatsoever. YI had enjoyed all the other movies, but this one had me yawning and looking at my watch for a long time. And boy was it a long time, two and a half hours nearly of pure boredom. Not sure what they were thinking with this movie, but it was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book for sure.","review":"Very long movie. The director David Yates has more of a grasp on the special effects aspect in this film but the story plods along and the ending is ,well, not presented or as built up to as in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"harry potter and the half blood prince","review":"The product was in perfect condition, as expected from Amazon.

They made unnecessary changes to the story, changes that made the movie worse, not better. They cut out very important parts and added unnecessary and ridiculous scenes. Too much teenage love and not enough Half Blood Prince in the Half Blood Prince. It became Harry Potter 90210. To sum it all up, I'm afraid it committed the unforgiveable sin for a movie, it was boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed watching this movie","review":"I was able to purchase this movie at a discount, and I enjoyed watching it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to the ending","review":"One of the things that annoys me most about the movie versions of the Harry Potter series are the things they leave out or water down. The book in this case is EXCELLENT, however the big reveal at the end and the battle scenes in the move was a COMPLETE and TOTAL let down. I can't believe that they decided to dummy down the ending. Where there was a explosive battle scene just after the Snape completed his agreement with Dumbledore the remaining scenes with Fenrir Greyback and the confrontation of Snape and Harry was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad.","review":"This was by no means my favorite Potter movie. But to complete the collection, you obviously have to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great features","review":"I like the fact that I get the DVD, Blu-Ray, and you are able to download a digital copy. Also, the are some really cool features on both Blu ray and DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Harry Potter ever","review":"I never read the Harry Potter books but have always enjoyed the adaptations created. Micheal Gambon did a poor job as Dumbledor (hope I spelled that right). The film dragged on forever. This film seemed to lose it way. The characters which always leap out just wimpered away. There was so many instances where the plot could have delved a little deeper. I was truly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"For everyone that has read the books it was great, but If some hasnt yet read the book get prepared to answer a one qestions I did"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"I have been a HUGE Harry Potter fan for awhile now and I found that this movie was done the best as far as book-to-movie adaptation. Some of the dialogue in the movie was even directly from the book.I am a big fan of Ron/Hermione, but the Harry/Ginny scenes in this movie were working!!I definitely recommend this movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unapologetic Harry Potter fan","review":"I know there are many who will critique each Harry Potter movie for its flaws, continuity errors, or omissions from the books, but my family and I are unapologetic Harry Potter movie fans. We LOVE spending time together on a Harry Potter film festival. Therefore, we love this move also. Sure, folks can say that there is too much time spent on adolescent social issues, but this just reflects the age of Harry, Ron, and Hermione in this book. We highly recommend making a bowl of popcorn and just enjoying it for its mystery and sheer entertainment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Blu-Ray ever.","review":"This is the worst Blu-Ray of a movie I have seen. You can't see a thing in the dark parts even though you could in the theater. Also, the DVD version is only a little better, but it still stinks just as bad. The producers did aweful on the Blu-Ray conversion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good effects... very poor scripting and direction","review":"When I watched the movie felt quite disappointed. I read the book and there was action, laugh, love, mistery, anger, distress, tension, pain... but you won't find any of it in the film, at least not in meaninful quantities. Don't even think of learning something about Voldemort's or the Prince's past or intentions; for that you'll have to read the book, which just happen to be named after the latter caracter, but it seems the producers, directors and script writers didn't know/notice it. I can understand some parts had to be cut in order to fit the movie, but the cut turned into butchery and some important parts didn't receive a good treatment, such as the Unbreakable Vow scene, Dumbledore's pain in the Horcrux Cave, or the final battle in the Castle. Also, olympics jumps from one scene to the other and unnecesary ones such as the burning of the Weasly's family house made this movie not as enjoyable as the previous ones. A real shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Disc?","review":"So, the first info says 3 discs but the description only says two - for both 5 and 6.So, which is it and what is the mysterious and possibly non-existant 3rd disc??Also, if material was cut to shorten the final film (i.e. removed only for length) then there should be no need for the director to do anything. An editor/edit team simply inserts the already ready footage (electronic signals) back at the points they were moved from. I do not know why (sarcasm) but I have a feeling there will be a New, Improved Double Ultimate Edition in our futures."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO DIGITAL COPY","review":"Bought this movie for the DVD/BR/Digital Copy . . .1) When you insert the disc, no iTunes support2) It tells you to go to [...]3) Welcome to Warner Bros.

Of the books anyway - the movies are nothing thrilling. I havent been happy with a single movie, until this one that is. Alright, they do take a little license from the book (a lot of license actually) and some scenes are completely pointless...but the acting has improved so much and the funny moments definitely make me laugh. Bottom line: treat HP the movie as its own entity...if you dont spend time comparing it to the book, the HP 6 is definitely the best of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The quality of this DVD was not good.....at times so dark the action couldn't be seen. I would not recommend the wide screen because it looked like it was a copy of a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Please!","review":"Harry Potter has always been a favorite of mine. I grew up with the HP books and the movies throughout the years. This movie was great but is not the extended edition, if that is what you are looking for. I like the cover art and the darker side of the movie series highlighted in the cover.The cinematic atmosphere through the movie is dark and erie, like you would imagine in the book. This movie is not a direct copy of the book (which movie actually does that?!?) and has its own spin on things. This movies has a large amount of adventure and action, but also has a flare of drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Kids Movie?","review":"My husband and I love this series as much as our kids have. We have read the books and watched all the movies. As well as played all the video games. Usually a story looses its momentum after the first couple books.

This one had great F/X effects. Although I enjoyed the movie, there seem to be something different. It seemed to be a bit more \\"hammy\\" if there is such a word.

What a bust! Tepid, disjointed, vague, etc., etc. This could have been a really slick movie but, it's like \\"Harry Potter meets Dragnet\\"! The kids look great though, all grown up! I have heard and read negative reviews of Half Blood Prince but tried to keep an open mind, I mean, these are kids movies after all.However, Half Blood Prince really fell through the cracks! I really worried about Deathly Hallows, my favorite story of the HP series.These movies could be full animation (not cgi but real true animation like Wings of Honneamise! Now that's animation!

There are so many key scenes left out and strange ones put in that make no sense, I wondered at times if the film was of the book I'd read. \\"Based on a novel by...\\" is only too true. And don't get me started on the 17 minutes of game ads, trailers and other rubbish that are impossible to fast forward over before you are finally allowed to see what you paid for. I wonder what the author makes of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid... not extended!!!","review":"I along with many other people bought year 3&4 expecting the deleted scenes to be added to the movies since year 1&2 had them. I was disappointed as most were that WB chose do not offer this option on further releases with out making their decision clear in the press release. If you offer something on the initial launch of a product you should make it clear if you remove a major selling feature of that product. It was not false advertising as WB never stated their would be extended cut of the movie on 3&4... but it is misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"This is my second favorite of the Harry Potter books, but my absolute least favorite of the movies, by far.Acting was stilted. Too many story changes. No \\"magic\\" at all felt during the movie. I know it should be dark because of the story line, but the director and whoever wrote the screenplay totally ruined it for me.At the end of the book, when Severus yells at Harry... \\"don't call me coward!\\" That is a climactic moment and it was completely left out of the movie!The whole backstory of Voldemorts mother and childhood are left out.If it was too much movie for one book, then pick up the pace. It totally dragged. I will not watch it again.If this same director is doing the next two movies, I won't bother seeing them. I would give the movie ZERO stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray was mastered with artifacts in the image","review":"This is not a review of the movie, but rather of the poor job Warner Home Video has done with the Blu-ray video transfer. There are horizontal bands visible in various scenes throughout the movie. They are not constantly visible, but appear primarily in scenes where there are large areas of darkness - though of course that means they are visible in quite a few scenes of this very dark movie.The bands are not being produced by my player - I can see them on all three of my Blu-ray players, including my PS3 and two computers with Blu-ray drives. The bands are part of the image and are visible when the movie is freeze-framed.I recommend that those considering a purchase refrain from buying this disc until and unless a replacement is offered by Warner Home Video.I own over 200 Blu-ray discs, and this is the first time I have seen this issue on any transfer. It is obvious to me that this disc was mastered incorrectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted time","review":"The audio on the Blu-Ray set was perhaps the worst I have hardly heard. I should clarify, background and special effects audio was clear as far as I could tell but nearly all the voice audio was unbelievably bad - garbled in many places, muffled in others, too low to hear in other spots - I believe that less than half the voice audio could be understood - incredible, must not have had any test audiences.AND the movie was so disjointed, and lack of intelligible audio so disturbing that finally the only thing left was to sit back and enjoy the video special effects (exception: try to take a close look at the mid-ground items in the storage room scenes )."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Ray version is unplayable.","review":"Blue Ray disk has an annoying commentary box without sound that impossible to remove.Blue ray disk is useless.Returned disk and will wait until they print a usable version to buy again.We have the whole Harry Potter collection but this disk is useless :(We have no problems paying other Blue Ray disks on our system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced Marketing","review":"This movie wasn't too bad.

My daughter actually prefers Draco, and Tom Felton's part is dramatically increased in this episode. That being said, of course the movie leaves a lot to be desired, if you are a diehard fan of the books. It's been proven in each film that the books can tolerate editing for film's sake.

Yeah, it was funny in the 80's (for about 15 minutes) but it didn't do anything but give white kids an excuse to say they liked rap music, even though they'd never listen to what was really going on. Though this is still the case for some, Beastie Boys have created great works in the past few years and shouldn't be held accountable for this childish, semi-comedic throwaway.

The skillful way in which these guys masterfully blend the genre's of rock and rap is music to my ears. The rhymes are amusing yet eloquently put. They were one of the first groups to mix hip-hop and rock. Run DMC was another group to do the same. I compare \\"Raising Hell\\", by Run DMC, to \\"Liscense To Ill\\" in the fact that both are extroidinary albums. More hip-hop artists of today need to take a look back at the old school and remember their roots. In the immortal words of Tupac Shakur, \\"What more can I say, I wouldn't be here today, if the old school didn't pave the way.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Ow! Ow!

Two jackbooted thugs from Rolling Stone put me in cuffs and dragged me to their offices and put me in a cell where I was forced to listen to this album and all the Beasties records for two weeks straight. I said: \\"This is torture.\\" They said: YOU MUST LIKE THIS ALBUM AND PAUL'S BOUTIQUE even more. After the 1,000th listen, while being forced to guzzle Natty Light beer and read the works of the Buddha, I submitted.

This album is definitely a must-have in my book, not only for pioneering the area of Caucasian rap, but also for the unique style of rap that they brought. As I get older, it makes me sad when I see the generation gap, and \\"Fight For Your Right\\" and \\"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\\" isn't part of the new generation's collective memory. If I ever have a child, I'm buying the casette tape for this album, sticking it a boombox, putting that boombox on my shoulder, and blasting \\"Paul Revere\\" as the child exits the womb.

I noticed that he mentioned all three \\"hit\\" songs. So that means just because the rest of the songs aren't hits that means this album is not that good? Give me a break, those songs he mentioned are probably the WEAKEST songs on the album. This album is a Hip-Hop classic. So, i guess this guy is gonna give the beatles white album 2 stars because it only had one number one hit.

In fact, it sounds terrible on paper. The production combines cheesy beats with hard rock samples (really, really blatant hard rock samples). The lyrics cover topics like girls, liquor, and robbery in a very funny but very crude way. And of course, the rapping is done by three white kids with very whiny voices. It looks like absolute chaos.Yet because the boys were brave enough to go all out on the formula, it works perfectly. In fact, when they're rapping about cab drivers recognizing their date from the back of her head over a basic rap beat and guitar stolen off Led Zeppelin's \\"The Ocean\\", all you can do is laugh along and admire the Beasties for their bravery. The end result: half of these songs are classics, the other half almost could be, and the album is the pinnacle of rock/rap combos.

Altogether a fun but average albumP.S. To Mr.or Mrs. bolsy32@aol.com - From a life-long rap fan, I can only say this to you - you don't know JACK about hip-hop! Your remarks (\\"standard rap is talentless noise\\", \\"White noise is better\\") is totally ignorant and straight-up racist. The fact that you have only listened to the Beastie Boys proves your pitiful misunderstanding. Go listen to far more talented rap lyricists like KRS-One, Rakim, EPMD, Tupac, Biggie, Public Enemy, N.W.A. and A Tribe Called Quest.

Hell, 103.9 (it's not even hip-hop, it's an alternative rock station!) here in Arizona is still playing \\"Girls\\" and \\"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\\" on a regular basis and the songs are older than half the kids that listen to Fall Out Boy or whatever else they play.

And although I myself prefer \\"Paul's Boutique\\", this one is hands down the funniest rap album ever. The interesting thing that you hear when listening to this album is that Beasties started out as fakes. All they really were doing were rapping what Rick Rubin wrote them - The Backstreet Boys for the beer-drinker set. Still a mighty good record, even I personally wish they'da chilled out on the fake 80s drum machines. How can you diss a song with a lyric like \\"Went into White Castle and I got thrown out\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Joke Is...","review":"In response to Rickey Wright's editorial review (this guy's an editor and didn't see this?)...The joke, Mr. Wright, is not them crashing their jet into the side of a mountain and surviving, but rather what the image turns into when you unfold the album cover and hold it length-wise with the tail-end up. It's the image of a 'joint' being mashed out (like a cigarette in an ashtray). So I think the genius behind it works, making the obvious - unobvious.Also, the call letters on the rear of the plane (3MTA3) actually spell 'EAT ME' when viewed in reverse - which is what is usually done when you're smokin' a fatty and 'Jake' is on ya.As for the album itself - CLASSIC!

I've always heard so much about the merits of The Drum, perhaps I was expecting too much from it? The first three or four chapters had me thoroughly absorbed in Oskar's ancestry, and for the rest of the book I kept waiting for someone as interesting and human as his grandmother Anna to show up, but I was to be disappointed. Granted, Oskar's mother Agnes is another consistent and great character, but besides these two... oyvay! Oskar was such an unreal personage that I found him impossible to trust as a narrator... with every beat of his drum he startled the already frightened theme of this book into a corner. I never found that corner. If you enjoy authors who tend to dive in and out of the \\"fantastic\\" and the \\"real\\" I would recommend you go to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Hermann Hesse, or Charles Williams, but for goodness sakes... \\"keep off the Grass.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"This is the absolute worst version one could possibly purchase.

I am a scholar of German literature and I've always found Grass just about unreadable, except for the novelle CAT AND MOUSE (Katz und Maus). The work has always struck me as somehow fascinated by the very fascism it wants to decry, and this novel is but another example of Grass' strange and -- as we know now -- unexpressed guilt-ridden post-ww2 narration. Sorry, folks, but you're better off with the equally insane writer Peter Handke, himself a problematic political figure, but he writes with integrity and unflinching honesty, and frankly, he's a better writer, as is the underrated (in this country at least) Heinrich Boll."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazing","review":"this book really did change my adolescence - it made me see that choosing to not grow up was a metaphysical choice and a viable on at that - oskar pays the price but i won't - we learn from his mistakes (ps see \\"Cat and Mouse\\" by the same author to find out more.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"self destructive, no?","review":"The tin drum is an equitius of time and place.

If I ever read something better, maybe I'll come back and change what I said, but I don't think it's going to happen.I won't give a synopsis of the story. Read the other reviews for that. I'm saying this book is simply monumental. Ingest it if you can, because it's not a Sunday afternoon read. As you go, you'll find it makes you think.Think about the scope of tragedy that was Western civilization in the first half of the 20th century. Think about... well, you should read it, and think for yourself.

Superstition, supernatural event constanly leek into the real world (thus this book is often called a magical realism piece). It's interesting to compare this work to those by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

However, it's worthwhile, so don't be faint of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metaphorically challenged...","review":"I just finished this novel this evening and have to admit it was one of the more painful experiences that I have had in the last little while. The metaphor of a stunted Oskar (a metaphor for Weimar and Nazi Germany) who is the perpetual three year old grew tiresome rather quickly. Grass never normalizes his character in the face of the absurdity of the Nazi regime. He is absurd even in this totally absurd world. If he had been more normalized it would have been much more interesting, because it would show that in Nazi Germany even the deformity of the eternal three year old does not stand out, because it is all theatre. What was interesting about the novel was the loss of identity that Oskar felt (much like Germany itself in the Adenauer aftermath of the 1950's)when he gave up his drum. Why Grass was given the Nobel Prize is beyond my ken."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Title","review":"This is a great movie.

The killer is revealed, as a bates-ish type killer, and the film really picks up. A somewhat surprising end is in store for those who manage to make it clear through the film. A Twilight Zone-ish tag is added to the end as well.The main problem this film faces is it's utter cheapness; in writing and budget.I suppose I should mention Kevin Bacon is in this, but by no means makes the film any more watchable.This film barely deserves the 2 star rating I have bestowed upon it (it's more like a 1 1/2 star film), but later entries are worse, so I had to give it more than just 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good flick when you're bored.","review":"Friday The 13th. . .

But now a days, it's a boring flick, with poor murder scenes, and unrealistic blood/injuries.Basically, Camp 'Blood' is re-opening, and so on Friday the 13th, the counselors get murdered one by one. It's a predicatable plot, up to who the murderor is.The only thing it really has going for it is the basic interest of who gets murdered when. Don't get me wrong. If I was reviewing this movie when it first came out, it might have received 5 stars. But compared with the films of today, it's a low-throttled slasher film, only worth watching when you're bored.

Cheesy by today's standards, it still holds its place as a trend-setter in the slasher film craze which seemed to bloom in the 1980's. Manfredini's wonderful music score nearly steals the show in my opinion, but Savini's grisly effects, good editing, and convincing acting by Betsey Palmer all add up to a campfire tale of terror which has somehow reached legendary status. Without specifically giving away any spoilers to the uninitiated, I still feel that it is misleading and inappropriate, (though understandable in marketing terms), to associate the Jason hockey mask image with the first film.

Jason, and Thirteen Ghosts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated since long...","review":"...and I can't believe people still find this old horror \\"classic\\" scary. Rent or buy \\"The Excorsist\\" instead, a true classic. You can predict every move the killer makes, and speaking of \\"The killer\\"; some of the sequels are better than the face revealed to us here. Forget about Jason. If you haven't seen it I will not spoil it, but this was stealing a good plot from \\"Psycho\\"... and totally wasting it! The picture quality is horrible, the sound just as bad. It's like watching a home movie. And I guess there is reason why the movie company had no urge to clean the tapes or enhance the sound here. It certainly would not have paid off I persume.

They're perfect for teenagers, all the sex and blood. I will always consider these fun to watch. I have a soft spot for exploitation. That's not to say though that this is a good movie. It starts off pretty good, setting up Camp Blood and everything, but Cunningham doesn't have much directorial flair. This one's pretty dead. Basically no character development. Even things of marginal interest, like Alice and Steve's relationship, are only suggested and then dropped. One thing I noticed watching it this time around was that they really fouled up on the heroine. She's really bland, and they would've done better making one of the other girls the heroine.Now the film is iconic, has some memorable images, a great location, and is atmospheric. It's too bad there wasn't more intelligence behind it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"What can you say? This is a classic in the horror genre.

Overall it's a great stalk/slash movie which has basically no plot, but very original deaths. Keep in mind that stalk/slash movies are to be watched for the blood, gore, and T&A, not the plot. Some parts in this movie are very scary, escpecially the end. Too bad no one makes this type of movie anymore. This movie, however, does contain some bad acting as do many other 80's horror movies, which pushes it back to B-Movie Cinema.Positives - Very Bloody and Orginal deaths, Good scares, Overall great stalk/slash movie.Negatives - Bad acting"},{"rating":"2","title":"Friday the 13th: THE BEST HORROR MOVIE EVER!!!!","review":"Even though Jason isn't in this one, It's very scary!!!

This one was really Mrs. Voorhees and Jason wasn't really even in it. I wished she was in the next few to help Jason out. The whole story about Jason is that one day he went swimming but since the counselers were making out and he couldn't swim he drowned and Mrs. Voorhees really never got over that. She took it out by killing future counselors at Camp Crystal Lake. What I didn't like about this one was you didn't really see her until the end. People obvisously got bored of this and decided to give Jason his hockey mask. There's a lot more nudity in these movies than in any other horror movie i've seen.

So now everyone who goes to Camp Crystal Lake is gonna get it, one way or another.I hold this movie close to my heart because I was an 80's teen, and VHS just let us watch all the movies our parents wouldn't let us watch in the theater.This and Halloween are like the Holy Grail of 80's teen slasher movie's (although technically they were released in the 70's).The VHS just gave them a whole new life in family rooms all over the world.So get some popcorn (preferably Jiffy Pop, the stove top type not that microwave junk), some soda and a group of friends.

It features a group of young teenagers that head to an abandoned Camp to set up and get ready to run Camp Krystal Lake for the first time in several years. One by one, they're stalked by an unknown, violent killer.This film has just what you're looking for as it carries suspense, dumb laughs and blodd spillage.It is one of the better slasher flicks and is highlighted by the scene where one of the young women is searching in a bathroom for someone (i won't give it away), and it's absolutely terrifying, shocking ending when you think it's all over.Overall, if you're a horror fan addict, this is a must see.

You dont really get to see alot of gore in this movie, everyone just mysteriously vanishes and then turns up dead in a \\"ghost train\\" type manner, the type of ghost train that's in the lamest amusement park one could imagine. By ghost train I mean, dead bodies just pop out from nowhere in the most random of fashions. *Spoiler to follow* One problem I had is that the Mother was incapable of taking down a small fumbling blonde girl towards the end but had no problem killing the larger males of the group.

And Manfredini's score really sounds crisp and just as jolting as ever.Fans looking for any superfluous deleted scenes will not find that here, the \\"uncut\\" reference merely refers to 10 seconds of footage excised by the MPAA that was determined too gory for an 80's viewing audience. Restored here, many viewers probably can't discern the difference.

(You reckon there was even a script written or a screenwriter named Victor Miller?) Makeup artist Tom Savini's realistic gore effects are the only ticket.

Lots of gore and a high body count, but not an ounce of suspense or tension. It also spawned countless sequels that aren't much better than this mess. This DVD gets an extra star for its camp value and because it evokes memories of those glorious 1980s.

Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elmstreet are the only classics worth owning on dvd.It would have got a 5 star, but with the dvd not being unrated with no bonus material, it looses a star.

I had a difficult time sitting through the whole thing, and it was rather sleep inducing. I wanted to see at least one of the Friday the 13th films, so I watched this one. Many of the murders were ripped off from Mario Bava's superior Twitch of the Death Nerve (aka Bay of Blood), so the film wasn't even that original. As we know, there were roughly around 1000 sequels, 500 TV shows, Jason dolls, Jason's official murder tools, Jason's hockey mask, etc., etc..

But what really drains it dry is the lack of true suspense (what \\"Halloween\\" and \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street\\" were rich of), annoying theme music that seems like a steal between \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Halloween,\\" and the most obvious of them all is the lack of logical plot. Basically, it's unwatchable, unless you have the hots for a young, 20ish Kevin Bacon, who dons a Speedo and his bare bottom.

Still, special make-up effects wizard Savinin does show some style and colour in the mutilations (especially Kevin Bacon's arrow-through-the-throat gag).The Paramount DVD edition of this movie is a disappointment to fans as far as extras go (theatrical trailer - bore), but a nice and neat 16:9 enhanced widescreen presentation and a clear and loud Dolby Mono track does make it satisfactory to the average horror buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC","review":"Anyone who calls this a ripoff of Halloween is a idiot, where are the similarities? People get killed...thats about it. The killer is unseen, Micheal was always seen. The Setting is a camp, Halloween is a small Illinois town, and finally Halloween had no blood...Friday has plenty. This movie is not great art, but it it a fun ride of gore and chills. The first time i saw this film i was 5 and it scared me then and it scares me now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific, clever, scary!","review":"Sean S.

People Grew Up on this and Freddy and Halloween, Jason and Michael Are the Kings of slasher movies that spawned many imitators,Part 1 and 2 being the best of Camp Crystal Lake and actually the cabin in this one,Although Jason still has not got his \\"groove\\" on so to speak,no Mask and well no.... but the Movie is at the top not just for being part one of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT REALLY THAT GOOD, BUT IT DOES OPEN THE DOOR FOR JASON!","review":"I am writing reviews for each of the Friday the 13th, but I own the box set and the older releases of the later two. The reviews are for those editions not the newer deluxe editions.The first installment of the series is pretty mediocre, but it does open the door for one of the 80's best loved horror icons - Jason Voorhees.The series is known for creative death sequences and not much of anything else. The first film features Kevin Bacon in an early role and like most visitors of Camp Crystal Lake doesn't last too long! Overall it's a fun Halloween flick with a memorable ending. I rate it 3 1/2 stars.The DVD transfer looks pretty good and the box set has some cool extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"agree with Deano and soundtrack question for anyone","review":"Hey I agree, not a whole lot of new stuff on this re-release. I did notice some non scary footage in the beginning when the killer is in the cabin looking in on the sleeping kids, more kids sleeping shots. wowee.the only thing I noticed that was a few seconds longer was Kevin B's death. didn't really notice much on anyone else. some other reviewer said that Marcy's axe in the face was longer. I didn't see the dif. Also my widescreen was Full Screen!! Does anyone know what the Vinyl Soundtrack that came out long time ago with the 3-D cover which includes music from parts one two and three worth? Can't find any info on it.So to sum up the new release, part one is okay, the extras kinda are lame and can anyone tell me what that nonsense forgotten tales segment was all about? looks like it was shot on video and doesn't belong. WT?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dreadfully insulting ripoff of Carpenter's Halloween.","review":"Friday the 13th is an awful movie because the few elements in the movie that arouse suspense and fear were simply ripped off of one of the greatest slasher's ever, Halloween. The movie is also an abomination because it inspired a whole genre of trash even worse than itself. If you want a good horror movie, see Psycho or Halloween or The Shining or Night of the Living Dead, but at all costs avoid this disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, sounds good but it really stinks!","review":"People are still wanting to see this dreadful chiller usually because of it's title but they do not know that it is a completely dull and boring film. I was one of those people but now I've suddenly reallised how bad it is. A bunch of teenagers with sex on their minds go camping at a place where two people got mudered in 1958 and the son of the murderer returns to chop 'em all up to bits. You can see a young Kevin Bacon and Betsy Palmer's head getting chopped off (in a grusomely memorable way) but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off - Paramount rips us off again","review":"Oh my god does paramount suck. They obviously hate this series and the fans of it. Pushed in doesn't equal blu ray quality, Amazon should cut all of the Paramount sock puppet ratings. I bought this on pre order and couldn't be more annoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Get Scared By The Critics","review":"I recently purchased this boxed set from a store that sells used DVDs. Although my collection was used and packaged in the 'horrible' cardboard packaging, my discs are fine and play just fine. Shopping frequently at a used DVD store has taught me the valuable lesson that a scratched DVD will still play. Also, despite buying it in used condition, the scratches were pretty minimal. If you buy this collection new, then I'm sure your scratches will be hardly noticeable: certainly, they will be no worse than the average day to day scratches that you put on your other DVDs. As long as you are a person who cares about your movies, and you give just a little TLC when you slide the discs in and out of the box, then this is a great buy and I would not wait to experience this awesome collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friday the 13th","review":"Terror and suspense abound in this 24-hour nightmare of blood. Camp Crystal Lake has been shuttered for over 20 years due to several vicious and unsolved murders. The camp's new owner and several young counselors are readying the property for re-opening despite warnings of a death curse by local residents. The curse proves true on Friday the 13th as one by one each of the counselors is stalked by a violent killer. This film is widely acclaimed for its horrifying and creative murder sequences.It is presented in a widescreen format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped it would be!","review":"This was actually pretty disappointing. While I felt, it had the potential to be so much more suspenseful than \\"Halloween\\", it just wasn't. I don't know what went wrong. The setting was a lot more frightening than \\"Halloween\\". Also, they could have spent more time developing the characters, even though they weren't very likable to begin with. This is especially true of Alice (Adrienne King). She was too whiney and not pretty enough to be a heroine. Kevin Bacon was probably the best out of all of them, so it's no surprise he's the only one still heard of. The ending, while exciting, still was a disappointment. I also felt that the violence did not add much to this movie. All in all, I'd give \\"Friday the 13th\\" 2/5. I'd actually recommend \\"Friday the 13th: Part 2\\" over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!!!!","review":"Jason Voorhees mom was doing all the killing?Awful!!I could see why she killed the initial camp counselors.Because they were the ones who let Jason drown.But to go back like 20 years later and kill a bunch of new counselors for no reason is stupid. The sequels are just as bad. Put a pole in the DEAD Jason, and have lightening strike, and all of a sudden he's alive again. Dreadful!!!The Halloween movies are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to Crystal Lake!","review":"The Crystal Lake Camp is about to be re-opened years after a double murder took place at the camp site. The local residents believe the camp ground is haunted and possessed by a lethal curse, and they therefore avoid it at all costs. Despite the local folklore, some young camp leaders decide to take a job there and help get the camp ready for the opening that is scheduled within two weeks. This is a dire decision, since the local legend has some validity and the curse is about to take its course. The audience is left with a rather gory and scary film, which creates a feeling of paranoia along with the feeling of being watched."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!","review":"THIS MOVIE IS ONE THE WORST SLASHER FILMS OF ALL TIME!!!First of all jason isn't in it.

There was nothing horrible or shocking about it, just hours of boring.... boring. What was Wes Craven thinking, getting involved in with this movie? Thats probably what killed his career, and why none of his other movies have done well. This movie just sucked. The next three, however, were masterpieces, that kept me on the edge of my seet the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can tell you a secret I see serial killers","review":"I have only seen this once since I got it. It was super disturbing super gory and super intense. I did not fell safe in my bed at night for a year after I watched this back in mid 2006 or late 2005 I can't remember which it was. This was the first movie made in a ten part horror series. Of which the firs eight were big hits. But several people were dispointed with parts nine and the futerstic part ten. I was suprised at how gory this was for and 1980s movie. Do to super heavy gory, violence, distrubing images, and language I do not recommend this too any under 17 even if they are surprivised. Terror reigns at camp crystal lakes as the counseler are hunted down and slaughter on after another.

I didn't think it was scary as everybody says. I didn't think it was graphic like everybody said it was. My favorite death was Kevin Bacon's death. Which was fun and great to watch. Sean Cunningham did do a great job with making this movie.

The image of that girl in the opening scenes with her throat slit open by the tree stuck with me for ages.Years later, the only thing this film has lost is the initial shock value of not knowing what is around the next corner. It's still wicked fun! Its idea was fresh and heart pounding (too bad so many lousy sequels followed it) and it's still good for an amusing night with friends when you're in the moody for a silly scare!It was also cool to see a young Kevin Bacon. He sure has come a long way since becoming a human blood fountain in that scene!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK MOVIE,TERRIBLE DVD","review":"First off this DVD stinks,no extras just a lousy trailer,and bad sound,picture quality goes from good to downright awful at times.Now for the movie itself.Although this came out in 1980 by no means is this a ripoff at all. It is about a boy(Jason Voorhees)that drowned due to irresponible camp councilers. His mother Pamela Voorhees(played by Betsy Palmer)committed a series of murders the following 2 years after the drowning. Then 20 years later the camp is reopening,and the new people to Camp Crystal Lake are in for sheer terror. Awesome Death scene,especially killing Kevin Bacon off."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd best in the series","review":"this is the 2nd best friday the 13th in the series.The only problem with this movie is that most of the killings are of screen.But this movie still deserves 5 stars.Dont listen to the bad reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"The start of an epic series.","review":"Should this movie get 5 stars? Hell yes! It started the Friday the 13th series. It's not the best in the series of nine (next year it will be the series of ten), but it is still a pretty awesome movie.

NOTE: Make sure to see Jason X next April"},{"rating":"2","title":"Friday the 13th Part 1","review":"If you are a true horror fan and want to have a full collection I suggest you get this 80's thriller Friday the 13th. It was the beginning of a nice summer when all hell broke loose at Camp Crystal Lake. Mrs. Voorhees is perfectly played. This was the movie that spraked a nation and also sparked a series and tv series. You have to have Friday the 13th, if you are a true completist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Halloween","review":"I liked this movie better than halloween but dont't get me wrong halloween was an awesome (a must buy). But friday the 13th had more gore, blood, and violence halloween didnt have blood or gore. And its the beginning of Jason. It's about jason's mom going around killing people cus she presumes her son drowned in the water and the camp counselors never cared. But jason got out of thw water and since he is a mongoloid he never knew what to do. Jason then returns as the villain is part which was pretty good to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm....it's better than a kick in the face","review":"Despite spawning too many sequels I care to count, this first of the series was the best, which doesn't say much.. The only thing saving this movie is Palmer's performance as Jason's mother, a lot more effective than the rest of the cast. Too bad we only see her for about 15 minutes. I recommend just fast forwarding to the last 15 minutes and you will see the whole so-called plot spouted by Palmer. Because up to that point, it is just a dragged on boring film (more boring than the Republican National Convention)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, Funny - A definite Classic!","review":"\\"In 1957, a young boy drowns at Camp Crystal Lake, the next year, two counselors are murdered by an unseen person, and the story flashes forward to Friday June 13th, 'Present Day' which has Camp Crystal Lake opening again.

Very little to assist the relationship between the couple. Everything went back to the personal relationship with God.

Dr. Crabb states that a man's greatest need is significance and a woman's greatest need is security. My understanding of the Bible is that the single greatest need for both men and women is salvation and sanctification. Not only is the assessment of man's need wrong, he says that this must be dealt with BEFORE Biblical principles can be applied. A better approach would be to apply biblical principles to the lives of men and women and allow the Holy Spirit to work in them so that they will find their security and significance in Christ alone.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Marriage Book","review":"It was a little slow in getting here, but it is very well written.

The book offers a very solid, easy to grasp blueprint for biblical marriage. I would certainly recommend it. The insights are profound and convicting, and the concepts presented are backed by Scripture. The book can be used in the context of marital and pre-marital counseling and is organized in a way that allows the use of one chapter per session. The book gives a few ideas of practice, discussion and intervention but additional such material is necessary. It is up to the counselor to come up with questions so if you plan to use the book as a counselor, do your homework.Read more at:[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the world's view","review":"This book includes wonderful Biblical exhortation for viewing your spouse as your primary ministry and serves to eliminate excuses for doing otherwise. The concepts fly in the face of views like \\"I deserve...\\" or \\"I'll do this as long as s/he does that...\\" The first half of the book is what to do and the second half focuses more on the how to - foundational principles that must first be established in order to be able to do what is called for in the first half.

This time however, we will be including several other couples because it is too good to not share it. This is truly a manual for a biblical marriage, whether newly-married, or married for a lifetime. Dr. Crabb describes our self-centerdness so accurately, and gives such realistic examples of the pitfalls we find ourselves trapped in. Fortunately he also gives examples of how to avoid common mistakes. His description of marriage as our chance to minister exclusively to our spouses and provide tangible evidence of God's love to each other is accurate and helpful. On many occassions I wondered if he had written this book especially to me. We have been blessed by this book and find it difficult not to recommed it repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes it is the Biblical view","review":"The \\"Reader\\" from Southern California who wrote the \\"not a Biblical view\\" needs to learn how to read! When the author talks about security and significance, he makes it quite clear that he is discussing emotional needs. He also shows how we receive that security and significance IN and FROM our salvation in Christ. He also says that you must deal with people's urgent perceived needs before they can hear a larger message - this is straight out of the book of James - if you try to preach the gospel to a starving man, how could or why would he listen to you?

They definitely provid compression and heat which helps significantly. I use one pair for equestrian sports and my hands no longer freeze up on me after prolonged, strenuous use. The gloves are holding up perfectly even for riding. I use another pair for sleeping when the symptoms are the worst and wake up with much more flexibility and less pain in my hands. After getting these results I purchased a pair for each of my parents who are in their eighties and have significant arthritis.

In spite of abiding by the measuring guidelines, they did not fit me well (although I have large hands, the guide said I did not need an extra large). I considered going to a larger size but felt they would simply no do what I needed them to.Two very irritating features:1. The gloves simply don't breathe - consequently I had to peel them off about once an hour. Because they don't breathe they also don't dry very quickly2. The fingers extend literally to the base of your fingertips - essentially leaving just the ball of your fingers exposed.From other reviews, these gloves have helped some; however, they are just not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like these gloves!","review":"I purchased these gloves to help reduce swelling in my hands.

These gloves keep the heat in for my finger and hand joints. I did buy them one size up because I like to machine wash and dry. I am finally buying a new pair because the velcro sometimes sticks to this one spot below the thumb joint and roughs it up (if I don't stick it correctly or the washer is rough- i do wash them in a lingerie bag).

The hand specialist who was fascinated to learn about the gloves. He'd never seen anything like them before.She's been wearing them almost daily for almost three years and one seam is beginning to split, so I'm ordering another pair.

The album consists of the kind of traditional popular songs that a Frank Sinatra or a Peggy Lee would sing. Good songs, but the arrangements aren't that interesting. But the real problem with the album is Nichelle herself. Sure, she has a very impressive vocal range, but so what? On most of these songs, she will throw in high notes just to show that she can hit them, much to the detriment of the songs. I guess you could say she was ahead of her time in that respect, what with all the \\"show offy\\" singers today. This is not a good album at all, sad to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a weak album.","review":"I bought this CD because of WANNA BE A BALLER.

I couldn't even listen to most of the songs. After 20 seconds or so, I'd just skip to the next one, hoping for something that would rescue the album. Nothing did.

Instead I found a generic, the-one-who-got-away type read. I didn't particularly like or care about the main character, so it was difficult to get into the book.

I have all of his books this one did nothing for me.I LOVED FLYY GIRL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow to get into.","review":"This was the first book that I read by Omar Tyree. The story seemed to drag on and was difficulty to get into and stay focus. It took me about three months to finish it, but I was determined to do it. The story line was too slow, and some it seemed far fetched. Especially, when Bobby's income hit the hundred thousand dollar range as a talk show host. I was glad that he got back together with Faye, but her being pregnant was unnecessary. They should have just gotten married."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will this book ever end.","review":"I'm usually not a critic to many authors, but this is the first book I read and it took about a month to read and that's only because I'm in a book club. It was nice to hear a man's point of view and see that he came to some positive conclusions on how he should take chances with women, but all that it took to get him there. I'm glad he doesn't speak for all men because I would never find a mate. It just makes me wonder if Mr. Tyree is speaking from experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs down!!","review":"I did not like this book at all!!! I only finished it b/c I paid money for it and didn't want to waste my money. Bobby was the biggest cry baby that I have ever seen (or not seen since I read about him). All he did was make excuses and blame everyone else for his lack of a spine. It is possible to be a MAN w/o being the whimp that Bobby was and w/o being a dog. I was very disappointed in this book, especially b/c I loved Mr. Tyree's debut novel _Flyy Girl_. I gave the book 2 stars b/c it was well written, but I hated the story and the main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"a major disappointment","review":"All the right elements were there: the NY, Washington DC/ Howard Univ. settings, an interesting career, NBA players, and more. Unfortunately, Tyree didnt seem to know what to do with them. The result was a flat, boring and one dimensional story with a weak, naive and frankly, stupid main character. I hated Flyy Girl and thought that this book might change my perceptions of the author and his work. Unfortunately, it only served to confirm what I already thought. I don't think I'll be reading any more of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"This book was the biggest disappointment. I read Flyy Girl and I thought that is was really a great read. When I purchased A Do Right Man little did I know I was wasting my time and money. The characters were unimaginative and boring.

And what do you know i stumbled on \\"A do right Man\\" on sale for ....at a local book store. To start with i was already looking for the book and second of all i was thrilled with the price. But when i started reading it i was quickly turned off. It was so boring from the beginning and i didn't even finish it because i just couldn't keep reading it. And maybe it was above my level i'm 16 and i've read \\"Chocolate Star\\", \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\" and so i'm not sure if age is an issue here i just think it was a boring book. I know not one of his best works."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was all the hype about?","review":"The introduction was okay, but totally misleading raising my expectation of the story a little too high. By the second chapter I was sorely tempted to put the book to one side. It wasn't that it didn't have a good storyline, it did, it was just how it was written, too much detail on areas of no relevance i.e. type of drink, and after a while it seemed like the author had digressed and kept struggling to get back to the plot. It started getting better towards the end of the story, but for me that was too little too late. Omar Tyrees' other novel 'Flyy Girl' was recommended to me, as I couldn't get hold of it in time I picked this one, I'm still going to give it a second try and get my original choice and see how that goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, how Black Men really think","review":"The character of Bobby was definitely one of the more recognizable characters I've seen in a book. He is intelligent, yet lacks confidence and the drive to really get what he wants.Not only in his relationships, but also in his career, he takes a back seat and just watches what happens. It's when he finally takes control and defines his goals, things start to happen.Bobby Dallas is truly a portrait of a \\"good black man.\\" Someone who agonizes over his mistakes, and ultimately doesn't like to rock the boat.I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a decent read. If you are looking for a typical sistahgurlplot, you will be a little disappointed. This mostly a study in character."},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic portryal of a young brother in the dating game","review":"The book was great. I read the entire book in one rainy weekend. I resent the comparisons to Flyy Girl. While it was a great book also, these are two entirely different stories. Frankly, I appreciate a writer who diversifies his lead characters and themes. Also, the book gave a really good realistic view of the ups and downs one encounters in the communications field and the inner workings of that field. I appreciate a book I can learn something from as this. It takes a caring,sensitive man to tune into the feelings of the lead character. I can hardly wait for Mr. Tyree's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The character development was not what it could have been.","review":"This is the second item of Tyree's that I have read. Though the story and character development was not to my liking, the story was much better than Fly Girl. The author has come a long way, but needs to work a little harder."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Do Right Man pays homage to black relationships","review":"This book captures the witty, poignant nuances to romancing in the 90's. The characters implore the reader to understand their points of view whether you agree with them or not.

I didn't get it. What was so do right about Bobby Dallas? He was the typical black man IMO. He ended up with a great job and salary and only THEN did he decide that HE was ready to settle down and Faye was supposed to be with it. NOT!He played a couple of different women, was dishonest, and less than \\"right\\".I only finished the book because I spent my hard owned money on it. This book was ENTIRELY too slow. It's like, please get to the point Omar Tyree. After this, I believe I am finished supporting him and his less than stellar novels. I only wish that I hadn't spent money on a black man writing about how hard it is for another black man out there in the dating and professional world when I can get that same sob story at any local hangout.

In college Bobby and his best friend Faye had a liking for one another okay why they didn't get it on? At the end of the book they finally get together! The details about working in the radio industry was really interesting and I guess Omar was trying to get across how hard it is to be a \\"black male\\" but it failed in my opinion!

I found the story extremely slow, and the main character, Bobby Dallas, rather boring. The book needed an editor to \\"punch up\\" the story line, ie add some conflict, tension, scandal, etc. to engross the reader. As is, it was a challange to finish the novel, simply because I didn't care what happened next.I also found it hard to believe that this was the authors' fourth novel.

Bobby Dallas is truly A Do Right Man!!","review":"The amazing thing about this book is that I felt thay I truly understood Bobby Dallas. His trials and tribulations (although certainly not his naivete) are a good view of the other side of relationships. I laughed, cried, and even fumed when he didn't seem to be able to see Pearl and Faye for the women they were.I agree with the reviewer who was thrown off balance by Faye's pregnancy--it sort of gave a rushed, and-they-lived-happily-ever-after ending to what was otherwise an engaging, funny, and timely story. I especially loved the fact that despite what he went through professionally and personally, Bobby never lost that modest quality that grabbed me from the first page and kept me enthralled to the last word. Good job, Omar Tyree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"The \\"Do Right Man\\" by Omar Tyree was good, but move rather slow. However, I did enjoy the book thoroughly, because it dealt with some reality that other books do not address. The reality I am speaking of in which I can relate to is the main character Bobby Dallas whom is struggling with the development of his career and finances. So many authors create this perfect utopia where nobody has problems with money or their career, and their biggest problem is finding that perfect \\"soulmate\\".I was interested in how Pearl Davis would finally get what was coming to her for dumping Bobby the way she did and not really giving him a second thought. However, the author did not go into that which I wanted to know more than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the ....!?","review":"I am usually a fast reader (a book a day)when not working.

Not a good effort at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After hearing so much about Mr. Tyree, I was anxious to start on the novel as soon as I got home from the bookstore. Unfortunately, about 3 chapters into the book, I was already disappointed in what I was reading. The author has no real lyrical style and his dialouge was mundane. Since the majority of the book was dialouge, it was extremely slow reading for me. All in all, a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow","review":"I read this book a while back and decided that I finally had the time to write about it now. This was one of the slowest moving books i have ever read. T he plot was decent but te author spent a good 10 pages elaborating on every detail of Bobby's life and his rise to fame. After a while it just became unbearable and I had to stop. If you have a hig patience novel and like reading roundabout novels then this one is made jst for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DO RIGHT DON'T!","review":"This was a hot mess, it was so boring I couldn't even finish the book, I passed it on to my cusion, and she said the same thing, I just gave the book away. My hopes were all high from Flyy Gryl, but thats the only good book that Omar written. I was so upset by this that I actually wanted to write Omar Tyree myself and ask him what the hell was going on. I mean when you write a bad book chances are that no one is going to want to read the next book. I hate reading a bad book because I feel it is just a waist of my time, and I could've done somthing better. Omar, you owe my 4 hours of a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This One Let Me Down","review":"This story was about a young brother trying to make it in life.I have to admit that I was excited to read this book, and it let me down. I didn't like how Bobby let Pearl walk all over him. I don't think Bobby Dallas was portrayed as a \\"Do Right Man\\" at all, but rather a wimp. During the first half of the book, I waited for him to get a back bone, which he never did. From there on the whole story was slow. I was bored about continually reading about him and his radio job. This was a slow read for me, I skipped a few chapters just so I could find out what finally happened in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omar Tyree, you know you can do better!!!","review":"I read this book a while ago and felt that it could not compare to his first book.

He seemed to be a real wimp. My bookclub read this book and none of us liked it. Furthermore, Faye was a very strong, independent character. Why did he have her character get pregnant before they were married? Was she trying to trap him or was she just plain stupid when it came to birth control?

Better luck next time Omar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omar Tyree, you know you can do better!!","review":"I read this book a while ago and thought it was nothing compared to his first book, Flyy Girl.

If the author thought Bobby was a 'Do Right Man' he needs to go back and talk to some 'real men'. I felt his character was a chump and didn't deserve Faye. When she turned from a smart, intelligent woman to an idiot by getting pregnant, he compromised her character. Since his main character was such a dismal failure the two of them deserved each other. Next time I'll wait on the paperback if or when it gets to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed in this book!!","review":"My Book Club just finished discussing this book and overall we were disappointed. This book is really pegged as a book dealing with relationships from a male point of view but it really dealt more with Bobby's Radio career than anything else. We initially liked Faye's character because she was very strong, independent and career oriented but at the end when she was suddenly pregnant, that didn't sit very well with us. She certainly didn't need to trap Bobby at that point and it didn't make sense that she would intentionally get pregnant before they got married. It seemed as if the ending was just thrown together with very little thought.

After another few months, the outer wire windings begin to uncoil, leaving the violin with that nasty, vibrating sound that resembles metals flakes being shaken.The uncoiling typically begins in the first-position, where the hand's third finger produces the tone of G (one octave above the lowest open string). The uncoiling this spreads to the lower notes and soon corrupts the sound of all notes on the D-string.Do not buy this product. You will regret doing so, if you do buy it. Find a better D-string first. I speak from experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Don't expect a large amount formulas for analysis in this book, only 3 pages worth.

In spite of a solid set of back-up musicians creating some inventive variations on a theme, I thought the theme itself was monotonous. Maybe it's the influence of featured artist, Boris Grebenshikov, a grim Russian if there ever was one. I believe that the term Bardo refers to a Tibetan Buddhist version of the Christian Limbo or Purgatory. Certainly not the mystical, mythical place I would want to visit. And the music perfectly captures that droning, drowning in goo interdimensional place. I don't generally like everything Gabrielle Roth has produced, but some of her work is among the best out there.

Indeed almost every soundtrack to an old Western movie is a re-write of \\"Rodeo\\" or \\"Billy the Kid\\" Suite.Copland's \\"Appalacian Spring\\" is an American \\"Pastorale\\", painting the deep green hills of America's heartland. But the real gems here are the \\"Old American Songs\\" which Copland arranges in a way that maintain the integrity and simplicity of each miniature while making them undoubtedly \\"Coplanesque\\". The delicate handling of these tunes by the expressive bass-baritone William Warfield makes for perfection, especially on the hymns \\"Simple Gifts\\" and \\"At the River\\".Comparisons for instrumental pieces: Bernstein/NYPO (also outstanding)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Copland by Copland","review":"I agree with one other reviewer who declared that the set of Old American Songs is the real star of this album. It truly is; indeed, I think it's the best set of versions available. Baritone William Warfield's voice is authoritative, and the performances are near perfect. The rest of the disc is certainly not bad, either, and with Copland conducting his own works you'd have to think these renditions have the stamp of authority as well. Of course, they also have intense competition with the classic Sony recordings conducted by Bernstein, as well as the more recent ones by Michael Tilson Thomas. Still, if you want a copy of the Old American Songs, this is the one to get, which nets you a fine Appalachian Spring as well as the Dance Episodes from Rodeo. Also included is the Fanfare for the Common Man, both the freestanding version and as a portion of the Third Symphony, as well as an excerpt from Billy the Kid. All in all, an intensely satisfying release, and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copland conducts Copland","review":"Item was recommended by a radio announcer. I think is okay.

Even if they were Roman Catholics.Book is full of historical errors (Warsaw was captured within hours, it was safer to be a Pole in the streets a Lvov during the German invasion)It bothered me that the street names were Misspelled (Owacowa instead of Owocowa, Mariacki Platz insead of Plac Mariacki)The story itself was very interesting.

Highly recommend Ms Fremont's book to all readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunately not long enough","review":"True, for the first 75 pages I could not put it down. Then the memoir ended and the fiction began. I struggled on for another 100 pages at which point I decided that Ms. Fremont was masquerading under false pretenses and gave up. A lively imagination does not a memoir make. It needed to be reclassified as fiction. I have rarely read a book that initially engaged me so thoroughly and then disapointed so totally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story of survival","review":"This book would make a great movie. The story of the author's parents during the war is truly a tale worth telling. They've overcome tremendous odds but did not survive unscathed. It made me realize that although people physically survive wars, they are scarred for life. They live with the price of their survival everyday. Theirs is an amazing story, very poignant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book has inspired me to go looking for my herritage, it is amazing how the Holocoust survivors can stand to hide what they have been through, and hide it from their children?

It is incredibly good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"(facepalm)","review":"Why is this book labeled a \\"memoir\\" when it is so clearly and explicitly fiction?

As she explores the secrets within her family, explores her parents' experience as Jews in Poland during WWII, and unfolds their history--her history--she also explores and discovers herself and the secrets she's held onto.After Long Silence is page-turning exploration of the tangled dynamics of one family, but it's also a book about strength of spirit and survival. Helen Fremont pens a story that will stay with you long after you've finished the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad commentary","review":"I found it sad and cruel that this woman could not appreciate the horror her family lived through. It was very self serving of her to use their experience in such a way as to satisfy her own identity search/emotional work and publish during their lifetimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Inspiring Book","review":"As a daughter of a survivor myself, I admired the skillful way Fremont knits together the bits and pieces of stories she gets from her parents about the war, and uses her imagination to fill in the rest. I can very much relate to her feelings of never being able to live up to her parents' seemingly impossible survival stories, and wondering if the parents she knows are really the same people who fought to survive war-torn Poland. As a child of a survivor, I can relate to a lot of this story, and as a writer, I admire the tightness of the writing, despite the vignette style it is written in. Congratulations, Helen Fremont! I hope that my father's story can be told as poignantly, one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lulu of an identity crisis!","review":"After Long Silence is no kitchen-table memoir; Helen Fremont is a skilled student of the writer's craft. How would you like to find out, as an adult, that your heritage was completely different than you had been told as a child? Helen Fremont did what we all yearn to do--to find out the truth. This is a tale of catharsis and of conflict, and will leave the reader drained, but in a good way. The tales of Jews struggling to survive are remarkable, and one learns from them to be willing to reinvent oneself, and to help others. The tone is bittersweet, not cloying. There is romance, and Helen's honesty about herself burnishes the work nicely. My only complaint was the lack of an index with which to follow the European locations in which most of the book takes place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely riveting. I couldn't put it down.","review":"This is a stunning memoir that works on many levels simultaneously and interweaves the past with the present to unforgettable effect. Fremont tells the harrowing story of her own parents' survival, and, along the way, tells her own story as well. She does both with love, humor, and some of the most exquisite writing I've seen. I found it absolutely riveting and simply could not put it down. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Jews and Survivor's Guilt","review":"This is a very interesting memoir of Jewish holocaust survivors who bring up their children as Catholics, hiding from them their Jewish heritage. As the children grow up, they begin to suspect they are Jews and try to piece together the story of their parents' lives.The book is poignant and painful. The stillness and guardedness of the parents' inner world is like the silence of blue in a glacier - and as chilling. It is a great portrait of survivors' guilt and motivation by fear of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the Closet","review":"The story was excellent - it was engaging - I couldn't put it down. Why, oh why, Ms. Fremont did you have to use this medium to come out of the closet? I don't care if you're a homosexual - I'm neither pro-gay or anti-gay.It was the wrong place.

I had looked forwarded to reading it. By now everyone knows her family's story. At the book's end, has the author just switched one family for another? To me, at mid-story, she'd decided to push on and not just solve the mystery of her family, but to betray her family's confidences and wishes. And to what end? She does this over and over again. She betrays her aunt to her cousin, and her parents in print. How her sexual orientation comes into play makes no sense to me. Her mother and aunt are the true stars of the tale -- while she, the author, comes off as a rather selfish, not-very-kind person. I wonder what damage this book caused to her parents, her Italian aunt and that family. They seem so unimportant to her -- as, on the last pages, the author extols the \\"...bagels and table of deserts\\" served at her new family's reunion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing on many levels","review":"This book deals with a woman searching for her roots and finding surprises. While this is an interesting story, which is much more common than many people realize, I felt disappointed by the book. The writing style was weak and the filling in of details from the past was distracting. Furthermore, I was infuriated at the author's need to \\"out\\" her family's Judaism to members who would have rather stayed \\"in the closet\\".

There is simply no reason I can surmise, as to why these guys did'nt blow up sky high - except that there were 2,000 other bands playing this type of music in 1989. However, not every other band released debut records this strong.The songs on this record are as catchy as the clap, and i'm positive after one or two listens, you will most certainly agree with me. I would highly reccommend buying this record, and blasting it really loud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far better....","review":"...in my memory than in actuality. Honestly, for some reason, I think the title track absolutely rocks -- in that crotch-grabbing way in which most good \\"sleaze/glam rock\\" always tends to. Otherwise, this collection of tunes blows overall (yeah, Toast of the Town is cool, but I still prefer Motley's version over the one found here), and I quickly re-discovered why PBF never elevated to the heights of success reached by similar lipstick and hairspray bands: because the songwriting was fairly weak, and simply sucked balls in comparison. PBF does look the part; so put on your leather pants, tease your hair to the sky, and do yourself (and everybody else) a favor and go slap on Vain's 'No Respect' instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me?","review":"I've listened to this cassette several times, and I've been noticing something wrong. It sounds like they are chanting something evil after the album is over, like it's a hidden track with parts of songs mixed in. I'm not sure what to make of it and it is wierding me out. Don't think I can listen again.Other than that problem, the album is just typical stuff. They look like they are trying to be Motley Crue, but sound way lighter. The title track is the best song, there are some other decent work here too, but most of it seems like filler.

He doesn't speak highly of being a recluse in the woods, cut-off from society like going into the wild, instead he favors moments of companionship; in visits from guests, sending and receiving mail. His appreciation for the quiet and grandeur of the country is full of compassion that resonates beyond our modern notions of conservationism, it is about the nearness to God and finding heaven on earth (and hell). This is Miller's testament to living simply and loving it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramblings of an old man","review":"\\"big sur and the oranges of Heronymos bosch\\" is just the ramblings of an old henry Miller trying to remember different things that have happened to him.

It is a collection of views and vignettes of the author's life when he lived in Big Sur. Miller's unique personality and interests come through in his language that makes even ordinary things come more to life. It was interesting to discover what seemed like proto-new age thinking in some of this, written in the 1950's. His evocations of character are great and so is the feel of the environment. I read part of the book during a trip that took me through Big Sur, and it deepened my enjoyment of being there. The Henry Miller Library is worth visiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Is In Everyone's Heart","review":"Just finished reading this book and found it became more and more interesting as the interviews went along. I especially liked Bruce Bond's tea with the Queen & Prince Charles, Jane Calverley & her mother in the UK and Elliot's own, particularly the photo when he was 17...The great thing about the book is you don't have to be a baby boomer or a yankee to appreciate the history, the music or the culture - you can feel the essence of the era. The emotion and feelings people have tucked up in their heads and how a simple prompt gets all those emotions roller coasting back as if it were yesterday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great archive of the Alaska life from an airline employee's perspective.","review":"I was amazed at all the detailed descriptions and photos in this book.

There are no scratches on the cd; however, it does not play properly for almost a minute at the 65th minute mark of the 1st cd (the one that contains the raga khamaj). It's extremely disappointing.

The movie has both the original french language track and a lousy English dub, but no subtitles. So unless your French is very good, you are stuck with the vastly inferior English track. The movie itself is cool kinda a cross between Slap Shot, The Full Monty and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hockey and male cameradie","review":"I am sure Mystery, Alaska was inspired by this movie, that must have had in its turn \\"Slapshot\\" as its template, just to remain in the hockey theme (there is a little bit of the Mighty Duck in it too!). But Les Boys is also a movie on male cameradie, like many beautiful films of the past (watch if you can find it the Italian \\"Amici Miei!).A group of eleven men meet every Monday night to play hockey in a minor French Canadian (Quebec) legue. Once their coach, the pub owner Stan looses $50.000 to the criminal Meo, they team up and give their best to win agains Meo's team to avoid having Stan's legs broken.The fun of this movie lies in the characters private lives, the ladiesman, the salesman, the gay lawyer, the cynical doctor, the cocain addict guitarist, the newly wed and others.

And \\"An Introduction to Astrobiology\\" edited by Iain Gilmour and Mark Sephton. Which one should you buy?This one.This book is a little more up-to-date. It has more about what you ought to want the book for anyway, the extrasolar planets. Still, the books are nearly identical, the more so given that the author of this book wrote two of the extrasolar planet chapters in the other book.If you get the other book, you'll get a chapter on Titan that this book doesn't have. And prettier pictures, and pages with a nicer and glossier feel.Still, if you want a book on astrobiology in general, well, both books skimp a little on the biology part. My choice for an overall astrobiology book would be Lunine's book, rather than either this one or the Gilmour book."},{"rating":"1","title":"movies","review":"Movies were short and lack a proper Thomas plot...would not recommend.We were very disappointed in the quality of the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal, bad packaging","review":"The 3 movies in this pack is a great deal.

The fit and finish of the new set was just like the old blades in that they were a perfect fit. Aligning the blades took a bit of time.

I have tried laser treatments that were partially successful, but the hair is still thick.I was tired of shaving and thought I would give these epilator things a try. I tried the Emjoi AP-9GAR Gently Gold Caress which was not too comfortable and only partially effective. I thought I would try this one just to see if the \\"4-way pulsating pain softener stimulates the skin to offset the pulling sensation\\" actually works.It does. This is a great device for removing hair. It is not pain free, but, it does not hurt nearly as much as the Emjoi.So 5 stars because it makes the most of an otherwise painful situation"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Old Epilady","review":"I am very pleased with the product. I have an older Epilady model epilator that I use occasionally - I'll never use it again. The Braun is painless in comparison.Initially, upon my first use, I thought it wasn't working. I did not really feel anything (again, I was accustomed to the much more painful Epilady). I looked closely and could tell that it was removing hairs. Soon, I found I could remove the massaging attachment. Without the attachment, I felt more of a pricking sensation, but it was manageable. I felt more sensations in the ankle, toe, knee, and forearm region. In an hour and a half, I epilated both legs and both arms.I also should add that I waxed my lower legs a few weeks prior to my first use. I think that helped the speed up the process.My only disappointment is that I still feel a slight stubble on my lower legs (no where else)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hair free, care free!!!!!!!","review":"I love it, I love it, I love it......(over and over again).

I like it so much that I got 3 more and I am thinking about getting 2 more some time next week. I have given them to family members and they just rave about how they love it. If you are thinking about getting this product go for it. The pain is minimal if you are some one who waxes or uses suger like I WAS. This thing is great there is no mess and you don't have to wait for the hair to grow out. If you are some one who shaves you WILL feel pain (how much depends on you), but the pain will be less as you continue to use the handy dandy little thing. I just love it and what can I say I just love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness and comfort defined.","review":"This model is a lot better than the previous Braun model (which i used and owned). Plucks hair cleanly at root and can pluck small hairs, which the older model had difficulty achieving. The \\"comfor rollers\\" are amazing.

Much better than waxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thorough little gadget","review":"I love this thing. Yes, it hurts a little bit, but you get used to it. And it's MUCH easier than waxing. I used to actually tweeze my legs (it took forever!) and I'm pretty particular about hair removal. I have to say, this thing is more thorough than me with a pair of tweezers. I thought I would still have to do a follow-up tweeze afterwards but I am thrilled to report that I do not. It gets EVERYTHING. Yes, you do have to go over each spot more than once -- and it's probably a 30-minute or so process for both legs -- but it's well worth it. I also really like that you just plug it in and you're ready to go. There's no need to worry about charging or changing batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't decide to give up swearing anytime soon.","review":"Let yourself swear - because it's going to hurt. I used every 4-letter word I know and even made up a few new ones while using this sadistic little gadget. The good news is, hair doesn't grow back for at least 2 weeks. I didn't find epilation on the legs to be particularly painful except for my ankles. Using this product on the bikini area or underarms is so painful that I don't recommend trying it. Also, make sure you exfoliate often to prevent ingrown hairs - they can get very irritated. With all these complaints, it may seem strange that I give this product a 4-star rating. It does do what's promised, and I can't really ask for anything more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well","review":"It only got about 60% of the hairs, even after I went over an area many many times. And many of the hairs just broke off and didn't get pulled, leaving stubble. So I tried an experiment: I did one leg with the epilator and one leg with the electric razor attachment that it comes with. The epilated leg was only slightly smoother than the razored leg-both were left quite prickly. Very disappointing. I will not use it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloooooooow and not very effective","review":"I've used this product twice since buying it, and am pretty disappointed. I got used to the pain, but it took hours just to do (most of) my legs, because you have to go so slow. Additionally, I noticed that both times I had stubble the next day, which indicates that it is merely breaking some of the hair off at the skin, not taking out the bulb. So it takes a comparatively huge amount of time and is less effective than shaving or waxing. I would recommend waxing, and then using the epilator to get the hairs that waxing missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product - takes practice","review":"I have been very impressed with this Epilator thus far, I can say that it takes some practice though. My hair is very fine, but there is a lot of it and it grows very fast! I have used the Braun on my legs, underarms and bikini area successfully, however I am still working on getting it all in one try - so far it's taken several evenings to get all the hairs, but I think with continued use it will be easier. I'm still getting used to the product. Going slow is definitely the key! I also found exfoliating helped on my legs. The pain was very minimal on my legs, everywhere else - just grit your teeth and bear it the first few times and then you're good to go..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"I must admit that I bought this with some reservations. I had read other reviews saying how great it was, but very painful. I was pleasantly surprised when I got it, and it did not hurt nearly as much as I had been led to believe. Maybe my pain tolerence is high? It does a decent job, but I feel that it can leave some stubble in places. The stubble is long enough to feel, but going over it repeatedly still does not remove it. Overall I have been pleased with the performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Devil","review":"To confirm other reviews, this works quite well. But no quality of hair removal is worth this pain. It is truly incredible. Consider I am a guy and I used it on my face. It works well in removing all the hair but it hurts so ungodly horrible that I'd never recommend it to anyone. So the results are great, but the ends do not justify the means. Go get a really powerful cream, wax, something besides this product. I'll be sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well but wish it were more powerful","review":"It does work and it does seem to pull the hair -however short it is- from its roots. The shaver head works better but hair grows back faster this way. It's OK but not the best epilation product I've ever used. I used to have Epilady by Braun which worked much better. Neither the \\"4-way moving pain softener\\" nor the \\"efficiency pro clip\\" is necessary for me. Being used to hot wax I don't feel pain. Without the pain softener gadget it still does not hurt at all (experience based on legs only). I only wish Silk Epil were more powerful. You need to go either very slowly or go over the same place several times. Despite all the negative things I wrote it is the best product I found in the market. Let me know if you find something better. Carrying pouch is stylish and is handy to keep all the pieces together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful steering wheel cover for Chevy fans","review":"I bought this for my husband for Christmas - 2011.

I have used the Neofibrine Absolut Repair for a long time and it really helps my hair. I have straightened my hair in Brazil with a Loreal product (Brazilian blowout that lasts 1 year or until the hair grows). I also don't like to receive what I didn't order.

When I actually got around to reading the book, I was at first disappointed because I had expected a technical review of the hands on techniques for IFR flight.After reading the first chapter I got the point. Apart from the pretty good read and interesting actual examples, I realized that one of the most important aspects to IFR flight is good pilot judgement.Poor judgement is what kills most pilots (and passengers) and IFR flight is a most risky activity. Not that technical skill is not important, it is. But pilot judgement skills are often neglected and under appreciated.The book is well written and the accounts of both personal flights (from two different perspectives) and industry accidents are very instructive and interesting.Highly recommended for those wanting to go beyond the basic skills.

Go to the Presonus forum and read about all of the complaints regarding sync issues. There are very specific fire wire devices that these devices will work with.

I like the sound of the mic pre's in it, so I went ahead and got this one, instead of just buying a mic pre. I had a serious amount of trouble with low gain output on this. I was pulling my hair out an finally found the issue on Presonus's website. In order to be compliant with Apple's firewire power standards, they had to lower the voltage rails on this device. This results in a MUCH lower output than its USB counterpart, This would be ok, with a condenser mic, but with a quiet mic like an SM57, you actually have to buy an ADDITIONAL preamp to boost the gain.

I'm a big fan of his songs \\"What does your soul look like\\" (Mainly part 1) \\"Highnoon\\" and \\"Stem/Long Stem\\" just to name a few. IMO he tries really hard to be creative but these songs at times appear to come off sloppy and incoherant.

Knives are not pry bars but they should not break when trying to dig a object out of wood or building materials. I have also ran across a lot of Benchmade's knives in the trash all with broken tips from normal military use. If you want a knife that is for everyday carry as a civilian it is fine but if you are law enforcement or military and you may have to depend on it look at something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Very well built product.

Lucas has lived or maybe how he felt.I really like \\"Simple Beautiful.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An O.G like me","review":"I truley enjoyed the poetry this author had to offer. The author was able to let the readers re-live his experiences of a black male from his childhood to manhood. More poetry like this should be available for our young society to validate some of their emotions and to educate others on a culture different from their own. For example the poem \\"Where I began where I am\\", and \\"My pop\\" was insighful and inspiring. And of course my favorite \\"BEAUTIFUL\\"!

My only complaint is the omission of his version of \\"She Loves You\\" done in the style of 'Dr. Strangelove'. WHY would they leave that off when EVERYTHING ELSE is there??? Then again, we DO get 3 'other' versions of 'She Loves You', so it sort of makes up for it.GREAT photos [one of the best is with Sophia, Peter and producer George Martin!] and original EMI/Parlophone sleeve art.Peter Sellers, like it or not, was most-likely the funniest, versatile & hippest comedian ever! Like he said of himself as Harold Fine [in the film 'I LOVE YOU, ALICE B.

Robbie Miller Kaplan uses her own experiences as well as consultations with many professionals to create a thoughtfull resource for anyone working in the helping professions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dock Wheel","review":"We have two pieces of floating dock that must be taken out each fall and put in each spring. It has become increasingly difficult for the two of us to do this - neither of us is getting any younger. I have been searching for some way to make this procedure easier. We do have a winch to help with the removal. The addition of the 4 dock wheels made the job very easy. Each set of wheels is connected by black pipe and we attached them to the dock using retractable tie downs - worked like a dream. It worked so well that we purchased 4 more wheels for the second dock rather than take them off the first piece. Hopefully the reverse procedure in the spring will go as well. They were well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"I'm glad my 45lb cocker/standard poodle puppy loves the stuff because I trust the brand and its superior nutrition.

So it is particularly disappointing to find two identical books given different covers and different titles. I had expected the author to have published a new book with new information. Instead this was identical to his \\"Old-Time Farm and Garden Devices and How to Make Them\\" published in 2005.

The copyright has long since expired.The book itself is conceptually interesting, but unlikely to be of practical use. The sketches of the farm equipment are very rudimentary, material availability has changed dramatically in the last 100 years, and you probably won't be using oxen.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Vague","review":"I bought this book and had to return it. The table of contents makes it seem rather informative. However, the \\"meat\\" of the book is less than impressive. The font is huge. In other words, they don't accomplish much with the space used. The descriptions of how to make and use the devices are excessively vague and esoteric. Many words and carpentry terms are used that left me desiring a step-by-step diagram. No diagram available. There are only a few pictures and they are pastoral and sentimental rather than informative and instructional. I have no doubt that most of the devices I wouldn't be able to make correctly given the information in the book. Hence, I sent the book back. I would advise against buying this book for anyone who isn't already a carpenter or skilled farmer. Maybe my grandpa would have been able to use this book, but I could not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Time & Money","review":"Don't waste your time or money. I've accumulated many similar books.

It does not appear to be abridged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified Incest","review":"This book disgusted me. I have never read anything so incestuous. 'Tale of Genji' is an overindulgent, horrific story. Any man who covets a girl of approxiamately age seven for a wife is what I would call a 'pedophile' not a prince. Not to mention that he impregnates his step mother. I have to wonder about those who gave this book 5 stars. Spare yourself the disgust, and use your money more wisely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Have to Have Everything Prince is On","review":"If one listens to this closely, you can hear Prince all over the place on this album, and it's likely he wrote all the music outside of the segues and the raps. Like New Power Soul, the other so-called New Power Generation only album, this one lacks virtually everything a good Prince album contains. There are no hooks in the melodies, the raps are ridiciulous, the profanity is ridiculous and typical for this style of music at this time period.The only people who'll really get into this, and I doubt it'll spin much on their CD players, are people who have to have everything Prince is involved with. If you can find a cheap used copy, go for it, otherwise forget about it. I've owned it for almost 15 years and each time I listen to it, which has been three times, I realize why it's been sitting in my CD collection more as a token than as something worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sesame Street Video!","review":"I have several Sesame Street videos but this is by far the most entertaining and engaging for my 10-month old daughter, as well as for me!

The clips are too random and jumpy- sometimes you are talking about a certain number for 5 seconds and sometimes you will spend 60 seconds on a certain number. If you are wanting a dvd to help your child learn how to count, buy something else.Thankfully I got this at a garage sale for $1 - but it wasn't even worth that. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Right now this DVD is not so exciting for my 1 and 2 year old but I liked it so I think in a few months my kids will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a hit","review":"My 2.5 yr old will watch just about anything, but this just has never grabbed her attention.

My son got excited at the beginning and then it just started skipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this movie!","review":"I couldn't stand to listen to it, so my 2yr old hasn't watched it very often. But there is this weasel character (a bellhop) who gets paged every time they ding the bell. He comes into each scene yelling and complaining and \\"talking ugly\\" as we call it. This character alone was enough to turn me off the show. I much prefer the leapfrog series, whose characters have upbeat attitudes just right for toddler movies. I also hate the show Angelina Ballerina, so if you like that show you may not mind the weasel's grouchy angry words. Neither has characters I want my children to mimic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of \\"vintage\\" sesame street clips","review":"It has a storyline that incorporates lots of little clips from Sesame Street during my childhood, along with newer ones exposing my child to numbers in a musical way."},{"rating":"2","title":"very entertaining and educational!","review":"My 19 month old son loves this video! It is about 30 minutes long- just enough time to clean up the kitchen and get a few other things done around the house.

Good quality both sound and sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn your numbers quickly while having fun!!","review":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE KID'S VIDEO. We originally borrowed this from the library. We liked it so much, and I was so tired of having to return it after maxing out the renewals just to check it out again, that we decided to buy it. The kids (2 and almost 4 years old) ask for it all the time. I thought they'd be tired of it after a few months, but it still holds their interest. The songs are a great compliation of really great Sesame Street production numbers. We all sing along and, quite frankly, I can't get the songs for the numbers 3, 5, and 10 out of my head. The kids also like the bits with Ernie and Benny (don't call him bunny) between the songs which is usually when the kid's lose interest in this type of DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and educational","review":"My 4 year old loves this DVD.It teaches the basics of numbers in a really fun and creative way that grabs the toddler's attention.My little girl is definately hooked on it.She watches it every day :0)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sesame Street - 123 Count With Me","review":"This is an excellent product. It is both very educational and entertaining. My two year old loves it and is actually learning to count quickly. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ernie has a great sense of humor.","review":"123 Count With Me really helped familiarize my then 2-3 year old daughter with not just the recognition of numbers and the concept of 'how many' but also the concepts of 'sequence' and why we 'count' things. Excellent production with a light sprinkling of humor moms and dads can appreciate while sitting on the couch with the little one. My favorite? The 'Counting Crows'! Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ernie sings some FUN songs!","review":"My 18 month old daughter loves this dvd. And you know what? I do, too! There are some classic songs I remember from Sesame Street as a child along with some newer songs, all about counting. All the songs are catchy and fun. My daughter is learning how to count with the help of Ernie, his friends, and Elmo, as well. Sesame Street has once again succeeded at making learning an enjoyable experience!The DVD is nice because the menu has all the songs available to listen to at your preference. The length is about 40 minutes. This is a great buy, and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not model polite behavior","review":"I loved Sesame street growing up, but Sesame street as a whole seems to be going downhill to me. This video, while it does have a couple of great vintage clips, models HORRIBLY rude and disobedient behavior. The bunny is extremly rude to Ernie and the Honker, and Ernie and the Honker repeatedly bother and annoy Benny, even after Benny asks them to stop (and of course, asks in a rude way). The educational value is minimal. I really don't think this helped my child to count to 15 or to recognize his numbers. If you want some good vintage Sesame STreet clips, check out the 25th anniversary. Good clips, educational value is about the same, but no rude behavior, and no disobedient behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sesame Street-123 Count With Me","review":"This DVD is good as far as exposing children to numbers and my 2 year old seemed to enjoy it, but the bunny is VERY rude. My son has not asked to watch it so I haven't shown it to him since the first viewing, because if the rudeness of the bunny. I would prefer if they made an effort to display or encourage good manners as well as teach about academic things, like Barney tends to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad...","review":"I rarely review books or DVDs but I felt compelled to do so with this one because it is really, really bad. There's a lot of yelling from one of the main characters (the bunny) and, though the songs are cute, there's no way to play all of the songs without also watching some of the bunny, who comes across as really cantankerous and angry. I love Sesame Street as a general rule, but strongly dislike this particular video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think","review":"The story line is very boring. My toddler loses interest immediately. As a parent, I do as well. Compared to some of the other Sesame dvd's, this one is poor. Story line is portrayed by Ernie, along with \\"second string\\" characters. I think you should spend your money on other learning materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss the *real* Ernie...","review":"Is anyone else annoyed by the \\"new\\" voice of Ernie? I find the character has lost that spark of mischievousness that made Ernie so wonderful. Maybe I'm just getting old...Otherwise, I agree that Benny is obnoxious and out of place, and some of the songs are so banal it makes my skin crawl (that \\"Rock around the Clock\\" thing is God-awful).On the plus side, at least it doesn't center around Elmo (people complain that Baby Bear's speech is a bad influence, I can't even understand Elmo half the time, and I sure wish he (she?) would stop referring to itself in the 3rd person...).Just grouchy tonight, but I'm not fond of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not working for me in my kids portable DVD player","review":"I bought this product with great hope.

Elmo)as well. They count all the way up to 15 and there is almost a song for every number."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Influence","review":"There is so much to love about the SS approach to teaching children, but this video is a grave disappointment. Throughout the video this bunny with a rotten attitude screams at everyone for little to no reason. With small children imitating everything they see, this is harmful exposure for behaviour development.I also agree with the review about Elmo. I have a growing annoyance with listening to Elmo speak in the third person. Come on! Are you educational or not?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it","review":"I like Sesame Street in general and my daughter loves Elmo. But this video has a very annoying character, the gruff sounding bunny. I think the bunny ruins it, he's not cute and he's just an annoying little character. Also, there is more talking in this video than the other ones we own. I like the ones with more singing. Our favorites of Sesame Street so far are Kids Favorite Songs and Elmo's Guessing Game."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"The screaming bunny is just terrible.

Avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You might get hooked yourself...","review":"I bought this for my seven month old on a whim as my wife and I were looking for some DVDs from the Baby Einstein video series. But after watching this, we are glad we made this purchase. The characters are great and, in typical Sesame Street fashion, are goofy as heck! Benny has to be our favorite character and I'm sorry one reviewer didn't take more kindly to him - he definetly brings more humor to this already funny video. Think of him as a funnier Oscar. The songs are extremely catchy - I find myself humming them on my way to work (shh, don't tell anyone!). This has quickly become the most watched DVD in our home!...and oh yeah, my kid really likes it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Benny the Bunny....","review":"I like the video and I think that the songs are great, however Benny the Bunny is very annoying and I find his yelling absolutely inappropriate for young children. Does every video these days have to have an obnoxious character? This is the kind of thing that desensitizes children. It really is a shame because otherwise this video has some great songs. My favorite video is Sesame Street's 25th Birthday - A Musical Celebration (1993). It has great songs and is mellow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"I thought I was read all great writers for this misteries, crimes and all those, but Sanders has become one of my favourites ones (the first of course is Raymond Chandler).

The shiatsu motion is superior to the vibration models. The chair itself is a very comfortable recliner, so you can still use it as a recliner even after the mechanics breaks down.On the down side, I wish the massage can go an extra half feet both lower and higher.

However, the chair I owned had defective welds, which caused the frame to break within a month of purchase. I was fortunate enough to purchase my chair at a place where I could inspect the remaining stock, and several of the chairs they were selling also had defective welds. I would not purchase this chair unless it was from a place that allowed me to carefully inspect the item before buying. One other caveat: the vinyl cover slips on like a fitted sheet. Inspect it carefuly to make sure that the seams are correctly sewn and that the cover will fit well.

I ordered a set this month (different size and color) and received a not-so-soft, thinner sheet set. I am not really happy with this second set. If I had handled them in a store, I would not have purchased them. Poor quality control? Or just a different manufacturer for different sizes? Good luck! The only positive is that this is the best fitting set I've found for a thick king-sized bed...and yeah, they're stitched together properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Renaissance 600 Thread-Count Queen Sheet Set","review":"I was extremely disappointed in these sheets. They were so stiff and noisy (yes, I said noisy) that I removed them from the bed after one night and washed them. There was some improvement after washing but not much.

Boy was that a big mistake and a waste of money. I keep hoping given the high thread count that washing will help. No such luck - they come out of the dryer a scratchy, wrinkly mess - and I'm talking hard crease wrinkles. In a desperate attempt to salvage these i resorted to ironing hoping the threads would lie down - my heavy duty steam iron could barely get the wrinkles out of the pillowcases. Now i'm stuck with them ... i'm going to continue to keep washing with fabric softener hoping for a miracle but my guts telling me these high priced sheets will wind up in the Goodwill bag. Unless u like scratchy burlap, don't buy these sheets. They do NOT live up to the advertising. Whether it matter or not I ordered the brown king size set. A friend has recommended bamboo sheets - i'm going to try that next. OBVIOUSLY high thread count does NOT guarantee softness or quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rennaisance 600 thread King Sheet Set","review":"Sheet fits the king bed well - I waited until I had laundered the sheets at least twice before commenting on the product. Sheets are a good weight. Some sheets today seem soft but so thin that they might not last. These are substantial weight and feel like they will wear well.

I had just purchased a chocolate duvet cover, and wanted a set of sheets that matched. These seemed to fit the bill.I was excited when they got here, and ripped the box open. I was a bit sceptical when I saw the colour, as it was more honey coloured than I thought. However, I found that they actually matched my duvet set really well.The other thing that came as a surprise was the softness. As most high thread sheets, they are not super soft, but they were still way softer than I had anticipated. I have washed them and they are really nice to the touch. I would recommend these, and I am thinking about another set in a different colour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sheets","review":"Good sheet set. For the $40 price of these sheets, it is unlikely that a better set could be purchased. The sheets are a little thicker and stiffer than many cotton sheets, but I find them to be a nice weight and they are fairly wrinkle resistant which is a big plus. I have the white sheets and they have held up very well after being washed probably a dozen times. I highly recommend these sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I had ordered 2 sets of these sheets and as usual the shipping was excellant.

I bought these sheets as a gift for my very pregnant daughter in an effort to make her bed softer and more comfortable. She washed them on gentle before she put them on her bed. When I asked her tonight on Skype \\"how are the new sheets,\\" she said with hesitation, \\"they are a bit scratchy.\\" OMG These so-called 600-thread-count sheets should be very smooth. Cheap sheets are scratchy, and these certainly were not cheap. I wish that she would have told me when she opened them that they were not nice sheets so that I could have returned them. All I can say about these sheets is \\"don't order them.\\" They are not what they claim to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. More like 250 Thread Count","review":"I purchased these sheets because we like a high thread count, soft sheet and this seemed like a good deal. Instead, we received sheets that are akin to what you would find in a cheap motel room. These sheets are nothing close to other 600 TC sheets I own. They are stiff and irritating, even after 2 washings with fabric softener. They feel nothing like \\"Sateen\\" as advertised. I have a set of 400 TC sheets that are far superior in softness than these sheets. In short, save your money unless you intend to put these in a cheap motel room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems after washing","review":"I purchased a set of Renaissance 600-count sheets at a store and loved it - silky and a good fit. I sought and found what looked like the same sheets on Amazon (same name, thread count,appearance and price). I purchase the ivory and teal blue. I did not receive the blue sheets, but a more blue-gray. Amazon offered to take them back and ultimately I got them without charge. Both colors shrank a bit when washed, enough to make it a struggle to get them on the bed. But after washing the ivory also became thicker, annoyingly so. Ultimately I gave them away."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Should Read Reviews","review":"I'd been looking for some chocolate colored sheets to complement our new master bedroom.

I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased them. I washed the sheets 3 times in Woolite and they were still very rough. Not the way 600 thread count sheets should feel. They are also very thick. Fortunately, Amazon allowed me to return them. That is why I love Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"rough as sandpaper","review":"I ordered two sets and returned the unopened one after washing and using the first set several times with no sign of them getting much softer. Roughest cotton sheets I have ever had. Pretty odd since they are 600. Definitely don't feel like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to stiff","review":"I got these sheets hoping to give me an extra set of super soft sheets. Unfortunately I think it is going to take a hundred washes for the stiffness to wear out. I also cannot stand the way they wrinkle in the dryer. They are really heavy too. I probably should have done more research on 600-thread-count but I know now if you prefer lighter softer sheets these aren't the ones for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cafe Colour has Little to do with Coffee","review":"Returning them.

I only washed it once, and so far the color is still as good as new."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy","review":"These sheets have a nice silky feeling, and the pockets fit my extra-thick mattress beautifully. It's difficult to believe they are 600 thread count, however, as they are much lighter in weight than 400 and 500 thread count sheets I have. They seem more similar to 300 thread count sheets. Of course, it may be that they are woven of much finer thread than most sheets. Anyway, they are attractive and comfortable, they fit my hard-to-fit mattress, and the price is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The color is diffeerent than it seems on Amazon","review":"Overall the quality is very good,I would recommend to buy this set of sheets, for this price it just a good deal; however be carefully with colors.

I would say it is more like mustard, cannot say anything about other colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice sheets","review":"I bought these sheets for my bed and my guest bedroom bed. I have had family for the past 7 weeks and they have made numerous comments as to how much they like the sheets on their bed. I would have to agree. They are soft and feel thick but not stiff.

And they call these 'Sateen'--I had to look @ my order to see if I received the correct sheets!I love the color, the cafe is not a blatant bright gold, but a nice muted soft one.

A really good thing about these sheets is that they make us feel cooler at night (we live in Cali, Colombia, where the usual tenperature is about 28o C at night, so this has been definitely an advantage for us).The cons:The color is evidently different to the one on the laptop screen.

Also, the pillow cases are too short! I ordered a California King sheet set, and my king sized pillows hang out of the cases about 2 or 3 inches, it looks tacky!I'm not happy with these, I'm not going to return them because it's too much of a hassle for me, but I would not recommend it to friends, and would not purchase again :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"These are about as soft as my 300 thread count sheets that I've had for five years and of lesser quality than my 500 thread count sheets.

I thought I was \\"treating\\" myself with these--unfortunately it turned out to be torture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich color","review":"Love these sheets! The color works great with our quilt, and they washed up nicely. Glad I ordered these in more than one color! Fortunately, we don't have a pillow-top mattress, or the fitted sheet would be too small. These are fine for us, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiff & Noisy","review":"I should have listened to what I read in previous veviews. I've washed these sheets 3 times in 2 days TRYING to get these soft and not noisy & stiff. Practically dumped fabric softener in the washer and added 2-3 fabric softener sheets in the dryer all 3 times. What the heck are they made of? I really expected softer sheets for 600 TC. Sure, they fit good, but are wrinkly and stiff to say the least. Wish I had better news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"This sheets are just ok, they match the comforter set I purchased. They do not wash up well, they are very wrinkled even when removing from dryer immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"quality sheets","review":"I paid $40 dollars for the sheet set and worth it. Very deep pockets to fit the mattress, therefore there is no pulling at corners. The color is a very deep brown. They are still a lil stiff, but thick and luxurious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, thick, exactly as advertised.","review":"Good quality sheets! The fitted sheet, if put on the bed straight out of the dryer, doesn't require ironing, but the topsheet & pillowcases do. This isn't unexpected with a thread count this high. They're comfortable, the color is sharp and uniform, and I sleep well on them. Definitely above average."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a deal!","review":"I am a sheet freak and I absolutely love these sheets! They feel fantastic and they're great quality for the price. I'm going to buy another set in a different color because I love them so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Soft","review":"These are great & well worth the price, we got rid of our queen berd shortly thereafter & now I am purchasing a king set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Value","review":"These sheets are great. I have purchased the same quality for much more $$. The value is incredible. I have recommended these and will continue to recommend these. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sheets","review":"I was very happy with the thickness and quality of the sheets when they arrived. The chocolate brown color is lovely. The do tend to get wrinkly and are not super soft but a great deal for the cost. I am quite happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrinkles galore","review":"These sheets get more wrinkly than any other sheets we've ever owned. The color looks very nice, but the wrinkles ruin it. They're reasonably comfortable, but not nearly as good as the charter club macy's sheets that we use on our main bed.Thread count is overrated. Don't buy into that hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome sheets, not so awesome color","review":"I have purchased many sheets from amazon. I purchased these sheets in king size and cafe color. The website shows cafe as a light brown beige type color, but when they arrived, the color was more gold in color. Luckily they match one of my green comforters, but the color was not what I was looking for. I kept them only because they were only $39.00 and it didn't seem worth it to pay for the shipping back. Oh yeah, the initial shipping was free! So it was not worth it to send them back. As far as comfort goes, they are very nice, very comfy. My boyfriend purchased the chocolate colored ones, and is very happy with the color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sheets for the money","review":"I purchased this sheet set on sale and could not be happier I did. They arrived in a short time and I love them. I highly recommend these sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Buy For The Price.","review":"First let me preface this by saying I am a single guy and I do not live in a Martha Stewart house. I needed a couple of sheet sets and these were a good price. When I opened the package and looked at this color, (Cafe), I thought it looked like a set of sheets from a house of ill repute. Brassy would be a compliment. They are stiff. If you don't like stiff sheets then look elsewhere. Once I slept on them I liked the feel of them and I cannot explain why. I am thinking that they will wear well and likely get softer after repeated washings. A bit stiff but certainly the color is the part you need to get over. They work just fine for me. I would buy them again and I did not have to go to a mall to buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not \\"Teal\\" - color great!!","review":"I like these sheets!!! Great fit on my 16\\" mattress.Teal???? NO!!! And barely \\"sateen\\"....my preference (not slick).But this blue COLOR is GREAT!!!! I would describe it assteel blue/grey, I love it.This color is a very modern, an almost masculine color of blue.It has depth and complexity. And it matches my florals also.For the price.....I'm very happy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Renaissance Sheets","review":"They are not quite what I expected. They wrinkle very easily. Would not order them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sleeping","review":"I have found these sheets to be very comfortable and a good value. I would like to buy more sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value, but a little rough","review":"This is a great set of sheets for the price. The only negative is that the sheets have a somewhat rough feel to them. This is probably because they are made from \\"open-end spun\\" yarns, which is how almost all yarn is produced now. If you want a really smooth fabric, you should look for \\"ring-spun\\" yarn. You can still find fabric which was produced from ring-spun yarm, but it will be relatively more expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"King size doesn't fit, cheap feeling sheets","review":"Ordered king size, white. They aren't incredibly soft, they're very heavy, probably too hot for summer. And they do not fit my mattress (pillow top)very well. There's no way the flat sheet will be able to be tucked in at the sides at all. Also, very wrinkly after drying. I guess you get what you pay for. These are no better than cheap Walmart sheets, which do fit better. So if you just want cheap sheets, get them from Walmart. If you want luxury sheets, I guess you do have to spend more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Material","review":"Sheets only lasted two washes and then started to fall apart. The sheets start to pill after the first use. Would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Quality is terrible! These things are terrible!! So think you can see your hand right through them. I had to send them back. There was no way I could keep them, and make due!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Wrinkly","review":"I have had different Sateen sheets for the past 10 years and these are not even near the quality. They are unbelievably wrinkly and after I even ironed the pillow cases, the wrinkles from the dryer did not come out. And I did not let them sit for a second in the dryer. Right when it was done I pulled them out. If I could do it again, I would not order these. They are not soft at all like sateen should be. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratchy & Itchy","review":"I do not believe this is 600 thread count. I washed it right out of the package before using it and was stunned at how acratchy the sheet set was. Even after a second washing. I do not recommend this sheet set."},{"rating":"1","title":"California King size is too small/stiff","review":"We got a set of these sheets a few weeks ago and immediately noticed that the top sheet wasn't wide enough. In fact, after washing, the top sheet barely reached the edge of the bed on both sides. We did try them out for a night, but the small size combined with the stiffness of the sheets was a deal breaker.As a side note, the fitted sheet fit just fine - although it was still made from the same stiff material.Other reviewers have mentioned that different sizes seem to made differently, so be aware that this review only applies to the California King size.I would not recommend getting these sheets in the California King size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiff and Wrinkly","review":"The sheets were very stiff. Even after washing, they came out stiff and very very wrinkly. I would not recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap sheets","review":"These sheets do not feel like they're anything close to 600 thread count. I returned them immediately and that process went very smooth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought two sets, one king and one queen. I washed one set and when they came out of the dryer the top and bottom sheets were a different color of ivory. The color was splotchy and they were horribly wrinkled and stiff. I packed them up and sent them back to Amazon today. I've bought heavy cotton sheets on Amazon before but they were made in Pakistan and were really wrinkle resistant even though they were 100% cotton. Wish I could find those again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolutely worst bedding ever!","review":"The fabric is the same as the sacks that in the 50's held chicken mash (chicken food) from the feed and grain store. No amount of laundering or wear will ever soften this coarse and rough cotton enough to make it comfortable to sleep on. They are not a true white, but more an ivory and made to \\"resemble\\" a popular striped sheet you find at local stores and even hotels. I was astounded that such a poor textile was still in use much less sold as bedding.I took a leap of faith in the 90's and used my credit card to buy books through the Internet on the site known as Amazon. Now many years later after having purchased probably hundreds of products,this will be my first return. I think the consumer and Amazon have been deceived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sheets","review":"I love these sheets. As some of the reviews mentioned, if you're anal about crisp looking sheets you will have to iron them. I personally don't care. If you want comfortable sheets at a good price, these are superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off going to Goodwill","review":"I saw the multitude of positive reviews and popularity of these sheets and thought I was safe to purchase them online. A month into using my king sheet set and I already know that I was wrong. The main flaw with this product that I have found is that the fitted sheet has already started to pill up, creating an unpleasant texture to snuggle into at the end of the day. The pillow cases and top sheet are holding up fine thus far--but one would expect any product to hold up after a month of normal use. I am hoping to return these sheets and may just go down to a local Goodwill and see if there are any sheets there that I can give a good washing to and use. At least then I'll know that they have been used without balling up. Quite disappointing. I'd highly recommend looking for a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naw","review":"Read the reviews. Was hoping for a set of affordable, quality bed sheets like the set I got from Sears years ago that were recommended and I still have and use. But, no. Just average feel while being a little heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Looks great...until the first wash. fitted sheet shrunk from a queen to a full size mattress!! Also, lost all its shine. Looks like a very cheap pair of sheets now. Washed in cold water and dried at low heat. are those disposable sheets?"},{"rating":"2","title":"best sheets ever that I've had","review":"very nice sheets, actually the best I've had. Nice and thick and smooth. I usually have 2 to 3 blankets on the bed during winter, but not with these sheet set's, 1 blanket all winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality.","review":"Terrible quality. Too washings (in cold and dried on low heat) and the sheets have shrunk so much they don't fit the bed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than happy","review":"I know you should never depend on the colors shown on the computer, but when I ordered STONE sheets, what arrived was very cafe au lait. I was hoping for taupe with a lot of gray as the picture showed.Then I washed them, before I used them for the first time, and the seams fell apart.I ordered HONEY sheets and they turned out to be mustard colored.If I could give less than one star, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sheets","review":"These are thick and soft, but still breathable. I don't sweat overnight in these the way in do in some other sateen sheets, and they're deep enough that I don't have to fight to fit them over the corners of our mattress. A good bargain overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Mustard than Cafe brown","review":"Not crazy about the color. Definitely a mustard color and not the taupe/brown color in the photo. Love the sheets though. After I had found that my Hotel collection sheets from Bed Bath & Beyond had been discontinued I came to Amazon and found these sheets. Great sheets for the price. For those who have never had sheets like these they do wrinkle when taken out of the dryer (even on permanent press). But after several washes they soften and the wrinkles become less and less. Within a day of sleeping on them the wrinkles are gone anyway. Good value and am going to buy another set."},{"rating":"2","title":"6oo Thread Count Sheets","review":"Sheets came in a timely manner & they are great, especially for the price. On top of that, they feel great. And I'm just the husband!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Renaissance 600 Thread Count 100% Cotton Sateen Queen Sheet Set","review":"They pilled up and were rough after only the second washing. Definitely not satisfied with the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"As soft as.... sandpaper.","review":"I was so excited to purchase the 600 TC Sateen sheets! I couldn't wait for them to arrive, wash them, and put them on my bed. Much to my disappointment, however, these sheets are anything from soft and comfortable. It was like sleeping on the cheapest hotel sheets you can imagine. I've washed them at least a dozen times, using excessive amounts of fabric softener and dryer sheets to try and make them softer. I have not yet succeeded in that. The deal I got would have been impressive if only the sheets were worth what I paid. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"After Three Washes, Starts Pilling","review":"Despite this being a 600 thread count set, it only took three washes to start pilling. This should not happen with a set like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom too big; top too small","review":"The bottom sheet fits like a king size sheet at the foot of the mattress and is smaller at the top of the mattress. None of the corners line up nicely on my new pillow-top queen size mattress. Also, the elastic is very poor quality.The top sheet fits like a full-size sheet and barely covers a queen mattress. These sheets are poorly assembled. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best","review":"These are the best sheets that I have ever purchased. They are so soft. The more you wash them the softer they become. I like the weight. They are heavy but not hot.... cool and so comfortable. I have 4 sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SHEETS!!!","review":"The sheet set was Great! The quality was as promised and the color was beautiful with my comforter---really picked up the butterflies colors! Loved it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the fitted sheet.","review":"Was excited for this item and have yet to use it but the color and quality look nice. Only problem is this order was for a 4-piece set: flat sheet, fitted sheet, and 2 king size pillowcases. I did NOT receive a fitted sheet, which to be quite honest was the main reason why I ordered this item. I did not see where I could contact somebody so that this issue may be resolved so please contact me (sahak_ghaghian@yahoo.com) cause I really would like to receive my fitted sheet.Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!","review":"I read the reviews before ordering and thought surely the bad reviews were just complainiers who wouldn't be satisfied with anything. But I must say these sheets are TERRIBLE! They fit perfectly and were soft, but after the 2nd wash they are pilled up and feel like sandpaper. Am now using them to cover plants outside during a freeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Sheets","review":"I'm sorry but these are not sateen sheets. I have been buying sateen sheets for 15 years. They are getting harder to find so I was thrilled when I found this set for only $45. When I got them, it was a major disappointment. They are not soft, at all (even after washing). Also, like another reviewer said, the cafe color looks nothing like the picture. Wish I could return but that's not an option since I washed them. Would not recommend. Stick with what you know and don't fall for something that says high quality just because the price is good - lesson learned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sheets!!! Itchy and rough after first wash!","review":"I have never once posted a review for anything, ever, and I am a huge online shopper. When you first take these sheets out of the box they fee wonderful. After you wash them they are scratchy and made me feel itchy. True sheets of the quality this brand \\"advertises\\" feel great for a long time, this is not the case with this product. I feel that I wasted my money and would never advise someone to buy these sheets, go to Marshalls of TJ Maxx over buying this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rough and Scratchy","review":"I bought these Sateen Sheets in hopes that it would be the smooth cool feel of sheets that you would get at a nice hotel. After numerous washes and fabric softener additions I realized that these sheets would never soften up and that I had made a poor purchase. If you want the soft feel of nice sheets I would not recommend these sheets. I bought Pure Beech Sateen Sheets from BBB and they were perfect right out of the box with one wash to make sure they were clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Renaissance 600 thread count sheet set","review":"These sheets are very wrinkled and stiff after laundering. I would not purchase them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fitted sheet corners are too long","review":"If you have a regular maattress, beware of buying this sheeet set! The corners of the fitted sheet are so deep that every night, they all come up from off the mattress, just from moving around."},{"rating":"2","title":"600 thread count sheets","review":"I bought these sheets for my son. They don't look anything like the ad. They are thin and not the same color. My son likes them though so it worked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the quality I was expecting.","review":"I was so excited to see that I could get a 600 count sheet set for the price I did. I always wash everything I buy before using the product. After washing, I put them on my bed and then I saw a part of the color had washed away. I also, found the sheet set to be very rough, not at all what a 600 count sheet should feel like. My husband even made a remark; that the sheets felt like a tarp. My husband doesn't make a remark on these types of things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed","review":"I am very impressed with these sheets. They were delivered within a couple of days after ordering. I usually purchase 1000 to 1200 count sheets for triple the cost of these sheets. These sheets were just as nice as the others. I just can't believe how many sets of these sheets I could have purchased with the money I spent on the others. I will definetly order more!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I returned these sheets because they were not scratchy, not soft at all.

These sheets are amazingly comfortable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't BUY!!!","review":"Before I bought these sheets I had 300 thread count sheets. I was super excited about 600 thread count and that it said Sateen. When you think about Sateen you think soft, silky, and smooth. Well, I got none of those. These sheets feel like cardboard. My 300 thread count sheet are softer then these trash bags.

They are a horrible gold. 600 thread count sateen - not. They are as stiff as cheap percale. This stiffness is what angers me the most. They feel like a really over-starched shirt, even after washing. I don't buy high-thread count sheets for stiffness. I buy them for their softness. Do not buy these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth more than $20.00","review":"This can NOT be 600 Thread Count. It is super thin and is not as soft as the $12.00 bed sheets I bought at Wal-Mart.

They are so rough and itchy. I washed them multiple times to see if they would get softer, but that was not the case. I am shocked that Amazon can sell theses claiming that they are 600 tc and sateen. I have a set of 500 tc that are so much softer and nicer than these. I couldn't sleep on these for one night. They are so uncomfortable and made me break out in hives and made me itch all over. Worst sheets I have ever owned!!! Very disappointed in these sheets and in Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"We ordered cafe colored and it is actually a dark mustard yellow.

However, after two weeks of use, I discovered a small hole in the fitted sheet - about 1/8 inch in diameter.I used an iron-on patch to fix it. Not worth the trouble of returning the sheets.First time I have ever encountered a hole in new sheets. Other than that, I like the sheets, but now would not buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Quality control","review":"I bought a set of these sheets in Ivory and fell absolutely in love with them. They were beautiful, soft and snuggly. I liked them so much I bought a second set in Chocolate brown and they are TERRIBLE!!! They are rough and scratchy.

I have gotten lots of stuff off Amazon and NEVER had a problem like this and never felt compelled to write a review, especially a negative one. Please buy these sheets with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sheets!","review":"My husband and I really love these sheets. They are very soft on the skin and they are a thick cotton. I like that they do have a slight sheen, but they aren't too shiny. I bought the ivory color and they seem to be slightly more yellow in color than the picture. It doesn't bother me at all, though. I liked these sheets so much and found them to be such a good deal that I bought another set.

To my dismay, I crawled into bed that night and ended up tossing and turning all night long (odd for me on my Tempurpedic) all because of these stupid sheets.

The top sheet in my Queen size in Ivory clearly states on the tag that it is a cotton polyester blend! If your looking for all-cotton sheets don't buy these. They are nice for a blend, but I would have never bought them if not for the misleading product description. Due to the misleading description I'm giving these sheets a zero rating, although you can't rank them less than one star. If I'd wanted a poly blend I'd have rated them much higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 100% cotton sateen.","review":"I purchased these sheets and they looked very nice out of package until I looked on the tags sewn inside to wash. The only sheet that is 100% cotton is the bottom sheet. The top sheet and 2 pillowcases are 60% cotton and 45% polyester. Has anyone else looked at the tags sewn inside to see if this is the same in your set? I do not know if I got a mismatched set but the RN number on the bottom of each tag states it is made in India and the RN number is the same on each tag - just the tags state cotton blend on everything except the fitted sheet. Please let me know if you have come across this. I do not know if I should exchange or find another set."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Shrink","review":"I purchased two sets of these sheets in chocolate brown six months ago.

I change my sheets weekly so with two sets they have been washed twice a month for 6 months and with each washing they have shrunk and putting them on the bed has become more and more difficult until yesterday when I couldn't stretch the bottom sheet far enough to get it on the bed at all and the top sheet barely covers the top of the bed. The sheets are now in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted...","review":"I think I will stick with buying sheets at Marshall's or other outlet type stores. The color is way too gold for my taste and my decor, and they are not at all soft. Making a live purchase allows you to feel--although pre-washed linens can be deceiving, and check the real color. I am happy that they are oversize, I have a big mattress, but that is really the only thing I like about these sheets. In fact I am not even happy that they are heavy duty, I would love for them to wear out sooner so I can justify purchasing a new set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy!","review":"The Renaissance 600-thread-count cotton sateen sheets have a great fit, will wear well, and are very delicious.

Would buy again if they had them in purple. Great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom sheet wouldn't fit!","review":"I'm SO disappointed that the bottom sheet didn't fit when I got these sheets. I've put off buying nice sheets because of the cost, but I finally took the plunge. When I put the bottom sheet on my 14\\" mattress (supposed to have 16\\" pockets and fit up to 18\\"), I couldn't get it over the one of the corners. I tugged and tugged and barely got it over the top of the pillow top but I know it will pop off when I lay on it. I love the feel and weight of the sheets, but I'm so disappointed the bottom sheet doesn't fit. I would return them, but it's such a hassle because I don't have the original box and don't have time to box it up to send back. I may change my mind if I get too aggravated with it popping off. The top sheet and pillow cases are just fine. Why don't they have better quality control????"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY","review":"I read several reviews. Stick to buying items like this in the store, it will be alot less hassle for returns, I washed them and dryed them on low, them were so wrinkled but the best part is they do not even fit the queen bed. I bought the ones with deep pockets. Also, they came out of the dryer very rough to the touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilling after One Wash","review":"Quite simply, sheets began significant pilling after only one wash. Thank goodness Amazon accepts returns. Not sure if we just got a defective set or what, but they were awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!!!","review":"I usually have great success with the products I purchase through Amazon. This product was an extreme disappointment. I washed these sheets exactly as recommended and I could barely stretch the fitted sheet across my mattress. If they shrink anymore in future washings, they will not fit at all. Unfortunately, I washed both sets that I purchased before I tried one set on the bed. I will now have to purchase sheets again very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THESE SHEETS","review":"I love these sheets. I am one of those people who like a sheet on the heaver side. I like to have all the blankets on me when I go to sleep but in the end I kick the blankets off and end up with just the sheet.I chose the cafe color because I am changing my room to brown and thought that the lighter color would go better with the brown comforter, and it does. But when I opened the box the color is a little orangie. It does not really look gold or yellow it is something else. Now I have say that the color has grown on me. At first I thought OMG what color is this but it does go good with brown.Also for people who have pets, these sheets do not collect dog/cat hair that some of the other sheets do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright, but awful color - not like what is shown on image!","review":"The sheets themselves are ok, (not that soft for 600, but not falling apart). The color however was not at all what I was expecting. I ordered the \\"cafe\\" color expecting brown, however the color of the sheets that came in packaging marked as \\"cafe\\" was an awful deep goldish-tan, not at all brown. Very colorful, but not in a good way (at least not when you are expecting something brown) and not in the way the sheets were advertised at all. I don't know if they screwed up and gave me the \\"honey\\" color, but the color was very dark - so when looking at the picture look at the top pillowcases - not the sheets below that seem to be more pale in the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well-made","review":"Although I rather liked the stiff quality of the sheets - reminded me of sheets that have been hung to dry outside - my fitted sheet ripped at two of the corner seams within about three washings. No, I don't have all that deep a mattress and no, I didn't pull all that hard on the corners. They just aren't very durable. I have another pair from Costco - same thread count - and they're much better made."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED!","review":"Don't be like me, READ the Reviews on this item!

After one wash (and I do mean O-N-E), the glossy finish was gone and I was left with nothing short of card board. It's extremely dissapointing b/c I opened the package and felt the smooth, cool to the touch, softness of the material and was really excited to put them on. But now they're so stiff, cheap walmart sheets feel like silk in comparison. Sadly, some of you might still give these sheets the benefit of doubt with all the good reviews it's got going for it. I just hope you have softer water than me, cause my sheets are unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"These sheets are nothing special. I have bought the same thing at a local odd-lot store. The color is completely misrepresented in the Amazon color swatch. I thought the TEAL was so pretty that I couldn't wait to get them. I had to wait three weeks and when they arrived the color was a faded GREY-GREEN (Sage Green) and not TEAL at all. Too heavy to send back. The sheets are thin and soft, 600 thread count is meaningless. They must just make the threads smaller to fit 600 in a square inch. Save your money and buy from a real store where you can see and feel them before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulletproof","review":"These are the most versitile sheets on the market. They are bulletproof, rough and can be used for collecting leaves in the yard, painting drop cloth, and other heavy industrial uses. I can imagine wet they could cut through steel too. Also sandpaper, 100 grit or emery paper to sand down pipes or deburr copper pipesYou can sleep on them too, and if someone tries to shoot you while you sleep these sheets will probably stop a .45 round at close range. Soft? Hell no, we don't need soft. These sheets are so hard they probably will be used to line hulls of the new battleships.Get the picture?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly soft out of the package, sandpaper after washing.","review":"The sheets were soft straight out of the package and I decided to follow the washing instructions. The end result was an extremely rough set of sheets that were horribly stiff. My previous set of sheets was a cheap 200tc set from Walmart (yeah, Walmart...) until I could get decent sheets for my new bed and they were way softer than these sheets. Terrible, terrible sheets. Steer clear of these. I thought with 500 reviews and 4/5 stars they couldn't be that bad. I was wrong. I still have the unwashed pillowcases and the difference between the two is like night and day. They also say sateen... but they sure as heck don't look/feel like it.I wouldn't recommend these sheets to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth","review":"I fell in love with my sheets the moment that I touched them....I will only be buying Renaissance Sateen type sheets in the future!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sheets, HORRIBLE COLOR!","review":"Very soft and overall great for the money, but after two returns with different colors, what you get is NOTHING like the color advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheets","review":"These sheets are amazing. I don't mean to cut them short by any means, but the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5 is due to not washing them yet. I just moved and they have been in packaging . I took them out felt them,judged them according to color (they match very nicely and were just what I was looking for) They are extremely soft and have a silky feel. I am not sure they are as strong as the Damask Pinson sheet set I had purchased before, but that is just going by the feel of them. They have more thread count and that's where the softness comes in.I love them and am more than satisfied, by feel,look,price, and above all comfort level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheet Set","review":"This purchase is disappointing.

First off when I got these sheets they were great...had that nice thick 600 thread feeling. These sheets were purchased so I could trade out my other ones for these ones in case I didn't have time to get washed and put on immediately.After about 8-10x washing I noticed a piling up of the fabric! This was very frustrating cause I know that 600 Thread count sheets shouldn't do that! I cannot stand feeling that piling of the fabric while sleeping.So please take as a helpful hint because I wish I had listened to other peoples similar reviews. I just passed by thinking what a great Deal being only $50 (which I noticed now they are $60!) and reading other peoples great reviews. (which I think they did the review right when they got the sheets and not after some washing)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!!!!!!!","review":"These sheets are not what they promised.

I washed them, according to package instructions, and was prepared for a good night sleep. To my dismay, the sheets were not comfortable. I like my sheet's soft. I tossed all night. I noticed some of the previous reviews stated the sheets were a little on the thick side,but I thought it wouldn't be a problem for me. I was wrong. Last year I ordered sheets from Amazon(Pinzon 500 thread count egyptian Sateen) and I loved them!! They are my favorite set. I've been waiting on the chocolate color Pinzon sheets to go on sale (currently it's over $100 dollars!) but I got tired of waiting and decided to try this set instead. I should have waited. Save your money, buy the Pinzon sheets. You won't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sheets for the $39.99 Price","review":"I bought these sheets for $39, during a DOTD sale, and I've very pleased with them. They are slightly rougher, as a previous reviewer mentioned, but with some washings, they should be fine. And yes, they do get wrinkly, but I am not a wrinkle freak, and not expecting Martha Stuart to drop by to do a random sheet inspection, so doesn't bother me :) Overall, very good deal on some great sheets!

The competitors couldn't do a better price even with a 20 percent off coupon code. Bonus... Amazon gives free shipping! Item arrived way sooner than quoted arrival date. As far as the product, when I was pulling the sheets out of the package I was like, \\"wow these are the best feeling sheets I have ever touched and I can not wait to get them on my bed\\". These sheets have deep pockets and fit my mattress that is 18 inches deep. I bought the cafe' color because of its neutral versatility. I would recommend this set highly and am planning on getting another.

Came out extremely wrinkled. Numerous small wrinkles that seem set in. Fabric is stiff and rustles audibly. Top sheet is too narrow. Have washed it several times since with fabric softener. No real help. The set will be put away and saved for emergencies. Very displeased. It seems that products like this are supplied by various factories from various countries with little attempt at consistent quality control. Well, the set was inexpensive, but really not a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"White sheets - great quality at a good price","review":"The fitted queen bottom sheet is very roomy being able to accommodate a pillow-top mattress PLUS a 2 inch foam topper, with room to spare.

Will update my review after actually sleeping on them and washing them.UPDATE: Wish I could say these lovely sheets held up to the first washing well; they did not. After following the care and washing instructions to the letter, alas, these sheets not only shrunk a little, but they did not retain their softness. I could barely cover both sides of my bed and the top sheet - don't ask; way short on both sides where I had to put it on unevenly to be in \\"synch\\" with my comforter, thereby leaving one side maybe three inches off the top of the bed.

They are very rough and scratchy. My husband calls them the sandpaper sheets. After only two washes (as per instructions), the color was running out in huge patches, and continues to get worse each wash. Fresh out of the dryer they are incredibly wrinkled and seem to pick up ever piece of residual lint. In short, they are uncomfortable and look terrible.

I read a few other reviews saying this...my sheet set was ivory, perhaps the white doesn't pill?? I was very careful to wash according to the instructions on the label! Now after the 4th wash these sheets feel like sand paper and will have to be replaced soon. My previous sheet set lasted for 6 years without any pilling, this manufacturing is sub-par.

My fault for not reading the reviews before I bought them! I have washed them about 10 times to try and get some of the stiffness out of them and they are like a board still. Tried the fabric softener trick too and it didn't help at all. Tried to send them back after 30 days (of washing and hoping that they would get better) and got the fabulous Amazon message that they would give me 50% of my money back! Guess I should not have kept hoping they would get less stiff. I am not kidding, sandpaper is more comfortable to sleep on. We took them off in the middle of the night they were so bad!

Additionally, although I ordered Queen size sheets and do not have an overly thick mattress, it almost took an act of Congress to get the final corner onto the mattress. I can tell just by this first experience that they aren't sized properly, and that after a few uses, the elastic is going to be complete stretched out. Do yourself a favor and don't buy these.

My husband had already thrown the packaging material away so I tried to use a spot remover product before washing them. The grease (magic marker?) spots did not come out and they are so wrinkled after washing that I will have to iron them.

I ordered the ivory queen-size sheet set and what I received (though it says ivory on the package) is more like beige or tan. My understanding has always been that ivory is off-white but this is at least 2-3 shades darker than that. I'll be sending these back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not soft","review":"These sheets are not soft. They are grainy feeling. I have washed them with lots of softener and that did not help.

The sheets are nice and thick, and it gives them a bit of a 'crispness' which I really like.

I expect them to last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are really small","review":"I love the look and feel of these sheets, they are of great quality. They are not, however, large enough to fit on a queen size mattress. I would have returned them, but I am a single guy, and I thought maybe after a wash or two they would stop bending my mattress so I threw the packaging away. It's probably my fault for not returning them immediately, but I would buy them again if they actually fit because I love the way they feel. If you buy them hang on to the packaging and do not hesitate to send them back if they don't fit immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Soft, Cheap Feeling, And Received Sheets with Large Hole in the Middle Of Sheets","review":"The title says it all in a concise manner. Sateen sheets are intended to be soft to the touch and are very dissimilar to the sateen sheets my friend purchased in a bedding store. After feeling the coarse rough-feeling nature I quickly noticed a large 3cm x 3cm (large) hole in the middle of the main bedding sheet through it's folded portion - meaning numerous large holes in different areas.Although there are many products I purchase on Amazon that are worth their price, these are no more impressive than most of the 400-thread cotton sheets I considered purchasing in the store. Perhaps, these sheets are vastly more comfortable to the touch after washing, but they certainly are not a bargain for the quality upon initial opinion.I hope your purchase experience was/is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Soft","review":"These sheets are fabulous, very soft, even after washing.

I would definitely buy more of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Quality!","review":"I had high hopes for these sheets as they were 600 thread count for a good price - I guess you get what you pay for! I owned them for only a week and very quickly returned them to Amazon - after they were washed I could not get the wrinkles out - I followed the recommendations and even ironed them - all to no avail. I would highly suggest that you do not waste your time or money buying them unless you like the wrinkled, dishevelled look. I would give these sheets no stars if I could!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented! Thoroughly disappointed!","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed in both the sheets and Amazon. Firstly, these sheets are NOT 100% cotton; they are in fact 55% cotton and 45% polyester. Secondly, Amazon clearly has not done sufficient quality control to catch the misrepresentation. I might have gotten past the fact that they aren't 100% cotton because they felt so nice coming out of the packaging, but once washed, they had lost a lot of their softness and no longer seemed appealing at all.

Yes, they are well made and fit my King nicely. However, to me, \\"Sateen\\" means soft and silky sheets, especially with a 600 thread count.

Plus, when I was making the bed, not just one but TWO corners ripped on the fitted sheet.Fortunately, when I ordered this sheet set, I also ordered some extra pillowcases fromMagnolia Organics 550 Thread Count Organic Cotton Sheet Set (Queen, White).

I have the luxurious, wonderful, thick, soft, and smooth bed linens I've always wanted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blue Note Classic","review":"If I could only have only one music available for listening it would be jazz music. There is an elite collection of jazz songs that really stand out. Just to name a few: Herbie Hancock's \\"Maiden Voyage,\\" and \\"Speak Like a Child,\\" Lee Morgan's \\"The Sidewinder,\\" Miles Davis' \\"All Blues.\\" I might get an argument or two, but Fancy Free ranks right up there. \\"The Uptowner\\" is my other favorite from this disc. \\"I Love the Girl\\" is a step off the pace but still makes for good listening. It just doesn't make the cut when it comes to getting copied into my \\"iTunes\\" library. Overall a very solid disc well worth a twenty dollar bill but probably not $40+."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed...","review":"If you were a fan of Umphrey's McGee on Anchor Drops, then don't buy this CD! I was thoroughly disappointed. UM has substituted their unbelievable songwriting and musicianship skills for writing, compared to Anchor Drops, bland pop songs. Granted, compared to the rest of the pop and pop/rock out today, it is great, but compared to their old material, it is very watered down. There are a couple of good songs, and each musician throws out a few impressive licks, but, overall, I was very disappointed and hope that Umphrey's decides to go back to what they do best...making good music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid album","review":"I own all three of Umphreys studio releases and this album is slightly different than the first two but it is still very good. Not all the songs are of the fast shredding type but it doesnt really matter. If you like Umphreys than you should without a doubt like this album. Songs like Believe the Lie and Words have a very epic feel to them and are very well written. Nemo is a great intense jam as well. I would advise you to ignore Tom Saleh's review because he really does not seem to know what he is talking about. If you like CD's that you can put in and just let play than this is perfect. I listened to this CD over and over when I got it and enjoyed it everytime. Oh and one more thing, there is something special about the last song on the album as well. I realize that its a simplistic acoustic song but it is very good. In closing, if you like Umphreys then buy the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job Boys","review":"WOw! What an amazing album. I just love how these guys have continued to evolve and have not just attempted to recreate another ANchor Drops. Incredible songs, great production. My personal favorites are Passing, Intentions Clear and Nemo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, wow, wow","review":"I heard Umphrey's for the first time about a year ago when a friend let me listen to Anchor Drops. I immidiately bought the album and have been listening to them ever since. Before purchasing this album, I wasn't too sure what to expect. I have heard multiple live performances and everyone shows a new side of the band. This album brings the best together. You can hear some of the same sounds as \\"Plunger,\\" \\"Tinkle's Overture,\\" and \\"The Pequod\\" throughout this album as well as even more. The lyrics continue to be amazing and the guitars are of course outstanding. There also is more acoustic guitar incorporated into this album which adds a lot. \\"Nemo\\" \\"Words\\" \\"Rocker\\" \\"The Weight Around\\" and \\"believe the lie\\" are among my favorites. But don't get me wrong, every song is incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saftey In Numbers","review":"I've been a fan of Umphrey's for quite a while. I enjoy \\"jam bands\\" and I've always considered them among the genre's elite. However many such jam bands issue studio albums just to have a basis for extending them ad infinitum at their live shows.This is definitely not true of Saftey In Numbers. This group has grown into more than just jamming on a four chord structure. Their songs are now arranged and flow with different textures. The planning and work that was put in before recording is evident here. If you liked Umphrey's before you still will, but this cd might just lift you above the ad-lib excesses of the free wheeling live band into something more substantial and thought out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright! Great like Pat Martino, Sonny Sharrock, and Crisom,","review":"Boom is the first band I have heard where a guitar god subordinates his outrageous chops for the overall good of the band.

Otherwise seemed OK, but not useful for me so I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with Auto-dimmer","review":"Although I like this clock, there is a defect with auto-dimming feature, which gradually causes it to dim completely at night. I've returned and bought 3 different times and they all have this problem. Also, if alarm sounds and no one is home, it will continue to beep forever.I do like the big buttons and the big display."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible reception","review":"I bought this clock radio for the large display (nice) and supposedly good reception. The reception is awful, and I cannot tune into two of my favorite stations, which my husband is able to get on his bedside radio. I have tried everything: moving the radio, placing it on a stack of books, gentley moving the tuner. Nothing works. I do not recommend this radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"This alarm made me late for work today","review":"The reason I'm looking at alarm clocks today is because this one let me down. I've had it for 4 years, and it stopped working today. I set my alarm, and it just didn't go off. I checked, rechecked - no, it's not set to PM instead of AM - it's a faulty clock. Very strange.The 'forward' time set button stopped working two weeks ago - now it can only be set in reverse. \\"Not a big deal,\\" I thought, \\"as long as the alarm still works.\\"I've grown to assume that consumer electronics have a finite lifespan, so this was really no surprise. Then I mentioned it to a co-worker, and he said he's had the same alarm clock since 1988. My parents have had the same alarm clock since 1981.Anyway, if you want to buy an alarm clock every 4 years, this should be your top choice. If not, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Clock-Radio ever, just wish they still made it.","review":"The only problem I have is that some time after I bought it, the automatic brightness control started dimming the display out completely in a pitch black room (and too much in a not-quite-black room, as well), rendering this nice-to-have feature useless.Otherwise, I still like and use it every day. Extremely useful are the nap timer (I wish it could be set for more than 2 hours though), and the adjustable snooze timer, which can be set from 1 to 30 minutes.I wish they still made it so I could get a back-up, and maybe a working auto-dimmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this clock","review":"Another dissatisfied customer. The auto-dimmer fades out completely at night and the regular display is so bright that it wakes me up at night. Also while the gradual volume increase on the alarm feature technically works, it starts off pretty load to begin with, jarring me out of sleep. Looks like I need to find a new alarm clock..."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinks","review":"The dimmer problem identified by other reviewer is a real problem, but the REAL problem is the arrangement of buttons on the top of the clock ... the OFF button is just to the left of the SNOOZE bar and both are pushbuttons (different sizes, but same type of mechanism), meaning it is far to easy too actually shut the alarm off rather than getting a 9 minute reprieve. This is a horrible design - and the designer ought to be fired. I've actually been assigned the task (by the wife) to go get a new clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Features... but didn't last a year","review":"Bought it because of the dual alarm and auto dimmer features which worked well. Overall, the radio not very intuitive to operate. Now I am digging out the warranty policy for a problem with the radio... IT WON'T TURN OFF!! It came on in the middle of the day and the hitting the \\"OFF\\" button will not turn it off. Even tried unplugging the unit all day and the radio was still on after plugging it back in. I'm quite sure that it has only been 11 months since it was purchased, I will try to find my receipt. Is it worth it to ship it back for a replacement? We will see how GE handles it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating links between Niccol's past and his future.","review":"It becomes increasingly clear in this, the seventh novel about Niccolo, that the focus of this whole saga shows deep interrelation with the author's earlier \\"lymond\\" series. In fact, Lymond's mother, Sybilla Semple, is clearly a 'St. Pol' and shares the same coloring as both Niccolo's father, Simon and Niccolo's elder son, Henry. If this all sounds as though the author, Dorothy Dunnett, can weave her spell around you-it's true. Her world is so vividly realized, yet the basic 'detective' element at the core of it (not for nothing has Dunnett also written some first-rate thrillers) will keep you on the edge of your seat, waiting for the next installment. Fabulous in every way; a little melodramatic in spots, but meticulously researched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody beats Dunnett, and C&R is no exception!","review":"This continuation of the Niccolo series is every bit as good as the earlier volumes.

These essays capture and explain to the English reader the hopes, values and experiences of actual Brazilians.

These \\"Board Books\\" illustrate very effectively why there was only one Dr. Seuss -- basically, the modifications that have been made to the stories make them much less compelling and educational. In particular, the rhyming is never as good, and the meter is non-existent. I will grant that the \\"Board Book\\" style is much more durable, as our child has torn a number of the classic Mr. Brown pages.

A childs library isn't complete without these wonderful books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New book with Marker on the front!!?!?","review":"First let me start by saying I love this story, I specifically went out of my way to find it for my son. The story its self deserves a 5 star rating but how in the world did I end up with a new never opened book with Marker on the front of it. Its green and I am very upset with this. I will update my review if this is rectified but right now I am NOT HAPPY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tongue twister!","review":"I really like to read this book to my little one - he just loves all the sounds it makes and it's a challenge for the adult to get all those sounds out to enhance the story. I think some of these books are written for the adults to have fun as well and this one is no exception. My little one has fun trying to make all the sounds with me and it just makes for a very good and memorable time. Don't pass this one by, it's a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I started reading this book to my baby as a newborn and she is now 8 months old and loves it! I simply have to recite the words ( which I've memorized) and she just lights up. It's a great book for a small child."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLEADING","review":"I ordered several of these thinking I was getting a great deal. SO disappointed when they came as TINY, ABRIDGED versions of the real Dr. Seuss stories. These should be labeled better! I shouldn't have to sort through 100 reviews to realized they're not what they appear to be. We bought 4, paying almost $20 plus shipping, but only got $9 back after paying return shipping costs. Biggest rip-off ever! If I had wanted books to put in my diaper bag- these would have been great. But as it is, I just feel swindled. Amazon- PLEASE clearly indicate that these are not the original Dr. Seuss books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the original; not the board book","review":"The board book version is a watered down mishmash of the original. All the fun of Dr. Suess's original rhymes and rhythms is lost making this nothing more than an expensive chew toy for your infant. Buy the original and keep some scotch tape handy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insect disease & Weed","review":"/this book was also purchased for my sister who lives in Missouri.

I have tried scrubbing with Ajax, Barkeeper's Friend, soap scum removers, and straight liquid bleach and my shower still looks filthy. I think I would have been better off just giving him regular wax crayons. Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased only because there's nothing better","review":"I've read the reviews for a few different bathtub crayons and really would have liked to bought the endangered species crayons which are one entire crayon and triangular and easy to hang on to. However, in multiple reviews for that product it was stated that those fall part after the first bath. So, I opted for these instead. And they are useful for multiple baths but it should be known that they break easily and the crayon, which is only about 1/4 the size of an actual crayon, falls out of the cheap plastic holder."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!","review":"Idea is great...writes/draws well...but is ABSURDLY hard to clean!!! It just smears and smears...its like trying to clean wax with water....doesn't work! It will come off after you SCRUB, and I mean SCRUB the tub. But come on....that is ridiculous. Very disappointed. I'm sticking with the markers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The crayon is in a plastic tube, which makes it seem more durable, but my 20-month old son quickly figured out how to raise and lower the crayon, then would try to write on the tub and the crayon would immediately break. He'd raise it higher and it'd break again. They lasted through 2 baths. The crayon is way too soft and it's too easy to raise and lower the crayon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wont Last.","review":"I can see this toy works and my son does love it. I just do not think it will last. He has had it for 3 days (so 3 bath times) and they are already 1/4 of the way used. Yes my son is 2 1/2 but he colors \\"nicely\\" with regular crayons and so I am assuming he also does with these. But Just does not seem like they will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"There is very little crayon to these. They are mostly plastic holder (which is useless once the crayon is gone though I suppose you could use them for real crayons since they are the same size)! They also disintegrate too easily in water and fall out of the plastic holders quite easily as well as get pushed back. Some of the colors work better than others but overall they give good color.When my little brother was a kid, we had Crayola bath crayons and they were big fat ones with no plastic holder. I didn't realize upon buying these that they would be the way they are. I expected more from Crayola than this! Very disappointed in this product!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stains!","review":"Every tub I used this in stained the tub for quite a while afterwards. I love the idea but hate the cleanup. I used it in 4 tubs and when my son got it in the grout forget it... the cleanup took forever! These went right in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to remove from the tub","review":"I had a hard time removing this from the tub and had to use a Magic Eraser sponge and then Soft Scrub with bleach. Our tub is about 15 years old but I didn't expect that to be considered an 'older tub' like the warning says. I don't want to worry about bath crayons staining the tub or anything else (like clothes or towels). Also, if the crayon sits in the water (like while your child is using another crayon) it will disintegrate a bit.I would prefer bath crayons that are made from soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not sturdy enough","review":"We got these crayons to replace the Alex brand that our little guy liked. We thought we would try Crayola because the Alex brand fell apart before they were used up. Unfortunately, the Crayola are worse for this. They are thinner and crumble easier with less pressure. The casing is an issue as well because the ends have a square hole at the bottom that our son would shove the top of another crayon in, thus trapping the tip and grinding it into crumbs. The Alex brand do not have this design flaw either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gooey","review":"We have tried 2 different versions of crayola bathtub crayons, and while this one lasts longer on the tub, IT LASTS LONGER ON THE TUB. We had to scrub to get it off, and even resorted to a magic eraser to get it off. The 'cheaper' version washes off with water and hand rubbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disintegrates","review":"Cool idea. Horrible execution.The crayons are super soft, hence the plastic tube used to support them. But they fall out of the tube and disintegrate into useless mess.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy again","review":"We're usually pretty happy with Crayola products, but don't waste your money on these crayons. On first use, several of the crayons fell out of their plastic holders. The crayons are also super-soft and if they're under water too long, they basically disintegrate and crumble (wouldn't be a problem, maybe, if they didn't keep falling out of their holders!). Clean up has not been an issue as I've not had the problem with them staining my tub that others have reported."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously I'm reviewing crayons!","review":"I came to Amazon to look to replace my current tub crayons; these ones. They are a smaller skinny crayon inside of a round plastic holder. I don't like that they fall out of the holders easily and the wax part itself is too easily forced back into the outer tube and this obviously frustrates my kids. The part that frustrates me the most is that the inside wax part is so thin that it easily goes down my tub drain and gets stuck. I just completed a surgical procedure on the drain to get it to flow again. Other than that, they clean off well enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i expected","review":"I was super excited to get these bath crayons for my daughter. She loves to color and she loves to bath. It was the perfect combination. She LOVED them. Entertained her so much! BUT i hate them. They are washable and wash right out but they leave the water dark. When I drained her bathtub the first time there was a black line where the water level was. It wouldn't just wash off. I had to get my AJAX bleach and scrub the crap out of it to get rid of the black line. Everytime she uses them it's a process to get the tub white again. Other then that she loves them and they last okay. I wouldn't recommend them unless you really REALLY love to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Bath Toy","review":"These contain only about 1 1/2 inches of crayon. The rest is the holder. They work fine, and wash off easily, but be aware that they also break very easily. I've tried several brands of bath crayons, and had the breakage issue with all of them. These are as good as it gets. Kids seem to love being allowed to mark on the walls.

When I went to remove them from the walls around the tub, the crayons came off the tile okay but only came off the grout with a serious combination of elbow grease, bleach-based cleaner, and time. Grout is definitely stained and not sure whether more scrubbing will take the stains off. I would definitely prefer crayons that were made of soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"WILL NOT WASH OFF PORCELAIN!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!","review":"My 5 year old loves to draw, so we were so excited to get these bathtub crayons. The first night he used them, he drew on the tiles on the wall around the bathtub. After his bath I went to remove the crayon from the tiles, and it was not easy, it took a lot of elbow grease. Tonight, he drew under the water on the porcelain tub itself, AND IT WILL NOT COME OFF. First I tried spraying Clorox Green Works and rubbing it with a rag. That had no effect, so I tried spraying it with Krud Kutter and scrubbing it with a large scouring tool. IT STILL WON\\"T COME OFF!!!!! In the morning I'm going to have to contact Crayola and see if they can think of something to get this off our bathtub. But these \\"bathtub\\" crayons are going in the trash and I will never buy them again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hard to Clean Up","review":"My grandson loves these crayons, but I won't buy them again. They are really hard to clean off the tub. I needed to use cleanser to get the crayon off. Get the tub markers instead - they just rinse off when you are done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!!!!","review":"This product is just bad. Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad. Most specifically, the soles are really thin, cheaply made, and horrible. I switched from my Osiris shoes to these because almost a year of skating had taken its toll on my old shoes. I ollied down some stairs that were never a problem before. I have done it at least 100 times before in this same spot, but when I landed it this time I ended up severely bruising the bone on the bottom of my foot. Now I can barely walk. When walking you can feel every little bump on the pavement. Its like there's nothing more than a Dr. Scholl's pad between your foot and the ground.

Might have been quite an interesting work if it hadn't taken the by now utterly tired \\"it's an elitist institution of my god I hate it\\" track. Everyone knows that modernism is polemical and complex. This makes it extraordinarily interesting and exciting, but like every other form of modernism, its complexity opens it up to the rage of the slaves who scream the empty phrase \\"elitist\\" while failing to evaluate judicially the object under consideration (here a state funded institute for new music and musical research). One can only consider this work: a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"First toilet seat we've ever had that broke in two","review":"We purchased this item new a year ago to match a Kohler commode in our home. After a year of normal use the seat split in two. We are average weight and put no more stress than would be considered normal on the seat. In addition, the chrome on the hinges began to peel off after about 9 months. We called Kohler expecting that, as a company that manufactures and sells premium priced fixtures, they would stand behind their product. They did not. We were told that they only warrant their product for 90 days. Definately not worth the premium price."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A LIVE SET!","review":"Personally, I think Alice Cooper's live recordings are even better than his studio ones. It was a great selection songs, and they were performed excellently. Sammy Hagar and Slash's guest guitars, and Rob Zombie's guest vocals didn't hurt either. Rob Zombie and Alice Cooper's vocals fit together perfectly. This is a must-have for any Alice Cooper fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a worthless album.","review":"I am an Alice connoisseur, I've heard all his recordings, even his early '80's imports. A Fistful of Alice is worse than the imports, I can handle them. This is for the non-Alice fans that think he put out his best music in the late '80's. If one wishes to hear the real Alice live, I suggest they buy The Alice Cooper Show 1971. If one wishes to hear \\"heavy metal Alice\\" with other \\"stars\\" from the eighties, I suppose this would be the album. I gave it one star because that is as low as they let me go. I give it Zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live Alice","review":"This album is just plain fun. Whether you're a devoted fan of Alice Cooper or just a casual one, you should enjoy these fine live versions of some of his best songs.True, \\"Fistful Of Alice\\" is too short, missing out on such classics as \\"Under My Wheels\\" and \\"No More Mr Nice Guy\\", but it's also very reasonably priced, and it's hard to fault what is here: Tight, focused live renditions of \\"School's Out\\", \\"I'm Eighteen\\", \\"Elected\\", \\"Poison\\", \\"Lost In America\\" and many more. The sound is very good, and unlike some hard rock albums, the band is gritty but restrained and they don't resort to long, pointless and eventually tedious instrumental breaks or wild solos.Alice Cooper's vocals are raw and powerful, and he has never sounded better. This is great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legendary Rocker Kicks @SS!","review":"First of all, Dave from Indie can't be that much of a 'connoisseur' if he thinks Alice's 80's music is all 'imports'...I have them ALL on vinyl...some gathering dust as 8-tracks! >:-) also The Aice Cooper Show is mid 70's, between Lace and Whiskey and Goes to Hell...in other words, I wouldn't go by Dave's review. However, if you want Alice live and at his best check out this recording...even Alice likes this better than the Alice Cooper Show, which he thought sounded terrible (I still liked it)...maybe it was because he wasn't too sober then? Anyway, true Alice fans will want this, and so will anyone else that wants to hear how real rock is done...and if you want to 'SEE' Alice live...check out The Nihtmare Returns on video, it's incedible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guide to Mla Documentation","review":"Textbook was in better condition than described.

He was literally strip-searched in front of both the mayor and governer of New York of his time to show the brusies and injuries on his person which were NOT THERE. Also to think about, Buster's father, Joe Keaton, was mostly angered by the fact that the social group going after their stage act, didn't protect or help the homeless and penniless children of 1910s New York and instead went after Buster who had both parents, friends, a steady job, and thought the roughhousing was a lot of fun.

Read Lindbeck!","review":"Vanhoozer tries to appropriate George Lindbeck's cultural-linguistic approach for biblicists via what he calls a \\"canonical-linguistic\\" approach. Basically, he claims the Bible has a logic of usage and thus a system of habituating consistent meanings internal to itself, before it is socialized into ecclesial life. Historically this is highly problematic, given that the Bible's content and orthodox meaning were determined by the Church over several centuries (50AD-400ish, if not later). If you don't believe that last sentence then you will probably love Vanhoozer's book. If you're looking for something a bit more intellectually satisfying then you should probably skip Vanhoozer's qualifications of Lindbeck and go read Lindbeck's \\"The Nature of Doctrine\\" yourself. On the plus side, Vanhoozer displays more or less sophisticated dealings with many post-modern theorists that do not get dealt with by many of Vanhoozer's colleagues, and that should be applauded."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!

The fierce familial relationships--especially between father and son--are riveting and understandable.

It is also dense, so my already very soft voice barely moves the meter when I speak through it.

Of course, it's not nearly as excellent as Newman and Jone's earlier Horror; the 100 Best books, but it towers above most other readers guides covering this genre. I would even call it essential, just because there are so few guides of this quality. It's particularly good at listing the better anthologies. Each book has an essay written by a practicioner of the horror genre, and as you can guess, the essays and choices vary greatly in quality. It skews somewhat to the literary and semi-obscure.

Dr. Dyer spells out his instructions for modeling good behavior in a way that is easy to understand and follow. There is a wealth of information in this book and I definitely refer to it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all parents...","review":"Until I read this book, I was unaware of how much influence I as a parent make on my child and how much influence my parents were on me. I think it is very helpful to understand why we are the way we are and how we can help our children to become the best they can be. There are a lot of things we just aren't aware of in life that influence our children and this book brings a lot of them to your attention. I am doing a lot of things correct in raising my child, but I also have a lot to learn. This book is terrific! I highly suggest it to parents of children of all ages (even those with adult children)!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"This CD clock radio is well set up with easy to use buttons and controls. It's too bad it is so poorly built. The CD alarm feature stopped working in less than a month. The CD player is very noisy and makes scraping noises. The unit is well designed but is very disappointing from a quality standpoint. It makes me wonder about all RCA products now. It certainly makes me wonder why RCA would put such a poor quality product on the market. Apparently, they have little concern for quality. Don't let the nice appearance of the product fool you. It is not worth your hard earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"great clock radio but bad CD player","review":"this thing had all the features I was looking for, but after using the cd player I noticed that a significant portion of my CDs would start scraping against the plastic sides due to poor design. while it didn't damage the CDs, it was quite irritating to hear that scraping noise. the sound isn't very good either, but that's to be expected of clock radio cd players."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've enjoyed it!","review":"Don't know what all the complaining is about. I've had mine about a year and have never had a problem with it. Maybe I'm just lucky-but it's still fully functional, including the cd player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake up to disappointment","review":"Do not buy this if you are planning to wake up to CDs or play CDs in your bedroom. It must be made with cheap optics because every CD plays as if it is scratched. All other functions work fine, but for the price, it should play flawlessly. Also, it is difficult to tune stations with the analog tuner. Your money is better spent on another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Annoying Way to Wake Up","review":"I've had this clock for about a year, and wonder why I haven't thrown it into a wall yet - or better yet, into the trash. Initially it worked as it was supposed to. Then, after a few months, it decided it would only play a certain few of my CDs. I thought I could live with that. Wrong. Now it plays the first track on the CD as it's supposed to, but after that, only whirrs and grinds futilely as it tries in vain to find a next random track to play. But it is NOT set on Random Play. It should simply play the next track on the CD, not seek a random track. If you want to be awakened by constant annoying, electronic buzzing and grinding, then this is the clock for you. Too bad the Amazon review system requires that I give this at least one star. I'd rather give it none. I think I'll go toss mine in the trash right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Radio/Alarm, with some defects","review":"My Mom and Dad bought this radio for their bedroom.When we first got it, it worked great!But, sometimes, the CD Player won't even play, or will play some tracks, and not others.

However the one thing that I despised was when I'd hit snooze it would flash the track"},{"rating":"2","title":"good value","review":"We went looking for a new clock radio when the one we had for about 15 years died. We looked at everything they had at Target,read the reviews and decided to try the RCA because we wanted one with a CD. We're really pleased. All components work well, no problems with the CD (as some have reported). Adjustable snooze is great. My only gripe is that the numbers are very bright, even with the dimmer on, it's so bright that we turn it so that it's not shining right in our faces! All in all, a very good buy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the NAP function? Did you find it?","review":"I'm a bit lost with this clock. I bought it for the NAP feature as I loved the one on my previous clock. Low and behold, the manual does not even mention the feature, let alone how to set it. The box has the NAP function shown on the front, the RCA website shows the NAP function in the specs sheet, but the online manual is missing those instructions.

It has a really bad amp obviously.I took the first one back and got another one to make sure it was just not this one that buzzed, and the new one not only buzzed, but it would not read my burned CD's.On the plus side, it is one of the few CD Stereo clock radio's that has a dimmer switch on the LED's, so you won't be making hand puppets on the wall from the display."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth diminishing the RCA name","review":"We have owned two of these clock radios. The first one broke within 30 days of owning it (CD just stopped working). We got a replacement, and that one broke within a few months. ...

Not so! Before buying this item a year ago I scoured Amazon.com for reviews and for the most part they all had the same problem - a warning of a soon-to-be non-functioning CD player. It's true! I have only used it perhaps 6 times and now it refuses to play any and all CDs. I ignored all those reviews and now I've paid the (high) price. Don't waste your money. It's back to my old Panasonic dual alarm clock radio for me. Please trust me. I should have believed all the reviews!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for in a space saver-perspective needed","review":"I read all of the reviews and there is some basis for complaint. I did not expect this thing to play as well as a more expensive model. There are a few functions like the wake to a CD that may not be that good but I wake to the alarm and the radio. The CD is not meant to be the main player for a person. I think they intended it to be just something you listen to for a couple hours a day at the most. I knew this would not have amazing sound quality but it is among the best for its price. If you are looking for a decent, space-saving, dual alarm clock with a CD/radio, this is a nice option. If you want a more sophisticated model, add a little more to the price and add onto the size a bit. For me, I needed a compact model that played a CD. This is just fine for what I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Design Poor Quality","review":"I like this product features and design. It is filled with great features like dual alarm, graduated alarm, the ability to wake up with it playing a CD, dual brightness settings for the time. When I first got it, I rated it 5 stars. The problem is that if get this product don't expect it to be fully functional for very long. The first thing that will break will be the CD player and then you will gradually lose all functionality. If you want an alarm clock that will last for several years, do not by this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"nikon 140 is a \\"not ready to take picture camera too\\")","review":"I recently looked through your comments and decided on a Nikon despite the one comment about it being not ready to take shots. So, I got the Nikon 140 (very similar to the 120). I agree completely with the person who wrote about the 120 missing all of his shots. I tried the 140 at a graduation. I missed so many shots cause it couldn't focus. Another complaint - even when it did focus, the shutter delay was so extreme that the kid had left the podium before the shot was taken. I got lots of pictures of kids walking away from the podium. I'm going to look at the Pentax the other reviewer mentioned and the Minolta 150. The Nikon is going back to the store ASAP. I haven't even seen the pictures it takes but was so frustrated using it that I really don't even care how they turned out. I missed almost every shot I tried for anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!","review":"I got this camera as a gift after my fuji discovery was stolen last year. I was expecting my second child and not in the mood to take pictures until she was born 6months later. Needless to say I should have taken pictures with this camera sooner, because it was too late to return it! The pictures are horrible! The camera does not focus fast enough to capture those split second funny faces a newborn makes... I am very dissappointed in this camera. All of my pictures are blurry and of nothing significant.

It's so slow you'll miss some of those priceless \\"don't miss\\" moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this camera expecting it to replace an olympus stylus epic zoom 80. The nikon had everything going for it: more zoom, a diopter adjustment for use without glasses, the nikon name, etc. After the first roll of film I discovered many of the pictures were very off center and I often had to press the button several times to get it to take a picture. I thought I could compensate for that with my 10+ years of hobby-photo experience, but after the second roll of film I realized it wasn't worth it. Even zoomed out it seemed that pictures were off center. Several times I missed the perfect picture because the camera didn't take the picture the first time I pressed the button. The graphic quality of the picture may be great but that doesn't make up for the off center composition and missed shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nikon-like Quality","review":"In spite of the ED glass lens, which is supposed to render superior colors, this camera is not any good. It seems unable to focus properly, except for when the infinity focus option is selected. Also, most shots from a couple of test rolls came out overexposed, even under unchallenging lighting conditions. Aesthetics and ergonomics are nice. Controls are intuitive and easy, but what good do they do on a camera that is otherwise useless? Yes, I know it is not an F4 but my advice is to look elsewhere. I thought I was going to replace my Olympus Stylus Epic. No way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget close ups!","review":"I purchased this camera on the recommendation of a camera store owner because of some special lens it supposedly has. It doesn't take any better pictures than other cameras I have owned and it is sooo difficult to get it to focus on anything! I had a baby recently and most of my early pictures of her are completely blurred because of this camera's inability to focus, especially close up. I'm going to return it and trade it for a Pentax which always takes close ups well. I agree with the shutter release delay everyone else is having a problem with also."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"lite touch\\" makes it difficult","review":"I had read some great reviews of this camera (on amazon)before I bought it, but now I see why the rating has changed from a 5star to a 3star.

Its fine if you dont need to use the flash, but most of the time you have to keep clicking and watching an internal light go from green to red green to red.

'Just Me' is arguably the tightest and most consistent Keith Sweat album since 'Get Up On It', all those years back. At a solid 12 tracks and zero distracting interludes, Keith has stayed true to himself by eschewing any gimmickry and cookie-cutter fare that passes for adult contemporary R&B on the airwaves these days. There's no room for filler on here. The Top 5 tracks (in no particular order) are 'What's A Man To Do', 'Love You Better' (feat. Keyshia Cole), 'Me And My Girl', 'Somebody' (feat. Chris \\"F.L.O.\\" Conner) and 'Sexiest Girl'. The rest of the album is made up of above-average songs and these make for enjoyable listening.

With the exception of a few radio hits/chart toppers here and there \\"I'll give all my love 2 u\\" - \\"There u go\\" - \\"Nobody\\" - \\"Make U Sweat\\" - he hasn't done anything else worth my attention.

I have not been able to listen to an entire song. His voice has changed dramatically and the producers just grabbed some beats off the back shelf and dusted them off.This album has received strong reviews.

I enjoyed Stuart's sense of humor and his ideas had a big impact on me. I ended up reading all of his books, and found most of the others to have empowering ideas, too. The only downside to his books is their lack of a spiritual feeling.

Though I guess I should have toned saying how great it is in school, though. The girl who sits in front of me in English stole it. :P Oh well. I'll get it back. Anyway, I loved it because it was all in instant message form, so it was an easy read compared to what I was reading before. *Imagines 50 pound book*. *Shudders*. I loved how funny and realistic it was, and I would recommend it to anyone. Well, anyone 6th grade and up. I think my school has banned it. Ha, what now?!

It feels like you're being told about something from someone who was there, not like you are actually there like good books make you feel.Nothing interesting happens until the middle/end and even then it only looks at that one thing. Basically, this book was a real let down & if you're going to read it, get it from the library first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids/teens","review":"I cannot believe this book is for teenagers.

I laughed at loud in several places, and I absolutely cheered at the ending! The characters felt so real to me and so much like me and my friends at this age. I loved this book and have just gotten both sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted potential","review":"The potential that this book could have is so high. It's a great concept - and something that its audience can relate to. However, it barely scratches the surface of the potential that the format could have. Although it feels a bit realistic, it almost feels like there's too much energy focused on the \\"plot\\", and not enough on, you know, what people actually talk about over IM.The ending feels rushed - not everything gets completely resolved, and it almost feels like a deux ex machina. Not a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i guess it is good....","review":"i would give this book a 2/5 because it is very boring at some parts... but it is okay, i guess. my friend loved it and told me to read it, and i did. i wasn't... like... dying for a sequal or something, but it is good. i thought it was really cool how all the pages are instant massages, especially since i like to im. anyway, it swears in it a lot so if you are a younger person, i suggest you dont read it. it is an OKAY book if you want to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"This is NOT a book for most 13 year olds.

It also does not lead you to think it will be as bad by the cover so a good lesson that you \\"can't judge a book by it's cover\\" and in this book that is so true.

Literature is meant to stimulate the minds of young people, not to cater to the bastardization of our language. We should be making our teenage daughters learn how to fully type out the word \\"you\\", not allowing them to read garbage in which internet speak is glorified.This is a gigantic step backwards in the fight to save our language from the internet.

The whole book is about 3 young girls having a conversation and at times is quite risque. For what is supposed to be a young adult novel some of the subject matter belongs at a college reading level... though the writing itself is that for a 6th grade audience. Terrible book! I've read many young adult novels (for career purposes) and have enjoyed most of them... this however is not the case with this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag me with a spoon :-(","review":"I've had many serendipitous discoveries in the library, and quite a few were pleasant surprises. For some reason (probably random selection) the local library had pulled ttyl from the shelves and propped it up for display. The cover is cutish and the inside cover description sounded different so checked it out.The first few pages start off OK but quickly degenerate. For one thing, it's not very realistic. Even if you're really quick with your thumbs no one is going to type such verbose IM/SMS/text messages. And don't HS girls have other topics besides boys and creepy old teachers and sex? Maybe the author did develop the characters deeper than that, but I don't know because after about 25 pages I chose to use my time reading more worthy material. To each his own, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have given it one star if that was allowed.","review":"After a few pages, my 11 yo daughter put the book down with such force that I had to acknowledge it. When I asked what was wrong, she said something is really wrong with this book. I picked it up to read her last passage and I am so insulted, I can't believe this author. I can't keep authors from writing this, but I can warn parents about this book. My daughter was insulted and she didn't even know how deeply she should have been insulted.My 16 yo daughter looked at it briefly and she too was amazed that this author could publish something like this for girls. I had to return the book to the school library because neither one of them wanted to get dirty by touching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, cute, and fun!","review":"I LOVED ttyl!I have to admit, I was initially wary of the instant-messenger format, but it only took me to the end of the first page to get into it. I also am a huge fan of Myracle's first book, KISSING KATE, and I'm happy to report that this one is even better. By the end of the book, if you don't love every one of the three friends whose correspondence makes up the book (even with their flaws), you should ask someone else to check to make sure you have a pulse. It's so rare and delightful to find YA novels that employ such an authentic voice for their characters, and the instant-messenger format serves to reinforce the sense that you really are getting an accurate transcript of high school banter. It's surprising (and laughable) to see that this book has been criticized by someone for inappropriate content--the treatment of sexual topics is very, very mild compared to a lot of similar books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is our world coming to?","review":"I want to know if I read the same book as the people who gave this thing 5 stars. Reading TTYL made me want to break down in tears. Is that how society truly views teenage girls? As a sophomore in high school, trust me on this, no middle/jr/high school female acts like that. The whole book basically made it seem as if all we're interested in is boys, sex, and boys. I was deeply disappointed in the fact that the author was promoting this. Although, I have more issues with the publisher who thought this one was a winner. And I don't believe anyone on this planet, or the next, types like that.Do yourself a favor, and don't even bother reading TTYL. You've much better things to do with your time, like watching the grass grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex and The City For Kids (without good writing)","review":"Just picked up this winner in the Young Adults section of Border's for my about to turn thirteen year old daughter. As defined in the book description the target audience is 13-17. At least the creators of Sex and The City target their show to adults and don't enter it in this category. However the subject matter and crude descriptiveness in this book could have found it's way onto that show. If you don't believe me, pick it up at the store and see if you would be willing to read pages 10-11 aloud to a group of junior high girls'.(although doing so would probably subject you to arrest) It's bad enough the pressures on young girls' to be sexualized everywhere they look, but it would be nice if we could turn them loose in the literature for kid's; especially when the book jacket tells us of the author's credentials in writing for young people. Perhaps Larry Flynt might have a place for Ms. Myracle in his Letter's to the editor section."},{"rating":"1","title":"The literary equivalent of the all-twinkie diet","review":"A perfect book for morons destined to drop out of school at 15 stoned and pregnant.

I loved the idea of the format, i do alot of instant messaging myself and thought the idea of a book written in instant messages sounded fun... It isnt a good idea tho, the book lacked details that it needed and the story line just wasnt there.. Maybe I am to old for these books now... but seriously, there wasnt any strontg plot lines to keep you intrested... i would have liked to seen alot more withg the Zoe/Mr. H story line... that could have been intresting... in all, the book wasnt very good... I was disappointed with it... it was just plan BORNING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy read, very 'typical'. Lame.","review":"This book was okay, but unremarkable in every way. It is THE epitome of a 'teen girl' fiction. You could see what was coming a mile ahead, like a train bearing down on you. Each girl has their own little 'crisis' that is set up from the very beginning.I didn't relate to the characters at ALL. Keep in mind, I'm a 16-year-old girl. If not me, who are they looking for? I found all the characters one-dimensional, foolish, and they each had one neat character cliche to fit into.The whole thing was fake, obvious, and contained all the cliches that could possibly be stuffed in.It was on easy read-if you're used to the chatspeak-and mildly entertaining, when I wasn't busy being annoyed by how ridiculous it all was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a classic, but it may have its place","review":"First, a warning. I am an older teacher who read this because I sometimes teach a college class in adolescent lit. I appreciate the author was able to tell a whole story through I.M. and associated devices. Wasn't the first novel in English \\"Pamela\\" a series of letters? I was surprised the plot was pretty good. It reminded me of \\"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.\\" Many parents will find the language and subject matter edgier than they would like. I read this title checked out of the library and someone had started to underline all the \\"dirty\\" words and then had given up. My assumption is that the publisher aimed it at girls buying it for themselves and not parents or teachers buying it for them. Boys will find very little of interest here unless they are doing research about the opposition camp. This is not a classic, but if it keeps girls reading and encourages them to move to other titles, that's ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I have not actually read the entire book but from reading some of it out of boredom from my sister's copy I can conclude that it is a sub-par book. Although the page setup is creative, the wording used is hard to follow even though I am a regular user of aim and by formatting the whole book into conversations you don't understand the main characters enough. Also many of the pages are just them ranting about absolutely nothing. I say this as a firm believer of \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" but when my sister bought this book I grimaced at the cover and the summary on the back and when I read the first page it was like rubbing salt into my wound."},{"rating":"2","title":"TTYL","review":"I totally understood this book. It was funny, interesting, and wierd all at the same time. I loved it. this book taught me that you dont always get along with friends, but you love them anyway. Like when the girls fight, they all make up and are friends again. Its pretty hard not to forgive a close friend. I know i fight sometimes with my friends, but we get over it. it also taught me be careful what you say to friends, you could hurt them. It is probably one of my all time favorite books. I hope anyone who has not read it does.GO GET IT NOW AND START READING!!!!!! :) Enjoy,*S.H.K*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I was really surprised by how much I liked this book.

This is definitely NOT a book that you should allow children under 18 years of age to read. After skimming through a few pages, I found plenty of cursing and graphic sexual comments.

But I was cool with that at the time. I finished it in an hour then returned it, forgetting about it.A year later.

Screws provided extend beyond back of handle about 3/4\\" when used on a residential door knob. This provides a sharp set of edges on the open screw that can and did catch on the whorls of finger resulting in torn skin if knob is grabbed instead of the handle. Needs to have screw that is 3/4\\" shorter than ones supplied which I changed.2. Due to use of soft foam as the anti slip material between handle and knob, the handle rotates on door knob if door locked and screws not tightend down extremely tight.3. Lastly, the large area around knob and the flex of handle gives unit a flimsy feel, causing wife saying it feels unsafe to her so I was forced to remove.But of alll the other options available it is the cheapest one I found on the web..

Jelly Belly and a few others also make similar shapped and colored candies but they are nothing like these. The imitators are basically cheap sprinkle covered gummy bears- avoid them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Candy was hard and had no flavor.","review":"Loked forward in getting these and was disappointed when I got them.

But after reading all the great reviews, and the low price, I ordered a five pound bag, and looked forward to their arrival. When I opened the box, the flimsy bag had split open and the candies spread everywhere. The outside of the candy is supposed to be crunchy, but they were about as crunchy as a jelly donut. The jelly inside was tough, and the overall taste, well the only word that comes to mind is yucky. Now, I am stuck with five pounds of candy that won't be eaten, and I can't mail it back, because it will cost as much as the product, to mail it. After reading this, and you still decide you want to order a bag, at least get the smaller three pound bag.

In the film, we meet a lot of them. Most of them aren't really that attractive but they are self-confident, muscular, trendy and semi well-maintained. And several of them (at least three who were interviewed) are porn stars, although only one of them is identified as such. So, the subjects are maybe not exactly representative of the greater gay male population. We also meet some outcasts (bears, goths) who bravely defy the stereotypical images and live to tell about it. But the \\"hot\\" guys all seem kind of dumb and not self-aware. What is the documentary trying to say about these men? I really have no idea. It offers no healthy alternative and no new perspectives on the culture of body image. It's as superficial as its subjects."},{"rating":"1","title":"As shallow as the subjects","review":"This ridiculous film takes the first 45 minutes to make this point: Attractive people get more attention and strokes.Duh. I think we all know that. In the entire film, there's about five minutes of actual discussion and analysis of why many gay men are body-obsessed and why so many don't put an effort into doing something more meaningful with their lives than looking good.So the film is pretty much a waste of time - if you watch it for eye candy, you'll probably be disappointed, as the guys are not as hot as they think they are. If you watch it to gain some insight, you'll be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Topic","review":"It is an interesting film and touches on interesting topics. I do not agree with all the conclusions the film presents, but it is well worth watching. Very thought provocative. Sometimes it is hard to hear some truths; the realization is that our gay culture is very superficial. If anything this movie has tons of great eye candy! Definitely recommend watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as expected","review":"The box included the fan motor and blade.

It was quiet for about five minutes, then began to rumble so loudly I could hear it like a freight train through the timbers of the house two floors away.

There are also 2 originals. The stunning There's Still My Joy and the tasty jazz-tinged Christmas Angel (Reminds me Holly Cole's Christmas EP). There are 3 songs missing from here. Her awesome version of Silent Night, a slightly different version of Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas and Amy Grant's, Breath Of Heaven.

I found this odd, as every other bottle I've ordered has had standard packaging that fixes the top to the bottle on its own. Next, when I opened it to use on my dog it was green and thin in consistency. As any Adams Flea Shampoo user knows, Adams is bright blue (like the bottle) and thick in consistency. To make matters worse, whatever shampoo or chemical they filled the Adams bottle with, caused an allergic reaction on my dog's skin. 3 months later, we are still trying to get his skin and coat back to normal.

My boyfriend is a mechanic and took it apart and found that inspector #8 (according to the sticker on the bottom) left a washer jammed in the motor. He removed the washer and put it back together and the machine started - this time it was smoking and sparking. It's now been thrown on the patio and I've no intention of bringing it back in the house. I have a $5 mixer that needed a new set of beaters and the beaters from the new mixer fit it.

After I installed it, the pump froze up within 3 months. I had to run out and buy a pump from Lowe's to keep the fish alive. A call to Sunterra got me a replacement pump which did the same thing 4 months later. A second call to them resulted in another replacement pump which quit working after about a year. Their pumps are garbage made in China. Go figure! The pump I bought as an emergency answer from Lowe's is still working after more than two years. The Sunterra rep told me that they were changing pump manufacturers but never offered a third replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of poor make and quality...","review":"Pros: Shoot water like a fire hydrant.Cons: The plastic used to build this pump is so cheap that I dropped it 3 feet onto the dirt while installing it and it split right down the female 3/4\\" threading.

I hope I get that number of years from this Sunterra. It took me longer to get into the ridiculous packaging that to set it up. After scissors, a utility knife and two lacerations on the plastic package, I finally opened it. Note that this is a 1\\" pump outlet. If you have 3/4\\" or 1/2\\" tubing, and you are not using a diverter, you will need an adaptor piece (I purchased this at Ace Hardware down the road). And the removal of the outer filter housing is difficult the first time (the slotted plastic housing is soft and could easily crack. Take care when removing it for cleaning as well). But once I attached it to the existing hose via the adapter and plugged it in, it is perfect for my small pond and 4' high waterfall. Like I said, I hope it lasts as long as the previous unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pond Pump I have ever used.","review":"I am using this pump for my prospecting equipment.

When I heard about this tribute or compilation, I had an image in my mind of what I hoped it would be. I have bought other tribute albums to bands such as, The String Tribute to Tool, and I enjoyed that very much because it stayed to the notes and almost direct parallel to the music itself. This album, Mein Herz Brennt, disappointed me. I thought it would be a classical approach to Rammstein, staying with the notes and almost exact parallel to their songs. The female vocalist does not fit for their songs. You can also barely hear the music over the vocals. It was a great try by the composer, but it just doesn't sound right.

The duet is very well engineered and spontaneous, Donna Summer's and Liza's voice are of different technique but oddly they complement each other very well. I do prefer Liza's voice though because it's unique and tremulous. Donna sings in a very pedestrian manner, in contrast to one impertinent reviewer saying Donna's voice is better!

I adored what she wrote on the insert too, this album is full of personal touches that make it a great find for any Liza fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it","review":"I love Liza at Carnegie Hall, but her studio albums don't capture her stage magic. She sounds mannered and as if she always has a bad cold. The only thing worth hearing on this disc is the duet with Donna Summer, but it's embarrassing for Liza to be compared with Summer. Liza is a great stage presence and can be a fine communicator, but she'll never be in Summer's league vocally. Donna doesn't oversing or show off, she's just obviously a far better singer. Still, it's such a shlocky, fun song that I enjoy it despite the vocal mismatch. Can't say that for the rest of the CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop it! It hurts!","review":"All I can say is, \\"ouch.\\" If anyone came along today and tried to put out such a mess of a CD they'd be laughed at. What happened to Ms. Minnelli's voice?

He speaks about the noble history of African Americans in the United States on and off the battlefield. Intercut with his sermon is footage of a soldier going through basic training along with historical footage highlighting black achievement.While by no means an exciting film, it is quite honorable and provides a welcome alternative to the often stereotypical and negative portrayals of people of color in Hollywood films of the era.

Like her best novels, \\"Death Comes as the End\\" serves as a psychological study of her characters. If I have one complaint, it might be that it's not too hard to guess the murderer at the end. In any case the end is still chilling and well-done. Christie changed the ending for her editor and later wished she hadn't, but I find this mystery intriguing nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unusual Christie","review":"Agatha sets her murder in ancient Egypt in this original tale of a wealthy landlord's household.The unusual setting is the best feature of the book.An exciting psychological exposition of the characters but the end was disappointingly guessable. Nonetheless one of Dame Christie's best books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egyptian Mystery","review":"This different from most of Agatha Christie's mysteries. It starts off a little slow. It was worth it once the first murder occurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books from one of the best authors in the field","review":"I read this book more than a year ago and it still comes back to haunt me on some lonely nights. More than any other Agatha Christie books I read (about 30), I would have to say this one is the darkest. Some harecters are so psychotic they could have belonged in a Stephen King novel. Setting the plot in the death worshiping land of ancient Egypt with its gods and tombs creates a sinister ambiance right of the bat with a strong sense of dark forboding, you just know something really bad is going to happen at any minute. Bottom line, this book transcends far beyond the typical murder mystery, even in dame Agatha's standards, making it a true gem of moderm fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"This book allows Christie to draw on her considerable archaeological knowledge based on her experiences on digs with her archaeologist (second) husband. The setting is an intriguing change from her usual. However, I found the plotting in this one to be a little thin. I rarely figure out Christie's culprits in advance, but I saw right through this one. Read it for an interesting change of pace, but don't expect to be deceived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a listen","review":"It's wrong. The British accent in the Egyptian setting doesn't work. The story is long and tedious. The protagonist learns nothing during the entire book and in the end it all has to be explained to her, like a child. I am sorry I purchased this item, and the reviews I glanced at made it sound so intriguing. In fact, it is dull. I am a HUGE Christie fan, and I'd say she deserves a miss once in a while. This is a big miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many berries!","review":"Having been a berry lover and berry picker since a young girl, I found this to be a very lovely and interesting book. Lovely for the beautiful pictures of so many berries. Interesting for the variety of berries pictured and described. There are so many berries I've seen and wondered about, not daring to pick and eat, or being aware they are edible, not knowing how they are to be eaten. Now I have a reference. The book is a feast for the eyes with lots of useful information. A good book for wanderers of the forest who come across these delicate fruits and wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"hairstylist for 40 years.... this is the ONLY dryer I will buy","review":"I have been a working stylist for 40 years, since switching to the Solis dryer, I get an average of ten years performance out of this dryer. The turbo and cold shot buttons leave controls right under your fingertips. Sturdy, wont break if it gets dropped, and the heat element is a workhorse. A little heavier than most popular dryers, but then again, try and get ten years service out of any other brand, it wont happen. Great service, they will repair for me, even after ten years, but I just buy a new one and keep \\"old faithful\\" as a backup. So far, I have never needed \\"backup\\" I still have my dryer from 1994, 2004 (just retired with this purchase) and both still work, just not as hot or quiet as the new guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Book!

Sure, it's blasphemy but I suppose that's what the youngsters like these days. Amazing stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the wittiest and most incisive humor EVER","review":"You don't have to be a fan of comic books to enjoy this book. This book is the beginning and is one complete story. And it's HILARIOUS! Truly some of the wittiest writing to be found today, it's more than just sitcom one-liners or pratfalls or toilet humor or pop-culture references. It's got some of that but really, you need look no further than the title to get a chuckle.Great artwork. Very easy to follow and understand what's going on and the last issue (last quarter of this book) is just amazing. I reccomend this book to everyone I know and no one has been disappointed. You can do far worse with a few bucks of cash than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmm&#65533; Sacralicious&#65533;","review":"I came across this comic through BlamBot Comic Fonts' link to funkotron.com. Being thoroughly steeped in Xianity in my youth (though Xian no longer), I was amused my the mere images of Battle Pope, so I decided to give it a try-- one of my best decisions! The comic is set after God has taken the righteous, and the wicked and devils are left on earth for 1000 years, He appoints a protector of the people-- Battle Pope! With his trusty sidekick, Jesus H. Christ, he fights the minions of evil to save the archangel Michael (a regular Patton-type field general). The comic is scathingly funny, and probably best appreciated by those who were indoctrinated in \\"the faith\\" at one point. I'd recommend it to any and all... and Xians with a sense of humor, if there are any. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yarns round the cabin table","review":"Published in 1935; Told in the Watch Below is twenty four cruising, sailing and sea-faring yarns richly recounted by an experienced seaman (a Commander in the RVNR) and hauntingly illustrated by Donald Maxwell.

I ordered the CD Soundtrack here in Amazon and was ecstatic to finally received it. I played it over and over again... It's heart soaring, made me feel free. I agree with the reviewer from Simi Valley that Carl Davis' had indeed made the scores fun, moving and deep with emotions.The reason why I didn't rate this CD a 5 stars 'cuz there was quite a few of the musics played in the movie that was not in this soundtrack. I was looking forward in hearing couple of my favorite scores in the movie, which sadly wasn't included here. Unfortunately, I also don't know the names of that two music I so longed to hear. One was played in Piano by one of Mr. Bingley's sisters. Oh well, overall, this CD is simply dreamy. I listen to it often especially when I am reading my Historical Romance Novels. What a GREAT combination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit cyclic, but still pleasant","review":"The music is very inviting and smooth. But I cannot help but feel a bit sick of that same piano tune that is randomly thrown in throughout the playlist. I would have liked more variety. Still a wonderful buy for those who loved the miniseries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more","review":"The book is not very visual except for the quiz at the end of five chapters.

I wanted something small with an electronic tuner so I wouldn't have to worry about bumping it and losing the station.The radio is very compact and fits nicely in my jacket pocket. The tuner is easy to use and well laid out. It allows you to set presets for am/fm and easily move through them with a single button press.The reception is pretty good, and keeps most stations tuned in even while riding at 60 mph. I would have liked to have a bass boost option on it, but even without it the sounds is acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I picked up this unit 'cause it seemed most highlyregarded in its class here on Amazon. The thing isnot a very impressive little toy, IMHO.I keep it on MONO all the time in order to cut downon static from bad reception. Even the most powerfulstations (e.g. KQED in the SF bay area) are regularlyinterrupted by static.The reception is simply poor.

At that time Iplan to try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound and good reception","review":"I love it! I get great, clear sound and the reception is very good.

I was too disappointed to listen to the rest of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for beginners, but nothing more...","review":"This book did not provide me with the information that I wanted. There were no scales given, just examples to play along with.

I am anxious to read it as an adult and see if it is as good as I remember. Back then, I recall that it made me really want to go to the Maryland's Chesapeake Bay. Haven't made it yet, but still want to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing up on MD's Eastern Shore at the turn of the century.","review":"The author's fictionalized autobiography tells of his childhood days growing up along the banks of the Chester River on Maryland's Eastern Shore. The book has been in print since 1957 and still offers the reader a flavor of life in rural America before World War I. Byron writes in the vernacular of a 9 or 10 year old and the book has been compared to Huckleberry Finn. It is an easy read,and the language is deceptively simple. Each chapter can stand alone as an independent short story, but collectively they provide and interesting view of an average family struggling to make do: \\"We were poor and didn't know it.\\"This modest book describes much more accurately the life and times that visitors to the Eastern Shore seek than do more commercially succesful writers such as Michiner and Barth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supababes","review":"For starters, the first 3 singles from this album is already worth thr price of this gorgeous CD. Freak Like Me is a hi-funk song that borrows from Adina's Howard song of the same name but breathes new life, making it into a bonafide Sugababe #1. Followp single, Round Round is even funkier and is a grand electro-pop affair that'll blow your mind away. Their current single, Stronger, is a cool R&B; ballad that exudes cool sensuality.This album is already much more superior than their debut One Touch. Elsewhere on the album on tracks like Blue and the title track, the babes create a ecletic mix of R&B;, funk and electro-pop that is not heard from R&B; girlbands stateside. However, I urge those who want a slice out of Maerican radio now to get this album! Easily one of the best of 2002!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teenage Listener","review":"I think this cd is a really good listen. Some songs like \\"Round Round\\" and \\" Freak Like Me\\" are quite dancy while there are others like \\"Shape\\" and \\"Stronger\\" are slower and more ballady. If you are buying this, i think the cd is more aimed towards girls and woman. You will want to listen to it over and over again, with its catchy tunes and lyrics. The music category is pop but can be quite soulful and chilled out as well. I think there is something for everyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD Is Wack To The Ultimate Max!","review":"Maaann! How can anybody give this CD more than one star? It actually deserves ZERO stars. The Sugababes cut and paste material from other artists and try to pass it on for their own. Adina Howard came out with \\"Freak Like Me\\" in 1995 and the Sugababes' remake of it was atrocious. \\"Blue\\" sounds too similiar to Aaliyah's song \\"What If.\\" C'mon now! Y'all need to stop playing! Heaven forbid these wenches torture the United States with even more terrible music! They're not original and their vocals are generic. If you listen to the Sugababes, be sure that you'll get diabetes.

Truly disapointing !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!!","review":"If you liked Stronger, Shape, and all the other recent releases you'll love this!

Eder is in the spotlight on this one, and I love her version of \\"When I Look at You\\" although agreeably it is much more a pop single than it is a broadway balad. Glaringliy missing from this recording is Eder's version of \\"Only Love\\".If you are a song collector as I am, then this offers a collection of Wildhorn Songs that may have otherwise been lost. If you are a fan of the show, I have to say my favorite all around Pimpernel recording is still the OBC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy BOTH recordings!","review":"I agree--it's difficult to compare the concept album TO the Broadway album!! I think that the Broadway cast truly brings to LIFE what the vocalists on the concept album were trying to share with us! I first bought the B'way cast and fell madly, hopelessly in love with Douglas Sills and company. But you can't miss Linda Eder, Chuck Wagner and Dave Clemmon's beautiful version on the concept album! So buy 'em both!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Concept in Need of Refinement","review":"It's a good thing changes were made to the score of \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" before it opened on Broadway. The concept recording has its moments, but overall there's not much worth listening to. Chuck Wagner is in great voice, though he is not foppish enough to play Percy. Linda Eder, a stellar singer, is unable to convince the listener that she is doing anything other than signing -- there is no emotion or depth to her performance. Her French in \\"Storybook\\" is particularly bad. Dave Clemmons is also disappointing as Chauvelin, and Peabo Bryson's duet with Ms. Eder would be more at home on the Top 40 List (which it acyually made)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a keeper","review":"This recording is incredible. I do not own the OSV but I know it's can't possibly be beter than this one. The entire cast is remarkable. Linda has a beautiful voice and I never tier of hearing it. Chuck Wagner is just phenomenal. He has the amazing ability to make you feel so many emotions with his beautiful voice. The song \\"Into the Fire\\" really shows his incredible talents. This is definitely a CD not to miss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This album is terrific although I still like the original Broadway cast album better. The music really tells the story in an emotional way, and there are songs here that did not make it into the actual show. Gotta wonder why 'cause some of them are wonderful. And some of the lyrics changed between this concept album and the final version. The final version is the best, but as a writer, I do appreciate the process Nan Knighton went through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sane opinion","review":"The reviews you will generally see of this CD will compare it to the OBC. These reviewers will swear by the OBC and how ideal the cast was... Poppycock. This CD is better for several reasons. First of all, Doug Sills (the broadway Percy) is a great performer and all but he is about one tenth the singer that Chuck Wagner is. Moreover, this CD benefits from the presence of Dave Clemmons, a veteran musical star. The one thing that is annoying about this recording is the presence of Linda \\"Streisand\\" Eder. Since the original concept album was completely dominated by her, her usually grating immitation of Babs can become a real headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"What became of Terrence V. Mann?","review":"This was my first musical adventure with the Scarlet Pimpernel - hadn't even heard any of the music prior to this year. The quality of the CD is excellent, the style of music (especially Marguerite's) unexpected - and the absence of Terrence Mann in the role of Chauvelin exceedingly disappointing. The actor who replaces him is perfect, just not the one I'd been hoping for. With CDs (including \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel: Encore\\") readily available - why aren't there any existing videos or DVDs of it available? As a Pimpernel novel/movie?now CD fan ever since high schoolFrench classes, I'd like to see how a musical handled the action!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"The songs in this are dull. Monotonous and boring beyond human comprehension. \\"They seek him here; they seek him there.\\" \\"Him\\" is probobly Frank Wildhorn and \\"they\\" is probobly an angry mob of people who actually spent money to see it on the great white way. Cablevision, being an evil comapany, sought to revamp an evil play. It makes perfect sense. What dosn't make sense is why people still see the play. The thing that stood out about the play was that the scenery moved about the stage. But you can't notice that on the soundtrack, can you? It's just too bad that zero stars wasn't an option. This is truly worthy of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting subject/highly readable","review":"Don't be intimidated by the subject matter.

Interesting twist in the story. Anxious moments while the Stormwarden has to rely on the help of a almost useless boy and a young semi crippled girl, whilst facing so many enemies. When you reach the end you just have to rush off and find book 2, with out delay to find out what happens next. Very Compelling. Excellent writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa, big difference between reading as a teen and as an adult","review":"I read these books years ago (the three books in the Cycle of Fire) and when I saw them at my local Half-Price Books I picked them up again. I remember them as containing a good story in a believable world structure, if a bit too demon-ish at times (reminiscent of Tolkien).Well, upon this most current reading, I am noticing that the books are mostly narrative, with very little dialogue. So much is explained in narrative that I found myself glossing over large swaths of explanations until I could either get to the parts about Emien (none of the other characters engaged me emotionally, except perhaps the Captain-Kirk-like Kielmark), or until I reached a patch of dialogue. This made it an almost tedious read.I'm halfway through book 2, \\"Keeper of the Keys,\\" and I'm finding the same problem there. Too much narrative, not enough dialogue, not enough character development to really make me care. I may not bother finishing the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and challenging!","review":"I have this game and at first, I only got to $100 or $200 but now I can reach like $8000 or even more!

It has a bold wall of sound, rare for him, and a good hook. I think it's his most underrated song -- it sounds like a top five hit but only made it to #23 on the charts. He should have done more in this style. Like Madonna, he stuck new songs on his greatest hits that were actual hits too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt songwriting at its best","review":"It doesn't get a whole lot better than this! All of his finest songs are on this disc making it great to listen to from start to finish. Few people have been able to match his amazing song crafting abilities.

Subsequent tracks from early '50's vinyl sources are not as bad, but I'd label this \\"for completists only.\\" Look for the current legit reissue of Jane's \\"Let's Put Out The Lights\\" album from which eight of the tracks on this semi-bootleg were taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrific concept, lousy sound","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that Jane sounds like she has a towel wrapped around her head, I would add that there must also be an army blanket wrapped around the microphone!

Firstly this is a bootleg, made up exclusively of VH1 tv recordings. The audio is dolby digital stereo at 192kbs. A rather low bitrate audio. At the very least they could have bumped the bitrate up to 448kbs to give us better sound. It isn't surround sound by anyone's stretch of the imagination. The fact it's not made by any major record studio should be the first giveaway. The Beatles' record studio was EMI. If anybody would release a collection of videos, it would be EMI. That isn't to say the songs or videos are bad, they're OK for TV recordings, but let's not make this to be something it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next time, at least get a REAL fan to proofread your BOOTLEG TRASH!!","review":"I was just about to.............but then upon closer inspection, I realized there were a bunch of people that were duped into buying this as an authentic item.

IT PIPES OF PEACE......not pipes of SPACE. Also for the time period they covered they excluded the videos O'uest Di Soeil & Put it there,(which is one of my favorites, by the way).

But don't make a mistake, it's impossible to correct. If it is possible, I don't know how as there are no directions. Using it for more than one player is tedious and not practical. With the buttons the way they are, its going to get bumped and errors made.

If keeping track of one player it is just fine. When trying to play two players it is hard to get from one player to the second player.

It was also a great value for cost per ounce. The smell is unique that is for sure. I can see why some people would love it. The problem I have is that it does not last. By lunch time I am smelling pretty ripe. Another problem with that musk smell is that it is not a perfumy smell so it does not cover up BO all that well. If anything it only enhances the BO.

Put DOWN your hip-hop and go buy this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues With a Mohawk and Safety Pins","review":"You gotta give 'em credit. To meld high-speed three-chord punk and blues is a master stroke, and this album makes for an enjoyable mix. Spencer sounds like Elvis through a warped fuzzbox ... and it make such testosterone poisoned lines as \\"Kiss my a** - your girlfriend still loves me!\\" a hoot. Most important, Spencer has resurrected the Blues Groove - Robert Johnson, after all, was a dance musician. \\"Love All of Me\\" and \\"Chicken Dog\\" have indelible dance grooves. This album takes a while to get hooked on, then doesn't let go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groove exploitation","review":"It takes more than one listen to appreciate this record and that's just as well, for it grows on you slowly but surely. It is one of these very few records you finally end up listening to over and over again without getting tired of it. The music is simple yet extremely efficient. The Blues Explosion know just exactly how to take a simple groove to its resolution. They may not be great musicians but it simply does not matter. They have uncomparable chemistry and complicity that particularily shines on the instrumental tracks, such as \\"R.L. got soul\\". Granted, this album is less accessible than its predecessor \\"Orange\\" but the funk is still all there, it's simply less obvious and takes time to be appreciated. A better album in my opinion that I would have given five stars to if not for that dreadful last song that is simply painful to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookbook for the Amateur Shaman","review":"A delightful find.

Reading Keeney's books tends to be very enlightening.That said, I'm not sure about \\"Everyday Soul\\". It's a fascinating read, for sure, but it is quite off-base from Keeney's more \\"scientific\\" works. Granted, this isn't a psychology book...I'm well aware of that. With all of Keeney's other books that I've read, I've been enlightened with new understanding that has a real impact on my life, so when \\"Everyday Soul\\" assumed the stance that understanding is an obstacle to spirituality, I was a bit disappointed.I'm still giving this book 4 stars because there are plenty of typical Keeney bits of wisdom sprinkled throughout, and my own expectations lead to the disappointment I felt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank iTunes!","review":"Without Apple's iTunes, I never would have found these guys.

It claims to just work when you get it, but I seemed to be having some trouble. After checking the battery and making sure it was all set, I was still confused as to why it wouldn't work. There were no helpful reviews online either. Turns out, according to some instructions (NOT INCLUDED!!!) you have to aim it at the grill on the right hand side. This only works if you are within about 6 inches from it, and even then it's SOOOOO particular, it's like it's a tiny dot you have to find for the iHome to respond. If you really wanna press it 100 times before you get that longer distance assistance, go ahead. Otherwise, you might as well get up and change it yourself because the remote won't do it for you.

However, I don't understand the designers of this adjustment since I use a setting of \\"1.5\\" to get nice brown toast. Makes you wonder what a setting of \\"5\\" would do. I have not used the defrost or reheat settings. The bagel setting turns off the inside elements for one sided toasting.

Take \\"Sleeping With Open Eyes\\" a song about the cold war or \\"Darkness on the Land\\" a song about the struggles of Native American people or \\"Lord Let Me Live Again\\" a song about spiritual awakening. These are all well thought out lyrical and musical ideas. I am a fan of mostly folk-rock and although Smoke Ring Days have a much heavier sound they both write great songs with great lyrics. Smoke Ring Days at times remind me a little of old U2, the same urgent passion of a band really giving it all they've got just to get heard. I think they have succeded, because this is a really good CD. I purchased this CD because of the mp3 of \\"Sleeping with Open Eyes\\" I got from Pitchfork Magazine and I was very impressed. if you like powerful and passionate music you will most likely enjoy this album, they Have a lot to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange album cover -- good music","review":"When I first heard \\"Sleeping with Open Eyes\\" on the radio years back, I could tell just from this one song that this band were intelligent, wise, and talented. I was not disappointed when I brought the CD home. Every single song on this disc is relatively good and should be given a chance by the public. What you get here are 13 intelligent, tuneful songs that mix folk and rock without being pretentious about it. The intellect that underscores this album is more basic than the kind that's flaunted in an attempt to get critical praise and \\"indie\\" popularity. This album should have had more attention given to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good collection","review":"I decided to buy a copy of Songs of Simple Dreams and listen for myself. After a few weeks I have come to like Smoke Ring Days, and I have to say that this cd is one of the better cd's I am listening to at the moment. Unfortunately, no one writes songs like these any more, at least, they don't sing them with the same passion that the Smoke Rings do. Most songs on this album are good. If you have never heard this album, it is worth exploring. It is a good collection, and not much to dislike. there is a quality about this album transcends the slick pop surface. This is an album well crafted, a good example of how to write with a pleasant pop/rock sound and still not sacrifice any artistic credibility. Songs of Simple Dreams has a pretty commercial sound, but it also has a very earnest and earthy sound as well. The songs always sound vibrant and never once does it come across as \`in it for the fame,' in spite of its commercial sound. Give it 3 stars if you dont like pop/rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth discovering","review":"To put it simply, this is a good album. This album covers a lot of musical ground. The band manages to combine the classic hard rock stylings with softer, more folk-oriented ones. This makes for a listening experience that is good from start to finish. The first two Euro-hits that the band scored, Sleeping with Open Eyes and In Other Lives, can be found on this LP. But, as with most bands, there are many equally-good songs that aren't as popular. A good example of this is the bluesy rocker, Baby Don't You Follow. One of the really good soft tracks the album has to offer is the sorely-underrated Daydream Tomorrows. But my favorite here would have to be Darkness on the Land, a powerful political statement on Native America, which is divided into three, continuous parts that bring it to a huge climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my cats fat","review":"I fed this for 7 years.

It didn't dawn on me that it could be this premium food that was causing them to be so fat until I looked at a chart which compared ingredients of dry cat foods. Science Diet has nearly double the fat of most brands. I know carbs are a concern too when picking a diet for these little carnivores, but I switched (3 mos ago)to an Iams product that has meat as the primary ingredient, and less than half the fat. Another note is that the \\"light\\" cat food formulations, including Hill's, replace fat with grains. That's simply not acceptable and can lead to obesity just as surely.The jury is still out on my cats' battle of the bulge, but it does appear that they're a bit more svelte in just this short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only food I give my cats!","review":"My cats have been on Hill's Science Diet since they came home as kittens.

Both discs are obviously played by people who love Dvorak and particularly his Slavonic Dances.This wonderful two disc set would have rated a perfect five stars if it had better sonic balance. Some of the finer pianissimos are sadly lacking in ambience.However, don't let this deter you from adding this wonderful set to your collection, especially at this price. The acoustics are nearly perfect, and enhances the orchestra's sound.Highly recomnded to Dvorak fans, and recommended for classical music lovers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Interpretations From Szell Of Dvorak's Scores","review":"George Szell did a fine job getting a rich, warm, almost Viennese tone, from his Cleveland Orchestra, and no where is it more apparent than in this still spellbinding set of Dvorak's Slavonic Dances. Admittedly the sound quality isn't up to par to recent recordings, but this is still an interpretation worth listening to, led by someone who truly had a great affinity for Dvorak's music. I doubt I have heard the Cleveland Orchestra's winds or strings play with such passion and lyricism. Without question, this was among the finest recordings made by the orchestra under the baton of Maestro Szell."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Devotees and Novices","review":"My copy of this CD has \\"traveled\\" several times, as I've loaned it out to friends who want to dip their toes into the pool of classical music. The usual result after hearing the Slavonic Dances is, they're hooked, and they buy their own copies, then move on to larger works such as symphonies and concertos.Dvorak wrote some great large-scale works for orchestra, notably the incredible cello concerto, but I think that, like Grieg, he was at his best in small-scale gems like these, with their delightful mix of moods and tempos. No. 2, the dumka in E minor, is my favorite, but they all have their merits.I've heard other recordings of the Dances, and none of them are bad, but I'm partial to this delightful rendition by Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra, as it has made \\"true believers\\" out of people who thought they would never like classical music."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for your car","review":"The music is lively and great, but I could not play this CD in my car.

From farmers, fishermen, and merchants to executioners and geishas who entertained kamikaze pilots in the last days of their lives, these simple, unadorned memories of ordinary smalltown Japanese people living in a previous era under circumstances that we in modern, high-tech times cannot imagine left me in awe of the power of the human body and spirit.

I found that I was wanting the book to be much longer as I learned so much from the stories and was thoroughly entertained. Subjects ranging from the work of a tofu-merchant to the rarity of shorts are covered so a wide range of information is available. Overall, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy case.","review":"I think this case is great for the Kid Tough camera. I like that it teaches my son that things should be put away safely, and as tough as the camera is, it should still be protected because it is important to him. It makes it easier to put it on a shelf or bring it with, protecting from dust, dirt, etc. However, I took one star off of my rating because rather than a handle, it has a small tab. When trying to teach my son to keep his camera safe to take it with us, it works against me because he cannot easily hold on to it. Because the camera is a good size, it usually means he uses both hand to hold it. Not convenient or practical. Fisher Price should add a common sense handle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, a custom case for the Kid Tough camera, but you get what you pay for","review":"This is an adequate impulse item for those buying the Kid Tough Camera as I did for a 2007 Christmas present. The pink case is a very light shade of pink, almost not pink at all. Lack of a handle costs it a star, but form-fitting to the camera and an internal pocket for the USB cord or extra batteries is handy. Though it's a light case, which will not prevent crushing damage to the camera, it does keep dust off the lens and camera controls. $14.97 at Wal-mart as of this writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me.","review":"As a student I find this book a terrific survey of possibilities. Frankly it has opened up whole realms of enquiry I hadn't considered previous to reading it. Ward admirably succeeds in covering an enormous breadth of ground in an accessible way. The book doesn't talk down to the reader or dumb down the subject, and while the treatment is a bit uneven in spots, I think the chief success of the book is how it supplies endless fascinating avenues for further discovery with encouragement to roll up your sleeves and get to it. If dynamical cognition is already your specialty, you may not get much new out of the book, but if the field is new to you, Dynamical Cognitive Science is that rare thing: a thoroughly readable introduction to the subject that, while it doesn't stint on the math, doesn't scare you away or bore you to tears either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and fast service","review":"Got my book quick and in very good shape.

The Spicy Tomato Soup required double the amount of chili as called for; The All Day Mushrooms needed salt--not included in the recipe or instructions; The Chicken Divan was heavy, thick, too rich, too processed and too salty (I added no salt). The Marinated Tomatoes and Green Chili Corn Muffins were the only recipes that turned out perfectly according to the ingredients lists and instructions. Somebody failed to test these recipes properly before publication, or that is my best guess. I haven't bought any of her other books, but hold higher hopes for Paula without her friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I purchased this book, and I was extremely disappointed...It states to get a lot of already made foods, and also to use chik filet chicken in recipes...There are some recipes that can be found on the foodnetwork site...I don't really understand the idea behind the book...Save your monies people..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do people actually eat like this?","review":"Practically speaking, if i ate like the way Paula Dean cooks, I'd be 500 lbs. I think it's unrealistic to promote this type of fat-laden cooking for every day given what we know about ways to keep healthy. I laugh at how much butter she adds to things and sure, it's going to taste good! Give me a chef who can create recipes that taste like they have lots of fat but don't. That person deserves the praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as you might think","review":"I was given this book for Christmas. I always try and make at least two or more recipes when I get a new cookbook. I am not a chef but I am a very good cook and can execute a fairly difficult recipe. I hate to burst everyone's bubble but this book contains recipes based on canned soups and when they are not the recipes are flavorless. I made the shrimp casserole, shrimp and grits and the oatmeal cookies. Nothing to write home about. I will say if you are a beginner this may be beneficial. A lot of hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recipes that never miss","review":"I purchased this book at a book signing and was lucky enough to meet Paula Deen. Since then, I've tried several of the recipes in this book, and they've always been fantastic. One thing I've learned about a Paula Deen recipe is that you don't have to \\"test\\" it ahead of time--they always earn me rave reviews at family gatherings. If you aren't on a diet and enjoy cooking, you will certainly get a lot of use out of this cookbook, not to mention the fun of reading Paula's comments and introductions. As a side note: she's just as warm and funny in person!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the pictures??????","review":"I love Paula Dean's show on the Food Network, but her cookbook fell a little short of my expectations. I prefer a cookbook where I can see a PICTURE of the prepared food, as well as pictures of \\"helpful hints\\" and \\"how tos\\".I will make a few of the dishes, but for the most part I'm sure this cookbook will sit on the counter unused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum!","review":"Another great book by Paula.

The only thing was not many pictures i like so see what I'm preparing.Thanks, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I found the recipes in this book extremely uneven. I don't feel a cookbook has to have long, difficult recipes using unusual ingredients to be good, and many of these recipes are nice and simple (some perhaps too simple for my tastes.) Other recipes seemed a little too exotic, like the author was try to appeal to too wide of an audience.For the curious, do like I did and check the item out at your local library before dropping your hard earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will Southern food be what it should be?","review":"I like Paula Deen, and I like some of her recipes. But, being a Southerner, I'm disappointed that so many popular Southern food writers continue act like they're cooking in the 50s -- taking shortcuts with processed added foods. Lots of Southern writers have resurrected and refined our traditions -- especially in New Orleans and in \\"low country\\" cooking. Paula Deen and her bandwagon act like none of that has happened. It's time for Southern cooks to throw away their canned mushroom soup, instant puddings, and hot-rise cornbread mixes. And start making desserts that actually taste like something other than pure sweetness, i.e., stop using mind-numbing amounts of sugar. Lots of this stuff used to be considered truck stop food (I'm especially thinking of the desserts here); now, it's becoming known solely as Southern food."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is it about Southern Recipes?","review":"Paula your book is great.

This book is full of small photos taken during the completion of larger works. Accompanying these photos are plenty of comments, but they are NOT detailed instruction or guidance that will help if you are learning - only generalizations, broad concepts, wishy washy artsy fluff. Don't buy this book to learn to paint shiny objects, fur, cloth or folds, or any other specific material or texture.

Take dozens of photos of each. Now add very generic comments about light, shadows, colors, etc. and you have this book.

You will never stop listening to it for years and still enjoy every track as the first time. It is so light... You will also enjoy the charming sound of each instrument, and you'll shurely discover a whole new aproach to Joplin's music as a band, rather than the original piano. Of course, the piano versions stand for themselves, but the deep bass lines, the charming flutes, the rithm of drums, you could almost belive it could have originally been written for a band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD, but there's another one that's even better","review":"This was the first ragtime album put out by the NE Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble, but their second album is even better. \\"The Art of the Rag\\" (make sure you get the one that's all Scott Joplin).

I purchased this book in order to get a better understanding of the EE basics. Like most universities a ME takes a EE 101 course that is essentially a weed out course. The problem with a weed out course is that in the end you don't have a solid understanding of what the underlying basics are. If this sounds familiar, you should definitely buy this book.The author (Darren Ashby) addresses this concern. This book is full of schematics and there are often various relationships made between the Electrical/Mechanical disciplines which are very useful.

I picked up this book hoping for a good refresher. Both the reader reviews and my initial scan of the book made it look promising.But, after slogging through mis-spellings galore, an unclear writing style, sentences obviously missing key words, ambiguous sentences, etc, I gave up. After all, if I have to dig through the language to get to the message, I may as well go with a book that's deeper in the subject because I would get more information for the same effort.I place responsibility for the poor quality on the publisher and editor(s) more than on the author.

Another thing about this book that is a little off-putting is that Koontz can't seem to make-up his mind if he's writing a suspense novel or soft-core porn.

The holes were not pre-drilled in many places, the paint chipped off, there were a lot of imperfections that had been poorly patched, the wood was split on the main right side of the unit. There were cheap plastic pieces to screw into the wood for anchors to other pieces and I could barely force them to fit so I could start turning them into the holes (note - have pliers handy, impossible to do otherwise). Overall, it is the size I wanted (extended changing area with drawers/cupboard area) so I am satisfied that I found what I wanted on Amazon, but the manufacturer has some quality problems to correct.

Maybe other babies are diferent, but I think its not the right material for such a playground. For a hot environment like ours in the south, it quickly gets very hot inside and you can not leave your baby or little child alone playing because of the plastic material that can be dangerous.

As far as bouncing, this was not a good idea. There was really no support to the walls of this item. Bouncing for a 18-20 pounder was not a good idea. The bouncer never sat straight, it always had a tilt to it. Maybe from the packaging. Also,the toy's hung wrong overhead as well. We are now 4 months later (of not that much use) throwing it out!!!

My problem was that the dome started to crack. The cracks got worse and worse. They are now being held together with electical tape. I called the company and they said they have had problems but they have made the domes stronger now and I could buy a new dome for $20. Seems to me that if they produed a defective product that they should replace the part free of charge. And how do I know this is true? So I rate the quality terrible.

And no need to post responses to this review, whining about the evils of illegal sharing/copying. I just don't care.

My reasons are that since I live in Mexico I can attest to the practically of Pimsuer in formal more educated settings with Spanish speakers. To say that Pimsleur teaches \\"archaic\\" Spanish is nonsense. However, it does teach a more formal Spanish that is spoken in educated crowds. When you hit the streets of Mexico and try to speak with kids, teenagers, and local store employees Pimsleur tends to fail you. That's where LSLC comes in and rescues you. You need both! You need to know the formal more educated Spanish as well as the street Spanish. It is not necessary to mean-mouth Pimsleur in order to point out the benefits of LSLC.Doug BowerYou Can Learn Spanish No Matter Your Age or Disposition"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool to help you learn Spanish!!","review":"My Fiance is from Argentina & speaks fluent spanish & italian.

They nearly ALL stop with a review up until lesson 13. I find that very interesting because something happens at lesson 13.The first 12 lessons are good, not great. I have a background in basic Spanish and thus I understood why things were conjugated the way they were. There are NO explanations provided on the cd so it is essentially rote memorization. BUT, at lesson 13, the instructor on the cd changes and the tempo and difficulty increases dramatically. In fact, even with listening to lesson 13 five times with the dialogue PRINTED off, I still could not follow along. This is because they begin speaking so fast and are using irregular verbs.Bottom line: This product is good for lessons 1-12 but is abysmal after that. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Pimsleur for conversations with the locals and friends","review":"I started with Pimsleur which moved at a slower pace and taught basic tourist Spanish (very formal).

My only complaint is that some of the female speakers are hard to understand, even with repetition and turning up the volume. The male speakers are much clearer, but overall, I like the program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Rather disappointing. Probably useful if you're taking a Spanish class, but for a traveler this is next to useless and really, really boring. I don't imagine I will ever need to say, \\"Yes, I see the red cars.\\" Ever. Also, focusing on the familiar form of Spanish seems like a bad strategy. If you're just learning the language, how likely are you to be talking to people you know well enough to use the familiar form of address? The first CD was unplayable; and while I knew enough Spanish to skip it, I just found the subsequent lessons to be boring and not all that useful.

You can seek only publishers/agents names and the names of authors represented by the publisher, but then you cannot cross reference from author to publisher. That requires a whole new search. The shareware can be found anywhere on line. And the web links don't work. Moreover, the program is continually crashing on my system.

The reality is that the gatekeepers and the keymasters of the publishing industry are publishing lots of books for writers that do not seem to advance their cause. This book looks more like an advertisement by literary agents for literary agents and editors, rather than anything that is truly meant to help the writers among us. The literati turn their noses up at most of the query letters they receive.Take a look at the responses most writers get to their queries and you will realize that the literati hold themselves to a much different and lower standard than they require of the writers who query them.

There is nothing special about this figure. The packaging looks nice, but the packaging is not very durable either.

I would advise them to take it back or apply more pressure to the leg to make sure it is installed properly. I have not had any problems with mine at all.

All the actors were wonderful as is the music and costuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Robert Pattinson sinks this Guy de Maupassant adaptation, it truly doesn't matter how good his co-stars are, and honestly some of them carry their roles with aplomb, the tale of a vapid intellectual simpleton who.rises to fame solely on his looks rests solely on its lead shoulders. The directors (or more likely producers) decision to cast Rob in hopes of getting the much coveted lonely elderly women with too many cats demographic is at the cost of the quality of the film itself. Almost every scene that he's in rings false and the fact that he's supremely out of his element as to the tedious film's great source material would be laughable if it wasn't so maddening. If there were one silver lining it's that I caught this on HDnet Movies, so I didn't have to pay to watch this travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it!","review":"I actually enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I was going too. I wish I could place it at Four and a half stars. I have watched many period pieces and all of Robert Pattinson movies and I believe that the movie was well written and the acting not just from Robert Pattinson, but Uma Thurman and Christina Ricci as well was great. If you are a Twilight Fan then first know that Robert Pattinson's character is nothing like Edward Cullen. I have to say that is one of the reasons I enjoyed the movie so much, and I say that as a die hard Twilight fan. The movie was true to the way things were back then as well as true to the book. I would recommend watching it, as someone who was not positively sure about it at first know there are no regrets here about my decision to watch the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This was a good movie, saw it twice.

The costumes and lead actresses looked great, but there wasn't even much of old Paris to enjoy. these seemed to be no point to this movie other than to show the teen vampire was a grown up...look at his bare butt sexing Christina Ricci! Ugh. I fail to understand the good reviews for this terrible movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous","review":"Whoever decided this needed to be released as a Pre-theatrical missed the boat! Robert Pattinson was absolutely wonderful in this role. He is a superb actor and never fails to deliver. I would have loved to see this at the theater although my daughters 10' HD projection system did do it justice. Highly recommend this movie - and I will probably purchase it when it comes out on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not good.","review":"I picked this movie mostly to watch Robert Pattinson, but unfortunately, I found his character to be \\"ugly\\" inside and out. I usually enjoy watching his movies, but he made a lot of awkward faces and he became distracting to the movie. The plot lines were nothing grabbing or captivating, so it took almost 2 days for me to finish watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly acted","review":"This is a poorly acted period piece focusing on a very shallow gigolo and his romantic adventures. It is well staged but the lead actor is constantly smirking at inappropriate times. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather good, best as a rental","review":"&#304; expected much. Having watche previews, I expected it might have boring sequences, but it easily held my interest trhu to the end. The end could have been better, it needed something else. It starts off rather raunchy, but the interludes decline significantly halfway thru. Rob did very well in the role and I didn't even find his character that repulsive, felt kinda sorry for him, but he eventually adapts, overcomes and is model student. Perhaps this is why Mrs. Forrestier seems smug at the end. He had a good variety of expressions and situations that I haven't seen him in before and he did well, it wasn't strained and appeared well-directed Ricci was perfect and endearing --her chemistry with Pattinson showed. Uma was good. Kristin Scott not so much. Worth watching and thinking about love vs. success and wealth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had hopes for this movie...","review":"...it was sadly disappointing. You keep hoping that the character played by Robert Pattinson would grow a bit. Or at least that Pattinson would actually show some acting other than his normal wooden style. The period costume is very nice and helps you keep interest in the movie until the futile end. The female actors did a wonderful job in their roles. The movie itself had great potential to be well done, however, the fact that Pattinson's acting was so poor removes any chance of this movie being labeled as \\"good\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely yet confusing","review":"This film was beautifully and lovingly photographed and sucessfully evoked the era. That said, the story was difficult for me to follow not having read the novel first. Robert Pattinson was every bit as beautiful as the story required yet it was hard to believe his baser instincts. He seemed like a nice guy, and the character wasn't really a very nice guy. I recommend it for the pleasure of seeing Pattinson, but watch the old George Sanders film for the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice production design and costumes, but movie is static","review":"This film had beautiful visuals. There are so many plot holes where the characters talk about something that the audience has no clue about. It's alright, but don't expect to be blown away by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Social climber in 19th century Paris","review":"I thought that the movie's plot was interesting, not all predictable, and it was different to see Rob Pattinson play such a cad (in period costume, no less!). A movie with strong women characters and Rob in the middle of it all. Those who loved him as Edward in the Twilight series may not appreciate him in this movie, where Rob's character is so self-centered and greedy. In my opinion, Edward fans would be better served rewatching the Twilight movies or as a sympathetic supporting character in the Harry Potter \\"Goblet of Fire\\" movie. ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"The best acting came from Christina Ricci, who gave another good performance. Rob Pattinson could have been doing Twilight, he wasn't into his character. The plot was the same old same old poor dude wants to be rich dude sleeps his way into big money - end of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"so proud","review":"I have waited for what seems like FOREVER to finally see this movie! And I couldn't be prouder of Rob! They were all amazing in this movie and I will go on the 9th of June to see it in theaters as well! Robert truly becomes the cad that Georges Duroy is...You don't know whether to love him or hate him, but I did love this movie. I felt so bad for Virginie and Coltilde. They truly loved him, especially Coltilde and I believe that he loved her too! I feel they will be together in the end. Thanks Amazon for having this available to watch online as I do not have cable! You rock!~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bel Ami Movie not what I expected","review":"The hype on this movie got me real interested in the film because I am a fan of Robert Pattinson. But, Iabsolutely hated this movie. I didn't think it was a good storyline at all. I love Robert but, not this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a let down","review":"I was apprehensive about watching this movie because of my aversion to Robert Pattinson. But the rest of the cast are all actors and actresses I have enjoyed in the past so I gave it a shot. My first thought after watching this movie was that Mr. Potato Head could have portrayed George DuBois with a larger range of emotions. Hell any other male actor could have done this role more justice. The rest of the cast are fantastic in their portrayals and it makes Pattinson's acting the more awkward to watch. Save yourself the time and watch an old favorite instead, I personally ran to sense and sensibility for comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible actor","review":"Uma Thurman and Christina Ricci make this movie. Very good performances by those two, especially Thurman, but this lead \\"actor\\" is horrendous! What a waste of ten bucks. This guy can't act to save his life. The story line is boring. It's tolerable if you enjoy period films, and again, Thurman makes it, but seriously - otherwise, a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a boring movie","review":"I watched this movie cause I liked Rob.

Even PDA is fairly small in size but it is still not very pratical to carry it with you all the time. This watch will make sure you don't miss a meeting and look up an address in an heart beat. If you are a PDA user, you should already get use to charge, hotsync regularly. So, battery life is not really a big concern. If you are very basic PDA (use only calendar & address)user, this watch can even repace your PDA. Only problem with the watch is its size.

Now, they're just another MTV servant, and I dont think we're ever gonna hear another Limp Bizkit album like this one.

They went a little over the top with the...humor though. 9/105. - Uhh, I did not understand the lyrics but the guitar sound is good. 9/106. - Great guitar sound. 10/107. - Uhh... ?/108. - DJ Lethal did pretty good on this song. 9/109. - Good song, but they should of used their own lyrics.10. - Not so good. 5/1011. - This song is ok. 7/1012. - Good lyrics Fred! 10/1013. - Too long, and scary. 5/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not metal","review":"wes borland made a very smart move when he decided to leave this band. this album has no solos, no shredding, no complex time changes, no speed. this album merely takes the stereotypes of metal, like screaming and loudness, and overused rap lyrics and blends them together. sometimes i wonder why this band even has a dj, the absentee member of the band. fred durst and company only get worse on later efforts. but if you like mtv trl nu metal be sure to check this one out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad and sad","review":"My son made me listen to this.

There is precious little talent on this piece of \\"metal.\\" The musical growth of this band cannot even be charted, as it doesn't exist. Songs are formulaic, repetitive, and just simply boring.

I have been a fan of these guys since I heard Nookie at a friend's house and I decided to purchase both cds. I did and liked Significant Other better. Fred Durst has a cool voice.

I would buy Significant Other first and if you REALLY like it buy this one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most hated rock band...","review":"Fred Durst was right at the MTV Music Awards- Bizkit is the most hated rock band in the world. Why? LB songs are as formulaic as those of NSYNCH or the Backstreet Boys. They sound too similar, and Durst doesn't help despite his fervent attempts to tell you he's quite aggressive and has had a hard life with say-nothing lyrics. Big deal. I have no doubt that Bizkit and KoRn and their numerous clones will continue to rock the charts, but one day this CD will look as out of place in your collection as that Slaughter album you've been hiding away."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd rocks!!!","review":"Every song in this cd rocks!

Not only is the production lousy, but everything on the album is out of control and unstable.Wes Borland is definitely a great guitarist, and this album is plenty enough evidence for that, but his heavy riffs and hooks don't mix well with anything. Fred Durst's lyrics are fast and unpredictable, and sometimes unintelligible; half the time you can't understand him. The album is NOTHING like the band's later efforts (\\"Significant Other,\\" \\"Chocolate Starfish\\"), and instead it seems to emulate all the other rap-metal acts that were scurrying around in the late 90's. The result: 60-some minutes of noise. The record's only big hit was the cover of George Michael's \\"Faith\\" ... and Fred Durst still managed to squeeze a \\"Get the f*** up\\" into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Health Warning","review":"Yes Apparently repeated listening causes impotence. Seriously though this is thye apex of Limp Bizkits art, if you can call it that. Difficult to absorb in one sitting yet devoid of any underlying integrity this is an album that will sit umcomfortably in your collection. Until the day your girlfriend drops you for owning it. Take my advice buy Gentle Giants \\"Power and the Glory\\" and see just how drastically Limp Bizkit have failed in their artistic vision. Anyone showing this band sympathy should consider their reasons and question their self esteem.

Do yourselves a favor and just download pollution and find some real music to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Limp Bizkit...some people will tell you you'll either love them or hate them. I'm one of the people stuck in the middle, and not everything Fred and co throw out is for everyone - this is a perfect example of such music.

But after delving deeper into the album, I realized that the music starts to wear off after the initial five tracks. The last eight songs are kept alive by good songs like Faith and the \\"Demo Version\\" of Leech, but still, the CD as a whole fails to reach the high standards set by Korn and Rob Zombie. While this CD is among the best I own, it just can't compare with Korn's latest, Follow the Leader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Trendy....","review":"This album bites... it has 2 good songs on it and one of them they didn't even write they had to go and copy that George Micheal guy. But Counterfeit of those two songs I guess is a good starter for albums to come. But of the 13 songs on the album they can only produce one song on their own that acctually sounds good... so let's put it this way, if they didn't have Korn supporting them do you think they'd be where they are right now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Limp Bizkit can't get any better!","review":"Their guitar parts are awesome in all the songs!

I gave this album a listen a few days ago, and I don't even wanna listen to it again. The only thing that prevented me from burning the piece of **** was that it belonged to my younger brother. Every 'song' in the album sounded the same, and the dumbest song in this album is their cover of George Michael's Faith. It is so terrible George Michael should consider suing the band for turning his song into a utterly pathetic mess.

My thinking was that, since I had suffered so horribly at the hands of this band, a little more pain wouldn't be so bad at all. The \\"songs\\" all sound the same, which is to say bad, and the lead singer's voice has all the musicality of a rusty chainsaw carving up a blackboard. People with plants or pets shouldn't buy this album, because the former will die and the latter will go mad and bite their owners. Avoid this album like the plague!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm.....","review":"When I got this CD and heard it for the first time, I was not impressed.

Why critics and even the band didn't give this album more credit is beyond me. It's raw and has some awesome, utterly underated songs on it. Stalemate is intense and emotional but no one seems to know it's there. Clunk, Leech and Counterfeit are equally as awesome. Apart from the unlistenable last song this album is great - it is to Significant Other what Self-Titled Korn is to Follow The Leader. That is - miles ahead with originality, intensity, emotion and pure heaviness. They;ll never be this good again unfortunately.

The pages are riddled with gramatical errors and misspelt words. Having been put off, I decided to skip around trying to determine if the information contained warranted reading further.

Unfortunately, this does not always make up for the plot problems. He follows his tactic of having the heroes of the movie being follwed along by the unique tag alongs (a wicked witch, an old fat dog, a random kid, and a enchanted scarecrow)who always seem to add sparkle to the movie. While this movie is an achievement, and even better the second time, I enjoyed Spirited Away a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely story with unique perspective","review":"Miyazaki's work has become recognized internationally because of his unique style and complex themes. It may not be for everyone but the story moves along enough for westerners. Howl's Moving Castle isn't perfect but the visuals and characters are entertaining.

The colors are brilliant, the sets are huge and the movement fluid.

Does anyone really want to go see a cartoon about an old woman? I guess they do in Japan, where Moving Castle was a huge hit. But it didn't work for me.The vocal casting for Moving Castle was also butchered having Christian Bale voice the leading male character. His rasping Batman voice was totally wrong for an androgynous teenage character.I guess if this was a half hour long, I wouldn't have been so harsh.

The vivid color palette is pleasing to the eye, and the storyline is beyond warming to the heart. I never cry during films, and I cried. Oh, did I cry. This film is not particularly sad but it warmed me in way I was unprepared for. I blame Miyazaki's gift for my tears. Curse his brilliance!I am only nineteen years old. I like to believe that I was born an old soul for I truly believe some are born young while others old. Old in the sense that you appreciate silence and welcome story time, desire family and enjoy simplicity. I connected to Sophie in a way that I never knew was possible. This film made me feel alive, like when Sophie flew in the morning sky with Howl right after their first meeting.

It is completely different than the movie and will make you like the movie a lot more. It, unlike the movie, has a story you can follow that shares essential details.

Her boring job as a hatter is pushed aside by a magic-filled job as Wizard Howl's old cleaning lady when the horrid Witch of the Waste turns her into an old woman. Sophie's more adventurous as an old woman, which comes in handy as she bargins with Howl and a fire demon, cleans green slime (that's my favorite part!!!), and befriends not only Howl's apprentice and a jumping scarecrow, but also the Witch of the Waste herself!!!

Each one is as awesome as the ones before. I am a huge anime fan and i love the stories and the imagination and the love and comedy. Man! i just love everything. \\"Howl's moving castle\\" was excellent. Billy Crystal as calcifer was just hilarious. he was one of my favorite characters in the movie. Howl....well he was just gorgeous beyond belief. i wish he was really a human being. what made him more hansome and gorgeous was the voice which was played by christian bale he is such a HUNK!!! no doubt about it i give 5 stars to eack movie hayao makes. good luck! MR. Miyazaki."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep them coming Miyazaki","review":"In the stunning events of Howl's Moving Castle, Miyazaki once again takes your breath away in the story, animation and production. Sofi a girl, Howl and enchanted wizard and Calsifir a fire demon embark on a thrilling quest to save themselves from war and the witch of the Waste. It is a heart warming film with thrills traveling through it like electricity through wire, it's what critics are calling \\"beautiful. \\"Stunning, and an adventure beyond imagination and beleif. It will be another big hit like Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and My Neighbor Totoro. keep them coming Miyazaki!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of our favorite movies","review":"love all his movies, we got rid of our vhs tapes and needed this in dvd, my children really missed it"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the same story...","review":"A caveat for anyone who has read Diana Wynne Jone's book, from which this movie was supposedly adapted - this is not the same story. The only thing that remains of the original tale of Howl's moving castle are the names of the characters. Everything else has changed - including the characters themselves, the plot and the entire storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose the book not the movie","review":"If you have read the book *and liked it*, then i recommend that you don't watch this movie. It shares very few things in common with the book, one of which is the title. The plot is almost completely different. It was like the director read the back of the book and then made up a new story."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY THE BOOK READ IT, DON'T WATCH THIS!!!!!!!!","review":"First off this movie was just awful, i cant figure out why Miyazaki even bothered. The casting was awful, they ruined Calcifer the voice of Billy Crystal was the worst possible choice for that character. They took out a whole section of the book and replaced it with nothing. There should not have been a war, and all of the technology is far too advanced, the witch wasn't evil enough and her role in the story was all wrong. So in the end there was nothing good about this movie, i suggest for anyone who is a Miyazaki fan to stick to movies like Spirited Away, Nausica and the Valley of the Wind, and Princess Mononoke. This movie was too disappointing based on the quality of previous Miyazaki films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter rubbish that is an insult to the author","review":"I have seen a lot of movies that did not translate well from the books, but this director has taken so much liberty with the story that I would not even call it an adaptation. It's more like a theft of title and main character names. Diana Wynne Jones's book has very well-developed characters, mysteries that reveal themselves as the book progresses, and an interesting twist at the end, none of which has been preserved in this movie. The entire interesting plot has been omitted in favor of eye candy that doesn't have roots in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"literary nonsense","review":"the move is beautiful but the plot is terrible. everything is totally random and senseless. i guess that's how the japanese define \\"imaginative\\". i felt like i lost 2 hours of my life after the credit role."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a masterpiece!","review":"I just don't understand the appeal. This movie had some beautiful painted backgrounds... but that was about all I liked. The animation was jerky and awful. The characters all looked like girls (especially Howl... what was up with that?!). The casting was bad (again, for Howl... a deep voice like that wouldn't come out of such an effeminate man). The story was so different from the book, and was a lot darker. Sophie's physical age didn't seem to be consistent (was it a continuity problem, or was there something in the script that wasn't explained? The book made more sense in that respect).The book is one of my favourite Diana Wynne Jones novels. I feel like crying with frustration after seeing this movie. It could have been done so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best not the worst","review":"While you can always expect a studio ghibli release to be visually stunning, this one semmed to lack in plot cohesion.

The story is such a fantastic fairly. It's basically about a young girl, who falls in love with a magical wizard boy and they go through a lot of adventures. In order, to be together. The cast features such actors like Billy Crystal and Christian Bale, they did a remarkable job with this movie!!! Do check this movie out!!! You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful English Version!","review":"After seeing this in Japanese with subtitles, I was nervous about an English version. However, the choice of actors for the voices was superb! The english verion of this anime movie is just as riveting and entertaining as the original. Our entire family (from 7 to 62) all enjoyed this fantasy tale immensely. You come to love all the characters even if they do no more than snuffle. This is a movie to be enjoyed on many levels depending on the mood you are in. A definite recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful Miyazaki film!","review":"I loved this movie. Yes, I've read the book, and yes, it is far different from the movie, but I loved them both independently. I read Diana Wynne Jones's book because of this movie. I so loved the film, that I wanted to read the book. Actually, I understood the movie a bit more after reading the book, but I still enjoyed them both immensely on their own--despite the differences.My kids watch this movie over and over again. They love it just as much as Totoro, Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away, and Nausicaa. This is a great Hayao Miyazaki film--and probably one of our favorites. Don't let the negative reviews scare you away. Even if it doesn't stay true to the book, it is still a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"magic charm and friendship","review":"It a strong film of magic and how things are not what they seem it delivers a breath taken story that fill your heart and make you realize that if we just try we can all succeed and be filled with happiness and be friendship is at times all ones has it carry you thru a world were to survive you must learn the way of the magic so it can work with you in the end its a simple as love that make things all well and how it portrait will leave a tear in your eye and a smile on your face"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Story and Beautiful Art","review":"I have to admit I liked this story better than Spirited Away and Princess Monoke. I have ordered the book because of this. I was held spellbound and didn't stop watching until the very end. My kids also loved it and got the messages about the heart and sacrifice and forgiveness. The art of other movies such as Spirited Away is also very beautiful, but this really held me in a trance. My kids want to read the book too, and that is unusual. I think this is slightly shorter than the other two movies I mentioned, and that makes it easier to sit through too all at once. I agree with what is probably the most important message of this story, the heart is a heavy burden, but worth the weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Animation and Color","review":"This is a movie about love, good and evil, wizards, sorcery, and incredible colors. The animation is typical Japanese in its futuristic characters but the tale is warm, involving, and intriguing. This is a movie that all ages go to watch as evident in the movie theatre I attended. And it's a movie to see over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie ever!","review":"i love this movie. the graphics the art the meaning of the movie is fantastic. i also read the book and fell in love. for once i love the book and the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I love this movie and i was dilivered right on time and all in all its just really freaking amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"I saw this movie a couple years ago and bought it for the kids after they fell in love with \\"Ponyo\\".

I love all his films and won't ever get sick of them. I don't know why, it may sound crazy but when i watch his films i feel at a state of peace. The characters are mysterious and dark yet others liven the mood by being funny and bubbly to keep your eyes drawn to the screen. Anyways i know everyone likes different types of genre's so this is only my opinion that not all may agree with. These aren't for 5 year olds to see. Not like it sexual or weird but it would be confusing for them. This ain't no tilly tubbies people) If you like anime BUY IT lol. I seriously watched this with my mother (and know doubt she falls asleep watching cartoons) but she actually stayed awake the entire time and loved the movie! lol so i believe anyone would enjoy this. Yes even your grandmother =]"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"Ridiculous storyline, with characters morphing back and forth, with no clear-cut reason for the timing or purpose. The preposterous \\"castle,\\" which could have been formed by a giant snowball rolling through a waste dump, has doors conveniently opening into alternate realities, providing convenient escapes for the author's story running into otherwise dead ends. One worthy story item--the hero is shown totally exhausted, emotionally and physically, after flying endlessly, saving the world. NOT up to Miyazaki's usual works."},{"rating":"1","title":"For fans of Miyazaki, NOT for fans of the book","review":"I was very excited about this film as a fan of both the book and Ghibli Studios previous works. All the greater the disappointment then, when less than half way through, the story becomes something utterly unrecognizable from the original, several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. What a shame.If you have never read the book and are a fan of Miyazaki, by all means buy this. You're very likely to enjoy the excellent animation and yet another unusual story from him.If you are a fan of the book, steer well clear. You're likely to want to poke Miyazaki with a stick and see if his head turns into a turnip or his turnip into a head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming but not deep","review":"This is a lovely film full of much originality and unexpected developments. Love, forgiveness and kindness are pervasive themes and it is interesting throughout. Miyazaki has a beautiful and rare ability to portray young people in the simplicity of their hearts but does not do so well dealing with the adult world. There is a common theme in his work that adults and especially governments despoil the world in various ways. While there is truth to this I think it is an immature attitude especially on the subject of war.The film makes powerful anti war statements. This might be OK for Japan but is not OK for the children of America who live in a country that temporarily holds the future of mankind in its hands. Howl himself is a warrior. He tells Sophie, \\"I finally have something to fight for.\\" He would not be interesting or heroic without his going to war to defend what needs defending. And that is the key. Sometimes war is necessary to check evil and to defend the innocent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Miyazaki's other titles","review":"This isn't as good as Spritied Away or Princess Mononoke. It's not a bad film but it didn't capture me as well as the other films did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Weird for Me","review":"So many people love and fawn over Japanese animation that I know I'm setting myself up as a target when I say... ugh. Save for the music which was great, I had to force myself to get through this movie. As usual, it looked like the director took 6 different animators, put them in 6 different rooms with 6 different scripts and then patchworked it together. Throw in a few fat women and weird monsters that turn into people and visa versa and voila... you get this movie and countless others just like it. Give me Don Bluth instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good idea, but it needs a handle!","review":"I purchased this for the Kid Tough camera I got my daughter for her birthday coming up. It's a great idea...I can't imagine getting the camera and not getting the case. However, there is no true handle or carrying strap, and that is the only true downfall.

The writing is fun, and the acting is absolutely superb! I especially liked the actress that played Toula's mother, and her saying of how the man is the head, but the woman is the neck and the head cannot turn without the neck is classic and a refreshing attitude to hear from a woman. There's lots of funny situations as Toula's fiance has to contend with her (huge) family. It is more of a 'chick flick' for people who like sports movies or movies with lots of guns and explosions, but it truly is a memorable and fantastic film that never gets old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rolling On The Floor With LAUGHTER!","review":"WARNING TO THE VIEWER:It is NOT ADVISED to view this comedy movie with a FULL BLADDER, lest you EMBARRASS YOURSELF.-------------------------------------------------One of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life.

And it's a bellwether as to why the movie-viewing audience shouldn't be trusted with sharp objects.I stopped watching television a couple of years ago out of disgust with how transparent TV sitcoms are. Everything proceeds in a linear manner, utterly predictable; anyone watching closely will know what the closing punch line will be within the first five minutes. And this movie is nothing but an extended situation comedy.It has good visuals, admittedly, and a broader palette than low budgets permit sitcoms, but its narrative structure and character development could have been done by the creative team at UPN. And I never really did care about the characters or what happened to them; I never overcame the notion that they were self-centered no-accounts.Don't waste your time with this claptrap. If you feel you absolutely must watch something of this breed, it will come to your house for free if you just turn on network television."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Big Fat Greek Waste of Time","review":"While this movie was technically done well, I just hated it. There were no issues with plausibility or lapses in plot line. Cinematography and all aspects were good. My beef is with the story.I just didn't care. The director and the writer did a lousy job of making me care about any character at all. I didn't laugh even once while watching this movie. I didn't think anything presented was new or novel or innovative in any way shape or form.For the life of me I can't understand why so many people rave about this film. Knowing what I know now, I would rather read product labels on household cleaners than watch this movie.I appreciate all the hard work that went in to this movie.

My mother's large, loving and loud Hispanic family resembles Toula's large, loving and loud Greek family, while my dad's small, conventional, quiet Caucasian family represents Ian's small, conventional, quiet Caucasian family. \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" was delightful and charming.

I guess it shouldn't, but it does amaze me that it did so well. If you like Gilligan's island, or I dream of Jeannie, go for it.

Her agents should decide whether she's a big fat Greek mother or a big fat Jewish mother already!I made my girlfriend promise that if we ever happen upon another turkey like this one in our moviegoing lives, we will immediately go to the nearest Schwartzenegger or Snipes flick so I can wash the foul taste out of my brain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotype gone haywire","review":"The first few minutes were promising and then the stereotyping got to be very embarassing. \\"Look we greeks are funny and weird haha.\\" Laughing at oneself can be a virtue but not if one is trying to make oneself look like a martian.Anyway, I couldn't get thru this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh...","review":"Eh, I don't get it.

As a child of immigrant parents, I know the world of this film intimately and can thus justifiably say without reservation that it distorts all the genuine aspects of the Greek-American experience in favor of cheap laughs due to easy ethnic stereotypes and standard Hollywood cliches. Many of the central characters are not played by Greeks, and their portrayals come off as phony as their accents, especially Andrea Martin. In fact, almost the entire movie fails to capture Greekness in any real sense, with the only exception of the hard-headed father's cold relationship with his artistically inclined son. Forget this movie and see MONSOON WEDDING instead: it is everything that MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, I was hoping for more.","review":"I really wanted to enjoy this movie. My wife loved it with her friends and it sounded to be a winner. But to no avail. This movie was not that funny and certainly is not hilarious.

This is like watching a long, bad comedy routine by one of those untalented, solipsistic thirty somethings that always seem to end up plugging up the stand-up blocks on the Comedy Channel. How pathetic and childish! This movie would make a bad episode of Doctor Katz. Plus it co-stars the \\"Ford Guy\\", the worst corporate spokesman in recent memory, as the great WASP Prince. Ugly!

Simply put, it is funny. Do I think it is necessarily indicative of all aspects of Greek American life? No. However there are a lot of aspects that are true to life. The fact that the father makes everyone aware of the Greek root words is absolutely true to our lives. The part that I didn't find so accurate is the way the grandmother \\"yiayia\\" was regarded. What the Greeks went through with the Turks is in no way funny and is much like poking fun at the Holocaust.

Thanks Rita Wilson for seeing the play and helping this film be made and getting it out to us the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's so Greek","review":"This is a sweet one. You really have a big heart for her & her family *the WHOLE family*. Michael Constantine, who played Gus Portacalos, Toula's father, was incredible. He is absolute Greek! I also enjoyed this movie since Toula isn't a model with minor problems. She starts out as homely, working in her father's restaurent. Then she ends up as an attractive woman, but she still isn't all glamour, or perfect. This seemed much more realistic than the other romantic flicks, which are so fake, it's repulsive. This is a nice twist to the norm. You feel attached to her whole family, and you can relate so well, you just want to celebrate. OPA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing comedy!","review":"Although I am always told I have a great sense of humor, I very rarely laugh out loud. This rule is especially true when I watch movies. However, I have to hand it to the men and women who created 'My Big Fat Greek Weeding' for creating a comedy which gave me a number of great laughs.The story itself seems morose when it is told, however, just like my friends did for me, I guarantee you you will enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie watcher","review":"like other reviews, i thought this movie was entertaining, but not worth buying or renting. i don't understand why people are so \\"gung ho\\" on this one. i would of rather seen it on cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable Escapism","review":"What a pleasent escape of a movie. Its been a while since something was so uplifting as this movie. I saw people laughing hysterically, crying, and clapping. We need more movies like these in the trying times.

I think i will"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Greeks DO Like this Film","review":"I have to say how much I loved this film. Not only as an enthusiastic moviegoer but also as a Greek American. It is easy to see how people of all cultures relate to this family-oriented film. Additionally, every Greek that I know, including my father who ws born and raised in Greece, loves this film. There is no greater advertisement for the richness and beauty of the Greek culture. If you are one of the few people who did not see this film, I highly recommend it as a funny feel-good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Nia Vardalos certainly is a new queen of comedy as pictured in her self-written film My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Funny, hilarious. AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This movie was a well kept secret until enough people realized how great it is. It is hilarious and shows that even though Greeks are considered \\"white\\" people, they are minorities living within a majority group. Their culture and humor is well displayed in this film and after watching this film you really do get the sense that the director (who is Greek) made this film will personal love and care. This is also a great movie for any woman who's ever felt like their life is at a dead end. I highly recommend this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Big Fat Greek Wedding","review":"I donno......Did I miss the point of this movie....I meant most of it was pointless jokes poking fun of the people who aren't greek....I personally didn't find it amusing.....the old grandma did get me going a few times but that's about it.....I don't think it's worth your time and the movie isn't all it's hyped up 2 be"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny!","review":"This movie was boring! this movie dragged! and to much hype for nothing! also made to much money.....

Well, I wasn't. I really enjoyed it, and it was definitely \\"cute\\", but I've seen lots of other films that really did blow me away compared to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie","review":"Even for me, a guy who normally likes shoot 'em up action films, I found this film really warming.

But has some funny moments, if you refuse to ever take it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I disliked this movie intensely for one main reason, It's story was like a rejected sitcom pilot. The jokes and situations were so predictable and lame that I could actually say the jokes before the actors.There could have been a much better story there if only it was cultivated and polished with a little more care.I found the stereotyping of Greek and English family life offensive and inaccurate. Being familiar with both cultures, I feel I am right in my assessment.If you are looking for a basic story, with below average acting and writing, then perhaps you will enjoy this film. I for one, thought it was incredibly, unbelievably bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"my big fat greek wedding","review":"my big fat greek wedding is one of my FAVORITE MOVIES ever. it is soooo great! with the funny habits of tulu's family to the run away turkish grandmother, laughs are guarenteed in this movie. the romantic aspect of the story is cute as can be and will fill ur heart with warmth. this movie is 5 stars and u should DEFINETLY WATCH IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big fat bore","review":"I sure wish I had paid attention to the negative reviews before I bought this. I'm as much a fan of romances, Cinderella stories, and light comedy as the next person. I enjoyed Sleepless in Seattle and Moonstruck, among others. But My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a big fat waste of time and money. The story is empty, dull, routine, and devoid of charm, despite the appealing cast (who were wasted in this dud of a screenplay.) It was like watching romance for the Romper Room set - there was no subtlety at all, no rich threads running throughout the plot, just a dull, straightforward tale that I didn't want to see through to the end. Even the Cinderella part of the story was over in the span of 5 minutes - she put on some new clothes and makeup and voila, a lifetime of feeling left out and she was completely transformed. And 5 minutes later, the man of her dreams was hers, just like that. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry, I just wondered when it would get interesting. It never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment.","review":"I watched this movie hoping it would live up to all the hype and it didn't. The only funny part about this movie was the old Grandmother from Greece sneaking out of the house and drinking. This was a sad remake of the dorky girl get's the guy kind of movie. I made the mistake of buying it before renting it and now it just collects dust!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Light hearted entertaining, but....","review":"not as polished (technically, as well as artistically) as some of the romantic comedies of the past.

I didn't laugh once in the whole movie, maybe smiled a feel times but that's it!The script is average and the acting slow, emotionless and totally uncompelling. The plot was a good idea, just a shame that the movie turned out to be a total waste of time. What people see in this I really do not know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar, full of cheap sex jokes and racist humor","review":"All of the characters in this film commit blasphemy in the big church desecration scene that should scare off parents interested in a good family film. The orgy scene at the Greek restaurant was tasteless and unnecessary. I enjoyed the crude joke about the donkey but thought they went too far during the \\"diaper\\" party. Offensive to the max but the lead actress was a babe."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE","review":"Let me get this out here...I'm Greek. I have a Greek family. When I watched this movie, I felt as if I was home again. The characters are funny and a little over-the-top, yet not unbelievable. Nia Vardolas does a wonderful job as the little Greek girl who wishes she wasn't \\"so Greek\\" because she is so different from all the other little girls. With her family always intruding in her life and a love interest who is completely understanding, it makes her life fun to watch as it unfolds.Highly recommended to anyone whose family is maybe just a little hard to believe at times. You'll feel comforted in knowing that you are no alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A laugh a minute","review":"This is without doubt the funniest film that I have seen in years the cast are superb. I can only say one word that discribed this film. \\"Umpah\\"From Shaun in England"},{"rating":"2","title":"442 Five Star Reviews -- and counting!","review":"No! It's not Shakespeare! (By the way, do you know he was Greek?) But, it sure is one of the funniest, most heart-warming movies I've seen in years. If you are Greek, Italian, German, Irish or Anything, you will see something of your family in this film. More importantly, it will leave you with a feeling of hope for the world, because we all share these family relationships in one way or another.Yet another reason My Big Fat Greek Wedding is one of the best feel-good movies around is that it pokes fun at the characters and their relationships without a touch of nastiness or venom.This movie absolutely belongs in every family's DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see!","review":"It is no fluke this movie is so popular. A wonderful story with good hearted humor. No stupid race or sex jokes just for the laugh, but family humor about a funny family. A great cast who did their jobs in an award winning fashion - they made their characters very real and believable. The hour and a half went by in a flash. You will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny movie","review":"I only own one DVD. Guess which one it is. Yes, it's My Big Fat Greek Wedding. It's a great movie. The movie is suitable for children but I don't think they would understand the humor. I think this movie is better for 13 and up. Buy the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to see this movie!!!","review":"I first saw My Big Fat Greek Wedding alone on the big screen. I had no idea that it would be such a hit.Nia Vardalos does an incredible job about bringing out the humor in what it means to be a Greek American. I laughed before things were even said in the movie -- the Greek school scene, the Greek \\"boys\\" her dad wants her to marry, the brother, and the pomp & circumstance of the wedding. This is a funny movie, I think for non-Greeks, but for Greeks, it's a must. You have to see this movie. How often does anyone make a movie about Greek Americans anyway??That being said, the dialogue could have been improved. Ian was a bit boring and flat of a character. I suppose that was the point, seeing as we were supposed to \\"see\\" Toula better. I think if Vardalos had realized what a hit she had on her hands, there would have been more polish on the movie. As it is, it is a diamond in the rough -- more or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but not as great as people are saying","review":"This movie was \\"ok\\" but not great. Michael Constantine steals the movie about a nerdy girl who works in a travel agency. One day she is attracted to a man that looks in. The man happened to be someone she waited on in her father's Greek restaurant. She decides to pretty herself up and then starts to date the man.There is a clash of culture as his family is definately not Greek. The Greek family is shown to be very large and fun going while the young man's family is very stiff and proper.The highlight of the movie is the constant wanderings of the girl's grandmother and her father's constant insistance that every word in the English language comes from a Greek root.I liked it but I was not overwhelmed by it like some people. Still it is better than a lot of the new movies out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really funny if you are not Greek, HYSTERICAL if you are...","review":"After recently enduring a big fat Greek wedding of my own, I was eagerly anticipating the release of this film. Nia Vardalos captured the endearing nutsy-ness of the paragon Greek-American family. Her intent, I'm sure, is to paint a broad caricature of all things Greek, to hilarious results. My non-Greek husband and my Greek self were rolling in the aisles. I literally laughed until I cried. A little bit of interesting info - Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson had a hand in this film (producers maybe?). And with good reason, Rita Wilson is Greek and they had a big fat Greek wedding of their own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Opa!","review":"Quite simply, this is the finest comedy in a long, long, time! Nia's autobiographical one-woman play comes to the screen and it blows all of the other overblown, overhyped films off the map. Here was a film that I thought was destined to remain in the art house but this weekend, it was released in many theatres. And it deserves such wide exposure. The audience, both men and women, was laughing constantly. My wife and I are going to see it again and we can't wait until the DVD arrives. Now, where is the soundtrack album? The wonderful Greek music makes you want to dance. Just like \\"Moonstruck\\" made you wish you were Italian, \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" will make you wish you were Greek."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best ...ever..","review":"This is the funniest, most romantic, real movie I have ever watched. The story following the Greek music is so fantastic that I watched it twice in a week and still addicted to it.If you want a 'lift me up' story to watch, this is it! This is it! If you don't believe me, lend it first from the video shop and buy later..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't get into it...","review":"I think I was a victim of the media hype here... maybe this could have been an enjoyable film, but I simply couldn't get into it... it was not at all what I expected. I found the characters dull and a bit annoying and needy, and the stereotypes were a bit too thick for my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet movie, but ...","review":"After watching this movie with my family and friends, we've come up with our own verdict that there is no trace of amusement. Even I personally thought about this movie to be funny and culturally interesting, I found it's hard to believe this movie was a big hit when it first came out. Use your own judgement, not some critiques on TV or magazines.Use the Windex !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but Predictable","review":"This movie tries to hard to be cute and funny. I liked some parts to it and the characters were likeable enough. The father with his Windex for every solution was funny. I just could not get into the whole movie. It's a nice movie, but it's a little predictable. If you want some fluff, this is it for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie was motivating. It related to the real world. How theirs people in life that are along for a long time, and finally the man of their dreams comes along."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want a good laugh, this is it!","review":"At the beginning of the movie, Nia Vardalos (Toula) is a plain, 30-plus young Greek woman, whose parents despair of her ever finding a nice Greek man to marry. They are so entrenched in their own ethnicity that imitations of Greek statues adorn their lawn and Toula's father can prove that every word in the English language originally comes from Greek. Nia persuades her parents to let her attend college and she has a physical transformation which leads to a romance with an engaging Anglo teacher, played by John Corbett. There is a predictable clash of cultures when the two young lovers meet one another's families and the working out of these problems is the meat of the film. Toula vacillates between love and embarrassment for her large family who talk too loud, eat too much, and get into each other's business. If you need a good laugh and a \\"feel-good\\" movie, this one's for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and warm","review":"I really like this movie. It started off kind of unbelievable to me. The character starts off so mousy and within like 2 minutes we are supposed to believe she has done a 180 and be a completely different person after 30 years of being one way. I didn't really buy it at first. I then had a scary thought that I would be like Elaine in Seinfeld, the episode where everyone loves and raves about the movie the English Patient and I would be the only one who hated it.But then I started to get into the movie and ended up really being pleased with the direction that it took. I felt for these characters and the grandmother was hysterical. I loved the way it ended and it just left me feeling very warm and wishing I belonged to a family and large and crazy as the family portrayed here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best comedy of the past ten years...SO GOOD","review":"If u r depressed, sad and moody this film is the ultimate solution. The stories involved in this film can not make you avoid to laught all time. It is a combination of the Greek things that we all love and their contradiction in the North American society. I can not believe it how good I felt after watching this film. It has also very good soundtrack and very good cinematographic approach...."},{"rating":"2","title":"my big fat greek wedding is a very good movie.","review":"this movie has clean fun, great acting, a very plainplot with very little conflicts. furthermore, there are nonudity, sex and violence scenes.

It received a lot of good word of mouth for some reason but really it stunk. The stars are not appealing at all. The humor is not creative at all. Think of every movie that you see about some ethnic group and they have them all in this movie.

Contrived and unfunny and bland. Lainie Kazan as the mother was almost certainly cast because she played an almost identical role as the ethnic mother to an embarrassed and Americanized offspring in MY FAVORITE YEAR. See MY FAVORITE YEAR (starring Peter O'Toole) if you want to see what this film SHOULD have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and banal soap","review":"There isn't any original idea in this film, it is too boring for a comedy and too predictable for any other genre. It is amazing that films like this are produced - couldn't they do anything more challenging or at least entertaining for the mind for the money they spent on making the film? It doesn't even have a soothing effect of a good laugh becuase it irritaes after 10 min with its pathetic stereotypes and clichés. And at the end, the happy end , of course. I felt that Forrest Gump was the director, and indeed it is Tom Hanks's film. Bravo to the extreme banality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very True Very Insulting","review":"This movie reiminds me of my 43 years of trying to understand Greeks. They are so involved in their conception that they are the best and so correct in all things that they have completely lost their brilliant beginnings. This is not pretend this is how they really are. Any non Greek is expected to make all the concessions and is treated like a non existant. To this day they don't know my name. Any person (even from their own culture) who tries to tell them that they have lost their remarkable beginnings is discredited in everyway. This culture that was the enlightenment of democracy doesn't treat its women equal. They even use their church to push their confused ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks to high heaven","review":"This is shameful and a real waste of my time. Not to say anything of the several youngsters I babysit regularly. Let me tell you, they'll watch just about anything and keep quiet, so when they fidgeted for the entire 90 minutes of this movie... well, I knew something was wrong.This movie almost literally filled the room with an offensive odor. The acting is uniformly stilted, especially from Nia Vardolos. Yes, I can say that John Corbett is quite a studmuffin but so is Fabio. You don't see him pretending to act in hit movies.The clash of cultures (Greek and W.A.S.P.) has been explored far better in numerous other films. I really felt sorry for some of the better actors (such as Vardolos's character's mother and father), because I think they would have been better served if the script was more insightful. This movie is too cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grotesque","review":"With all due respect to those who embraced this film, I have to say that I couldn't believe how horrible this film was. The Greeks were all made to look ugly. The one character's description of coughing up what was to be her twin at birth nauseated me for days. The script is worn out and unfunny. The groom's parents are presented as the typical uptight WASPs. If I were Greek, I would be insulted by this film. As an Irish/Italian mix, I would be outraged were either side presented in this manner. For me, this is a disturbingly moronic film."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY BIG FAT DISAPPOINMENT","review":"I bought this movie based on all the hype and was truly disappointed. A couple of funny moments but certainly not enough to carry this movie.I always enjoy Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan and Andrea Thomas but again their comedics not enought to carry this movie.

Like many other male reviewers here, I had to be dragged to this one.But I'm glad I was.This movie is very funny but it's also very poignant and most immigrant families will be able to relate to it.Nina Vardalos is very sweet and dare I say, quite sexy.

The other side of this review is that my younger brother and his girlfriend loved.....so....this is one of those \\"love it or hate it,\\" movies......better than renting it, I'm sure one of your friends got suckered into buying this.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Predicable but sweet and funny hit!","review":"Sure you go into it knowing the girl gets the guy, and there is a big wedding at the end, but the ride to get there sure is hilarious. Toula is someone we can all relate to, whether we knew an \\"ugly duckling\\" in our lives or we were one ourselves! She is sensitive and shy, yet confident and determined, and her love and respect for family and the values that keep them together is truly endearing. The story has been told before, especially in teen movies with Freddie Prinze Jr., but this one seems to grab you by the heartstrings with some very touching scenes and there were parts that made us laugh so hard we nearly cried! You might not like the stereotypes, but it's all in fun and any nationality can really relate to the way customs are perpetuated in one way or another. You'll even enjoy the music here.

Up until that point I though my mother would hava a coronary trying to get me married off to any person with any Greek blood in them, but back to the film...The characters really portray the feelings/emotions/ideals I grew up with good or bad, although I don't get the Windex thing. They act like the people I grew up with, even the senile grandmother. They look like REAL people, the only one with Hollywood great looks is John Corbett.This is a really funny \\"feel good\\" movie.

Don't go to the theater--and don't buy it till AFTER you've rented it, or you're wasting your money! Yes, it was 'cute', I guess, if you can get past the fact that it was BORING!!!! This is a SIMPLE movie. Nothing too entertaining here.1smileycat :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh or bust!","review":"I laughed so hard when I watched this movie that I thought I would explode! I know Greek people who don't live in Greece (they live here) and they are a lot like this. It is very believable and very funny. The kind of funny I like, taking the funny things in every day life and showing them. Yes yes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flick!","review":"This was by far the most entertaining movie I saw in 2002. I laughed alot, and I even cried a couple of times. This is one of those movies that I just didn't want to end.As for the people who reviewed the movie and critisized it for not reflecting what Greek people are really like; THIS IS A MOVIE. THIS IS ENTERTAINMENT. The characters are exaggerated, yes, but again, this is to entertain us, not to attempt to educate us on Greek culture. Get over it!Everybody should see this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was as real as it gets. Excellent flick!","review":"As a fellow 1st generation American and 100% Greek, I assure you that the movie was a replay of my life. My whole family laughed. We thought it was terrific. I guarantee you will definately enjoy it. We rarely purchase movies, but this one is a keeper. I've seen it twice and loved it more the second time. My children were in hysterics, because they were able to identify characters with their own family members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good jokes but too long !","review":"This movie is a simple story with funny individuals.No real antagonism. It's an easy plot where there is no conflict, where everybody is kind and life is beautiful.Some of the dialogues are quite funny but in my opinion you need more to make a good comedy.The end is too long because there is nothing interesting happening.It's finally as if you see the same joke during the whole movie.Some characters are really too flat.Fortunately i see this movie for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where were the DVD extra features?","review":"The movie was cute, but why bother with the DVD if they don't use the technology that's available. Luckily I had read an explanation about the Windex, so I was able to appreciate the humor there, but why no deleted scenes or other fun stuff? We were a bit disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat cute...but irritating","review":"I'm a non-Greek living in Greece. Some of the things in the film that were supposed to be funny...AREN'T when you have to listen to them on an almost daily basis. For example, many Greeks really do believe that their language pre-dates all other languages. It may seem like nothing more than the rantings of an eccentric old man who also believes that Windex is a cure-all. However, this sort of pseudo-scholarship is very common over here, and not at all charming in reality. Maybe a Greek could find it humorous to poke fun at that, but anyone who has been invited to someone's home only to hear a lecture on how their language is \\"poor\\" compared to Greek...won't find it very amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Bother","review":"This movie is all hipe and no action. Some funny parts, but over all this movie is a waste of time. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A toast to ethnic families, and the WASPs who love them!","review":"This is a terrific movie, full of laughs and ruefully realistic to those of us from ethnic families. Everyone in the ensemble does a great job, and it's interesting that Toula's mom is played by Lainie Kazan (who is Jewish), her aunt by Andrea Martin (who is Armenian) and her cousin Angelo by Joey Fatone (Italian): a perfect fit for all. In my family, we cheerfully absorb the WASPs who marry in by hitting them with a combination of food, fun, and love -- and it works! In this movie, the WASPs lighten up just fine; it's only the Turks that are \\"dissed\\"-- no problem there.Thanks, Tom and Rita, for producing this movie. Notice that at the wedding reception, the song \\"All My Only Dreams\\" from the movie \\"That Thing You Do!\\" is playing as the bride and groom enter. Just one of the clever touches in this worthy film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Fat Overrated Wedding","review":"This movie was beyond overrated and I have no idea why everyone was ranting and raving over it. What is so fascinating about being \\"Greek\\"? They put so much emphasis on the Greek issue it was like they were begging for acceptance or something. Just be proud of who you are. I also think this movie was sending the message that if you marry someone \\"non-ethnic\\" and blonde and blue eyed that your whole life will magically improve and be complete. Yeah, whatever. None of the dialogue was funny, and in fact, this movie was sincerely boring. Maybe this truely is a \\"chic flick\\". I don't know of any men that would like this movie and if there is, I would be very surprised. I hope the new TV show based on the movie is more entertaining than this thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"funniest 2002 movie","review":"This movie is so funny.It's a clean movie. It makes you forget the outside world. The movie shows that people with opposite beliefs can over look things with love and laughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a hoot!","review":"Ha!I had the pleasure of watching this movie on this past Sunday night which is Thanksgiving here in Canada... Anyways, my Father, Mother and fiance and I all went to watch the 9pm showing of My Big Fat Greek Wedding... I hadn't heard a thing about it because I don't have cable but my parents had heard that it was great. So taking my chances I tagged along. The first couple of minutes I was wondering if this was going to be any good but was I ever pleasantly surprised. I didn't stop laughing the whole time. Hey I come from a somewhat crazy family of my own so seeing this made my day. Those who didn't enjoy this movie you need to lighten up a little! Nobody is perfect and it is amazing how your family can run things even when it wasn't what you planned. Hey I may not be a Greek but I am half German and well you know! So go watch the movie and try not to tempt yourself to try the Windex cure all! I am still trying to stop myself from trying to use it!Kate"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"What can I say, that hasn't already been said about this wonderful movie? My Big Fat Greek Wedding is funny, simplistic and satisfying. This film is testament to the fact that good movies don't need sex or violence to be entertaining. Everyday life and everyday people are funny enough to create a blockbuster. Luckily, I own this DVD and can watch this movie anytime I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a big deal","review":"I saw this movie when it was first released last year and honestly, it didn't make a very big or very good impression on me at all. Sure, Nia Vardalos and John Corbett are likable enough in their roles as culturally-crossed lovers and yes, I was glad that the filmmakers took the time to point out that there IS love out there for girls who aren't 18-year-old waifs--but other than that, I didn't see much to like about this movie at all. Toula's family is portrayed in the most unrealistic, stereotypical, over-the-top way imaginable with no real character development whatsoever. And worst of all, most of the movie isn't even funny! A chuckle here and there but for the most part I was sitting in the theater bored and/or annoyed. All in all it was a disappointing film-- and months later, I am baffled by it's popularity. This movie is worth a rent, maybe, but certainly not worthy buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Big Fat Stupid Movie","review":"I totally agree with another reviewer that the success of this movie has got to be one of the biggest mysteries of the century. I was so excited to see it after all the hype. I wanted to like it! I tried. But I was sorely dissapointed in it. First of all, Nia Vardalos is a mediocre actress. The constant blank look on her face throughout the movie just got on my nerves as did the way she would move her eyes from side to side like Jack Black's character on \\"Shallow Hal\\" (cuckoo! cuckoo!). The chemistry between her and John Corbett was non-existant. The windex thing got old. The fact that \\"Ian\\" had to alter his complete identity in order to be included in the family was ridiculous. Yes, there were a few laughs . . . but that was it. This movie doesn't hold a candle to Moonstruck, When Harry Met Sally, or any other great film that comes to mind. It is an insult to intelligent people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"You'll never go broke underestimating the etcetera...\\"","review":"As a purported romantic comedy, this unimaginative slog fails on all counts. There's no \\"meet-cute\\", there's no dramatic conflict, there's isn't even a character arc. What there is, however, is 90 minutes of cheap, weak Greek stereotypes recycled from some justifiably forgotten sitcom. The whole exercise is inoffensive and mild to the point of mild offense. Of your two grandmas, the dimwitted one will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drop Dead Boring","review":"This should be called \\"Two boring [...]hook up\\". The guy even admits that his life was empty and dull before he met her. Is that the kind of guy you would want to marry? Yech. [...]. This movie had no tension, no climax, a few [...] giggles, no real reason to watch it. Hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment","review":"What a great job of acting by Michael Constantine and Lane Kazan! They were just outstanding and made the viewing what it was.The plot is truly American, and maybe points out some of the problems we're now having. Greek people trying desparately to remain Greek in America's melting pot.Over time this is beauty of our country and this film. That Greek girl can fall in love and be loved so wonderfully by non-Greek. The dangers of multi-culturalism lurk and threaten to destroy this great thing we call the United States of America.Didn't want it to stop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this supposed to be funny?","review":"Okay All I've heard was how funny this movie was supposed to be. Well after sitting through it, I'm still waiting for the punch line. If anyone finds it, will they let me know where it is? This movie was almost painful to sit through, and felt more like a documentary then anything else. My buddy and I both sat there scratching our heads. His girl didn't even think it was so great, and this was a quintessential chick-flick! Guys, beware,and steer clear! You were warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't BELIEVE this film made bank","review":"This film is complete tripe. Not only would it not pass Robert McKee's muster, it has nothing but stereotypical, 2 dimensional characters. It is a Canadian embarassment. The testament to this is how quickly the seies fell from grace. One of the MANY problems in this film is the fact that Nia and her husband-to-be simply fold to the desires of the family. She completly gives herself over to her stereotypical family's desires. Disgusting. Not a celebration of Greek culture, rather a racist and trite look at a story no one REALLY cares about."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Big Fat Greek Wedding","review":"This movie was a total disappointment. An idea that could have been charming has been turned into something gross. The grooming details of the bridal party were more than most viewers would care to see in a romantic comedy. Also, the male and female leads aren't believable. He's entirely too attractive for her, even after the makeover. If I were a Greek-American, I would want to sue the producer. This movie really puts it to them. This could have been charming. It was raunchy."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is so great about this movie","review":"I rented this movie hoping to die laughing from what I'd heard about it. This movie is awful. There is no plot or character development, not to mention that for some reason the guy falls in love with her after seeing her in the shop. But why, it looked like they only gone out a few times.The family is absolutely irratating and one demensional. Im a black woman so i dont know any greek people, this does not give me a good impression of their culture. Do all greek people try to force their children into a crapy life where they are unhappy with no career goals, only allow them to marry other greeks and talk constantly about the greek routes of words? I hope not. I cant see how anyone in their right mind found this movie entertaining, it really made no sense or had any point. And what is with the Windex???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly overrated movie","review":"After reading a number of reviews of this movie I ordered it. This movie was a great letdown for me--actually a waste of time viewing it. I plan to resell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this movie get so big?","review":"This movie is titled a comedy, but I didn't laugh once when I saw it in the theater. As a matter of fact, it is one of only 2 movies I have ever walked out on. The acting was decent, but not great by any means, and after sitting through well over and hour of this movie, I couldn't take any more of it"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Big Fat Stupid Movie","review":"This movie is neither funny nor clever. This movie takes itself too seriously. It recycles the same stale old jokes could be written about any ethnic group to the same effect. The characters are basic but exaggerated to the point of being to grotesque and unbelievable. The plot line has been done so many times that you can recite it in your sleep. There is nothing new here. If you want to see a clever, edgy movie that is actually funny, see Barbershop."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big fat disappointment","review":"My tag line pretty much sums it up.I had heard this movie was hysterically funny, and I wasn't laughing much at all.Actually not many people were laughing when I saw this story of an \\"ugly duckling\\" who comes out of her shell and comes into her own. It's a coming of age, which I can appreciate.Seeing as a Greek person, the star of the film, Nia Vardalos, wrote the screenplay, the portrayals of the Greek family must be right on. Well, I felt saddened by there behavior. I thought since Toula(Nia Vardalos) was coming into her new brave world that she would have put her foot down and had her wedding her way instead of her family's way. They entirely took over everything. It just bothered me to watch her allow this cuz they are \\"family\\".A big letdown of a movie. Avoid!! It's not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Drivel","review":"I had heard so many wonderful things about this film and was quite anxious to see it. When I finally did I found it to be rather disapointing. The jokes were inanely obvious and played into tired stereotyping. Perhaps most irritating is that this film really had no plot - a thirtiesh woman meets a thirtiesh man, they have a relationship and get married. The only character development was the father's reluctant acceptance of the young man into the family. Hardly worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME","review":"I vote this as one of the worst movies of ALL TIME. Not just because of its unfunny story, or bad acting, but because it was enormously popular, for some unknown reason. I'm still completely shocked that nearly everyone IN THE ENITRE WORLD thought this movie was hilarious. No, I'm not Greek, and no, I haven't been married. I'm sure most of the people that saw and loved this movie weren't either. I've been able to relate more to films made in the 40's set in other countries than to this rubbish. EVERY bit of this movie was nearly unwatchable. HA HA WINDEX IS FUNNY. HAHA GREEK PEOPLE ARE FUNNY. Any movie with an N'Sync member in it should be avoided, especially with that fist-clenching smug smile on his unimpressive face."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best greek wedding","review":"While sitting in the theatre i watched the people around me as i was laughing so loud. I noticed they were laughing as well and you couldn't help it. I think Nia Varadalos did the movie justice she was very down to earth and then appeared like a butterfly so beautiful yet so gentle in her character. I highly recommend you see this movie and if you are over 40 I encourage it as it is good clean humor. This is what humor was all about years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to be Greek to love this movie!!!","review":"What a great movie!!!! I think everyone can relate to this film. There isn't one person in the world that doesn't have an over bearing mothering or domineering father and nosy family members. Grab a friend and see this movie. Don't wait for the video or you'll be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good comedy","review":"If you're a movie fanatic like I am, you've gotta see this. Good movie, but I expected a lot more comedy out of it based on everybody else's comments. It's got the really funny parts such as how akward the family is (it seems like everybody has a totally different personality). However it's pretty strong for a PG rated movie, as some scenes suggest sexual relations between an un-married couple. I recommend it for a 12 years & older audience, sadly. However it's very enjoyable for that age group!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Move","review":"This movie is very funny and entertianing. You will fall in love for this big fat greek family and wish that you could be part of it. Well maybe not. At least know it.The windex joke was the highlight of the movie for me. YOull want to watch this one more then once."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Big Fat Greek Hit","review":"\\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" is not only a very funny comedy, but one of the few comedies these days appropriate for young and old alike, free of gross-out jokes or crude humor, and clever with many insights into human nature and cultural clash. Anyone who is in a bi-ethnic marriage (myself included) will be rolling on the floor with laughter. This is a rare, one-of-a-kind movie that should not be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"always rent first","review":"Perhaps I made a mistake in not going to see this movie while it was in theaters. That being said, I took to heart all of the wonderful reviews, the appearence on Oprah and the recommendations of total strangers that this movie was the HIT of the year! I believed in them so well that instead of renting the movie, I went out and purchased it post haste! Big mistake....I'm now watching the movie for the 2nd time in an attempt to marvel in the hysterical comedic perceptions reported to be caused by this movie.

Those elements are the pillars of its appeal. Although the family in question is Greek, you could easily insert Jewish, Italian, Hispanic, etc. I refused to see this movie when it first came out even though urged to do so by my parents. I thought it would be a melodramatic waste of time and money. I recently was \\"trapped\\" into seeing it on a cruise ship by my friends. Upon return home, I ordered the DVD. This is a very funny and satisfying film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most hillarious movie EVER!!!!","review":"This movie is so funny you will want to watch it a milllion times.

A city that has produced bands such as the Smashing Pumpkins and Local H now has a new band to be pround of. From the opening track of \\"They can't save us now\\" this band keeps the listener wanting more. The single \\"Kennedy\\" is just a beutiful piece of song writting about glamour and the hollowness of being famous. Additionally songs such as \\"Unwanted\\" and \\"Boys and Girls\\" change the mood of the CD from The Cure type of influences and add some uptempo beats in the vein of Blink 182. Overall, a must have CD and a band to anticipate much from in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kill Hannah is awesome","review":"Kill Hannah is one of the best new bands out there right now. They have a unique sound, which is really unlike most bands I've ever heard. Mat has a very nice voice, very soothing and sexy.

Pitiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosmic lullabies","review":"Granted, this isn't actually music. But the sound etched onto this CD is a glorious one, like stars conversing to each other across space. It sounds reverent, glistening, and multidimensionally spacious. And all it is is guitar feedback and amp noise. This is the only CD I can actually fall asleep to; actual music keeps my attention and thereby keeps me awake, but this stuff just streams out of the speakers and flows over you like radiant waves. Not for everyone, sure, but I like it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulsating pieces of feedback","review":"The band leaned all of their instruments against their amps (to drown out the metal band recording upstairs at the studio), patched in a beatbox thru the p.a., and turned up all volumes to maximum. Later mixed it into smaller pieces. Nice pieces, but sometimes they don't extend as long as I wished they did. Proceeds to the album go to the suicide prevention hotline, by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure white noise bliss","review":"Sonic Youth do best lately when they either stick to pure noise or pure pop. This is of the former category, and it has that wonderfully soothing noise of the best tracks off their recent SYR discs. For those who tire of Thurston's current fascination with the Grateful Dead, and Kim's tired free-association 'beat' schtick, this is for you. And no 'song' lasts longer than 6 minutes!

Beth and Cesare, from two very different worlds - literally, meet and fall desperately in love on a Greek island, then continue their romance both in Cesare's Italy and Beth's America. Tradition, ambition & cultural expectations keep them apart yet they continue to remain emotionally attached.A wonderfully intriguing tale of passion and the two very different cultures that shape these lovers and ultimately make their love impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the crickets were sleeping","review":"I love romances and the cover is more intriguing than the story.

If you are looking for a more action oriented novel with some grit, such as I usually like to read, this one's not for you. Accidental detective stumbles into a crime and solves it, of course. Interesting was the insights into the Japanese sub-culture in California and Japan and their history. Other than that I am not sure if this was supposed to be a hommage to Marlowe and Spades or a poor copy.

At the beginning of the book I would never have guessed \\"who did it\\".What I did not like about this book is the fact every chance the author had he gave a \\"lecture\\" about race in America and how bad Americans treat Asoian Americans. There are problems with the way the Americans treat people, but the main purpose of this book was to tell the readers how bad Asian Americans are treated not to be a mystery book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Cookware!","review":"I purchased the 10 inch skillet and the 1.5 quart saucepan.

I say was because we had it for 5 years before we had to get rid of it! The propellor attached in the back did get a hole at about the one year mark but we just threw that away and kept playing in the submarine. When my daughter got older and we had our second child believe me that this toy was not treated nicely and it still held up! Great product and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied with product quality","review":"I purchased this product for my 1 year old twin girls. They loved it the from the time they got it until I had to throw it away. I noticed at first that it was slowly deflating and I would have to re-inflate it every day. Then after about a week the leak got worse. We were so disappointed that the sub wasn't more durable, and my girls only weigh about 18 lbs. each. The only thing we could think of was maybe the seams were defected. Just imagine if a 3 or 4 year old were to play in it. If I had only paid $5-$10 then I wouldn't be so upset but after shipping it ended up being about $35. It just wasn't worth it for them to only get to play in it for less than 1 month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap at twice the price","review":"I'm a cheapskate, so I was pretty excited to find that some colors of this were available for around $6.

Seeing a younger James Earl Jones is a curiousity. The acting really isn't bad. The story is discombobulated, at best. But it's entertaining -- you could do worse. Not appropriate for younger viewers due to a one-second glimpse of a pair of mammary glands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera-Shy Monster Eats Virgins","review":"Ever seen a movie that just made you angry? BLOOD TIDE made me quite angry. James Earl Jones visits a Greek island and frees a monster who starts eating the local women. James, how could you go from STAR WARS to this?And don't you just hate it when the Monster Staff design a cool creature, but then the director decides to be a jerk and give the beast about three seconds of screentime? That's exactly what they did here. And what's with that cheesey pop song in the end credits?Avoid this tripe. It could of been so cool, but wound up sucking hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mufasa vs. the Monster","review":"Blood Tide stars James Earl Jones (Field of Dreams, The Lion King), Joe Ferrer (Blood & Orchids, Dune), Lila Kedrova (Some Girls, A Star for Two), Mary Louise Weller (Q, Forced Vengeance), Martin Kove (Messages, Con Games), Lydia Cornell (Biggest Fan, Steel) and Deborah Shelton (Blood Type). the story goes as this, Jones dives deep down into the water where he finds a secret entrance that he has to blow up which he thinks treasures lie behind it. When he blows it up he unleashes a pretty ridiculous looking sea monster in which back in the day the villagers sacrificed virgins to it. It starts to attack people in the small community and when Jones' blonde bouncy friend bites the dust Jones goes after the sucka to rid it. Pretty much a waste of cast and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredom Tide","review":"This movie is awful. There are some good actors wasting their time and talent in this dreck. James Earl Jones and Jose Ferrer deserve better. Hell, even Deborah Shelton deserved better. Something about ancient virgin sacrifices on a remote Greek island and the monster the sacrifices were made to being released from its prison. Who knows, the movie is so boring you'll find no reason to follow the plot. The monster isn't seen until over an hour into the film which tells you how proud they were of it and when you see it, you will laugh. Go get some glue and construction paper and you too can be a special effects artist. Eventually, after many dull scenes, the movie finally ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful people in an ugly little movie","review":"I am a fan of schlocky horror and schlockier monsters, but \\"Blood Tide\\" is so cheap, you barely ever get to see the thing that everyone's so afraid of. A monster hand here...some badly puppeteered jaw movement there...and that's it!The storyline is reminiscent of the movie \\"Dagon\\" in that a pair of visitors happen upon an island where the residents worship some underwater menace, but \\"Dagon\\" is a much, much more atmospheric and satisfying movie. As for \\"Blood Tide,\\" Martin Kove, along with two blondes and a striking brunette (all with giant 80s hair), gives off considerable sex appeal...James Earl Joones adds a bit of gravitas....but sadly, there's nothing else to make this movie very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"el cheapo golden turkey award clucko!!!","review":"One of the cheapest movies you'll see made. In-fact, this is a fun movie to poke fun at. Despite the movies' cast (James Earl Jones) and some very pretty actresses, that alone is not enough to save this from being one of the worst horror films ever made. The movie seemed to drag on and on and on.If you want to waste about 90 minutes of your life, go and watch this film. I gave this movie a ** instead of 1 because of the very pretty actresses and the nice location (ie, Greek island). But you could very well save yourself 90 agonizing minutes and order a 10-minute tourist video of Greece which would show you the beautiful women and scenary.

This book must have been the first that I ever read of Ms. Blyton. She is the queen of children's adventure and mystery stories with her \\"Adventure\\" series and her \\"Five\\" series. While these books were penned many years ago, I have found in re-reading them, that Ms. Blyton has managed to capture the essence of the spirit of adventure and imagination of children from any time period (even old children like me - 63). I am re-reading Ms. Blyton, with an eye toward writing some young teen adventure/mystery stories myself. For that purpose, reading the master (Blyton) is well worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Castle of Adventure...kindle edition","review":"Growing up overseas, we all read English author Enid Blyton's \\"Adventure\\" series. There was always a long line for reading this particular series and we considered ourselves lucky if we got to read one that week from our school library. Many years later, seeing them available on Kindle ( thankfully not having to store them in my bookshelves)I decided to give them a try to see if they were still timeless enough to pass down to my great nephews/nieces. Although this particular book has a weaker plot than the earlier books in the series, it is still good. Compared to more recent books designed for this age group, it has a strong emphasis on loyalty, problem solving and self-reliance. Further, the language is in readable English without the poor grammar so common in more recent kids' books. Static language teaches grammar and I feel should be teaching correctly. It is worth the purchase for a kids mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"KEEP SPINNING THIS ONE.....","review":"LIKE I SAID ABOUT THE GROOVE CD \\"ADRENALIN\\" THIS IS A MUST HAVE IN YOUR GROOVE COLLECTION.

It seems more concerned with tooting its own horn than with informing women how to get their babies nourished at the breast with their mother's milk.

Please read The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers : The Most Comprehensive Problem-Solution Guide to Breastfeeding from the Foremost Expert in North America to ensure much greater success. Interview all your local hospitals and ask what their initiation rates are for breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is not all a bed of roses. It can be maddening in the beginning when nature does not seem to be taking its course due to a variety of reasons.

My husband purchased this book for me after I was having problems nursing. With the help of this book I discovered reasons why nursing is so important for babies. If you are undecided about whether to nurse, read this book. It may change your attitude on breastfeeding in general, atleast it changed mine. This book is especially helpful since most Doctors don't have a clue about breastfeeding.

She is an ob/gyn with 3 kids of her own, so I thought this was going to be a real help to me--especially as I was having a lot of nipple pain whenever my daughter fed off my left breast. Unfortunately, I was sadly, sadly disappointed. Whatever question I had, the only answer the book had was \\"Consult your local La Leche League\\" coordinator. I also felt that any woman who was considering breastfeeding her child for a short period of time only would be made to feel guilty for that decision. All in all, I was very, very disappointed. I would recommend this book only for those of you who have some money to throw away and a bird cage to line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as comprehensive as advertised","review":"We purchased this book after having spoken to a relative who has been LLL for 20 years, lactation consultants, neo-natal intensive care specialists, a doula and pediatrician. My wife was so looking forward to breast-feeding we wanted to do everything right. Unfortunately, our son has other ideas. Our pediatrician believes that some babies just do not like taking milk from the breast.So, now that you know where I am coming from, here is my beef about the book. Throughout the book, problems are brought out, but instantly dissolve if only the baby is breastfed. The book purports to be comprehensive, yet it has no information for babies who are drinking expressed breast milk from a bottle. Apparently, LLL believes that milk taken directly from the breast is the only type of breast feeding that exists (or should.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"My mother and mother-in-law both recommended this book since I am planning to breastfeed my baby (which is due any day now). However, I was very disappointed. The information presented is very biased and does not take into account differing opinions and lifestyles. I was made to think that I'm a horrible mother and love my baby less if for some reason I decide that breastfeeding does not work for me, if I give my baby a pacifier, if I can bear to leave him to go to work, if I don't let him sleep in bed with me. While it started with practical information about breastfeeding, it only proceeded to be a springboard for LLL beliefs. If you want to be encouraged that you're doing just fine and that your decisions don't reflect your love for your baby, I recommend trying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old fashioned opinionated book insulting to the thinking mom","review":"This book is short on practical \\"how to\\" advice on breastfeeding, and long on preachy passages that attempt to convenince all moms to stay at home and breastfeed until your child is 8.

In my sixth month of pregnancy I started reading this book and at first found some of the information helpful. Especially the information on a baby latching correctly. But, as I went forward I was extremely disappointed with the breast is the only way mentality and I was really grossed out by the chapter feeding your toddler and newborn, complete with a picture of a 2-1/2 year old feeding on one breast and a newborn on the other. I sincerely hope that breastfeeding works out for me but I don't want to set myself up to feel like I've somehow ruined my child's life because I didn't breastfeed.

It was helpful in raising awareness about the benefits of breastfeeding, and about our right to breastfeed. However, it is now largely LLL propoganda, and very little information. It offers NO help with any problems--which are actually very common (about the only recommendation offered for any type of problem is \\"go to bed with your infant\\"). Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding and The Nursing Mother's Companion are much more helpful because they contain much more actual information.

I looked at the index for \\"mastitis\\" and found NOTHING. I looked at the index under \\"biting\\" and found only references to toddler biting, not infant biting. I had very few problems breastfeeding my daughter until she weaned herself at 10 months, but breastfeeding my second child has been more of a challenge, and this book is no help at all. In my view, the book is more a platform for selling La Leche League's parenting philosophies than a real help to breastfeeding mothers experiencing difficulties. La Leche League has some admirable goals and philosophies, but so many women stop breastfeeding because they experience challenges like mastitis or biting, and this book fails to even recognize those problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference for any new mom!","review":"While many people don't agree with all of the tenets of LLL, EVERY new mom will benefit from reading this book. It lets readers know that with very few exceptions, every woman can successfully breastfeed her baby. The bias is, of course, that every mom should breastfeed. After reading this book, it is hard to argue with this premise.The book provides information on the technical aspects of nursing as well as the physical, medical and emotional benefits. They provide details that show that no formula can even come close to copying the contents of breast milk.The authors make it clear that they believe that breastfeeding is THE best thing that moms can do for their babies. No matter how the reader feels about LLL, parents can benefit from their message. They want moms to relax and know that they CAN breastfeed while giving their children a wonderful gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much","review":"I found the book to be great as far as teaching you how to physically nurse. However, I felt that a lot of the information the book provided was to extreme and the LLL made you feel like an awful parent if you did not do everything to their extreme. An example would be that you are shutting up your baby by using a pacifier. The book goes on to say that in German pacifier means dummy, but last I checked in English it means to pacify and that's what it does. I agree that you can abuse it, but like everything else you need to use it in moderation. I do not recommend this book to anyone who is iffy about nursing because this book will turn you away, making you think that you have to follow their rules and that it's a lot harder then it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit militant in parts","review":"But an excellent resource on solving breastfeeding problems, breastfeeding in difficult situtions and everything you ever needed to know about breastfeeding but were afraid to ask!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better books available","review":"I found this book extremely disappointing. Basically, it's a propaganda piece about how great breastfeeding is (which I agree, it is wonderful). But the book is not so helpful when you need information about breastfeeding problems. It's doesn't have enough unbiased, practical information on breast infections, alternate feeding plans for babies having trouble latching on, or pumping milk when you work outside the home.My daughter was premature and had trouble latching on.

In the case of difficulties it makes it seem like all you need is determination.

That said....This book is really just self-promotion for LLL - rather than be given a practical solution, you're just told to contact LLL for support when problems arise. It's not terribly informative, mostly it's just an attempt to persuade women to breastfeed (a noble aspiration) but USELESS if you have already made that choice which is likely if you have purchased the book!To reach any useful information, you have to wade through pages of hippie nonsense and preaching.

There is very little advice on good positioning and good latching, both of which are absolutely vital to breastfeeding. The funny thing is that my mother bought an earlier version of this book in the late 60's.

However, they seem to have taken out most of the helpful stuff from the earlier version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful in a basic way","review":"As a one-stop, all around basic information source, I loved this book.

The best advice I can give is to see a lactation consultant at the hospital where your child was born or see if you can have someone come in and actually help you have your baby latch on. The book has zero information as to how to wean your child as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced Technical Aspects of Brewing","review":"DO NOT get this book if you are a beginner looking to start brewing, I recommend How To Brew by John Palmer for that, a truly excellent book to start with. This is more of a reference guide for the advanced brewer ( being a beginner myself I have yet had a chance to use it )."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brewing lagers or just brewing?","review":"In short this book was 90% about brewing which I already have several books on. I was thinking this going to be all the tricks and hints on how to make your lagers crisp and clean. You get a few temps and times but other than that just a lot of over your head chemistry and diagrams. I don't need a detailed breakdown of lager yeast to know what it does and why! If you need to know how to boil your wort (it's in here) you don't need to be brewing lagers yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lager manufacture","review":"I enjoyed the book however the technology is outdated and most people ferment lagers at 9-11C, secondary ferment then filter at -2C.

(We might not be altogether different from those who couldn't see the emperor's new clothes.)The book certainly isn't about brewing lagers (as opposed to other styles.) The author says as much in his introduction. That was a disappointment. More disappointing was the tone. It read more like a textbook than what I've come to enjoy in \\"homebrewing books.\\" (Books like Papazian's and Palmer's among others.) It screams with the message that brewing is just too serious of a matter to have fun with. I disagree. I guess that means I'm just a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift that does not keep on giving","review":"Got this for my 7-year-old son.

Fascinating and fun science. Nice to have 30 of the best myths in book form, but the real way to enjoy \\"Mythbusters\\" is to watch the show -- every week on Discovery -- and to buy the DVD collections. And if you love Mythbusters, be sure to pick up all of the books by Jan Harold Brunvand (\\"The Baby Train\\", \\"The Choking Doberman\\", \\"Curses! Broiled Again!\\", \\"The Urban Legend Encyclopedia\\", and many more titles). Also, check out the new book \\"Turn Me On, Dead Man\\" by Andru J. Reeve. It explores, in depth, the entire story behind the Paul McCartney Death Hoax of 1969. Like the Mythbusters, Reeve gets to the truth behind the myth. Buy all of these books and DVDs right here at Amazon.com and watch \\"Mythbusters\\" every Wednesday on Discovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mythbusters a bust","review":"I did not realize that this book was based on a television show because I do not watch television.

So, what's really the point of buying these pans other than its \\"Good Look\\" ?

Bolan's fine vocal gymnastics, from a shriek to a breathy whisper are highlighted by the absence of electronica which often overshadows his voice in the \\"hit\\" versions of these songs.

Scientists proceed on their merry way with little to no thought as to consequences, and disaster is far more likely to originate with some well-meaning scientist eager to save the world, than a malicious renegade.

It is not written for men (in order to know more about pleasing women) but, instead, written by a lesbian for other lesbians, etc., but the book cover and copy try to make it look like it was written for both: men AND women. In other words: it's bogus. The pulisher is trying to have it both ways in order to sell more copies of the book.My advice? Don't waste your money like I did.

Two cuts on this disc are good, his first mistake was puttin' Memphis Bleek up on his joint, wich I firmly believe he gave Memph a come up ,just to make his own music sound better.

(Ho's, Cash, Cars, etc) But he just does it so damn well that you can't do anything except bob you head and tap your toes to the beat.

I haven't even HEARD of most of these producers. The beats are lacking. Memphis Bleek and Beenie Sigel aren't very good. And they're ALL OVER this album. This album has no really good guests (Snoop's alright). A standard Jay-Z album has a TON of GREAT guests, and a TON of GREAT beats, with Jay's rapping in the center of it all.

He has reached a point in his life where he has almost lost hope in himself and in life. The ironic point is that although he landed and brought the fish back to shore, it was devoured by a group of sharks.

He said that he had read it when he was my age(i'm 15). He was telling me the other day about how he could picture everything from his childhood when he read this book again last month(He is from Cuba). \\"Everything about this book is so realistic\\", He told me. From the boats, to the way the town was described to how Santiago and Manolin would leave early in the morning and come back late in the evening. Anyway, myself, This was the best book that I have ever read! I think that it is basically the story of how Santiago persevered and continued to struggle with the great marlin. He didn't give up. I don't know weather that the marlin had him or if he had the marlin, but it did show how Santiago cared for the great fish as he always called it \\"his brother\\". END"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great piece of cinema","review":"This movie is a must see. The cimetography is powerful, minus a few outdated special effects during the climax, where some bluescreening is apparent. The film progresses as a Hemmingway novel reads...superbly narrated throughout. Watch it when you're able to devote your full attention to it, and you will find yourself drawn into this great story about hardship, perserverence, and respect. A great tale, with a very human core, set against the great power of Nature...done superbly in movie format. It became an instant favorite on my first viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's some Guppy!","review":"Hemmingway was great no contest.... but just cannot move beyond one guy in a rowboat fighting an 800lb marlin.... and if they had just a more reasonable oppononet like a levithian killer whale (spielberg style) I might buy in, geez, the lilting beautiful descriptions created such a lovely appreciation of being in the sea alone but the visuals completely annihilated any hope of that connection... every time that beeg feesh jumped 12ft the music swells so loudly and seeing Spence just nodding his head to exhibit the physical strength required to actually complete this feat even worsens all of the Hemmingway essence... I doubt his comment about being fat was the worst of his issues, but sometimes the book is the only way to go.... sorry Spence, loved ya in almost everything else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong dvd in jacket","review":"Dissappointed that I have written twice and mentioned that I received the wrong dvd in the jacket and there has been no response to correct the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ALL parts of a novel are worth preserving","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a decent, if over rated, book. The movie is a very good adaptation of the book. I regret, however, that the writers of the film decided to retain certain parts of the book. In particular, while the old man was arm wrestling with the other man it was decided that the other man should be referred to as the Negro as if he was not a human being and only a color. I would also have objected had the old man been referred to as the Blanco. Whatever it's merits, I would not recommend that children are exposed to this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"if fidel watched this hed fall asleep forever","review":"the chances of anyone making a workable movie out of hemingways novella were slim, and this might count as a noble effort if not for the fact that it is as deadly dull a movie as any ive ever seen. spencer tracy rarely came off as a dullard, but this just doesnt work on any level.

Nice idea, but very poorly executed. Several of the keys stick so you can't press them more than once without waiting 2 or 3 seconds to press again, and amazingly, one of the notes is way, way out of tune.

The recording is excellent. For those of you with audiophile rigs, you will be thrilled with the presence and clarity of this Angel recording. It is surely a R2D4 (Record to die for)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment to me...","review":"I love Bernadette. I really do. But I hated this album. I cannot imagine what she was thinking. To me, the songs were bad choices for her, the arrangements were unpleasant, her voice was not at its best. I listened to it three times, and could not warm up to it, so I gave it away. I was so excited when I found it in our town's only music store, a place that offers few items which are not mass appeal productions. I have to say that it probably was the full-price purchase I regret most in the last five years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent power adder","review":"I purchased one of these as a replacement for a cheap cone that was included with a short ram intake I bought for my 2005 Acura RSX. Night and day difference - just from the paper cone going to this actual high flow cotton cone. It's cheap, cleanable and re-oilable. With that in mind; you don't have to worry about getting another filter. Ever. The mesh seems to be of a good quality and since it's all rubber, there's no worries about the end caps rusting either. This was definitely in the top three mods to a mod I've done, just because it was so cheap, added a tangible amount of power, and is so well constructed and thought out. It's worth noting that you should also buy aSpectre 884820 Accucharge Filter Kitkit along with this so you can maintain it. For added protection, I found that theInjen Technology X-1033RED Red Hydro-Shield Pre-Filterfits perfectly over this filter for added looks and peace of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for Goblin King costume","review":"We also bought this to use in a David Bowie from Labyrinth costume. But, it was so ugly and cheap looking that the only reason we ended up using it is because we didn't have time to find an alternative. This wig ruined what was otherwise a competent Goblin King costume and it was a real shame. The top was messy looking and kind of fuzzy, did not spike well even with hair products added, and there were NO bangs -- everything stuck up, no part of this wig would stay down over the forehead. It was also a uniform light yellow and extremely shiny, not brown/blonde highlighted like the picture shows (the name even says \\"mixed blonde\\" but it is a totally uniform color). It is really too bad that this wig is so cheap looking; if it had just looked like the picture, the costume would have been something to be proud of, but as it is we ended up untagging all pics from this Halloween out of embarrassment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this book is just excellent.","review":"I think this book is just excellent. I love the main character, Emma and her best friend Louise. Their relationship with each other and with the male characters is very entertaining. I found the dialog between the characters very funny and quite realistic. I think kids in the 3rd to 6th grade age group will be able to relate to these characters and their dilemmas.I especially like the plot of the story. Emma loves science and her friend Louise is quite the inventor. Together, they want to prove 'scientifically' that girls are better than boys. It is refreshing to read a book where girls are drawn toward math and science. What is especially nice, is that Nancy Matson is able to show the girls in these nontraditional roles without them looking geeky or unpopular. The girls like science AND they're a lot of fun.One last note - I think the Michael Chesworth's illustrates are really nicely done. They add a lot to the humor of the story and really compliment the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too impressive","review":"I was a little let down after how juvenile the whole thing was. I would probably recommend this book to a girl who's gossipy because it's the audience the book would be of obvious appeal; but I may be mistaken, because being a girl myself, I find the whole thing immature, unrealistic, a let-down, and quite frankly, revolting. I find the whole experience quite horrifying. I would also recommend this book to an obvious feminist, and, in short, someone who hates boys. As for my evidence for the unrealistic material, a girl in the fifth grade would be a lot more mature about matters such as those in the beginning of the book, especially those about being a \\"genius\\" as a fifth grader. Not too impressive in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not earth-shattering, but definitely engaging","review":"With HoMM3:AB, I found that I enjoyed that expansion pack but it didn't really keep me interested as much as this one does. On HoMM3:SOD, there was not only a more sinister plot throughout the campaigns, but you are able to pick the difficulty level of the campaign - a sorely missing feature, previously. True, the Elemental Conflux town type is absent from this (which was stupid to remove), and there really are no new creatures. That hampers the game. However, the ability to combine several artifacts to make a super-powerful one adds a nice touch. I found that picking up a bunch of random artifacts in previous games became tedious, but now it's worthwhile finding some of the less-powerful ones just to assemble something that makes your hero supercharged. Is it worth the money, even with the rebate? I can't say it is unless you really enjoy the HoMM3 series. If you are a fan, then the new campaigns and features should keep you rather entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend Shadow of Death","review":"I just got the game and haven't been able to stop playing. There are tons of great new senarios and new terrains to add to your gaming experience.

The addition of the ten dollar rebate makes the overall price a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why HOMM3:SOD get's 1 star","review":"I love Hereos of Might and Magic 3 with the Armageddon's Blade add-on. I find it to be a fantastic turn based strategy game with role playing game elements. The whole game has a certain \\"hobby board game\\" feel to it as well. This product above is nothing more than the old HOMM3 with a few new terrain sets, 12 artifacts, and a handful of scripted scenarios for the price of $40. This is bad for existing fans of HOMM3. Secondly, NO new monsters, heroes, or buildings are added. Thrirdly, to date, NONE of the new terrains or artifacts work with the randomized map generation (with no plans to implement this according to NWC CSR). Lastly, the game will not work at all if you install HOMM3:SOD with Armageddon's Blade, despite the press releases and what is stated clearly on the game box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Computer Geeks send you whatever they have in stock?","review":"doesn't matter to them whether the items sent are compatible or not they just send you items that wont work together knowing, according to a customer service operator at computer geeks that the item that you ordered is not in stock they send you items that are not compatable just to fill the order?????

Unfortunately, when you need to make it in the mainstream, you need to start on your own, and try not to sample another artist's part. That came when they covered Don Henley's hit, The Boys Of Summer. This version, was the worst version of any cover song I've heard within the past few years. To me, it is just a dull throwback to the Punk days of the late 70's. Still, if you really enjoy the song, listen to the original version Don Henley did back in 1984.

The book is set during the civil war which ensues in former Rhodesia with a minority white government unwilling to extend voting rights to the majority unrepresented black population. In highlighting the human level of these problems, Lan very effectively shows us how destructive and instructive colonialism can be for a people. By reading of the relationships that existed before white rule and their destruction and also their emergence out of this experience, we are ultimately awed by how strong the human spirit can be.

This requires you to insert the thing inside the grate, turn it 90 degrees, release the spring tension, and lift. Sadly, the spring is not strong enough to keep the top and bottom firmly against the grate. This means that when you lift the grate it slides one direction or another. You do NOT want a hot grate sliding toward you! I have tried this on my Weber 22 1/2\\" Performer charcoal grill and my DCS Gas Grill. Same result on both.

The music isn't housebreakingly beautiful, the lyrics aren't super witty, and the singers don't melt my ears... so I just don't think this is a CD people must have. There's a lot of dancing in this show, and a lot of Gershwin instrumental music... if you like that, then you will like this CD.

I don't have a problem with the subject matter, because I consider myself a conservative. I also understand that Joel Rosenberg is a very intelligent and accomplished man, with a vast amount of experience. However, this novel was not compelling enough to keep my interest. The character development was nonexistent, the transitions between sections were rough and the amount of cliche throughout the book was absolutely irritating. I was reading it for a discussion group and was about 40 pages from finishing it. We finished the discussion and I had no desire to finish, despite being so close to the end. It was a complete waste of time.

I decided to go back and read the first two books in the series to get more of a background (same characters throughout) before going on to Rosenberg's newest release.

Informative and exciting!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept - Poor Execution and Research","review":"I was so excited when I read the concept behind this book only to be disappointed by writing defects (the author should have read The Elements of Style) and the apparent lack of an editor (or friend) to check even the simplest facts for accuracy and plausibility.The actions of world leaders are ridiculous, the action sequences are silly, and sub-plots had no relation to the main story line.This is truly one of the most disappointing books out there. I won't even go into detail about the advertising and supposed right wing views espoused.

Had I read the accolades on the dust jacket I would have read this book with a much more jaundiced eye, as it happened I did not.The plot is contrived, the characters one-dimensional and the lesson, hammered home relentlessly, is that the good guys can use nuclear weapons and still retain the moral high ground, indeed that we can avoid all this unpleasantness looming in the near future if we'll just get out of the way and let Bush turn Baghdad into a parking lot.I only pray that Bush never reads this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad read, but...","review":"I should have known when the front cover endorsement by Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh what the agenda of this book is. The action and events are great, but it feels like pro-Bush post Iraq propaganda.

All Muslims are presented as insane cultists bent on exterminating all Jewish people, or, failing that, as many Americans as they can. All Jewish people (or at least all Israelis) are presented as innocent victims (even when they're engaging in acts of terrorism of their own - after all, they were \\"forced\\" into it). And the U.S. President seems to think it's his Christian duty to nuke Israel's enemies. There aren't any characters I could care about in this drivel, which I only read because a family member insisted I \\"had to\\". Today, after the capture of Saddam Hussein and the fact that Osama bin Laden is still \\"in hiding\\" somewhere, the book is that much more ridiculous.Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Jihad","review":"Purchased for future reading.

Not only is the economy going great guns but the pair are presented as all-knowing, far/decisive thinking greater than life heros. In adition, Saddam is proven (remember how Bush/Cheney were so certain) to have not only Sarin and other poision gases but actual nuclear bombs with rockets to launch them. Of course, in the book the President has no choice but to launch a massive bombing campaign against Iraq again with no plan of what to do next - just like what happened.Although this is a 'book' where actual events have evolved completely differently, I am sure Christians and Republicans will love its delusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"for neocons and christian right only","review":"Only if you put ideology above quality writing could you possibly enjoy this book.

My wife got irritated yesterday because I was drawn into the book's twenty or thirty page climax. The storyline sets up for the climax early on, which pulls you on to the last page. We all know what became of Iraq's dictator, Saddam Hussein, but this fictional story had much to offer. I look forward to reading more from Joel Rosenburg in the near future. By the way, this edition has a good sample of Joel's non-fiction book \\"Epicenter\\" at the end, that further explains some of the plot fueling this story (no pun intended)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joel Rosenberg is no Tom Clancy!","review":"This book is riddled with leaps in plot elements that require the reader to stretch the imagination beyond what should be neccessary in a \\"well crafted\\" novel. I also am appalled at the lack of research on Mr.Rosenberg's part. For instance, Rosenberg has F-111 fighter bombers screeming all over Iraq. Even a casual bit of research would have revealed that the last of the F-111s were mothballed in 1996. There are other errors such as when a federal agent uses a Smith and Wesson REVOLVER chambered in .45 ACP. Again, a bit of easy research would have revealed that in order to use .45 ACP rounds in a revolver requires the use of cumbersome half-moon clips- something I doubt any agent/officer would use. Mr. Rosenberg is no Tom Clancy!

The book fast forwards the world 10 years of the aftermath of September 11, 2001 and how Iraq is making an all out effort to destroy the United States once and for all.However, this story is highly improbable because he paints Hussein and his top officials as religious fanatics. Hussein was not, nor will he ever be, a religious fanatic.Also, his protagonist, Jonathan Bennett, had such a limited role in this book, you couldn't help but wonder why so much time was devoted to him.This book obviously had a very pro-Israel slant and the author was way too preachy throughout most of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, we've suffered enough ...","review":"If you're looking for an unlikely story populated with Saturday morning cartoon hero and villain stereotypes, \\"The Last Jihad\\" fills the bill. It lurches along a crude, poorly researched plot-line that culminates in well-telegraphed, brutish wish fulfillment.

You'll probably also love the fact that the book's only black character is a man who goes by the name of Frank Oakland.I'd mention the myriad twists and turns that make this book almost vomit-inducing in its disgusting, naive portrayals of American politics, the middle east and foreign policy; I would but after reading it I took the book back to the store and insisted on a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow!","review":"If you like reading pages upon pages (and I am not dealing in hyperbole here...) of details about what the characters in the stories are eating, then this book is for you!

No charactor development, confusing plot line, its a big Rah-Rah cheerleader book for the Bush administration and its policies. You end up not caring a whit about any of the people here. If you can figure out what the main charactor does to advance the story in this book, you are better than I am. Its like the author wrote the thing in a couple of weeks and got all his media buddies to hype it before the war in Iraq starts. Particularly hilarious is the gun battle at the end where everybody is sending messages to each other on their Blackberries while the bullets fly. Right...... And the main charactor gets an email on his, right at a crucial moment in the battle, that tells him his father has died. I laughed right out loud. Hmm. Maybe its a comedy, that would explain a lot.

As I continued, I was no longer distracted; I was appalled and disgusted. Apparently Rosenberg was looking for some kickbacks from Coke, M&M's, Blackberries, etcetcetcetc, because they are mentioned AD NAUSEUM. That's about all I came away with after reading this book - commercials. Sure, the plot is remotely engaging, but the characters are a bit flat and the dialogue is laughable at times. I zoomed through it and I suppose that has to do with a fast-paced plot. If you're looking for a book that feels like you're being interrupted for a commercial message every 2 pages, this one might be for you.

The story line is not bad, though the hero seems implausible, and actually not very admirable. Character development is shallow.

If you can walk and talk on your cel at the same time, stick with Tom Clancy. I am very angry at Rush for promoting this garbage, I thought he was above things like that.

WIthout saying anything blatant, Rosenberg made every single Arab character a blindly anti-Semetic extremist, including one who cuts off people's heads without reason with a sword (??) and shoots his comrades in the face. How about some real Arab characters, real humanitarian people, who are not hateful or violent? It makes sense that Rosenberg is a journalist. He is perpetrating the same image forced by the media of Arabs who are murderous and crazy, which doesn't make Rosenberg an imaginative or realistic writer- it makes him an unoriginal propagandist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Valuable Time","review":"I've never read a Rosenberg book before this one but it is so unnecessarily dragged out I could't finish.

I actually dropped the book into the garbage when I was done.

That one also has a non-fantasy book coming soon.On The Last Jihad, I was occasionally swept up in action scenes, but finally disappointed at the mix of characters. The point of view seems to stay fixed on characters who just don't DO that much of substance. The President has Big Decisions to make (and makes them), but we see that from afar. The Wall Street Whiz Kid thread... disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"G\\" Rated Thriller?","review":"What's with Rosenberg? Is he a graduate of Oral Roberts or Jerry Falwell University? Preachy, preachy, preachy! I can see baptist ministers across the country working this story into their sermons (there's no shortage of bible verses here). There's no sex (not even a kiss between the leading characters)and not a single profane word. Gosh, it's Ajax and Lysol squeaky clean! Buy it; your kids will enjoy it. You won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Jihad","review":"One of the worst books I've read. The only reason I finished it is that I wanted to see how much worse it will become at the end. Interesting subject and rather promising beginning. Very choppy and hard to follow narrative. If it wasn't for almost \\"crystal ball\\" view of politics I don't think it would see the light of day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Jihad","review":"I found this book rather fasinating in the speed events happened. I had difficulty putting it down. The characters are strong. The events fast paced. Although this book was originally set before 9/11, and is fiction, the events have a strong influence to the reality of 9/11. It will be important for readers to follow the sequence of the series. One of the things I really enjoyed about the book is that although it is an \\"action\\" book there is no cursing in the book. It does have some religious undertones, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great American Novel","review":"Simply put, World's End is one of the best novels you're likely to read.

I didn't care enough about the story or the characters to try and get the point or to figure out who was who and how they were related to anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read and enjoyed several of Boyle's other novels, I found this one boring and I gave up on it about two thirds of the way through.

At his best his energy and use of language is fantastic. However, after reading Water Music, Budding Prospects and Descent of Man I was unprepared for this. It is b-o-r-e-i-n-g. And d-a-r-k. I know Boyle is dark, but his was too much, too repetitive, etc. I frankly couldn't wait for it to end. I can't believe it won all those awards.

Possibly.","review":"In the mid 1990's, when teachers thought it was very hip to have their students read modern novels, I was stuck with this one. I live in the area and whatever romanticised notions I had about it were crushed with this book. I can't say more than I hated it and I've blocked it from memory. However, one lingering question remains... Did the author have a fixation with feet as George Lucas has with hands?"},{"rating":"2","title":"shed his grace on (some) of thee","review":"Boyle shows us with breathtaking style how the powerful stay powerful and the powerless stay powerless. By writing about the same two families in both the 17th and the 20th centuries and spelling out in shattering detail how little changed their social relations are, Boyle gives the American Dream a good dope slap. Anyone who finds this book boring or hard to follow needs to stop watching so much television and get an attention span.Boyle was one angry young writer and I think his venom has ebbed somewhat over the years, which is a good thing for him personally, but might cost his writing. I stopped reading him at _Road to Wellville_, which I thought was silly, but after hearing a recent interview with him about _Riven Rock_, I may try to catch up.I think that _World's End_ is his best book because it is about his hometown. Maybe he has lived in southern California long enough now to write about that area and its people just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the real mystery?","review":"This book reads as if it was a good short story, ruined by several hundred unnecessary pages of boring dribble, in as much as it is based on only one idea rather than a gripping plot. I just didn't care that much for the main character, and everytime yet another catastrophy would befall him, I just rolled my eyes back in my head and thought \\"come on, get to the point\\". Even the fact that P.C. Doherty reapeats stock phrases to describe people and events throughout the book seems to suggest that he had run out of original ideas long before the pages stopped turning. The only real mystery here was how does a book this bad get published?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it until you wear it out!","review":"When The Sting came out I was maybe eight years old but I knew right away I'd discovered a kind of music that immediately possessed my brain. When visiting an aunt I played her copy of the soundtrack until everyone was completely sick of it, except me.Thank goodness I got my own copy which I played, literally, until it wore out.I can't believe it took me this long to realize I badly needed the CD in my collection. It will never leave and I will play it to anyone who will listen. Great job, Marvin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rebirth of Ragtime","review":"Marvin Hamlisch brought back to the public consciousness the musical career of Scott Joplin, though the movie is set about three decades after ragtime had run its course in American pop culture. But the music fit the mood of the con game and the soundtrack spent 41 weeks on the Billboard 200 album chart, peaking at number one in 1974.The foundation piece is The Entertainer, which appears in orchestrated and piano versions and in a medley with Rag-Time Dance. Pine Apple Rag also appears in two versions, as its own track and as a medley with Gladiolus Rag.The 13 tracks are perfect and there is a wonderful timelessness to the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music!","review":"It had been years since I had listened to this soundtrack, and was pleasently surprised to re-discover these songs! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Sting\\" is right!","review":"Rarely is a record so aptly named. There are only 13 songs on it, two of which are repeated twice and one, three times! You wind up with less than 25 minutes of unduplicated music out of the 80 minutes a CD can hold. I would say $6's worth. OK, the music is fine, but at a $12 (list) price, this is definitely a fine argument for \\"pirates\\" who say they'd rather rip off the record companies than the other way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good instructional video at all","review":"While Bill Douglas has the best of intentions, this video just does not give enough information to practice Tai Chi safely. I have been a Tai Chi player for over 30 years, and I have seen students get hurt from the \\"non-instruction\\" school of teaching. I think it is time for everyone truly interested in advancing the art of Tai Chi to take responsibility for their students welfare, instead of saying \\"If it feels right, it MUST be right!\\" This is the easy way out. In this day and age, it is crucial for all good Tai Chi instructors to have in-depth knowledge of human anatomy and physiology, physics, including force vectors, energy flow, health benefits for each and every movement, etc. - and both the video and the book do not express any knowledge whatsoever of these crucial aspects of Tai Chi. This is a superficial exploration at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown ... big letdown","review":"I purchased this book because of Don Middleberg's good reputation in the PR field. Put simply, it would be an understatement to say that this book is terrible. Three main reasons for my drawing this conclusion: 1. outdated anecdotes and examples to illustrate ideas, 2. the thrust of the book (i.e., what value you get out of it when finished) is bland and generic at best, and 3. poor writing. Middleberg is definitely a successful PR professional but this book is a stinker for certain - and a big waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Advice for Everyone!","review":"The ultimate ettiquette expert tells you, in person, what you need to know to function in this society -- not only into the next millenium but for many years to come!

At least when it comes to the actual whereabouts of Darwin in South America. Thomson's presentation of Darwin's ideas on organic evolution is a bit more foggy, but that matters little as the main focus of the book is to retrace Darwin's anchorages in South America.The read is easy, nicely contrasting today's luxury of modern oceangoing sailboats and Darwin's cramped accomodations in the tiny HMS Beagle over 150 years earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"'techno' arrangement gets in the way of the music!","review":"I didn't know what to expect from this CD. But my first reaction was, especially when the first piece was Bach, that it was one of those hooked-on baroque music productions.

It is unbelievable that it became so popular. To hear people call this the album of the century is depressing. The arrangement of Toccata and Fugue is absolutely HORRID! The rest of the music sounds like new age mood music that tries very hard to sound like Jean Luc Ponty.This album is garbage and it makes me sad to see that so many people believe that this is classical music. It is too difficult to put how terrible this album is into words. I guess I will stop here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing...........but not surprising","review":"Vanessa Mae is obviously talented. Anyone who has heard her \\"normal\\" classical recordings would attest to that fact. But this album is just a flawed attempt at being cool. Sure, her playing is great, and sometimes the idea is what counts....but that doesn't make a good listening experience. Bach Street Parade is the only track I'm fond of, but that one sounds like her violin has been multi-tracked to hell.

New age is this style, buy a great idea to make classical music more enjoyable to contemporary people. Just listen to Bach TOCATTA contained in this album. The other melodies are excellent. I recommend this album to all those people who enjoy New Age music, but also those who have not appreciated classical music. It is a great idea that once inspired the Argentinian, now deceased Waldo De Los Rios, to do something similar with classical music. Vanessa Mae has been another success in this area. Get your album now."},{"rating":"1","title":"commercial object....not music","review":"Exactly like Andre Rieu, but in the other direction, she transforms music in a commercial object. Having fun in playing and listening music is of course imporant, but this CD, and the behaviour of Vanessa Mae seems to me more like the pleasure a teenager can take when he pretends to be a rebel... Mixing techno or whatever it was with the Toccata & Fugue could have been interresting if it had been done cleverly, if it had highligthed something in the music, but none of it here... You may think i'm a sad conservative guy. I don't think so. If i can advice a great modern version of classical music, i will tell you about Sclavis' sextet in \\"Les Violences de Rameau\\" which is a jazz study of Rameau's operas knowing that (dixit Rameau himself.. except for the translation) \\"Despair, and all the passions that lead to fury need unprepared dissonances of any kind\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Listenable","review":"Let's get this straight upfront: Vanessa Mae is a good violin player, but I've heard plenty better in the classical world today. You buy this CD not for Mae's technique as a violinist (frankly, I'd give her just a 6 or 7 out of 10), but for her innovation - her ground-breaking album that blends the old-style classical music with pop/techno/jazz, and gives that genre of music (which had there for a while even before Mae) the kind of visibility that it did not use to have. This album is novel and upbeat, and is highly listenable both to people who like classical music and those who find it intimdating (or boring).

She may thrill you with \\"modern\\" and other \\"non-conventional\\" sound, but I find it completely meaningless. When I first heard her, I was completely shocked by the lack of any structure and coherent idea. I think her technique is pedestrian and her understanding of music is nothing more than childish. The only thing that she seemed to care about was the circus-like performance and the idiotic cheering audience. If you are into modern styles, I would recommend Nigel Kennedy.

It makes one think of him as a kind of off-beat, new-age musician. In reality, he was nothing of the sort. He was one of the finest conductors ever to have recorded. The fact that he was not under contract to one of the major companies often kept him out of the running. More's the pity. These performances, taped in concert with a less than first-rate orchestra, will make you listen to the first two Beethoven symphonies as if you had never heard them before. They are full of tension and very, very revolutionary. If you want your Beethoven served to you on a velvet cushion, pick up any of the hundreds of other recordings. If you want to sit up and think, get these Scherchen CD's. He was one of the major forces in progressive music, and his performances show it.

And somehow she's getting her \\"groove\\" back.Where's the up swing in this movie? So, I tried to overlook that crucial flaw, I really tried to like this movie, but to no avail.Taye Diggs as a 20 yr. old was unbelievably stiff and contained. Where is his zest for life, the energy and vivacity of a 20 yr. old falling in love for the first time. His performance was dull and uninspiring. The same goes for the chemistry between him and Angela Bassett.Too many holes, too many flaws to point out, but it would mean reliving those forgettable scenes.

The only reason why i gave it two stars was because of Whoopi Goldberg and Taye Diggs. This film was long, drawn out, mediocre acting, and borderline offensive. It could have also been about 40 minutes shorter, but I suppose the screenwriter felt adding three more endings would be worthwhile. what annoyed me was the entire tone of the movie, it was so angry, resentful, it was a display of horrible values. I didnt see any love. The writing was poor. It was an insult to the acting and talent to the wonderul actors and actresses inb the film.

I loved the idea that out of darkness she was able to see the light and seize her job loss as an opportunity to take her life in a new direction. I found it empowering how she dealt with her job loss, the death of her best friend and trying to deal with the external/internal conflict of dating a much younger man. The film reinforces how much of our own destiny is within our control and how the decisions we make impact our lives for better or worse. The film reinforces that out of the ashes the Phoenix can, shall, and will rise again. Plus, it was funny! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was better","review":"This movie has a promising start, but falters midway through. Where the book was entertaining and fun, the movie changes the story to insert dramatic subplots that did not exist in the book and make it more of a downer. Also, the picture on the cover promises much more Jamaica than is delivered - the movie does not focus on Jamaica as much as the book did, which minimizes its escapist potential. The casting is excellent and the acting good, and there are many funny parts, but on the whole the movie is simply average. Wait for it to come on TV, but don't spend your money on it. Buy the book instead and take it to the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY ENTERTAINING; BOTH FUNNY AND TOUCHING","review":"I was just flipping channels when I happened to run across this movie. I didn't even know what I was watching, but the engaging dialogue held my interest, so I just kept on watching - and I'm glad I did! I really enjoyed this movie about a gorgeous forty year old woman taking up with a friendly, charasmatic guy half her age. Will the relationship last beyond the initial thrill of romace in sunny, exotic Jamaica? Will it work in \\"real life\\" - after the vacation is over? These may be somewhat cliched questions, but the clever (and amazingly funny!) writing and excellent acting (with a little help from Whoopie Goldberg as the warm and humorous \\"best friend\\") make the whole film a delight to watch!

Like Poulenc, his pieces from the 1920s and 1930s are playful winks and are highly melodic of strong national character, in this case of American ragtime, cakewalks, and jazzy riffs, as well as pastorals. His thoughtful, moody summer \\"patterns\\" of Lake Tahoe (1965) suggest French Impressionism. Three of five art songs (1964) are presented with cabaret singer Joan Morris and her husband William Bolcom on piano. The final work, a romantic suite for viola and piano from 1948 is also rich in melody and rhythm. It is a wonderful, at times beautiful, chamber piece, and violist Mahoko Eguchi performs it with deep sensitivity. I am very glad that Naxos has brought this American composer to wider attention.

The reader does develop a feel for how complex international tax avoidance is and an understanding how excellent advice could cost hundreds of dollars an hour. The summary of it is, there are some legitimate opportunities for legitimate companies conducting legitimate businesses. However, most schemes while skirting the letter of the law violate the spirit of the law and are therefor, illegal. The temptation arises with foreign governments in search of hard currency, willing to hide activities from the IRS.

The music, what there is of it, is the worst of British military movie music. There is one tune, and it sounds like a march played on a parade ground. Fortunately they don't play much music in the movie.The real killer is that you've seen this movie before, in bits and pieces. Every imaginable cliche from every lame WW2 movie is included here, with very little variation.

The software apparently is not on the CD that they send you since a three hours download is required if using a modem or at least 1/2 hour with broadband. I am not sure why they even bothered with the CD since all you really get is a trial download. No phone number or any means of support or contacting Microsoft for help is provided anywhere in the product documentation. Since Microsoft does not support this product and will not let me activate a paid product, I guess I paid Amazon for a free 90 day trial. I have a dozen Microsoft products installed on my computers at home and at work but this is my first failure to activate experience. I do not recommend buying this product simply for the activation issues. I am not sure how it rates for virus protection, etc.. I did not get that far. I have nothing against Microsoft, but this product does not work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Overall Anti Virus Spyware Program","review":"I know I have read that other programs are better than this one, but I installed Vista Ultimate on my maching and wanted a comprehensive program that would mesh completely with Vista. What better choice than a program by Microsoft?It installed flawlessly, has done what is supposed to. Consistently backed-up my computer and keeps it running well and checks for viruses and other malware. The only advice is use another spyware program (either freeware or purchased variety) to insure that all malware/spyware/adware is trapped before doing damage to your computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy To Use Product That Works","review":"This is a product for people who want easy to use antivirus, firewall, and general PC care software. It keeps my PCs protected and in excellent running order.I do suggest that an additional anti spyware program be used to increase your layers of protection. I use Lavasoft along with OneCare and have not experienced any difficulty."},{"rating":"2","title":"PC Security","review":"This program offers a complete set of tools for firewall and virus protection.
