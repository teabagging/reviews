I saw this toy and it came with extra puppies and cats (which is good as initial set only has a couple). She absolutely loves it and can't stop playing with it. She's always asking either me or my wife to sit and play with her. The hamster tube kept her entertained for quite some time as she enjoyed moving it through the tube and down the other side.

As a pilates instructor myself, I can say that this is an entertaining, intelligent, and true-to-form Pilates book. What sets it apart from the other choices out there, is that it's made for real people and instructors alike. It's the classic Pilates repetoire taking you step-by-step, from beginner to a high-intermediate level. Because it was shot with real everyday pilates students (and not supermodels or professional dancers), the models jump right off the page as if your taking class with them. I particularly like the fun and clear explanations of pilates concepts, anatomy and imagery in the intro. The voice of the author also feels as if she's in your living room. Anyone who buys this book will find it to be engaging, informative and enjoyable; a refreshing departure from most exercise books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book!!

In fact, Lock & Co. at #6 St. James Street in London is such a store. Whitbourn, a relative of the proprietors, writes of the twists and turns of the shop's history. I found most interesting the story of the advent of The Bowler Hat (a.k.a. The Derby or The Coke): A game-keeper customer, William Coke, wanted a hard felt protective riding hat for safety-sake while chasing poachers in his game preserve. Mr. Lock accommodated his customer and a great hat was born (see THE MAN IN A BOWLER HAT in this bibliography)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gucci 101G Mens Watch","review":"High class selleronly the best recomandations, i buy 2 stunning watch from this sellersuper fast shipping, brilliant packing, i can only recomand this seller.im sure to see you again, for new buy.thanks, from Denmark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's supposed to.","review":"I got this for my friend as a gift, and she is very happy with it.

Its coverage is strikingly broad: it has extended, well-chosen excerpts from virtually every important figure from the Ancient world through the Medieval, modern, and contemporary. Moreover, it contains excerpts from a broad range of perspectives, including the important but usually-overlooked anarchistic and libertarian traditions. Finally, its editorial matter is informative without being obtrusive. The editors merely situate the figure or text in historical context, and then let the readings speak for themselves--just as they should.If one is looking for an anthology for an undergraduate-level political philosophy class, or if one merely wants to peruse what the most important voices have had to say, one could hardly do better than this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Needed","review":"This book is awesome.

The tags are laid out clearly, and the methods to achieve certain looks or feels are plainly illustrated, but the book doesn't teach that much theory, so you are generally stuck with the methods they teach. Some of the methods are somewhat non-standard, which worries me, but as a whole the book is sound and easy to read. I would recommend _HTML 4 for the Worldwide Web_, by Elizabeth Castro, instead. It is very clear and basic, but it covers more of the theory so you can be a more powerful designer."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the name of the working class","review":"This book is currently not in print.

New weapons and power-ups are added, and Serious Sam continues to spew some rather hilarious one-liners. The secrets in this game are even harder to find, while the music is still as great as the music in First Encounter. The South American, Babylonian, and Germanic touches to the music really make this an unforgettable experience (and the Christmas sequence makes me want to laugh so hard).

His tactics are rather phony and disingenuous in soliciting today's educated buyers. Tom's book is all about pretending to be someone you're really not -- a phony, slick, used car salesman strategy. Although this might still work in parts of the U.S. that are still stuck in that era...maybe somewhere in small-town Nebraska.

I picked up this book from a remainder shelf at a local bookstore chain. I know, I know, my first mistake. What was painfully apparent in only the first five pages is that the book was horrendously edited. For example, the female protagonist is first spotted wearing a \\"tea dress\\" and Timberland boots, as she meets with two real estate professionals. Yet, in the same scene, she uses the bathroom of what we are led to believe will be her new home and struggles to pull her jeans over her hips after taking a contemplative dump! I gave it only about ten more pages of absolute crap (pun and vulgarity intended), including banal, and, ultimately, pointless sexual references and encounters. Hoorah for Tony Strong! He has the dubious honor of being the author of the first book I have ever thrown away. Folks, don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"I picked this book up for a good vacation read as I like thrillers/mysteries. Although there were some good parts, as a whole this was one of the worst books I've read in a long time. The character were not well developed, I could have cared less about the whiny lead character by the end of the book, loose threads left hanging, etc. I read it until the end thinking it HAD to get better but with no luck. I could go on and on but the bottom line was that I actually threw the book away after reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Strong of a Poison","review":"I found a copy of this book in a used bookstore and the inside cover sounded terribly interesting. However, when I actually began reading this book, I could not go any further than 80 pages. Usually, a book has me as an audience by page 30, if it is written well and the characters are strong enough. True, Mr. Strong seems to have a good command of the literary ways, but not enough for me to finish this book.The cannabalisitc cat did not do too well with me, either. As someone who loves animals, this just repulsed me. I know it is a work of fiction, but I think that should have been left out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and disgusting.","review":"I read Strong's second novel The Death Pit before I started The Poison Tree and I really liked it. And I'll admit that at first I liked this one as well.I read it with interest right up until the big climactic scene when the whole plot fell apart. The solution made very little sense to me- it almost seemed as though the author had just tacked it on at the last minute to have an ending- any ending! That leads to a thoroughly disgusting and nauseating spate of animal cruelty that I find unforgivable. The author seems to be hoping that these atrocities will make the reader forget that the so-called solution to his mystery was ludicrous and wholly unbelievable. It didn't work- I was so furious by the end that I vowed never to read anything else by Mr. Strong. That's unfortunate because as I stated before, I did like The Death Pit. Makes me wish that I'd never looked for The Poison Tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly and disappointly awful","review":"The plot line of this book had such potential, which is what kept me reading past the first few chapters. I very much identified, however, with the main character's students, who were falling asleep during her lectures.The grotesque and the sexually explicit does not bother me very much when I am reading a good book. This was not a good book. It was oh-so-obvious that this was written by a man, and one who really doesn't know women at that.The most unnecessary part of the whole book was the epilogue. It added nothing to the storyline and leaves the reader with only negative feelings towards the book as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little to like","review":"This is less mystery than thriller, and it's not very thrilling. I found the characters neither interesting nor likeable, and prefer criminals to have some motivation other than psychosis. One book jacket blurb says something like \\"the classic English mystery meets the American thriller;\\" if so, the classic English mystery is badly beaten and raped in the encounter. Even the sexual relations seem to lack plausibility. I think that Tony Strong relies a little too much on brutality against a cat and various people, and too much on the coarse titilation of fantasy sex letters, instead of creating convincing motivation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not for a book club!","review":"I guess our book club missed the point of more famous reviewers - was it a noir thriller? Was the sex absurd to the point of laughable? We searched for a cohesive plot, struggled to make sense of the heroine (why did you have a lesbian relationship? why did you launch into a straight affair?), wondered if every second page truly required violent or unhappy sex, and swore we would do much better research before selecting a book. The book would have been so much better if the author had concentrated on the characters and the plot, instead of filling it with sexual psycho-babble -- a British mystery professor, what a great vehicle that could be. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift!","review":"This was a great gift for someone who was only just discovering the world of Balsamic Vinegar.

It is both engaging and well written. In addition to being very enjoyable to read, the book left me thinking long after I finished it. I highly recommend it.The book takes the reader though the story of the main character, Terri Slater, who experiences a life full of ups and downs. The story takes you through a journey as Terri works to understand what drives her to behave as she does and what the main events in life that formed her character really are. By exploring these experiences, she better understands her actions and is better equipped to deal with the consequences from them. It also positions her to grow as a person. The author tells the story with humor and a directness that is refreshing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst unreadable tripe","review":"This is a terrible book that could had potential. Arguably women in antarctica have as much interest and stories to share as men. Unfortunatly this author, an unabashed feminist, just lists lots of boring facts and petty acheivements of women.

No. A terrible book, useless tripe, hateful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feminist Textbook History Lesson","review":"I didn't even finish this book.

(And I'm not even done yet.) Basically, it continues the story of Balance of Power by James Huston, but in such a way that you do not need to have read Balance of Power to read this one. It's all about a congressional aide finding a long-forgotten clause in the Constitution that in effect brings up a constitutional crisis, pitting the Legislative Branch against the Executive Branch. All in all, an enthralling read. Romance is interwoven into the plot as well, so it's not just dry legal and military stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I haven't even finished it yet......","review":"I'm about 2/3 of the way through the book. I've purposely (with great difficulty) decelerated my reading speed as I want to savor the experience. I anxiously but patiently await the outcome of the impeachment trial with the hope that the president resigns, and also look forward to the future relationship of Dillon and Molly. It is incredulously easy to see a movie of this tale and I already envision the actors in the following roles: Lea Thompson as Molly, Rob Morrow as Dillon, and Fred Dalton Thompson as Admiral Billings. I read Balance of Power back when it was new and just found the Price of Power in my collection the other day. Don't know how I missed it over these years but for some reason, I had not read it. The courtroom dialouge is especially spell-binding. Great work Mr. Huston."},{"rating":"2","title":"US Navy 2 Bad Guys 0","review":"What a great follow-up to Huston's first novel. Pardon the cliche, but, I couldn't put it down. Fast-moving, plausible, and a true political thriller that weaves great action seamlessly into the storyline. The only negative comment I have is that I don't see a third book in this \\"series\\". Not really sure if the same characters can be utilized again. I was a Huston fan after \\"Balance of Power\\". Now I am a \\"groupie\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a sequel that out paces the opening book.","review":"In his sequel to the \\"Balance of Power\\" James Huston provides a riveting extension of the driven political and military personalities in a complex south seas terrorist/Washington D.C. drama \\"Price of Power\\". Although the novel was chock full of military and legal details, Huston avoids the overload that often loses many readers. Instead, he provides a page turning, intriguing read that turns into an edge of seat experience. The sequel can be read separately but is most effective following the initial book. The only disappointment comes when you have to close the cover to depart the plane or hit the sack. I highly recommend it to those that like the legal maneuvering of a Grishom novel or the suspense Clancy provides. Huston puts it all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huston lets us down","review":"As an avid fan of Jim Huston from the first edition of his first novel, it is disappointing to see him put out such drivel -- probably in fulfillment of a multibook contract. His first three novels were a little skimpy in character development and contrived in dialogue, but these flaws were easy to overlook because of the interesting legal and constitutional dilemmas he contrived. In this book, he resorts to the standard Clancy-lite 'terrorist is loose in the US\\" theme and does it less well than most of the leaders in the genre. If Jim has run out of interesting plots, it's time for him to take a sabbatical before he destroys a great byline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible dialog","review":"I suffered through half of the audio version of this book. Honestly, I began to feel like I was back in first grade attempting to read conversation between Dick and Jane.These are supposed to be educated characters.

One criticism though - what self-respecting Admiral would drive a Miata?"},{"rating":"1","title":"RIGHT WING FANTASY","review":"What a lame book. It is at best a weak ripoff of the Clancy novels. Only an idealogue could believe in the preposterous characters.To whit: all conservative and militaristic characters are god-like in their skills at \\"warrioring\\" and (god forbid) \\"lawyering.\\" It is reason-stretching enough to have a congressional aide discover a \\"hidden\\" meaning in the Constitution that leads to an unbelievable confrontation between a \\"superstar\\" Admiral and a pacifistic President; however, when this aide takes on the defense of said Admiral, his angelically pristine paramour actually quits as the Assistant Counsel to the President to offer him aid and comfort. No rational plot line would have such an inexperienced lawyer put on such a bravura performance! The book is a weak entry into the right-wing galaxy of attempts to glorify conservatives and vilify anyone with an opposing thought. My money was wasted on this tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Flute!","review":"I have several very expensive handmade wooden Native American Flutes. I find that the sound quality of this flute is comparable, and having a flute that you don't have to worry so much about is great! The tone is very consistent, and the flute is quite playable. Since it is a six-hole flute it is much more versitile than the 5-hole versions offered by many manufacturers."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable book for all ages!","review":"This story about a young girl who believes an elephant is rightfully hers is well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Disappointing","review":"Purchased this elsewhere based upon claims on the label. Never again.The cleaner is supposed to be \\"odor free\\" - who are they kidding! It has a powerful, searing smell that will bowl you over if you don't have all the windows in your house/apartment open. Even then it will be hours before the aroma dissipates.Will it cure your mold problem? I have no idea. To give it the full treatment you have spray (wait), let stand (wait), wipe-off (wait), dry (wait), and then spray again. The last spray is supposed to be left on without wiping up. Due to it's smell, my wife and I didn't get that far so we don't expect any long term results.Will it cure your soap scum problem? That I can tell you. It won't. Our tile and glass shower looks the same now as it did before we applied the Mildewstain product.All and all, a waste of time, money, and nostril hairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant scent?? No, not really, no.","review":"Not only are the fumes put off by this overwhelmingly-strong (if not as harmful as bleach), they last for hours, and, to top things off, it's over-priced and significantly less effective at removing mildew stains vs your typical bleach-containing cleaner. Each time I've used it (2-3 times, and no more), I've been amazed at how strong the odor is. I understand the desire for an effective non-bleach mildew fighter, but this stuff will not be replacing any of those products any time soon as your go-to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful and thoughtful read","review":"I picked up this Ursula Le Guin book after first reading some of her more celebrated titles - The Left Hand of Darkness and The Lathe of Heaven (both excellent!).

I have been playing for a long time and even picked up some great tips. I recomend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn how to play hold em."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casino Play","review":"This Video concentrates alot on the \\"Etiquette\\" of playing in a live game. It also covers playing position and some other very basic concepts. It is a good video for a total novice or someone who has never played live before. The price is a little much for this information as there isn't alot of stratagy here. Ed Miller's video cover stratagy very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best game ever!","review":"This game is so cool! You play as Spiderman of course, and just being him and swinging around the sity is awesome. In several levels of this game you get to swing and explore with a pretty big portion of New York City! In several of these cases you get to roam freely throughout the city, or you are chasing or fighting a villan through the skies. Sometimes inside many of the buildings(mostly Green Goblin)or in other levels, you're chasing thugs, battling robots, or stealthly sneaking into buildings, such as oscorp. I might add the second part of that mission nearly gave me a heart attack, trying to avoid security cameras, laserbars, and night guards. If any of these spot you, they will swiftly call out an army of super soldier robots, and I mean swiftly! Overall, this game is really fun. A few levels can be frustrating, but once you solve them they are even more fun. The graphics were very surprising, and many of them were better than those on more recent games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Mini-Shelf Audio System","review":"Excellent sound and easy setup of the panasonic audio system. Only reason why I gave it 4 stars is I wish they could've use the space for cassettes for something else. Its such a big waste of space and I know I don't have cassettes anymore. Anyhow overall an awesome product. Also I got the Ipod adapter with this so I can plug my ipod in. I just with you were able to control the ipod with the remote..instead everything you do with the ipod has to be manually, but its not a big deal if you just setup one playlist and let it go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set of rechargable led balls!","review":"This is a very nice set of rechargable led balls.

The writing (now seemingly a lost art in broadcasting) is also terrific: a nice adaptation of Wells' elegant prose, just purple enough for this sort of material. It's nice to see this great broadcast given the (relative) immortality of the CD format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality version of a classic","review":"There's a reason that this CD is priced so low. My low rating has nothing to do with the material itself, but the poor quality audio. Welles's outstanding oratory skills and clever sound effects are overwhelmed by the low levels of the vocal track combined with an unrelenting hiss. The CD isn't even good for \\"old-timey\\" atmosphere, since *in between* the words of the original program they seemingly removed noise so there is a kind of \\"stutter\\". It's like listening to the show over a bad voice-activated radio circuit. Underwater.By all means, get this classic recording. Just get it in a better, cleaned-up version. This CD is no bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"one track mind","review":"This is a wonderful original of the 1930's classic, but who in their right mind puts 60 minutes of recording on a CD and makes ONLY ONE TRACK? If you miss any portion of the \\"show\\", you have to start the whole thing from the beginning, there's no going back. Each of the pauses could have been made into a track break so that you can listen to the story at your own pace and not have to start over with the same drone if the kids, telephone, doorbell or any one of a million other distractions come about to prevent you listening to the whole thing, totally, in one sitting. Do not get this unless you have one full hour of completely dedicated time to listen, with NO distractions. Otherwise you will listen to Orson Welles and the orchestra about a million times before you can get the whole show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing, convincing, amusing","review":"I enjoyed the audio version of this great book.

I picked up this book two days ago, and just finished it - I kept thinking I should savor it - since the writing is so amazing, but I literally couldn't put it down. I would say that Strause's writing places this book in the category of instant classic: seemingly effortless yet full of rich insight. I imediately identified with the dynamics of a family under unusual strain - adjusting and readjusting to shifting circumstances that are completey unexpected.But my favorite thing about this book would have to be the narrator - Monroe. He joined the ranks of some of my favorite literary characters, occupying a vaulted place in my imagination-mostly because he made me laugh so hard at times with his searing observations that I was competely exhilirated by meeting him.I not only recommend this book, I'm stuffing it in several stockings (yeah, they'll get stretched out of shape) this season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for a first time author","review":"I found this book through Writers Digest, I read an experpt in the magaize and had to order the book.

Luckily I got this book for 50cents at a garage sale so I am able to be okay with throwing it into the recycle bin (first book I ever put in the recycle bin). It bashes Christianity. I kept waiting for the pivotal moment when the charater realizes there is a God but that never came. Then Annika wakes up and she is an ungrateful little girl who also doesn't recognize that God is real. So if you are not a Christian this probably is a great book but if you are don't bother reading to the end because the main charaters never come to light. WASTE OF MY TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand all the great reviews!","review":"I couldn't wait to start this book, I had read so many good things about it....I really had a hard time getting through it.

His mother raised him by telling him the formal (not slang) names for his body parts. It was a great book for him, as kids like picture books. He looked at it and read more and more of it as he got a bit older. He already knew much of the information inside of the book; however, there is a difference in hearing than there is in seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"Having seen Lennart Nielsen's book a few years back, I was expecting to get something of even better quality now. Instead, the book just feels somehow more intimidating to me than Nielsen's book. Maybe the pictures are too big? Not real enough? They don't carry the information I would want, and almost nothing is explained in text either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Pictures!!","review":"I was given this book as a gift after I found out I was pregnant. The pictures were awesome and the information very useful. My only disapointment is that 3/4 of the book is dedicated to the first 12 weeks.(I didn't receive it until I was 14 weeks) It is still amazing to see what my baby looked like as it was developing, but I wish the later months were more in depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Conception to Birth","review":"Beautiful pictures! Complete overview of the development of the embryo (up to 12wks) from their size to physical strutures. But limited discussion of the size and development of the fetus (12wks to term.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible book, visually stimulating","review":"I first saw photos from this book used in Time Magazine back in 2002 or so, and I knew I had to pick up this book! The photographic techniques are incredible. What separates this book from the other fetal development books I've seen is the usage of technology to isolate images of the developing organ systems. For instance, not only will you see a fetus at 58 days of gestation, but you can see the stomach, the heart, the skeleton.I bought this book just for the stunning photography, and have subsequently found it enlightening as I have gone through pregnancies. This book has really captured the miracle of human development in a way not seen before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, bad binding","review":"I love the photos in this book and definitely recommend it. If you want to see what's going on in there and aren't satisfied with infrequent blurry ultrasounds (who is?) this is the book for you! It's great to see the stages of the baby's growth. I kind of wish it was organized slightly differently, like by the week. It does go in order, but with some overlap.However, be warned, based on my experience and others I have read here, there seems to have been some sort of manufacturing problem with it. The pages crackle as you turn them because they are pulling out of the white glue in the binding and will eventually fall out. I'm returning the book to Amazon for a replacement, but there seems to be a lot of problems with a lot of these books, so I'm not completely confident that the same thing won't happen with the replacement. So, you might not want to give it as a gift since a gift recipient might feel awkward trying to figure out how to return the faulty product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The binding is very bad.","review":"Got this book for my oldest daughter about a week ago and she reports the binding is very bad.

It's not so scientific that it bored me nor is it just pictures- it's the perfect mix of information and pictures.It clearly states that most of the pictures are not actual photographs, but a mix of pictures and art. Some of the reviewers are so bothered by this. I don't think the author is trying to trick anyone into thinking that these are actual photographs. The author is simply trying to let the reader better visualize the amazing process that occurs in a mothers' womb. Since it's almost impossible to get actual pictures of a fetus, this is the closest that we can get. They are still amazing picures. I look through it everyday and it makes me appreciate even more the miracle of birth and life. This is a must have book for all expecting mothers. It can also make a perfect gift for a mother-to-be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Pictures!","review":"I bought numerous books for my pregnant wife, and this one has the most amazing photos! The book shows many digitally reformatted pictures of the spinal chords development, genetallia, the brain, skin, ears....well the whole anatomy!

As an educator, I was hoping to read some more insightful discussion of how to engage students in the thinking process. Unfortunately, this book doesn't accomplish that. For those interested in learning more about neuroscience dimensions of education, I recommend \\"How People Learn\\" which is much more authoritative and recent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsubstantiated and belabored.","review":"Despite the claim of the subtitle, the author can never really tell us why children don't think and what we can do about it. Every word of this book may be true; unfortunately, very little is substantiated. If repetition and anecdote proved anything, this would be a masterpiece. As it is, the book is four times the length it needs to make the points it makes.Until social scientists can unscramble the myriad of possible factors, e.g., single parenting, TV, video games, fluoride, we are just whistling Dixie. It is not even clear that there is a problem. I thought the author dismissed the Flynn Effect too matter of factly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure bunk. Infectious nonsense.

I did it over a bunch of times and finally just punched the question as is into the calculator and it still said 7 31/40 was correct. I don't know how many other errors are in the book since I quit using it after that. The best book I know of is Barron's Math The Easy Way, Fourth Edition so use that one instead.This has to be the same book I am using.

There's stolen videocassettes, abandoned property, Rudy Guiliani, sex sex and more sex, utterly unrealistic dialogue, a lot of blathering about meaning of life. I'm supposed to like these people? I'm supposed to care? Does Harrison know how to write a sympathetic character? Does he know how to write, period?

This book is setup as though designed for a 4th grade student to write grants. The assumption put forth by its design and content is that teachers are either too inept or too stupid to understand the more sophisticated nuances of grant writing. I have read many other grant writing books (not specifically designed for teachers) and they are far more complex, filled with worthwhile content to assist one in writing effective grants.

Clare's depiction of the medieval threat of disease and disaster -- as well as courage, faith, and love is heartwarming.

In my mind, all it really does is lend more credibility to the 150-year-old document.I recommend getting a different publication of this book. In fact, I recommend finding your local underground bookstore and getting it there, if only for the experience.I gave this book a score of 1, but only because the \\"introduction\\" pisses me off to no end.

But I decided to experiment around a little bit and decided that it would give me a different perspective on the world of communism and the idea that sparked the fear of communism. What I found, in essence, was something different than communism as it was practiced during the Cold War and how it is still practiced today. It is somewhat of a difficult read, or at least was for me, but I found that with a little time and effort, the language of Karl Mark flowed easily into my mind. There is much talk about bourgeoisie and proletariat class, so if you have little knowledge of those classes, I would strongly recommend looking it up.

Communism need not be ruled under an \\"Iron Curtain.\\" In fact, a communist status can be reached in the USA while still keeping the constitution intact. Anyone who rambles on about the horrors of communism is most likely rambling with an empty mind.

His view of history is one of the funniest ideas ever concieved. The worst thing that he manages to concoct is the theory of polylogism. The only reason that this theory was developed was because the classical economists completely refuted everything that he came up with. They did this with logic though. So, Marx thought, we have to ditch logic. Besides, proletarians have a differebt logic anyway. HIs conclusions are absolutely laughable. Along with his other garbage piece, Das Kapital, he manages to concoct some of the most preposterous drivle in all of history. His socialist threory is not even original.

This text bases it's evidence on the inefficiancies of other forms of government without demeaning them.

There is a reason why this band never struck it big...they are just a by-product of the classic 'Progressive' sound (whatever that means) you hear when you listen to Crimson, Yes, VDGG and the likes. Eloy, though technically accomplished, lack originality in their music (on track one they sound like Rush, on track two you hear a clear rip-off of Pink Floyd' s 'Shine on crazy diamond')as well as the ability to write some even remotely interesting lyrics. I just lost interest after three tracks, a record of sorts. So, for all you out there who are not already fans of this band, if you are into Rush, Crimson, Yes etc. etc. DO NOT BUY this cd or any other Eloy album! This stuff is not worthy of the rich German tradition of the Seventies (Can, Faust, Tangerine Dream and so on). Probably the worst German band after Triumvirat.

Ruth was a great athlete and while his weight fluctuated he was never the blob that Goodman is. I remember seeing this movie when it first played in theatres and until I actually saw real footage of Ruth and learned the true story years later did I realize what a travesty this \\"movie of the week\\" type project is....BEST THING ABOUT THIS DVD? the two bonus featurettes starring the real BABE RUTH as bonus features...they alone are worth the ten bucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Babe","review":"The biggest joke for a baseball movie that I ever wittnessed.

Truthfully, Goodman is so grossly out of shape there is no way that he can convincingly pass for an athlete! He swings the bat more like Babe Ruth's sister.

I brought it home and read through it pretty quickly, at first it seemed pretty interesting, except for this whole weird storyline with the Joker(that ends in an extremely disappointing way). Page after page I was waiting for something awesome to happen, waiting for an amazing story like Batman: Hush, but no...nothing...and the comic community has felt the same way. In fact DC has brought Hush back recently with a new storyline and new devious plot and guess what? They acted as though Hush Returns never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, muddled and not worth it","review":"I was really, really let down by this volume. As a sequel to Hush (a good but a bit over-hyped story in itself), this had big shoes to fill. Unfortunately, this book is undone by a number of shortcomings. I really didn't care for the artwork, which is a bit naive and cartoonish and really doesn't suit the action.

It talked about how to animate graphic, etc. But it didn't even cover 'good' practices.

I thought maybe I made a mistake so I just listened to the whole thing again. I still stand by my original judgment that the cd is horrible. I understand them may be trying to take thier music in a new direction, but this was the wrong direction to go. The songs had no rythm and I think Joel was out of tune throughout much of it.

Down syndrome is not an inherited condition. I think that the author means well which is why I have stretched to 2 stars. He has covered the topic thoroughly.

I wanted to try a workout designed for prenatal fitness. This DVD is awful for anyone who is active - meaning if you workout at least 2 times a week.

Now - if you are pregnant and have never worked out and are not at all active - then this IS the DVD for you. Otherwise - dont buy this one! If you really want to be fit while pregnant - go for Jillian Micheals or Brooke Burke.

As a Pete Townshend fan I unfortunately let down my guard and purchased this one.Don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"Charmed by seeing the Who's phenomenal performance in the dull dull dull Rolling Stones Rock n Roll Circus, I bought this book. I wish I had read these reviews before I bothered. The chronology is muddled, the author spends far too much time on his own involvement with Townsend, and we learn too much about the drivel Townsend churned out later in his career. Not enough about the early days. Read Dave Davies' and Ray Davies' brilliant books. They hide nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"The back jacketcover is the first clue as to what a waste this book is. All it hypes are previous works by the author. The book is boring, gives no insight into the person or times. It is filled with stupid errors ie. it's common knowledge that Mick Taylor was hired before Brian Jones death. The author states that Jagger went to Townshend for a recommendation after the death. How can anything be believed after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This man is not a good writer","review":"I wanted a more clever and biting title for this review but not sure I would get away with it. This \\"writer\\" has written books by three of my favorite musicians-Townshend, Rod Stewart and Paul McCartney. Unfortuntely, I have read all three. His prose is nothing to get excited about, his books contains errors that any casual fan could point out, and he is just rather slimy in his selection on what to cover. If he ever get to Springsteen, I will know not to bother. You would be wise to avoid anything with this man's name on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the real deal...","review":"Since this is a review about the book, I normally do not wish to mention anything about the author. But it is truly hard to do so: apart from the several pages devoted to his interaction with Pete, the style of writing betrays a strange disconnection of the author from his subject: while his life did cross paths with Pete's more often than most of us readers, the author doesn't seem to have \\"gotten\\" his subject. He quotes George Harrison at the back while seemingly being unable to see what George, the master of thoughtful sarcasm, meant.Pete's writing his own book and that will be worth the wait. Get another book in the meantime, unless you can pick this up at your local used books place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, simpering folly of a \\"book\\"","review":"For the life of me, the part in this very catty biography where the author showed up with a gracious invitation to stay with Pete Townshend at Oceanic and then STOLE THE MASTER REELS OF TOMMY (!) should have been cause enough to use this book as kindling.

Although the spirituality of pt is important, much else was left out. This should not have beent the running theme of the book. A big disappointment for a much awaited bio."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it.","review":"My main problem with the book was this: we find that the author stole some tapes while on the payroll of Mr. Townshend. From that point on, the book takes on a very smarmy feel, and to me, ends up sounding like he is trying to get himself back into Peter Townshend's good graces. The stuff on the early years, childhood, etc, was interesting, some new stuff on the Who's beginning (although better covered in Kieth Moon bio). Overall a disappointment to a long standing Townshend/Who fan. You can still learn more about the subject from listening to his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"However Much I Booze","review":"This third rate account of the life of Pete Townshend focuses mainly on his drinking, drug use and search for spirituality. The ideas behind the lyrics and the actual making of the music are glossed over. Seems like the author simply read a bunch of interviews and album reviews and cobbled this book together haphazardly. What few pictures it has aren't even in color.[DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Life","review":"I am a 30+ year fan of Pete Townshend's, but after reading this book I have removed all his music from my iPod.Whether the information in this book is accurate or not, Pete appears to be nothing I had previously thought him to be. Through this book he appears to be an ego maniac, with heavy gluttonous tendencies. This goes from his sexual ambiguous exploits, to drugs, alcohol etc. And through it all, his poor wife and daughters were un-ware to a full degree regarding what he was up to. So sad, and what a waste of a life.Now when I listen to his lyrics, it is evident they are juvenile in their tone. His music is good, but his ego behind his lyrics is a now an apparent joke to me.In short, after reading this book, it is apparent that Mr. Townshend's life is a big Disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"---------","review":"The interviews are what stand out more than anything. The conversation between Smithson and Kaprow is really worth checking out. Anyone who will be having a show of their own should at the very least flip through this book.

This is not the worst mascara I have ever used which is why I gave it two stars but it is definitely NOT worth the high price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"who saves us from deconstruction?","review":"While his previous work revealed many interesting facts about ELT, Pennycook's post-modern ideology leads to disaster in \\"Critical Applied Linguistics\\". Indeed, the book's structure is so postmodern that there is hardly any frame left for reader to cling to. The only overarching structure is Pennycook's construction of the four schools of applied linguistics and this classification is extremely questionable. Often one scholar is taken as representing a whole school. In the case of Widdowson, his argument is misrepresented to suit the construction of \\"liberal ostricism\\".But the basic fallacy of the book is Pennycook's attitude towards research.Pennycook argues that, as objectivity is not possible, there is no need to try to be objective. While it is certainly true that notions such as \\"objectivity\\" and \\"rationalism\\" are often biased, the answer is not to discharge these notions but to use them while being aware of their problematic nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny.","review":"I absolutely love this book.

Anyone who's seen Lamb of God live or owns the live DVD version of this knows what kind of intensity and agression they bring to their live shows. This CD sums that agression up nicely. All of my favorite LOG songs are on here, Highlights include The Faded Line, The Subtle Arts of Murder and Persuasion, What I've Become, Black Label, Ruin and 11th Hour.

In my fifty-seven years I have run across only one other book that I would rate worse, that being MOONSPIN.Do not waste your money, time or effort reading this. His Heroine arrives naked with a single goal, she fails pitifully after becoming mired in the Quaker religion (which this books spends much too much time explaining and pushing upon the reader.)

We had read some short stories by Simone de Beauvoir, and she is listed as one of the authors in this compendium. And I remember Wayne Booth's work from my graduate school days. I am very disappointed to find that the book does not include short stories as I had expected, but rather short (very short) passages from some of the major authors. For example, of the four pages devoted to Beckett, 2 are ABOUT Beckett and the other is a very very short work, but at least it appears to be entire. Simone de Beauvoir doesn't fare any better. There is a lot of poetry, which is OK, but doesn't really fit into what we have covered in this class over the past 2 1/2 years.

It swings and surprises. Just when you're nearing your fill of one of the trio's complex rhythms, they switch tempo or return to one of the lovely melodies that make this CD thoughtful and haunting. Just when you think this CD is about technical mastery, you notice the harmonious blend that gives each player an essential role. I can't classify Let's Get Started by style. I just know that when I listen to it I feel I'm in the hands of people (composer Greg Murphy on piano and keyboards, Dale Robbins on electric bass and John Brown on drums) who know what they're doing, and they do it very well indeed. Let's Get Started is complex but accessible to anyone who recognizes original work done with love and skill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Good","review":"I expected this to be bigger.

Of course, many of the chapters could be applied to any U.S. city such as writing in a public place or how to write a novel in six months.

They roll in and out fine, and clear the underneath of the bed with room to spare.It was instantly obvious that the carts are not intended for heavy items. The contruction is very basic and sags in the middle if you put large/heavy items in them.They are perfect for storing clothing under the bed. I also have my younger kids toys in them - and they hold quite well.For the price, these are a great purchase if you are looking for quick access to your stored items.If you are looking for something durable or protective, this may not be what you are looking for. For example, when my kids pull the carts out to get toys, they automatically want to climb in the cart and it falls apart. But it does go back together easily after that.Also, I might add that the wheels are okay. So when they roll on moderately thick carpet I am not sure that they are superior to a plastic tub without wheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it out","review":"I can't think of any use for this cart. It's flimsy, wobbly, and ugly. The bottom is two pieces that sit loosely on the frame and fall out whenever you push it.

He's annoying throughout, he's an obnoxious drunk, keeps yelling out \\"We're number 87!\\" which nobody else in the band thinks is funny, and you can just watch Aaron and Scott both thinking, \\"What the hell is Tyler doing?\\" It's really hard to watch, but the music is great, and the rest of the band is as entertaining as ever.

You'll have an easy time getting through the questions, but when you go to take the test you'll fail. This book is no where a good match for the exam. I suggest this book for people who want to learn about Win2k3 AD, but if you're getting it to prepare for the test you should think twice. Nothing this book discuss could have prepared me for the test. Bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"As a long-time mystery reader, I'm always on the look out for promising newcomers to the genre. Jeff Sherratt is definitely an author to keep an eye on. This novel has it all -- a twisty fast-moving plot, interesting, off-beat characters, and a great feel for the grittier side of the Southern California scene. I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"In this novel, Jimmy O'Brien's conscience forces him to champion the cause of an uneducated gardener accused of murder. Rita, his paralegal will have you laughing, and O'Brien's need to survive a pilotless plane will have you at the edge of your seat.\\"Six To Five...Against\\" is fast paced story, an enjoyable read. I recommend it to all readers who love mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Window into theSoul of Terrorism!","review":"After the September 11th tragedies many people asked, how could such a thing happen? How could such a horrible event take place in the United States? Why would any one want to harm us? Well, this book answers those questions and many more.Mr. Aleem's premier novel deals with disenfranchised masses that are the oil and gears running the American machine. As told from the perspective of Demetrius Williams, an ex-cop, the country is in a state of war with itself. Frustration over the distribution of wealth, educational resources, and the isolation imposed by todays societal demands are the breeding ground for an underground movement, a call to revolution for the American working class! Not the \\"blue collars\\" of generations past, but the lower \\"98%\\" of the Regan-Bush generation...If you liked Fight Club, than you'll love Guerillas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Garlic Press I've Ever Used","review":"Everyone knows that it's pretty hard to find a good Garlic Press. In fact, until now I've been happy to use no garlic press whatsoever; rather mincing garlic with a cook's knife. Then I came across the Cutco Garlic press as a part of the Cutco Pizza pack, and to my suprise it was easy to use, could hold more garlic than most presses, and most important of all: INCREDIBLY EASY TO CLEAN. No more chopping for me, from now on I happily use the Cutco garlic press; it's the only garlic press I use or recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving true story of human endurance","review":"Pursuit Of Freedom: A True Story Of The Enduring Power Of Hope And Dreams is the compelling autobiography of Susanne M. Reyto. She tells of life in Hungary, and the ravages that the nation faced - first from the Nazis, then from the rapacious claims of Communism, which exhorted taking from the people to give to the party. Families were torn apart; respected citizens were ostracized, and author Susanne Reyto had to navigate the treacherous environment to build her own life, and cling to hope amidst darkness all around. A moving true story of human endurance and the will to realize one's dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wowzer","review":"'It's real. It's Pure. TNT For The Brain.'This tune is absolutely amazing. There is real power in TNT For The Brain without the use of bombastics. It feels loud without actually being so and has a terrific pulse that will drastically alter whatever mood you may be in. Enigma created lyrical and melodic magic with this track. The album version and the slightly shorter radio edit are the best examples of pure musical genius.The midnight man remix is breathtaking. It abandons the lyrics (only sticking to the minimum of words) and goes, full swing, into re-imagining the melody in a different (but nonetheless magical) direction.The instrumental mix gives a chance for the music to come thru on it's own without the need for the lyrics to dominate what is one of the best tunes ever. All mixes evoke feelings of eroticism, violence, grace and power. And always enticing you to dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does Anyone Know Where A Hermit Crab Goes","review":"My mother bought this book some time ago to read to my son while he was visiting, and he has since fallen in love with it. The book follows Permit Drab the Hermit Crab as he looks for a new home. His shell has gotten too small for him, and his task is to find one that will be comfortable enough for him to live in. This book is written in a way that people of all ages can enjoy it, and it's especially fun to read to your children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a really great book - one of my children's favorite and mine too.

I personally think this is one of Jean Fritz's best short American history books. The biggest and first name on the Declaration of Indipendance, If America lost, He would be the first one to die. Full of information, this book is a great learning tool and biography of this American Patriot. Look for other titles like \\" And then what happened, Paul Revere?\\", and \\" Can't you make them behave, King George?\\" also by Jean Fritz."},{"rating":"2","title":"A near-perfect album","review":"For three years, this was my favorite album.

Hopefully this will end the ELP remasters!?, i think they finally got it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confused about the MP3 download pricing","review":"Why does this (absolutely terrific) album cost $9.99 to download, when you can individually download each of the six tracks at $.99 each? What am I missing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crisp Killer Remastering - ELP Reigns!","review":"Finally, these superb performances get the exquisite treatment they deserved! You really can hear the difference. As you know, with some remasterings - you end up asking - where's the difference? Yet here, if you know this music - you'll hear a huge difference. The occasional muddiness of the original recording is gone! Carl's drumming is so crisp & punchy. Keith's piano is so much more articulate in this rendering - You'll hear things you never heard before.And can I just say the obvious - Thank God for great music like this. It's so rare these days. ELP knew how to do it - and they did it so right! I still think this is their best work. Not one track slacks. It kicks your butt from beginning to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful beginning","review":"I think ELP is the most fascinating and most extraordinary rock band of the classical rock era and especially the 70's and 80's. In this debut album they made a very strong entrance to rock world as a trio. Apart from their success in their previous bands, these three man prove that they were born for each other to make beatiful music. In this album you can find classical songs like The Barbarian, Knife Edge and Take A Pebble. If you keep on listening ELP you'll see that it is not by chance these men are still making music together. So I highly recommend this album to classical rock fans and those that have not listened ELP before. It is a very good beginning for the band and the fans I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut !","review":"The Shout Factory did indeed get it right on this one.Everything sounds crisp and clear with the drums right up front.. just how I like it.When that drummer is Carl Palmer.It sounds just like it did back in the 70's.Greg Lake's voice back then was fantastic and Emerson is incredible as always.Happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Appreciation 101","review":"The debut release from this extraordinary trio is a virtual music appreciation course presented on one disc. This album is capable of giving the listener a respect not only for classical music, but also for the jazz and rock influences contained within. The music was recorded nearly 30 years ago, yet shows no sign of age, standing up incredibly well in this new millenium. Each member of the trio gets ample opportunity to show off his talents. Keith Emerson's keyboard playing is simply breathtaking on \\"Take A Pebble\\" and \\"The Three Fates.\\" Carl Palmer's percussion solo on \\"Tank\\" is simply amazing. And Greg Lake's haunting ballad \\"Lucky Man\\" showcases his angelic tenor at its best. ELP's debut album pushed the boundaries of popular music upon its release in 1970. It continues to stand as a monumental musical achievement in the history of rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor analog source for this CD","review":"The analog source for some selections is very poor, likely very heavily filtered, seriously lacks fidelity.

At this price, I'd expect it to be hand delivered by Keith Emerson! I bet it sounds great, but at this price, I'll just keep playing the vinyl copy I bought in the 70s."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Classic\\" album is actually a snooze fest","review":"Emmerson, Lake and Palmer were one of the worst examples of a 1970s supergroup. They had the same problem that would befall Yes in that they often forgot to infuse their songs with a decent melody and they just didn't know when to quit. Mercifully, the idea of combining classic music and rock music died a quarter of a century ago, and ELP were the lead pallbearers at the funeral. This album, their debut, contains their best song, the decent and catchy \\"Lucky Man.\\" Beyond that you get a lot of aimless noodling and pointless soloing. At least Yes put together a couple of very strong albums before decending into mediocrity. ELP was there at the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, so that is a Moog? Nice.","review":"The first time I listened to the solo in Lucky Man, I thought \\"this is a very interesting new instrument\\".After I listened to the thing for a hundred times, I couldn't help noticing it was just a silly ballad after all. As for the other themes, well, these guys seemed to believe they were some sort of serious composers, right? (huh-huh-huh...)I never got to listen to it a thousand times -I threw the darn vinyl album away and never cared to get the CD. Not much to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"manditory purchase with Steven Wilson 5.1 mix. Damn!The surround mix is amazing.

However, I'm having a problem with the 3rd disc, the 5.1 DVD Audio/SACD tracks. My Pioneer DVD AUDIO player will not play the thing. I have gotten 2 copies of the set from Amazon and they both are turning the player off when I put the disc in. The 2 CD's play just fine. The owner's manual for the player states that if this occurs, the disc was illegally copied. But it's not a copy...Has anyone else seen this? I'm keeping my second copy, but I hope this problem does not occur with any others...???"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great place to start.","review":"This band could never really be represented by a compilation album. So, you need to find the best studio albums and go from there. ELP's debut is a good place to start. Along with Classic Rock staple \\"Lucky Man\\" you also have \\"Take A Pebble\\" and \\"Knife's Edge.\\" The band really never sounded tighter than this. The next album, \\"Tarkus,\\" proved that."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"An Addendem To The Review By RockSteadyEddie......\\"","review":"In regards to the replacement of the cuts \\"Clotho,\\" \\"Lachesis,\\" and \\"Tank\\" from the DVD-A 5.1 Mix, to me it is also strange indeed, more so by the fact that when Steve Wilson re-mixed KING CRIMSON'sIn The Wake Of Poseidonfor 5.1 they also were missing multi-track reels for \\"The Devil's Triangle,\\" but were able to \\"painstakingly (remix it) from a stereo version.\\" I guess Robert Fripp has more patience and regard for his past work......"},{"rating":"1","title":"PATTERN QUA;LITY","review":"I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I RECEIVED THE MILK PICTURE.

From panelled screens to placemats, headboards to overdoor ornamentation, Rust's highly personal style, occasionally quirky point of view, and amazingly developed illustrative ability shine. Primarily visual, the book does not offer much by way of instruction or technique; nevertheless it is an inspiration. Many of the illustrations could be adapted to other design situations. I particularly appreciate his studies of drapery and exquisitely rendered botanicals. An interesting and useful addition to the reference library of the illustrator, muralist and painter, as well as those in interior design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"The pictures and ideas were fabulous, However, The book lacks any instruction. These creations are not for beginners nor mildly experienced decorative painters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and frustrating","review":"If this had been created and written as a coffee table book designed simply to show how a fine artist created lovely painted finishes, that would be OK. But it is \\"billed\\" as an \\"idea\\" book for ordinary people. Created by a fine artist who obviously has no clue as to what the rest of us can actually DO, this book is useless and frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more commercial outing from Canadian guitar hero","review":"With The Spirial Notebook, we get to see a new side of Rik Emmett. On this disc, his voice - not his guitar - takes center stage. Truth be told, I was a little disappointed after my first listen. Where were all the guitar solos? Where were the harder rock songs? But, with repeated plays, I grew to appreciate what Emmett has done on this CD. He's not looking to reinvent the past. He's pushing forward into new areas. Of course, his songwriting is still strong. Over time, I found myself humming many of the tunes. Anything You Say, Raise High and Casey's On A Roll come to mind. If you're solely into his guitar hero material, Absolutely, his first solo disc, is the way to go. But, if you enjoy hearing a great voice and listening to catchy melodies, The Spiral Notebook won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not Triumph -- but it's Rik","review":"This is a great pop album. Don't expect the hard-rock of Triumph, but do expect Rik's inspirational and insightful lyrics; and of course his great guitar-playing. Why this doesn't get American airplay, I'll never know. Probably 'cause American radio wants to label Rik \\"hard rock\\" and he's not. My sister played Let Me Be The One at her wedding. I finally found a guitar player good enough to play The Way that You Love Me at mine while my sister sang. Take My Heart off Progressions of Power would also be an awesome wedding song. Rik was trying to break through with his soft side way back then, but his bandmates and management wouldn't let him. I commend from walking away from fame and fortune to do what his wanted to do. Rik, you're the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music!","review":"Rik's song \\"Let Me Be The One\\" is the most romantic first dance for a wedding ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality TV Broadcast","review":"You know this DVD sounds too good to be true...and sure enough it is.

I returned the scale and am waiting for my refund. I did not reorder another scale from Amazon. I instead ordered one from Wal-Mart so that if there was a problem I could just take it to the local store and not have to pay to ship it back.

No matter how much you like Metallica, there's nothing much here worth saving."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe James & Lars allowed this","review":"This album is one of the most atrocious few minutes of music I have ever heard. They give you two versions of \\"One\\" and they both sound outright comical- though I'm sure that was unintended. Besides the strong accent, the singer always sounds like he's running out of breath and trying to squeeze out his last few words before he passes out- too bad he never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its pretty hard to totally screw up Metallica tunes........","review":".....but these guys somehow did. They somehow turned \\"One\\", which could easily be called the best song ever, into a disco dance song. Whats next, NSYNC or Destiny's Child doing a cover of Megadeth's \\"Peace Sells, but Who's Buying\\"?I usually enjoy tribute albums, especially Metallica ones, that are totally different than the originals. But turning Metallica to a dance groove is just wrong. Go pick up \\"A Punk Tribute to Metallica.\\" It does the band justice. Listen to the Surf Punk Version of Seek and Destroy on that disc; thats how you change a song up, and still make it good.The only reason this gets 2 stars is that it is a very interesting listen, borrow it from someone if you can, just for weird listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"not metallica's best sound, but not their worst either","review":"It sounds worse than anything before the black album and better than anything after. It's better than listening to Hetfield's vocals now. A very cheesey cover album. It sounds like Die Krupps is trying to sound cool, but it's beyond their ability to. The album sounds like some kid i don't know, that would ask me over to his house to check out his, new cool midi keyboard that he can hook up to his computer. That's why it didn't get five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is horrible","review":"I consider this album an insult to Metallica, you just can't take something like \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" or any other Metallica song, and do a remake of it without any guitars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for serious golfer","review":"Must have for any serious golfer.

It's remarkable how studied her approach is, how devoid of appeal, spontaneity and Russian soul. Where is the poetry and charisma these compositions easily evoke? Even perennial charmers like the Romance, Op. 5, or Reverie, Op. 19, No. 1, seem merely routine. As well, the placement and juxtapositioning of the pieces themselves doesn't quite work, making the music appear maddeningly lackluster, which it certainly is not. To add insult to injury, the exceptionally realistic recording, compounded by generous disc length, only serves to augment the unfortunate interpretive monotony. Those unfamiliar with Tchaikovsky's piano works should seek out alternative performers, such as Ponti, Postnikova, Richter and Pletnev, who are outstanding in this repertoire.[Running time: 69:50]"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheated","review":"I bought 2 dvd's .....and both were the same except for a small part in the begining....she even wore the same clothes.....Her brother did the same thing.....both dvd's were the same except for a small part at the start...He even wore the same clothes in both dvd's.....I'll never buy another of their dvd's....shari"},{"rating":"1","title":"foot...logics?","review":"I have yet to find a product to clear up toenail fungus....even those that are guaranteed to work.

My Loose Thread reminded me strongly of Ellis' work in both style and subject.The extreme violence may put off some, although I would argue that the imagery is relevant in understanding Larry and the world as he sees it. But it is the chaotic narrative that challenged me. While I suppose it is a device to underscore the confusion and insanity of the main character, we only jump into situations as an observer in Larry's head with the reality or Larry's perceived reality at that moment is what we experience. Larry, as the narrator of the book, never treats the reader as a trusted confidant and doesn't help us pull the pieces together in a way that help really understand who he is and what his motivations are. I believe that is probably intentional, but is a writing style that does not work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible,Horrible,Horrible!","review":"I have read many books that are intended to shock and disgust it's readers, but this book was a down right mission to read!

It was too tight around my rib cage (I was expecting it to stretch more) and forced my breasts into a strange pointy shape, flattening them across the top and mashing me down in the middle.

This band seems to run small, the 36 fit me like a 34 in other brands, I could wear it on the last hooks. The cups, on the other hand, run big. The foam lining also makes them a little stiff and pointy, so under a t-shirt it looked like my breasts were aiming off to each side, really not flattering!

So for the same price of this, instead buy her Combat Depression or General Wellness cds because you get identical affirmations, but also a terrific guided imagery experience too.I wouldn't have written this negative review if the price was adjusted to reflect the amount of content.

It does sort of sway a little bit when you push the clothes to make more room, but because the pieces are screwed together I think it's fine and doesn't seem like it will topple over.

Why pay more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Act Concert Series Violin","review":"I give the First Act Concert Series Violin five stars based on quality and price. It is perfect for school music programs. First Act should be commended for designing instruments that are affordable for average families. The critics must realize that this allows children to learn to play an instrument who may not have been able to otherwise. It is a beautiful, well crafted instrument for the cost. My daughter is proud to own her violin and I don't have to deal with the hassle of renting. If she becomes highly skilled at playing the violin, then we will discuss paying top dollar for one. Until then, her First Act violin is perfect while she's still in elementary school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fastest Delivery Ever!","review":"I was very surprised and pleased when this product arrived earlier then the earliest estimated shipping date.

The picture shows that the net comes to a point at the bottom. Is it tied? Glued? No, you have to tie it yourself. Basically, when you get the chipping net - the net is open on both ends. How the picture shows the top open - this is how the bottom is. You have to bundle it up and tie it yourself. So at the bottom of the net is a bunch of extra netting - which is the knot - after you tie it of course. This chipping net seems to only work well outside. Comes with two hooks to anchor the base. These hooks have to be pushed into something soft - like the ground, grass, sand, etc. If you use it indoors and can't anchor it down, when you chip into it, the net will fall over backwards. It's an ok net for the price. The construction isn't the best - you could probably do better making one yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"GILLAN&GLOVER WORK GREAT TOGETHER.","review":"TO ANY GILLAN OR DEEP PURPLE FANS THAT ENJOY THE FRUITIER SIDE OF ROCK.

The radio edit, which has a shorter opening than the Album version and 2 tracks called Almost Full Moon and Light of Your Smile.

We are not exactly sure how it happened, but as near as we can figure, her foot got caught in the space between the slide and the side. Water is not able to get into these areas. Due to the lack of water, her foot did not slide but the rest of her did. She now has 3 inch long fracture to her tibia (shin bone) and her tibia is now in two pieces.If you choose to let your children continue to play on this toy, PLEASE tell them to keep their arms and legs crossed and stay in the middle of the slide so that they can avoid a summer like ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous for children!","review":"My nieces grandmother bought this waterslide for their birthdays.

She was okay to breathe after a few minutes but also has a large bruise on her back.

The toy is GREAT, and the kids had an absolute BLAST on it, but after only a little over one summers use, it has expired.

His parents do not believe him, so he takes matters into his own hands and devises a way to trap the alligator. The text is simple but effective, the illustrations are realistic yet playful, and the alligator is the perfect mix of menacing and cartoonish. The children react with a mix of fear and \\"I'm glad I'm not that kid\\", and then conclude the story impressed with the boy's courage and a feeling of \\"Hey, maybe I could have been that kid.\\"This book will be re-read many, many times throughout the year, and the students never get bored with it.

The sound is great, but the color is completely washed out and the picture runs right out of the frame. In the famous \\"Al Di La\\" scene, Suzanne Pleshette's nose is cut in half.

Suzanne Pleshette is fabulous as Prudence Bell, a former librarian in search of love in Italy. Troy Donahue, who is not exactly known for his fine acting skills, really does pretty well in his role as Don Porter, the man Prudence falls for. Constance Ford is great as Prudence's boss, Daisy. Hampton Francher plays the nerdy but loveable Albert Stillwell so well that part of you will want Prudence to fall for him in the end over Donahue. The storyline is a bit predictable at times, but the characters are all so likeable that you can watch this film again and again and never get bored!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rome Adventure","review":"This is the ultimate in love stories.

If anyone remembers \`The Million Dollar Movie' or \`The Late Show', these types of films were main stays and you could see them all week long. Why must we beg for these movies to be released? What about Parrish or Palm Springs Weekend? Maybe if all us fans write to the studios, they will realize that there is a market for these films and that most of us don't want to see 6 episodes of a cancelled TV show put out on DVD within weeks of the cancellation- Just maybe we would like to see something from a more innocent, gentler time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of the great performers and artists","review":"I am over 60 now, and the first time I saw this movie was back to 50 years ago when I was just a small kid.

Also, the movie theme \\"Al Di La\\", and also the main theme \\"Rome Adventure\\" are really beautiful. A couple of weeks ago I bought a copy of the DVD in Hong Kong from HMV. However, the colour is disappointing. So, I decided to order another copy from Amazon where I used to order CDs and books.

It's amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLA's most consistant effort","review":"you really can't compare it to anything else. FLA is industrial...but...not. FLA has always been more subdued than, say, skinny puppy or ministry. more atmospheric. this is music you play while driving at NIGHT. its very sleek, and enjoyable from start to finish, but you have to listen for the little melodic, rhythmic, production complexities. its definitely a landmark album for industrial music, it announces the arrival of electro-industrial (just as NIN's Broken and Ministry's Psalm 69 did for industrial metal, the same year might I add).

Quran is viewed as a piece of poetry. Author in many occasions tries to tie the Qur'an with ancient Arabic poetry and tries to find paralells. I could not find any phrase that tells to the reader that this book is send down to humanity by God through Prophet Mohammed. I did not expect him to believe that but the whole approach is from a literary point of view. The minimal amount of commentaries are mostly his own as a pure interpreatation as a literary text. Poetic nature is emphasised and paralells are drawn between ancient Arabic themas and the Quranic subjects. There is nothing to learn from this book.

If only she could have apologized for the selling of State secrets to foreign governments........if only she could account for the lost or stolen laptops from her own office.

Al Pacino plays Shylock to the hilt, avoiding an interpretation that has him appear either sinister or victimized: this Shylock is a powerful man, greatly angered, and in the famous \\"Does he not bleed?\\" speech, there is not a hint of self-pity.

In order to secure the loan, Antonio pledges \\"a pound of flesh,\\" should he not be able to repay the money on time, and when his fleet of ships are sunk, Shylock seeks what is legally owed to him.Despite the high quality of this film, the anti-Semitic aspects of Shakespeare's drama make it difficult to watch.Extras include audio commentary by director Michael Radford and Lynn Collins, plus a \\"Making of\\" featurette.Michael B.

I've read two translations and am planning to read a third soon. In Cyrano, Rostand has created a character I and many others can empathize with. If you're reading Cyrano for the first time, I would reccommend Bair's translation, as it has been rendered into more modern English. However, Hooker's translation often captures the beauty and poetry of the language, whereas Bair is more prosaic. I highly reccommend reading this book, and if you can see it performed somewhere, you're in for a real treat. \\"Philosopher, scientist, poet, swordsman, musician, aerial traveler, maker of sharp retorts, and lover. . .\\" I hope that you enjoy making Cyrano's acquaintance as much as I have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful and enjoyable literal translation","review":"Lowell Bair's translation of \\"Cyrano de Bergerac\\" is done by discrding the rhyme and meter of the original for a simpler prose translation. Even the duel ballade of Act I and the Gascon Cadets' introductory triolet are reworked into blank verse. Bair makes the play accessible and provides a fresh, delightful version. My only criticism is that he has thrown out the baby with the bathwater, diluting the poetry of the original in the process. Still, most readers will find it an enjoyable read, and Cyrano scholars like myself will appreciate the usefulness of his approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Service","review":"I got the product very quickly- they shipped the next day and i got the standard shipping. the product was just a described, if not better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My Favorites","review":"This book is truly one of my favorites.

It isn't scientific, just brute force, pure intensity and dedication. I've had the pleasure of meeting Ronnie on two occasions and he's been pleasant if not verbose when posing for pictures and signing autograps. When I asked how many calories he eats daily he replied \\"I don't know that's too much work, I just eat!\\" I truly believe him too, which is amazing in the climate of modern bodybuilding.

Or at least having enough gumption to defend herself against unjust accusations and unfair treatment? The worst thing about Eden's character was a weakness in moral fiber: she withheld information about her husband's sister-in-law's adulterous behavior because she was the only from that branch of the family who seemed kind to her. ...and that goes to show her relationship with her husband that she couldn't even trust him with her feelings.

The movie is kinda depressing: bullying, abandonment, good guy turns bad, etc. Overall just not a great kid movie like TS and TS2. Def recommend you preview this one B4 gifting it to a grandkid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for my 3 year old","review":"I just bought this movie this past weekend based on all the positive comments I had always heard about it. I can honestly say I truly enjoyed the very beginning (up to the time the toys made it to the daycare) but that rapidly changed. Just like some of the other comments, I felt this movie was depressing and creepy (even for an adult). My 3 year old got very scared of the monkey and told me he did not want to see the movie again. It was a huge disappointment since I was a big fan of the first two. I do not understand why they would make movies like these for children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, Not for Young Kids!","review":"Our 4 year old loved TS1, TS2, Cars and other Pixar movies. This one not at all! He did not smile or laugh once during the entire movie, just said it was too long.I don't get the mindset at Disney and Pixar with this one. Like others, I found TS3 very dark and depressing, and I certainly do appreciate the sentimentality around Andy growing up. Oh, and why does Disney need to try to numb our minds with 6+ trailers!We wasted our time and money on this one, don't waste yours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker than its predecessors but still moving...","review":"The title says it all. It leads me to believe that this movie might be more geared to a broader audience as opposed to mainly children. There are bright, funny and just darn cute sequences to be seen here but even more parts that will make you think, feel bad (yet invested) and just plain wanna see Andy's old chums make it through their stay at Sunnyside Daycare. In fact, I never expected this movie to take such a route.Nonetheless, I highly and thoroughly enjoyed this endeavor. Never have I seen a Pixar movie this great! This special! This elite! Some of the onlookers may be quite disappointed because the story gets dark. And when it's dark, it can seem grim. There are plenty times when it feels like there is no hope in sight. Just keep watching and stick it out. I got super-invested and you just might too. Toy Story 3 rocks to the umpth degree!Highly recommended.4.5 stars (or a 9/10).P.S. The ending made me cry and I'm 26 and male. :^D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Toy Story","review":"This movie is so many things to so many people - in the theatre I watched it with kids as young as four and others my age (over 50)...we all loved it and for many different reasons.

This one is about Andy going off to college and parting with his beloved toys. The toys get donated to a daycare by accident and the movie follows them trying to get home to Andy. Something for any age. Just adorable.

Andy, now 17 and headed to college, must decide what to do with all his toys. Through human error, most end up on the curb, rescued and sent to day care. Unfortunately, they are placed with toddlers who are not \\"age appropriate\\" playmates for our guys. Woody, who had been chosen to go with Andy to college, must make numerous moral choices beginning with rescuing his friends. The Pixar team as you might expect deliver a technological achievement, but pack the film with action, thrills and humor as well. Expect to swallow hard and whisk away a tear or two as Andy says his final goodbyes to Woody, Buzz and the rest of the gang...and to us as well I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"toy story 3","review":"great movie!!!!! loved it. watched many, many times already. will tell all my friends and relatives to get this movie.

I don't know why anyone would have strong feelings about it.The first one was excellent; the second was ok; this one is mostly a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Triggery and Bleak","review":"Toy Story 3 was a traumatic experience for me. The villain is too real, and triggered flashbacks of abuse. Maybe I'm spoiled by the considerate nature of the internet's fiction community, but if TS3 had been a fic, the mods would have come down hard about abuse warnings and trigger warnings for the villain and the whole chunk of the movie that takes place in the daycare centre.Aside from that, I did not like the message that everyone gives up their toys in order to fully grow up. I feel it's a bleak message for children to be told that they must leave everything behind, or inevitably will. Personally I know many people who have held onto and still make companions of their toys, and still use their imaginations. It just seemed forced, to me, that Andy gave up his toys. There was no real reason for him to do so, so the fact that he did felt out of character, especially after all the build-up of him looking for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"the CD is not working properly!!!!","review":"I bought this movie for my young clients in my clinic. however, it is not played till last ending. in the middle of the movie it is stuck and stop it.first time I was think the video player would be wrong. therefore I tryed to play several time here and there. therefore, I found it was the CD problem.I wasted money!!!!Don't buy from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is dark","review":"I liked one and two..but this one sucked...it scared my nephew..even though he loved one and two,I did not let him watch this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 disc abomination","review":"$37.49? You've got to be kidding me. Why do I need a SECOND blu-ray in the package of the SAME movie?

If I wanted the 2D version of the film, I'd buy the 2D version of the freaking film.Don't make me pay for an idiotic digital copy on disc either. if I'm so technically incompetent I need someone to create a digital copy for me, just provide a download code.Quit throwing in the kitchen sink, 5 discs is ridiculous.\\"I spent the money on the 3D TV, I have none left for overpriced 3D movies\\".

I just want to say that I am 62 years old, and just the thought about the way I felt when I saw this movie in the theatre makes me tear up. It is a nostalgic feeling in a big way. Reminds you of your childhood and those special feelings about growing up. You want to grow up and get on to being an adult in the worst way, but thinking back now your childhood was such a very special time. So fleeting and if we're lucky, such a special time in our lives.I highly recommend the purchase of this movie to add to your collection.I honestly feel that the series should stop here. Perfect right where it was left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sequel ever","review":"As far as sequels go, this one takes the cake. The characters of Toy Story have come to life once again in this animated heart-warming film. Although new characters are added, they seem to help the story rather than hinder it. The plot is far from predictable and keeps you on your toes the whole way through. You will laugh, you will cry, you will get angry. But all in all, you will come away loving the story even more than the first one.

Not only do I find the theme timeless, and the hero's journey no less powerful than in a \\"live action\\" film, but I relish the planting of these seeds in the minds of my kids. Much of old Disney fare seems tired in light of our modern (e.g. post-feminist, post-racial) era. But, the themes in this film, self-sacrifice, self-sufficiency, and remaining true despite loss and peril are well presented. I remain awed by Pixar's ability to present stories that are both appealing to kids, engaging and humorous to adults, and that convey timeless ethical memes to young viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequel","review":"Very well done.

With Toy Story 3 I was pretty sure I was going to really enjoy it. I went and saw it in the theater and my expectations were exceeded. The animation was absolutely incredible. The story had so many allusions to other movies and the earlier two Toy Story movies yet for me it created it's own story amazingly well, which is what I have come to expect from Pixar in all their movies. The voice talent was excellent.It was the ending in particular that really took this from a good movie onto a great movie. It was really a classic ending not even taking into consideration that it was an animated movie.The extras on the blu ray disc are excellent and that it comes with a DVD and digital copy is such an amazing product.

When I complained that the Blu-Ray didn't play it was replaced twice without a glitch or problem, it was replaced in2 days, twice. I did have a slight problem with the second one as I had requested a replacement, but Amazon.com accidentally gave me a credit instead. When I contacted them to complain because the price had gone up, they charged me the original discounted price and replaced it instantly without argument.

Total screw up by the mpaa for rating it G. Or was it a deal to get more tickets sold? A G rating is supposed to mean lets go to the movies and not have concern over how your toddler/young kid is going to react. By far this is a PG.

My son ended up crying in the middle (about the background story of Latso the bear) and we had to stop. I myself have seen the movie from start to finish and did not like it.

I love the first 2, but this one is so dark and I don't like most of the new characters. I mistakenly did NOT watch it before viewing it with my 2 and 1 yr olds and I'm very sorry for that. Thankfully I had not opened my copy before we watched it at my sister's so now I can return mine to Amazon and I have an excuse for my 2 yr old as to why she can't watch it again. I liked the opening and the end (though the end made me cry) but the majority of the movie is very dark. At one point they are in an incinerator waiting to be burned up! I also don't like the premise that the characters are just trying to get back to Andy's attic so they can sit in a trash bag until... well they don't know. Maybe I'll wait and let my kids watch it again when they are older."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the....?","review":"THANKS Pixar!My 6-year old now has recurring nightmares after watching this. Totally unsuitable for kids age 6 or less. Too brutal, too scary. She cried for 10 minutes during the scene where Woody and his party were supposed to go up in flames.

NOT recommendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the original for toddlers","review":"Movie arrived quickly and in good condition as most amazon products do.

The ending always makes me cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I admit that I am not too keen on jumping on the bandwagon and the emporer's new clothes sindrome when it comes to Hollywood movies, but I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I rented it for my teen daughter and thought \\"oh well, I'll watch it with her..what have I got to lose?\\" I haven't seen the previous installments of Toy Story. In my opinion it is very well made and is heartwarming and has a positive message. To always be faithfull to friendship because life has it weird turns and dips and the ones you think are trustworthy are really not and friends stick with friends no matter what. It made me feel good and that is the norm to which I adhere to when I judge a movie, even if the \\"critics\\" don't give it high ratings.

I saw the 3D version in theaters and felt it was an almost perfect ending to the series. I do feel that SOME of the move may be a little intense for real young children but in general is another awesome PIXAR release.just a little buying advice for collectors who may not know already - i was at B*ST B*Y today to pick up The Exorcist & One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and happened upon the B*ST B*Y preorder offer for TOY STORY 3 BluRay which is $7.50 down for a preorder for the 3disc edition and you get the STEELBOOK for TS3 - hoping they do the STEELBOOK for TS1 & TS2 when they release TS3"},{"rating":"2","title":"TS3","review":"This Movie Is Far out man its the best cartoon i seen Since The Lion King!

Lord of the Rings, the original Star Wars, Back to the Future are three. Spiderman and Terminator held true on the first two installments, but both delivered weak on the third. It is indeed a rare thing. I could go on, but hopefully you'll appreciate that the Toy Story trilogy is one of the strongest ever made. A triple-threat of Pixar's powerful storytelling, each movie with a unique direction to take the characters, all based on the original idea of what it's like to be a toy.And btw, no part of this review refers to the gimmicky and worn-out 3D glasses, prone to distort the movie if your viewpoint moves as much as 2 inches. The stupid plastic things remind you again and again that you're in a movie theatre, watching a movie, with big, honkin' fat 3D glasses on. It was a good ride while it lasted.

Boy was I wrong. This movie is great and really is a nice end to the Toy Story series. I saw it in the theatres and bought it as soon as it came out on DVD.

Pixar is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Got the cheap 1-disc DVD of TS3. Will definetely buy all 3 on BD later. If this wasn't the best of the 3 then it was pretty close. Spanish Buzz was great, especially with the dancing,(to funny)and thinking that Woody was a rival for Jessie's love. In all 3 movies they've had the running gag of Buzz being in Space Ranger mode, this one was probably the funniest.Woody stepped up to the leadership role that he's always had, but even more so when he told the toys that they should all go back to Andy. Good spots with him trying to escape, then the Hogan's Heroes scene where Woody plays the Col. Hogan role in coordinating the escape.Hogan's Heroes - The Complete First SeasonAll in all, get this movie and watch it several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"I love this movie, and it seems like it is a perfect end for the Toy Story series.

Unfortunately it has taken me 2 weeks just to get to page 74. Ms. Blake is the Don King of the Romance Writing World. There are so many nauseatingly long descriptions of every little detail from conversations to observances that I find it impossible to read more than 3 or 4 pages without getting frustrated. I want to get in to the story, I'd like a little of the fantasy to be left up to my imagination. Ms. Blake is so long winded that I feel like I'm reading a blow by blow narrative of a documentry, instead of losing myself in a historical fantasy life."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the book for you","review":"anyone who is interested in a good conversation along with a good romance will enjoy this book. the heroine has a wit to match the heroes. you have to pay close attention and infer what is being said. don't skip pages cause you will miss out. this was definitely something for the mind to enjoy. i rate it one of the best because it never lagged, you never get bored because they are always sparring with words;whether with eachother or their own conscience. so if you want an intense novel this is is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, it was ok.","review":"The book was ok.

For a lesser mixer, that would have been expected, but seeing the size of the gears, it was obvious that they probably should have been replaced when the mixer was reconditioned. Since this is not a popular model of KitchenAid mixer, I had a hard time finding replacement gears. But when I did find the parts needed for about $35, it was an easy repair. Since then, this mixer has been very strong and has worked very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, it's a wonderful machine!","review":"I've had this lovely stand mixer for about a year now, and I've had no problems with it at all.

Pearl develops his characters and his story marvelously well. Longfellow emerges as both a significant poet and gracious person, as well as a man of conviction. He was on the faculty of Harvard which rejected teaching Italian or anything written in other than the Classical languages. Pearl draws interesting and compelling portraits of the other New England intellects (some of them also significant poets) whom he drafted to assist him in the translation. On top of this he grafts a murder mystery which reveals a most peculiar perpetrator with a tragic and convulted history. The mystery is an invention. The history of the translation and the times and place in which it occured is accurate and solid. Excellent and absorbing. Thank you, Matthew Pearl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool!","review":"As a Dante fanatic, I wasn't sure what to expect. This book rocks!

It is not a great piece of literature, but I found it very entertaining. I read it during a business trip to Singapore. It made the long plane trip and nights at the hotel more enjoyable. I particularly enjoyed the setting, the mid 19th century and the way of life. I don't know why, but the story worked much better than having it take place in the age of cell phones and e-mail. I am giving it four stars, because as an entertaining novel, it worked for me, but it is not a book that I will read a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad!","review":"So boring!!

Of the 12 members, only three of us were even able to finish it. Very hard to get in to, most gave up before page 100. But, even those of us who keep going found it very plodding and tedious. A good plot, but, his writing style definitely got in the way of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not that good","review":"I am a big fan of \\"The Divine Comedy\\", and the description on the book's cover made me very eager to read it. However, I feel that this book spent too much time worshipping the Dante Club and their importance, rather than describing the mystery. I figured out who the murderer was long before the novel got around to it, and the brilliant members of the club didn't seem to figure it out quickly enough. I guess what I'm saying is that the book had a slow pace. The main characters were supposed to be masters of language, but they missed a very basic language-based clue. I couldn't wait to finish this book and be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Boring","review":"The concept has everything for someone interested, as I am, in thrillers and mysteries with an intellectual twist. Sad to say, the execution of the concept lacks everything but the intellectual content. The writing is pretentious in the extreme, full of pseudo antiquarianisms. The characters are as thin as the paper the book is printed on. Basing some of them on famous people doesn't help a bit. Mystery plotting is lame and the climax is predictable. And, oh, does one have to wait for the end to come! This is one of the few books I have been tempted to heave across the room into the fireplace, if I had one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viciously gripping novel unable to be put down","review":"Pearl creates a portal for you to step through, if you dare. You'll end up in a post-Civil War Boston that reeks of history, erudition, and fantasy, where you will sup with a menagerie of characters (both famous, from Longfellow to Holmes, and refreshingly original, in Patrolman Rey and young Dan Teal) that will lead you through a tightly plotted-out story and discover crimes horrible enough to pay homage to Dante while remaining scarily possible.This is a novel that deserves all the clich��s of each new writer that arrives: from \\"refreshing the mind of a now cynical reader\\" to \\"swooping in with a completely original twist\\" and from \\"weaving a web of intrigue through strong writing and research\\" to \\"a true phenomenon, one that will live on through the ages.\\"There is no book more deserving of a good, willing reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supense with a bit of history","review":"If you enjoy history, then this book will interest you. However, if you are a fan of both history and suspense/murder mysteries than this book will be a delightful double dip. The novel moves at a reasonable pace, building its characters and the cultural, psychological, and sociological atmopsphere of the time the story is set in. Also, Dante, for those who are familiar with his work, has remained an intriquing persona, both in terms of his work and his persona. Pearlman utilizes this intrique throughout the novel. Hopefully, you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evocative, but a poor payoff","review":"I enjoyed the setting, found the period evocation nicely done, and liked the historical characters. The denouement of the mystery was weak and left me disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dante Club","review":"The Dante Club is a terrific novel and if I hadn't met Matthew Pearl, his father, mother, and brother when Matthew was a young child living in Sunnyside, NY (a town in Queens County of New York City), I would naturally assume that the author was an older individual with much more time on this earth to have gained the muturity to develop such a unique and entertaining novel. The blend in this novel has integrated my enjoyment of biographical historical novels and mysteries to offer a new reading experience for me. When I heard through the grapevine that Matthew had written a novel, I went straight out to buy it. The book is well worth the money spent. The book has been a pleasure to read and I have been recommending it to co-workers who have made note that is has been on the best seller list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superlative Historical/Literary Murder Mystery","review":"Pearl has elevated the genre of historical crime mystery with The Dante Club.

Unfortunately, he sacrifices the story to tell you just how much he really Really REALLY L*O*V*E*S Dante. Well, great, and so do I, but this could have been a much tighter, better book with the help of a good editor to tone that aspect down.Also, Pearl gives away a good chunk of the plot fairly early on with a literary conceit that was so obvious I couldn't really believe he was going to make me, or his hyper-intellectual characters, sit through another 180 pages to prove it out. Gee, maybe the cast of this book wasn't so bright after all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book","review":"The worst book I have read in many many years.

Very long, and slow-moving story, with many under-developed characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Gone","review":"I love well written books, some badly written books, this one is out of the ballpark when it comes to BORING. I have always finished a book, until now, this was the worse book I have attempted to read in 30 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i had read dante's again","review":"This book was terrible. The author spent more time finding good vocabulary than he did on the plot. A book that could have easily been a good suspenseful who-done-it, turns out to be a book that delights in Harvard history and poets, not poetry. This book fails completely when put under a rational microscope and manages to actually describe the sickening feeling it puts in your stomach. Millions in the Civil War and we read about this fabrication with no rational sense and no justification other than the civil war. Don't read this book unless you: love Harvard, have read Dante 20 times, and fantasize about being poet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drudgery","review":"Seldom do I abandon a novel before I have given it a fair chance and read it at least half way through. The writing style is awkward, the story has many irrelevant asides and drags the reader out into endless boredom. This work is nothing short of drudgery. Try \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" by Iain Pears instead - brilliant historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insomnias drug free sleep aide!","review":"I had high expectations for this book. I took this book with me on my fight to Mexico to pass the time. I couldn't even get half way through the book. It was the most boring book that I have ever read in my life. The beginning was very promising. However, after about the first 100 pages this book was about as interesting as watching grass grow or paint dry. If you want to read it for yourself please save your money and check it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious - Mediocre","review":"Very slow moving. Characters never came to life for me. It came across as the author showing how much he knew about Dante and famous literary people. I can appreciate some graphic material since it is a serial killer, but when you combine gruesome details with slow and plodding storytelling, it is just torturous for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving and dry plot doesn't get my vote.","review":"To me this is a slow reader, one that I got got through 70% only because I was traveling and was the only book in hand. Very British, slow moving plot and yes, the characters seem to lecture at each other rather than actually do anything. Two thumbs down on this one. You'll be much better off reading an old Sherlock Holmes book. Conan Doyle moves three times faster for a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dante Club","review":"Proof that a literary degree does not make a good author. Slow pacing, flat characters that are at times difficult to distinguish from each other. The idea of the book is excellent but execution is deadly. Overwritten, at times very repetitive in its exposition. There are no real suspects in the book either for the reader to play detective themselves. There is an excellent section detailing the killer's Civil War experience but the rest falls flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"great historical fiction","review":"This is a great historical fiction novel which cleverly weaves the historical characters into the plot. The author also includes an appendix at the end which clarifies which parts of the book are accurate and which are fictitious. A very entertaining and fun read if you enjoy historical fiction, or fiction in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could finish it...","review":"I have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask. I have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it. Although the first few pages were very catching with the author immediately opening with a murder scene that is discribed with enormous detail; it just doesn't click for me. I f ind it very hard to read more than a paragraph at a time and the story seems to jump around everywhere causing confusion of both characters and storyline. Surely if you can get through the first few chapters it may become interesting but I just cannot do it my self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad that's over.","review":"Matthew Pearl chose such an intriguing premise for his first novel that I really wanted to like it. In the end, however, I don't recommend this book. There are a number of unearned plot twists, a couple of pivotal characters whose motivations are never explained, and a denouement that (yawn), reminds us that the whole psycho-killer plotline has been done to death. And, in this case, not very well.Note: I listened to the abridged version of this book on CD, over a couple of days during drive time. The reader, John Seidman, gets four stars. He has a nice voice and if he hadn't gotten so precious in doing the characterizations of Longfellow's daughters, I'd have given him five stars. Nice work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too boring...too bad","review":"It is too bad this book isn't good because I had high hopes for it. You might not be able to explain why a book isn't good, you just know it. It's as if the author was above the book, maybe? It never got to a level of an entertaining read, at least for me.

Perhaps if I did, this book would be easier to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a pretentious non-reader, you might like it","review":"The thought of great American poets getting together to solve a mystery Hardy Boys-style is ridiculous. I think the story might have been more interesting if I weren't constantly distracted by the goofiness of the poet-sleuth combination.I think the sort of people that would love this book are the same people that loved Dan Brown's DaVinci Code: people that feel that it makes them more educated because of the historical element. If you are an avid fiction reader, I recommend staying away from this one.

My only complaint was that the ending wasn't as beautifully rendered. The writing style serves well, even though the initial descriptions of Dante's hells disturbed me a bit.I do recommend this book, even though it does not draw me into an adrenaline-filled adventure and some plot points were forced. However, several fascinating characters and back-stories make up for all this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tour-de-force","review":"The author has written a detection masterpiece for the masses, with the exceptions of the reviewers who have claimed the book is boring and a sleep-aid. Those poor souls must have been expecting a comic book with a shooting on each page. You won't find that sort of stuff in Pearl's work - rather, you'll have to ponder carefully upon each and every sentence. If you like to think, and enjoy poetry 'on the dark side' (Dante's Inferno plays the central role here), you'll enjoy Pearl's effort. And contrary to the uncalled-for comment by one reviewer that all the good reviews of The Dante Club must have been paid for (there are an awful lot of good reviews, too!), these brief comments are posted here for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Suspenseful and Education","review":"I highly recommend this book. Very cohesive story line and the characters were very well developed. Full of surprises as well.Finally, I appreciate how this book married fictional and non-fiction elements which makes this novel not only entertaining, but also educational. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic read","review":"Of all the literature I've come across in recent years, \\"The Dante Club\\" stands out from the throng. It is first-rate entertainment but at the same time, the thoroughly-researched rendition of a key moment of U.S. history (the aftermath of the traumatic Civil War) and the clever use of Dante's Inferno as backdrop makes this reading one of discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would not and could not put this down","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I have never read Dante and now I can't wait to pick up my own copy. The author's love for literature and the characters showed in this great novel.

Recommend 4 star...recommend 5 star if one has an interest in this time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"We were assigned this in our AP English class, and nobody in the class made it through without being forced. Unlike Dante's Inferno, which we were assigned before this book, it's not a page-turner. Dante seemed to believe in heaven and hell, and a lot of the sins he describes pervade our contemporary culture. I wish Pearl would have writtne something in the same spirit--something which took a chance in passing judgement. Maybe he will next time, and I bet it'll be a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Dante....","review":"The author may be a Dante scholar but he is not yet a secure novelist. The Dante twist is a clever, entertaining plot device but the characters are dreadfully flat. The author supplies clues that are helpful in identifying the characters but these clues become annoying in a very short time: if facial hair is mentioned, it's Lowell; if a recalcitrant son is nearby, it's Holmes; if it's Annie Allegra asking for help with homework, it's Longfellow.

I'm not even sure if I'll finish it. There are too many other interesting reads waiting in queue on my nightstand to waste time on this one. If you buy this book thinking it will be like Da Vinci Code, you're going to be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all cost","review":"The story is extremely slow, I have so much problem finishing it. the writing style is absolutely horrendous. You would not believe that a published writer could've developed such uni-dimentional and boring plot. I've never finished the story nor planned to finish it.

To answer the reader questions: no I would not have guessed the offender correctlt, since he played only such minor part in the story before the last chapters.But what really put me off -and why I would never recommend the book too anyone- is the tedious way the writer slows down the story. Honestly, if you have problems sleeping you'll be cured just by reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite as expected","review":"The plot is intriguing, but the writing is heavy and quite \\"baroque\\".

That about sums it up for two of us. Both my husband and I gave it a real try, but abandoned the book with sighs of relief.Dialogue stilted, plot implausible, style clunky, crime details disgusting, characterization nil. What less could one ask? All that is written in the name of Dante is not necessarily intellectually valuable nor worth reading.If there were a rating of No Stars, that's what we would give The Dante Club."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tedious read","review":"I was very interested in this book before reading it. There were a great many rave reviews about it and the book was often recommended to me. It is very clear that this author is highly intelligent and knows a great deal about his subject, HOWEVER....there was no point during this book in which I was positively riveted or ever really felt much for any of the characters. Perhaps the author was trying to cover too much ground in his use of famous characters...I don't know. I was pretty disappointed. Even though I did not care for this book at all, I would still be interested to read something else by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Tangents","review":"Thoughtful plot but too drawn out and many tangent situations which induced a severe case of bordom while reading. Was hard to finish but did manage. Good scene descriptions of 1865 Boston/Cambridge/Harvard. Crimes were reminiscent of THE ALIENIST which was a better book.

For starters, the characters aren't especially likeable.

I'm happy to say that this is not the case in this fine book. Longfellow and his contemporaries come alive in this book, but Pearl treats them with a respect that's rare these days. His wonderful characterizations had me rooting for the Dante Club as they try to sort out this literary mystery.This is easily the best book I've read this year- the storyline, characters, historical information- all were fantastic. It made me want to brush up on my Dante.

Dante depicts what happens to people when they die, based on what they did on Earth. Not now, on earth... If one has really grasped the Inferno, which the murderer is portrayed to have, he should know this. The Inferno and the Purgatory are Dante's way of justfying to himself the atrocities commited on earth. It's almost defeatist and certainly not provocative.I'm sure Pearl is many times better versed in Dante than I am, yet I can't help but think he tried to write Dante for Dummies and failed pretty badly.For an historical murder mystery, either read \\"Instance of the Fingerpost\\" or \\"My Name is Red\\" which both have much more substance than \\"Dante Club\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointing","review":"I thought that this would be the perfect book for a long trip. An interesting premise; a group of famous 19th century poets turned detectives. Wrong again. The author managed to entirely ruin the experience for me with some of the most stilted, corny, cliched, writing I have encountered in quite a while. Toward the end of the book I found myself constantly looking for the next plot hole or absurd coincidence. I should have been forewarned by the number of \\"blurbs\\" at the front and on the Amazon editorial page. I have generally found that the quality of a novel is inversley proportional to the number of \\"blurb bites.\\" Obviously Mr Pearl can write well, as evidenced by his comments in the \\"conversation with the author\\" notes at the end of my paperback copy. Perhaps he should have taken some creative writing courses after Law School before writing this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like \\"Unholy Bore\\" than \\"Divine Comedy\\"","review":"Like a very bumpy flight to Asia, \\"Dante Club\\" is both nauseating and boring, with long patches where you just want to stare out the window instead of turn pages. I never quite recovered from an extended maggot-fest in the first chapter, rendered in prose that unsuccessfully channels Thomas Harris of \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" fame. I stuck with it because I love Dante, and was waiting for some exegesis or at least a novel take on his masterpiece. However, there are far more burrowing larvae and rotting limbs in this book than glimpses of \\"The Divine Comedy.\\" And Pearl manages the trick of having his 19th-century characters mouth 21st-century Harvard pomposity and cant on post-traumatic stress. I admire the author's obvious immersion in history of the period, but this book was much overpraised and the hype surrounding it will probably prevent the author from getting the training in fiction writing that he so badly needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I was expecting a good mystery with a Dante backdrop, but instead found an utterly dull story featuring great authors rendered as poor caricatures. I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought writing","review":"This is the most overwrought prose I have encountered in a long time. The character's dialog is like they are making speeches at each other. The opening paragraph gives it all away, and if you like that, you will love wading through this book. If you like to figure out what a story is all about, you will probably like this book but the story is not worth the effort. If you want to enjoy the same sensation he tries to provoke, go back to the Hot Zone by Preston. That one will scare your skivies off.Although he got an endorsement from Dan Brown, the story is nothing like DaVinci Code and does not equal its pace or excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many people do I know who didnt finish this book???","review":"Everyone I lent it to...including myself. Growing up my father taught me to always finish the book because sometimes the end makes it all worth it and you shouldnt get into a habit of just quitting a book. Well since I've been reading this is only the third book I've never finished. I struggled to read this and finally couldnt force myself anymore. There were times I would read a page and it was so dull i realized that i didnt really even read it and had to go back and try it again. The best thing about this book was the description on the back of it. The story dragged on and I didnt find it really took me anywhere. I really suggest going to the book store and reading the fist two or three chapters before wasting your money on this book. I think the average reader wont enjoy this book. You really need to love history which I dont mind reading but this was simply overkill. I think the book doesnt deserve all the hype!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Serial Killer Collides with American Literature Greats","review":"Matthew Pearl's debute novel places the reader inside a collision course of post civil war Boston, the hell of Dante's INFERNO, and the literati of New England. Its a fast paced thriller, which captures the post war corruptness and wretchedness of a city, which is plagued by unspeakable murders. One is able to peak into the personal lives and relationships of the likes of Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell, among others. That's the fun part of this very original and diabolical plot. Be prepared to enter a literary \\"inferno\\" with no turning back. Its a definite page turner like no other. I am looking forward to more by Matthew Pearl."},{"rating":"2","title":"The characters were free","review":"The Dante Club is a delightful read about a fictional series of murders that shake the Cambridge literary circle of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow shortly after the end of the Civil War. The characters were free -- historical personages set into the fictional piece conceived by Matthew Pearl. I thought Pearl handled them well and made them seem quite human. The centerpiece of the story is Dante's Divine Comedy. If you have already read Dante, by all means, read this book and enjoy. If you have not yet read Dante, put this book down and read Dante immediately. Do not wait until you have learned Italian -- there are several excellent English translations available in inexpensive editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Particularly nice for Dante fans","review":"As someone who is a real fan of Dante (I normally read the entire Divine Comedy in various translations twice a year), I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The twists and turns of the suspense are very well crafted, and a nice tribute to Dante. While a reader wouldn't have to be completely familiar with the Inferno, at least some familiarity is called for. After finishing the book, readers may want to dig deeper into Dante's work with a renewed interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging mix of history and mystery","review":"The use of true historical figures in a work of fiction is always a risky proposition, but The Dante Club succeeds in its task not only as a work of fiction but also as a window into an often overlooked historical period. Matthew Pearl captures the atmosphere and prevailing political landscape of 19th century Boston, as well as a personal perspective into the periods great literary minds. Against this backdrop he weaves an engaging tale of murder and madness, and introduces Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy to many of us who have never read it. I never once felt at a loss for not having read Dante, although it has interested me enough to do just that!I have recently read The Metaphysical Club in which Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. features prominently, and after reading The Dante Cub, I feel more of a connection to those poets and intellectuals of the 19th century. Pearl takes us to a different time, and entertains us with a great mystery all the while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will it ever end or can he wrap it up?","review":"I'm sorry, maybe it is my ignorance, but I found this book very choppy and boorish and difficult to get through. I didn't like the way it jumped to the Civil War scenes near the end though I understand the purpose. I will give Pearl credit for mentioning \\"post traumatic stress syndrome\\" and \\"civil war\\" together which I'm sure was a reality for many Civil War veterans even though the syndrome didn't come into vogue until after the Vietnam war. Why is Longfellow made out to be such a hero while Oliver Wendall Holmes and James Russell Lowell have a proper amount of human weakness? The character Nicholas Rey didn't seem to fit into the time of the novel. The mystery got lost in all the long drug out scenes of Dante Club meetings and the following of endless suspicious characters with dead-end conclusions. It was messy even though it most likely involved a lot of research. I think I'll skip the Poe mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dante Club is a pearl of wisdom!","review":"Matthew Pearl has taken some real characters (Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, to name three) and produced a mystery that is not only readable, but fascinating and enjoyable.In \\"The Dante Club,\\" Pearl gives us not only an interesting perspective of the personal lives of these American literary giants, but also he's added touches of humor (quite welcomed inthis case!) and some erudite \\"lessons\\" in history, literature, and the Bible!Murder seems to be running rampant in Boston. Our characters are busy translating Dante into English and there are unseen elements who oppose this, quite violently. Harvard Yard has never seen the likes! Methodically, logically, the mystery begins to unravel, with a story line that is mesmerizing, to say the least!Pearl is to be commended--and here's hoping he's planning other such literary adventures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reach far exceeds grasp","review":"I hated this book.I wanted to love it, but the author's obsequiousness continued to put me off.Repeated mis-use of syntax; placing unbelievable 1990's words and phrasing in the mouths of major, literary characters from the mid-1800's; poor pacing and transition in the first two-thirds of the novel -- all created a framework of high annoyance, and not delight.In truth, the concept for this work was terrific. The author should get high marks for it. His EDITOR, however, should be fired, and banned from any future editorial employment.A much better attempt at this genre was The Alienist, by the accomplished Caleb Carr. Carr created an utterly believable world. Pearl's world is, by comparison, populated by video game characters, stilted and stiff, always a long run away from credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books I have ever started to read","review":"I would give this book 0 stars if I could. I fell asleep every time I tried to read it. I am an educated person; I have even read The Divine Comedy. Pearl's prose is amatuerish, ponderous, and totally flat.

There was too much emphasis on the scholars who were members of the Dante Club, and there could have been more emphasis on the murders themselves.This book is very slow moving, and several times I almost put it down for good. Mercifully I got to the end. If you don't mind very slow moving books, and like the setting and the concept, then give it a try. For me, I often found myself using this to help me fall asleep at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow...","review":"While I can certainly appreciate Mr. Pearl's idea for this book and the research and effort that went into writing it, I must say I found it unbelievably slow and plodding. I honestly had to force myself to finish it. I would suggest to anyone wishing to read this book that they familiarize themselves with Dante's DIVINE COMEDY. Since I am not as familiar with it as I could be, it made it that much more difficult to get through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous and boring","review":"This is a terrible book. It is so boring and so poorly written that I used it as a sleep aid. The extravagant praise from professional reviewers and readers is completely mystifying, unlike the book itself. Everyone I know who has read the book feels the same way I do, making the preponderance of positive reviews even more puzzling.This is my 2nd negative review for this book. My first review was suppressed by Amazon. I don't know why. It met Amazon's stated guidelines. Maybe there are so few negative reviews because they're being suppressed? This would be a conspiracy far more interesting than any mystery in this dreadful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russian edition","review":"I've read this book in Russian language. In my mind it was bad translation so it was difficult to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for the paperback","review":"If you are looking for a Cliff notes summary of Dante's Inferno, the Dante Club may be a good choice. Though called \\"A Novel\\" it reads more like a play with a small ensemble of ready made characters and with all the action centered at the Craigie house. The Nicholas Rey character seemed out of place and while it may have helped set create the atmosphere in Boston during that time, he doesn't contribute anything critical to the story. Like Rey, the rest of the cast fit the formula for mass-market mystery novels. The story lacks its own Virgil. It needed a Beatrice or Francesca to create tension. Figuring out who was behind the murders is obvious from the time of this character's introduction. In summary, it's an okay book for a quick read but wait until it comes out in paperback or they make the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bog Down","review":"I got very bogged down in this book. Too many names being thrown around and the prose itself was overwrought and overly dramatic. Sometimes felt that Pearl was getting a bit carried away with his own genius.

I finish many books in a couple nights...It starts fine with an interesting murder with some amusing characters and a nice overall set up... but then it goes off on a bunch of tangents introducing many characters with no depth that all mushed together in my mind with their highfalutin literary refernces that I didn't get...I'm sure there are many people who enjoy high-brow literature will find a way to enjoy this (or at least convince themselves that they did). They would probably get the references and might eventually get all the characters straight, but it was just too much work for me when I just couldn't relate to any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"stodgy and boring","review":"i was really excited when this book came out because i'm intrigued both by dante (i've even made a pilgrimage to his house in florence) and by cambridge. when i started reading it, however, i was put off by the stiff prose, overdone, plodding description and tedious characters. the author manages to take the very gruesome subjects of dante's descent into the inferno and a serial murderer in 19th century cambridge and write a book that is downright boring. i really, really wanted to like this book, but i just couldn't. let me say that i am an avid reader -- i'm willing to put up with a book that has a slow begninning and i almost always finish a book once i start it -- but i could not bring myself to read anymore of the dante club after the first 99 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I've heard people talk how boring and slow this book is but they could not possibly have read such things as Herman Melville's Moby Dick (and not the edited down version) and say this is slow.

Now when the book arrived, it was nothing like the add nor the picture. It was a short fat soft cover! I was so disappointed for the fact my book collection look horrible now with the short book standing out! So basically a waste of money!

Spiritual warfare is alive and real in 2006 throughout the world, but we're not going to learn how to fight in such battles from reading books like this one.

It was...to put it mildly..horrible. Several times throughout the book I thought I was going to have to make a run for the bathroom to empty the contents of my stomach. I kept on hoping that it would pick itself up and turn around until I reached the end and found that it would never be able to do so. When finished, I found that this book left me with a nauseated feeling and I could not read for close to 6 months for fear of something similar happening in another book. I do not recommend this book for anyone, especially people of the younger generation.

I am a huge fan of all Ted Dekker novels and would eagerly recommend his books to anyone. That being said, I was extremely disappointed with the physical quality of the book.

So just a word of warning...This is a bargain book, so you are getting what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian fiction?","review":"I have read all but one of Ted DeKker's books - I was very disappointed in Showdown. I think that Decker is an excellent writer and story teller but this book was adolescent and contained tremendous amounts of gratuitous violence. I believe there are other ways to depict the battle between good and evil without hacking people up or ripping out their eyeballs. It was long on fiction and low on Christianity. Don't get me wrong, toward the end of the books I picked up the parallel between Samuel and Christ but it was quite a stretch. \\"Books\\" or no \\"Books\\" - no parent or guardian would let 13 year-old children make their own rules and then destroy themselves with those rules in the name of personal freedom. The rules were all about love and that point alone certainly didn't show any love at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone like this book??","review":"I've never written a review before, but feel compelled now to hopefully save someone else from wasting their time. I had read some of the reviews on this website before I read the book and wasn't too concerned about the violence it mentioned (I'm a 24 fan, how bad can it be?). It's not the violence, it's the gross, disgusting, twisted descriptions that left me feeling nauseous the whole way through the book. I loved BLESSED CHILD and A MAN CALLED BLESSED, but this? I'm so sorry I wasted my time. I'm reminded of how much I loved the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark, but then when I watched the 2nd (or was it the 3rd) where any suspense was completely overshadowed by grossness, I just don't get the draw? I highly recommend BLESSED CHILD and A MAN CALLED BLESSED, but don't waste your time on this unless you enjoy feeling sick to your stomach throughout a whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"None","review":"i hated this book it was soooooo wierd. i only read to chapter 3 so far but i doubt that i will be finishing. if u want to read about this kinda stuff be my guest..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, but at least it gives you a little closure...","review":"If you love the Trilogy of the Circle (which I most definitely do), then you'll be thrilled to note that Showdown tracks down a loose thread from those books and is crafted around something that had been left unexplained. I admire his skill and courage to attempt it; but I wish he had taking a little more time on the story. I don't regret having read it. It may just be that I know that Ted Dekker can do better. He's more than capable of producing a magnificent thrill ride with profound spiritual meaning. In fact, he's done it more than once. Unfortunately, this work doesn't fall under that category. It's still entertaining enough to complete; but, on the whole, it's somewhat predictable and can seem a little drawn out. I'm the type to not leave anything unfinished, so I'm still glad I read it for the closure; but I wouldn't say that the work stands on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not his best","review":"I loved this book although it's not Ted's best (and I've read them all). Great plot and really good character buildup without being wordy. However it finished way to abruptly. Most of the characters where just left behind with no explanation of what happened to them on a personal basis. There needed to be one more chapter to the book. Also I'm a fan of justice and it seems like some people got away with murder (and other crimes) with no punishment.It's a cleaver story and good points were made. I highly recommend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Supernatural Thriller","review":"Dekker has the wonderful talent and ability to pull you into the scenes wherein you imagine yourself the character. I look forward to books in this genre; there are so few good ones. I started reading supernatural fiction (seemingly real) through Frank Peretti who writes only a few books. In searching for more of the same type, I was pleased to have found Dekker. Dekker gets better as he ages and writes more and more. I look forward to his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"And what a showdown it was....","review":"I really enjoyed Showdown; the way Dekker told the story was gripping-- I almost hit the ceiling when I realized the connection from Showdown to the Circle Trilogy!Another reason I liked it so much is that it connects to the Circle Trilogy, but it is still able to be a stand-alone book.

The story itself is powerful but I wondered how the author was going to tone down some of the violence; not to mention the fact that Shamat was a prostitute in other versions. Ludmilla Zeman has brought this story to children with intensity and grace that comes as a complete surprise. I especially liked her painting of the chaste kiss between Shamat and Enkidu with the explanation that Shamat taught Enkidu to speak and together they explored the ways of love. Very tender.In her illustrations, Ludmilla Zeman has made an attempt to incorporate actual historical artifacts.

One senses the hopelessness conveyed by Salim's passionless actions, a habit of his Muslim family ancestry, who do not change with the times. His relationship with Metty, his servant, seems mutually condescending as is their tradition.

Some of the passages involving the main character and his love interest are very well written and beautiful to read. In fact, I re-read some of the passages again just for the majestic quality of the author's writing.

The characters did not make me care about them....and I didn't \\"get it\\" when it was finished. I knew what Ken Follett wanted me to \\"get\\", but I did not. It was was so trite, that it wasn't even a summer \\"Take me Away\\" type of novel.

Once they arrived, they would not fit in that I've been wearing size 11 of the very same sandal for over 5 years, and the new pair, also size 11 was too small.

Unfortunately, the sandal has a problem with the un-adjustable backstrap. It makes your foot go forward one whole size at least. It is simply mis-placed and needs to be back further so your foot can utilize the back of the sandal as well. I'm not sure about the rest, but the comfort looked nice (never tried on for more than a minute). Too bad. Looked nice, but poor build.

The sandal is very comfortable and seems very well made to last. The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is that (and someone else mentioned this also) that the strap that goes around behind and above the heel is a bit short, forcing the foot just a little far forward. The adjusting strap in front of the ankle does not make any difference and there is little \\"give\\" to this back strap. This seems odd at first but it has not affected the comfort of the sandal in actual use.I am a female purchaser of mostly men's shoes. Used to be that just being men's they would be a bit wider than women's. As I get older, that bit, is no longer wide enough.

The audio quality is good but not outstanding. The ensemble plays nicely with precision but no soul.

Mozart wasn't a pedestrian dabbler on the organ. He played to be heard and make an impression.

He was in the process of his transformation. I must have gone back and read it from the beginning 3 or 4 times. It was like having a low-maintenance diet buddy. I cried when he took his journal offline. I feel like he, Robyn, and the \\"Spud\\" are members of my family. I was so glad when he announced that he was putting his journal into book form. You really cannot transform yourself until you change your thinking. Seems simple enough, but we so seldom do it. Fred is living proof of the power of the mind. I wish him and his family all the best in this endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but simplistic.","review":"My criticism is that he makes losing all of that weight sound much to easy. Basically, he is saying that \\"eat non-processed foods\\", and you weight problem will take care of itself. There is not one month, in that whole book, where he does not lose weight. He touches briefly on exersize, but I don't think he really tells the reader how had he worked. This is more of a motivational book, than a weightloss book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An arrogant bore","review":"I had high hopes for this book -- I thought it was going to be a good read. Instead, I found it to be ponderously written, ploddingly slow, and deadly dull -- and the sense I got of the author made me pray I never end up stuck next to him on an airplane flight. What a self-centered know-it-all! Sheesh.There are much better books out there on this subject -- I highly recommend The Obesity Myth by Paul Campos. The one thing Anderson is right about is that you simply need to eat less and move more, and live that way forever, period. That's what works -- but man, this guy really should have sprung for a decent editor who'd stare him down about some of his puffy prose, and not just allowed his wallowing ego free rein to self-publish. Not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by the REAL Jason Millikan","review":"I did not write the review that is posted on here, I have sent an email to have it removed.

I have been a reader of Fred (and Robyn's) website for a few years now and have always admired how down to earth they seem to be. The book was exactly like I thought it would be, full of Fredisms and good advice. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anthony Robbins should be named honorary co-author","review":"This book isn't very good. While the author's large and rapid weight loss, using sensible food choices and exercise, is inspirational, he spends too much of the book simply parroting his favorite self help gurus - verbatim. If you're familiar with the work of Anthony Robbins in particular, you will find this distracting. I tossed the book aside in disgust after the first few chapters but eventually came back to it. There are some honest moments where he seems to actually write in his own voice about the physical and psychological anguish of obesity. But these moments didn't come often enough for me to be able to recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Derivative\\" isn't enough","review":"I went through a Norman Vincent Peale/Tony Robbins/David St. Clair phase at one point, so I'd already basically read this book. Perhaps he meant to give credits, or is so saturated with the message that he forgot where specific analogies come from, but that's one of the pitfalls of self-publishing. So is repetition. The same \\"look-where-you-want-to-go\\" story about steering into a pole is told twice as if it happened to different people, making it seem likely that it never happened to anyone.It's a good synopsis of the standard motivational-speaker stuff though, which at this point is always derivative, and it does have what seems to be a true story laced into it. It was a good goal, I'm glad he got to it, love the before-and-after pictures, but there's no book here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fred's just an ordinary guy...","review":"who traded in his sugar filled junk food for whole grains and veggies and became a \\"hunk\\". He doesn't exercise endlessly, he doesn't eat weird food, take supplements or drink gallons of water. He just eats nutritious food and exercises moderately. He turned his life around after he saw what his future would be if he didn't change his lifestyle. He decided that his future would be that of a fit, active and healthy individual and he has achieved this. This just shows that you really can do anything you set your mind to achieving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure inspiration!","review":"This simply is the most inspiring account of weight-loss I have ever read.

It was a good story about freedom and rights, but it could have been fifty-pages shorter. During the last four chapters it talked about Anthony and his court trial. Every chapter seemed the same which lost my interest quickly. I also think the book had to many characters. I could never keep track of which person the author was talking about. I think Anthony Burns' story is a good one, but I don't think it was written very well. For example, every chapter was a different season and it would skip years. Anthony Burns had a very inspiring life, fighting for freedom and being traded from master to master; however, the overall story was just not very interesting. My opinion of this book is that it is a good book about a man's fight for freedom, but it was too slow and slightly confusing. I think this book would appeal more to adults or history teachers."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disgrace to anthony!","review":"first, i would like to acknowledge that anthony burns and the story of anthony burns are great. with that aside, i can now say that the book....WAS AWFUL. it was easy, yet confusing. plus, it was not very deep at all. i learned nothing new. nothing at all. not reccomended for anyone looking for something out of the ordinary. not reccomended period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good work shock","review":"These were bought to replace the shocks on my stock 2002 Ford Ranger XLT.

It's now just a figurine that can sit on a shelf instead of a snow globe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sizes are inaccurate","review":"I just got these and I could tell just by looking at them that the sizes were inaccurate. The 2 tsp. scoop actually holds 1 level tablespoon. The 1 tablespoon scoop holds 1 1/2 tablespoons, and the 2 tablespoon scoop actually holds 3 tablespoons. This won't be a problem with most people but for some people who might be running a catering business and are concerned with things like cost and portion control it could be. The scoops themselves are well made and can probably handle the stiffest of cookie doughs. The action on the largest scoop isn't as smooth as the other two but I probably won't use it very often anyway. I'd use it as an ice cream scoop if I didn't already have one.UPDATE: I've noticed that since this review was published that Amazon has updated the description of the item to show the accurate sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor Labeling","review":"These things are good for scooping and dishing approximate sizes and volumes, but as a previous reviewer noted, they are not accurate enough for measuring baking ingredients.

My biggest problem with the set is that the smallest one, which is about 35mm and I'm guessing is a #60 or a #70 isn't labeled at all.Update: According to Norpro's website the smallest scoop, Item Number 676 is a #70, which they claim is 1Tbs, but should actually be about .91 Tbs.

Thankfully, I decided to read other books or I'd have never realized that there were people that actually gave useful and helpful information."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best starring Lou Diamond Phillips","review":"I have loved this movie ever since it first came out and was waiting for it to go on sale at the local video stores! Well, never did see it on sale--can't even find it anymore, except on i did find it on Amazon. Not only does the movie have a terrific cast, with REAL NATIVE PEOPLES starring in it, the movie itself is at times moving, touching, humorous, heart-breaking, and shows what still happens to some of the Indigenous Peoples. The soundtrack is great (I do have that--:D ) and listen to it frequently. Now I'm finally going to buy the video so I can watch it whenever I want to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rednecks 'N Gore, Yeehaw!!!","review":"I thought this movie was pretty boring, and the town was like Mayberry and Hazzard put together! There was too many rednecks and white trash, it seemed like a Rob Zombie film! I did love all the gore scenes. If you are a redneck and love gore, you might like TWO THOUSAND MANIACS!!!p.s.

The ending is terrible to be honest with you. Even if they made a remake of that movie, there should be no animal cruilty and the ending should be different. This movie makes me think of famous serial killers such as John Wayne Gacy; Charles Starkweather; Clifford Olsen; Ed Gein; Jeffery Dahmer and famous woman serial killer Aileen Wurnoes aka Aileen Pitman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD!","review":"The transfer is fantastic! Not to mention the movie itself which, as all H G Lewis fans know, is utterly depraved and fantastic! This is definitely not to miss. The commentary is great, with David Friedman (think that's how it's spelled) and good ol' Hersch himself! Very informative, you can actually learn some things from these masters of shlock. The DVD is great, the movie is better. Great music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Bea Miller","review":"I'm quite familiar with this movie. I played Bea Miller and that's my death scene on the cover.

Although its entertaining... and I really enjoy the commentary on this. I've only seen a little of blood feast and I can assure you that is a much more thrilling movie. But, this concept is great! At first its kinda bad... but... once you watch it 2 times and watch it with your friends you'll enjoy it. Its not half as gory as it says... maybe in the 60s' but not anymore! Still... worth a look and entertaining. Definatly more gore than horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as gruesome as you'd expect","review":"This was the first movie I had seen by HG Lewis.

Its very chilling)This movie is a hoot, and as others have said, the commentary track is very VERY interesting as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great blade. The wood stinks!","review":"I've read that certain types of rosewood have a distinctive smell, but aside from the fretboard of my guitar, I've never owned anything made of the stuff.Fast forward to my purchase of these knives... they have a \\"distinctive smell\\" alright. If you're cleaning them and you get the handles even slightly wet, be prepared for a slightly-smoky, mostly-foul odor.The blades are great... usual victorinox quality. But unless this smell starts to fade over time (it's been 48 hours now since they dried completely) I can't imagine wanting to eat anywhere NEAR these knives again.

Other reviewers -- most of whom appear to be friends/relatives of the author -- led me to believe this was a well-written, fast-paced and unpredictable mystery. Wrong! This book was formulaic and predictable to the point of nausea, suffered from terminally weak paragraph construction and cliche overkill, and had errors up the ying-yang. Definitely NOT a satisfying read, nor a book I'll pass on or recommend -- what it WAS, unfortunately, was a mistaken purchase based on inaccurate reviews. 'Be Safe' should be retitled 'BEWARE!'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not be Mislead By Those Other Good Reviews","review":"I was anxious to read this book based on the Amazon.com reviews. What an incredible disappointment. I only finished the book so that I would be able to write a review. The dialogue is very stilted. The characters are not very developed. And the plot... well, there's something there but the writer just can't seem to pull it all together. An avid reader of good fiction, I was very disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not academic","review":"This book is very enjoyable reading. It's like a memoir or autobiography of Voice of America, definitely not a stuffy academic work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gothic Thriller!","review":"Compared to Bulwer Lytton, the greatest of Victorian occult romancers, this novel has been praised for its narrative strength and brutal gothicism, depicting a premature burial in cholera-ridden Naples of 1884, with a gut-wrenching climax of revenge. Gothic, rather than supernatural, this second novel of Corelli sparked her onto further success to become one of the most widely read authors in Victorian England. If you are new to Corelli, then you are in for a wild ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is master of suspense.","review":"I read this book in 1972. I have never read a book like it since then. From start to finish, I was not distracted by anything more important than reading it. I took it to a restaurant with me and I over stayed my welcome reading it.. I was told to give room to others who might want to come in for lunch.I didn't realize that I had stayed that long. I apologized and left with the understanding that the owner had the right to make money, regardless how much I liked the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading advertisement","review":"I'm sorry, but this smells much more like an Ampharos than a Pikachu. Are they dumb? If I wanted Ampharos-smelling perfume, I would get it. Have they never smelled a Pikachu before? This was really disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fast paced tale of mystery, modern fantasy & sci-fi.","review":"An interesting mix of plot lines and solid writing keeps this tale moving along at a brisk pace. The characters are interesting, but the book as a whole is not as challenging as the authors Nebula winning novel \\"The Falling Woman,\\" or the multiple award winning novella \\"Bones.\\"Overall, a very solid and satisfying story, but with a few quibbles. Why do authors' feel the need to include \\"Ockham's Razor\\" and \\"Schroedinger's Cat\\" as principles that need inclusion and explanation? Along with \\"Gordian Knot\\" and \\"Damocles Sword\\" these must be the most overused clich��s of science fiction and I am very tired of reading them. And what ever compelled the author to name so many characters after herself? It might seem humorous to some, but it really spoiled the rhythm of the story for me.Still, I do recommend giving this book a good reading, to expand your thinking a bit while getting a good dose of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!","review":"Like all of the novels by Pat Murphy/Max Merriwell/Mary Maxwell, this is a fun book that takes you to odd places inhabited by even odder people. It's a lot of fun, has some interesting insight into how people invent their own lives, and says a few things about Quantum Physics as well. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - Hitachi DZGX5020A DVD Camorder","review":"Small, quick and easy to use! I love the ability to save a picture to an SD card from any frame. We bought digital frames for the grandma's this Christmas and I was able to save pictures from the camcorder directly to the SD cards for use with their frames - I didn't need the camera at all. And I have the best pictures because I was able to pick the perfect frame to make a picture! That perfect smile that I would have missed with my 2 second delay camera - I got it this year using the camcorder. There was no learning process and it is very user friendly. The only downside so far is that the lenscap doesn't stay secure when clipped on and I tend to zoom way too fast! This is my first camcorder and I am very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky Camera - get something different","review":"Has trouble with disc formating and playback in general, not to mention the quirky steps needed to \\"finalize\\" a dics to be played elswhere or transfered to your computer you need a special cord, which plugs into your battery charger of all things, and then from the charger into the wall.

I have had several of my DVD's become corrupt and unreadable after I had recorded (and viewed) several videos on them. I called Hitachi and after a LONG phone call was basically told that I had bad luck and they were sorry. It is a porblem with the DVD itself and they do not stand behind the DVD's (because they are from a different manufacturer). My only option is to contact a data recovery service to get back my hours of lost video. Looks like that will cost me about $200-400 for two discs.I understand that they do not make the DVD's, but their cameras use them. If I can record my videos on to them, I should be able to see those videos again. The only way to use their DVDCams are to record onto DVD's!

He was a one man destruction derby under the guise of poetry, linguistics and hate and he helped stir up anti Israel and anti Jewish hatred on every University he spoke at. Hopefully, this \\"vintage\\" book will become no longer relevant, ans disappear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in purchase","review":"It stated that it was used but in good shape. When I received it the front and back cover was all bent up and worn and the pages were yellow from age. I did not consider this purchase to be as expected. All of my other used purchases were in very good shape and the pages were not yellowed like this one was. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great text","review":"This text is a MUST for anyone who is interested in the Middle East, Orientalism, Arab-Israeli conflict and any of the aspects related to the Arab region and identity. It is also a useful book for anyone who is looking at the notion of the 'Other', whether that be in terms of race, gender, religion, politics etc....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"This book is not about blaming the west for what is going on in the world or it is not about the Israeli Palestian conflict. It is about who we are as human beings and how we share a common history and how we are connected to one another. Our experiences have influenced one another for thousands of years and Orientalism simply suggests another way of thinking as opposed to binary logic. There is no east and there is no west as we know and imagine, it is only in our minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and courageous outlook","review":"Edward W. Said is arguably the most important intellectual alive. The Themes he dwells upon are fundamental to understanding today's world. In this book, Said brings a refreshing insight into European literature and its prejudices.A Must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see why people are buying this BUT....","review":"I can see why people are buying this now, following Said's sad and premature death, but the extreme way in which he used to put things (I remember he almost converted an audience I was in to support Israel by the time he had finished) is sad proof that he did not do the Palestinian cause in which he believed any good. (And I speak as one with many Palestinian friends and who is very much in favour of the pro-peace Palestinian cause). Saying that Jane Austen in Mansfield Park is an orientalist is complete rubbish! So read this book, but do so with your mind open. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)"},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute rubbish","review":"It is interesting, as a brazilian, to realize Said's resentment resembles one of a similar kind which portraits Latin America as the victim of American Imperialism. Latin american intellectuals share the same hate, anger and paranoia towards US.This may be why to this day brazilian academics force this appaling book down their students throats.You dont need to be a clinical psychologist to figure this one out: a scape goat is a helpful tool to cope with one's own stupid decisions in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible and Lacking Rigor","review":"Said's book has, sadly, been hugely influential on thousands of university students, their professors, and many living in the islamic world. His book should not be read without concurrently reading Ibn Warraq's critique _Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism_.Said lays the blame for nearly everything wrong in the islamic world at the feet of the West, and thus helped entrench the culture of victimhood that feeds into suicide bombings and riots against political cartoons. By authorin this book, Said confirmed his place in History as an irresponsible poseur in scholarly trappings."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Old Stone Thrower Is At It Again","review":"The old stone thrower is at it again, expounding his one-sided, biased view of history. Said made a career of being a highly-visible defender of the Palestinians; was even a member of the PLO executive council. Too bad he was silent about Yasir Arafat's theft of hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for the Palestinians. He would rather blame the Jews for the Palestinians misfortunes, which they were the SOLE author of. What hypocrisy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False assesment","review":"Lets get the argument strait here: the Western scholars tried to understand Islam through tradition techniques like fact finding and cultural analysis and for Mr. Said this is not good enough and in fact racist. So basically this book claims that to understand and even critique is racist. The main theme is 'how dare the west critique'. Well isn't Mr. Said critiquing, maybe this book should realize its utter hypocrisy to say 'how dare you critique us' on the one hand while then critiquing the west on the other. according to this volume the great flaw in the west is that it dared to try to understand the east, well maybe it would be better if we just remained ignorant of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orientalism is an inaugural book for postcolonial studies","review":"Although from the perspective of postcolonial and cultural studies in the late nineties Said's Orientalism may seem basic or unselfconscious, one must remember the importance of this book to a wide range of fields. Through his identification of the construction of the racist and imperialist discourses of academic Orientalism, Said forces those interested in literary and cultural studies to reflect upon their own status as intellectuals and their own complicity with Orientalism and, by extension, other exploitative modes of power. Said's book at least partially inaugurates contemporary debates about the literary canon, as well as really paving the road for a variety of approaches to postcolonial studies, including, most importantly, the work of Homi Bhabha."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for only one song","review":"I don't like the original version of this song or the remixes. What makes this CD worth it is Erasure's live remake of Blondie's \\"Heart of Glass.\\" This adds to their renditions of Abba, Judy Garland, and other camply classics. It also proves that Andy Bell can sing falsetto just as well as Debbie Harry, very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabe Flops Big","review":"As mentioned by a reviewer below, this self-styled, supposedly-self-deprecating wannabe hipster has written a shallow, not-funny book. He tries hard to be funny in every sentence, which gets tiresome (and fails). All the expensive-name-brand-dropping had me rolling my eyes. If he was showing any talent whatsoever back in law school, I think it was a mistake for him to drop it for \\"his life as a writer\\" instead. I get the feeling that this collection of essays was meant to attract the same audience that reads authors like David Sedaris and David Rakoff. Those authors, however, have genuinely comic voices and some hilarious stories to tell, whereas Hyman may not be lying when he asserts that he's just out to catch the wave of a trendy concept. (Perhaps not unlike the difference between \\"homo\\" and \\"metro\\" in general?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not reluctant at all","review":"Hyman is anything but reluctant. He is a born metrosexual who tries too hard to charm the reader. He is funny and would be a lot funnier if he stopped trying to be charming everywhere and make himself the foil of every joke.

It was a perfect companion for my beach weekend... funny as hell! Hyman's unique writing style and hilarious (over) analysis to his life as a man \\"on the fence\\" kept the pages flowing.

Most of these phony titles are very, very poorly written and are not worth your time and money even as curiosities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treats Sun Tzu as Scrabble","review":"If this is the only military theory you were ever going to get, got your history from comic books and the movies, and had never made a serious study, this would be OK. Otherwise, avoid this junk studiously and stick with Griffith.There's nothing here that any junior officer hasn't expounded upon in the o-club, usually after they've had a few after an excersize. The various \\"quotes\\" given are removed from context, interpreted selectively, and some even originate the commentators, not with Sun Tzu. The way this is done you could get the same strategy advice from a Scrabble set.His history is so poor I lost track of the incorrect dates. Some of the examples have nothing to do with the text used to supporting it if it is correct. He botched the Griffith translation completely, leaving out the footnotes that don't support his position.This is one more book intended only to be sold at overpriced business seminars. Small wonder it sell so cheap on the aftermarket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Bought this for a friend. I have had my copy for years. Good to find a copy at that price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mango? Mango!!!!","review":"I couldn't possibly agree more with Gretchen, above, regarding the rewarding musical experience that keeps on growing after repeatedly listening to this CD. It is a carefully crafted work on which Mango's own compositions shine throughout, not only thanks to Mango's vocal abilities, but also because of the rest of the musicians. Standouts are Il Dicembre Degli Aranci, the traditional Neapolitan song I Te Vurri�� Vas�� and Ti Amo Cos��. The three of them show the kind of range only few singers can dream of archieving, but Mango seems to glide effortlessly through them. Get it. And... by the way... I've noticed Gretchen is from my country too. Maybe we should meet and start a fan club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Italian current music","review":"Just excellent, the entire work of this outstanding artist/singer should be more famous worldwide as he's been singing since 1976 !

This documentary covers the troubled conflict rather well. It combines very well restored footage with a compelling narrative. The only caveat is that while it covers the progress of the war well, the Algerian War was very complex. A little background might help one understand everything covered by the documentary.

I just love Patrick's positive energy...it helps me get through those tough workouts. I have to confesss I never tried his dvds before because I thought they were all very complex and advanced. I have two left feet and no coordination and so the dance and step dvds are beyond me. But his conditioning dvds really work for me. Of course, I do modify them somewhat (I'm 52 years old with creaky knees) but I love them. I feel a real sense of accomplishment every time I sweat through one of his workouts.

Cocoa powder, aka \\"cocoa solids\\", do not contain cocoa butter as does chocolate liquor, and do not satisfy the definition of chocolate. These are a substandard imitation of true chocolate, which is readily apparent in their similarity in consistency to Crisco. The reason they are made with palm oil is because it is significantly cheaper than cocoa butter. It's a cheapness you can taste, definitely.

So just to let you know that if you shop around you may find them cheaper. I first discovered them at the Annual Chocolate Show in New York City being sold as Gustaux chocolates at a price of 22 pieces for [...]. Much more expensive than both Amazon and Costco.

I find the taste perfect--not overly sweet and sickening because the chocolate is the tiniest bit bitter, but also smooth and rich. Just right. I was never a truffle fan before I tried these, I always found them too sickeningly sweet or too bitter, but these truffles, for me, are just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought for a Champagne Tasting - Truly Disgusting.","review":"This is my first Amazon review- ever.

They have the sickening taste of moldy bitter sweet chocolate used in making chocolate fudge. They are not sweet nor tasty in any sense of the word. They leave a bad taste in my mouth and an unpleasant feeling in my stomache. I will never again pay any attention to the reviews on Amazon. How anyone could report that this awfull concoction is good or great is far beyond me. I may have received a bad lot, but I doubt it. Obviously, a number of reviewers of this product who rated it four or five stars would rate cow dung as delicious. Buy a fifty cent candy bar at your local food store instead of purchasing this awful concoction, at least they taste sweet and don't leave you rushing to the frig for something to kill the taste of Chocmod Truffettes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly Truffles","review":"Devinely Heaven is the only way to describe these Truffles.

I don't recall but I got two. I took the one I hadn't opened and returned it and through the mostly uneaten package away. I should have checked the ingredients first.

These things, while they'll satisfy a sweet tooth, are NOT chocolate. Search the box; you won't see the word \\"chocolate\\" anywhere. They are made of vegetable oil flavored with some cocoa.

There is much prep work! I have done other detox programs and none were this...thorough (complicated!!!). You must be willing to clean out your home, toss cleaning products, make-up, lotions, soaps, detergents, you name it! I was looking for something a little more simple & quick start such as the Fat Flush Program which I had done before with great results, but as a vegetarian, find it much more difficult to do now.

My comments contain spoilers.The Julia thread could have been heavily compressed. It seemed a combination of comic relief (the comments about her clothing by a tv personality), a venue for discussing future-earth's technology, and something to fill the book up. I ended up skipping almost all of her pages, just reading where something important to the plot actually happened. Her romance-life issues and banter with her grandfather were page-skippers.Hamilton seems weak on ending stories, and the way the antagonist is flushed out on a murder spree at the end seemed a bit odd. Aside from vengeance, what else would be gained by killing mandel?I did like this book much more than the bizarre Nano Flower that followed, but not nearly as much as mindstar rising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best vocal yet","review":"I like In-Grid's music a lot but I loved this CD. I loved her vocals, and she really shows a beautiful voice with these songs. I own nearly all her CD's and definitely prefer the songs in French to the English translations. Here she covers some French classics and while the versions may not be traditional or lyrics complete, her voice gave me goosebumps. The only thing I did not love was that these seem to be shortened versions of the songs and I like them so much I would have like to have heard the full lyrics. These show off her sound better than her dance songs. In-Grid is definitely a wonderful singer and will hopefully be around a long time. Her variety thus far gives me hope she will endure long after techno is pass��."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done","review":"I love IN CONTROL. It's a flanker to CURIOUS, but I can't pick up on any similarities between the two fragrances. It's limited edition which is a shame, as I much prefer this to the original. (It is still in a lot of stores though; have they made it permanent due to popularity?) It's much lighter then CURIOUS, yet I can still pick up on the fragrance after a day at the office.As you can guess, it is a sweet fragrance, but it's not sickly. The soft floral notes seem creamer as they're enveloped in the cr��me brl��e & the vanilla & musk notes warm the fragrance up. IN CONTROL blurs the top, heart & base notes into one on me.I'd recommend this for autumn/fall as it's so warming & comforting. I also like the black bottle; very dramatic. If I see IN CONTROL in any shops I'll be stocking up on it.Scent notes: loquat fruit, midnight orchid, cr��me brl��e, black vanilla bean, tonka crystals, sugared sandalwood and musk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maltese Falcon","review":"I enjoy the Maltese Falcon generally, and now and again either reread the book, or re-view the movie with Humphery Bogart."},{"rating":"2","title":"On sale for half of retail price","review":"These were on sale for mega low price so I purchased many of them.

Certainly, it contains fine ballads, but only a couple of songs worth dancing to, and you can't dance to those unless you buy the dance remixes! This album had to grow on me before I could listen to it entirely. Much like the two Erasure albums before it, \\"Cowboy\\" contains haunting melodies I love to sing along to. If \\"Innocents\\" was your favorite, stay away from this. If you loved \\"Erasure 1996\\" or \\"I Say I Say I Say\\" then you'll like \\"Cowboy\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD musically and technically","review":"Much of the CD is not for dancing, but is undoubtedly one of Erasure's most mature works. Vince Clark's writing is very advanced artistically; the engineering is top notch- the sound seems to fill up your head and play between your ears instead of pounding at the center of your forehead.Favorite track: Treasure. Why? It's a great driving song! If you get a chance, put on this song when you happen to be driving in the mountains!My only beef with the CD is that I happen to HATE the Magic Moments song! But that's just me... most others I know love it.Vince and Andy: PLEASE do a remake of Vince's \\"Only You\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Erasure has matured and so has their music.","review":"This is without a doubt one of Erasure's best.

I am hard to please in both genres, but Nephilim delivers good \\"aliens among us\\" suspense combined with a demonic plot to destroy Christianity. The main character \\"Mac\\" is a middle aged reporter who has lost his faith for the past two years following the death of his son and the breakup of his marriage. He has fled to the bottle for his comfort, and is on the brink of losing his damaged career entirely. Mac gets a chance for the story of his career, involving secret government installations and mysterious claims of alien abduction. He travels to Israel to see the remains of an almost-human giant referred to in the Bible as \\"Nephilim.\\" His lukewarm interest turns into commitment to saving the world. The characterization is excellent. The plot is far-fetched, but hey--this is science fiction. So...get this book and sit back in your easy chair for an enjoyable mini-vacation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Close Encounter with a Great Book!","review":"What a thrilling story! I couldn't put it down. Interesting characters and a compelling, thought-provoking plot - a real page-turner. Mr. Marzulli is a very gifted writer.\\"Nephilim\\" will not disappoint you! I really hope there will be at least one more sequel - I can't wait to find out what happens next! You really feel like you know these characters. And since I live near the Nevada Test Site, it really made me think about the mysterious Area 51 and what may be out there. Praise God that His perfect love casts out fear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Such A Time As This","review":"This book is a wonderful novelization about things done in the shadows, past and present. It kept me riveted throughout, and was a great example of the importance and application of spiritual warfare. In the times in which we live, this is essential information to be armed with. It ties so many mysteries together. I also liked his inclusion of the book of Enoch, as most people are unaware of this ancient text, which is so relevant to today. Hopefully this book will spark the curious to research out these things for themselves. It is a novel, but it is a reflection of the truth of what is actually happening. Knowledge is power and we need to be armed against the coming Great Deception."},{"rating":"2","title":"COMING EVENTS ON PLANET EARTH..........","review":"VERY ENJOYABLE READING WELL DONE.....NEPHILIUM WILL RETURN WITH THERE GREAT LEADER SATAN, SOON.

I am waiting for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't give it enough recognition the first time","review":"When I wrote my first review of this book I was a little dissapointed but now that I think about it this book was extremely good; for a first time effort from a Christian writer. Yes, again the dialogue is pretty lame but what can you work with if you're writing a Christian book about modern times-tough! I think that Marzulli did an excellent job. The scripture references are accurate and the reader should not be discouraged by any of the other biblical text. I also said, armed with the mind-what was I thinking! This book was probably meant to stress Marzulli's personal opinion on the power of prayer. Hats off Marzulli to a wonderfull first-time effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was published???","review":"Just because a novel is written by a Chrisitan author does not mean that it has to be dry, bland, cheezy, lame, and far-fetched. Yet, that is exactly what this ridiculous novel is. At the core of the book is an alcoholic journalist stumbling around in a drunken stupor all because he lost his son in a car accident (There's originality for you!) Sadly, things only become more ridiculous as the goverment decides to fill him in on their Alien Agenda. There isn't any action, no real drama, and the one-dimensional characters are as bad as the boring, preachy dialogue that is but one of the many flaws in this \\"sugar coated\\" demon fest..."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the point of it all is?","review":"The plot had some promise, but there came a point near the end of the book where it became clear to this reader that \\"the point\\" of the book was MIA. Overall, it was a disappointment. Why the publisher had the audiacity to post a \\"We Guarantee You'll Love This Book\\" sticker on the outside is beyond me. Had they ever read it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A literal deus ex machina","review":"It seems today that many authors begin a book with energy and continue eloquently until it's time to wrap up the book. Nephilim began with a wonderful concept but in the end became too fantastic and shallow, as if there were a deadline for the author. I was prepared for a great battle between the forces of good and evil, but it simply didn't happen; God appeared and wrapped up the book. I'm not a prophet, but can we say sequel \\"Great Deception\\"? Not quite as trite as Heaven's War, more interesting than a dictionary, but it's a book I'll only read once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nephilim","review":"This was an exciting book - cover to cover! Not only did it have an exciting story, it presented the Gospel in a great way. It was not heavy handed. The Gospel was presented in a simple and understandable way. It presented authentic questions and doubts that many have and then presents answers to the seeker. I have often thought that so called \\"extra terrestrials\\" and UFO's were a demonic event. I believe that the enemy (Satan) uses UFO's and the idea of Extraterrestrials as a diversion to get our eyes and thoughts off of God. This books captures that idea well. Read and enjoy! Debbie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nephilim","review":"Very entertaining and intriguing. I couldn't put it down! Unlike many other books, it really got me thinking - is what happened in this book possible - is there a chance? I would love to meet the author and ask him a lot of questions! I really hope that he is able to publish a sequel to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I found this book fascinating and fast paced. Nephilim made me see the whole alien issue in a different light. It was realistic and, at times, terrifying. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary","review":"This X-Files type/Christian thriller about an alcoholic reporter who stumbles into a vast government conspiracy involving human-alien hybrids is scary and well-researched and thought out. My complaint is that the supporting characters are much better developed than Mackenzie, the protagonist. Mac is a bare sketch of a person who says \\"yeah\\" and \\"for crying out loud\\" far too many times.Another thing is that author L.A. Marzulli has not left out a single action in the sequence of events. So the book moves slowly. Still, plenty of chilling moments, as well as food for thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"A platform for proselytizing that left me unmoved","review":"I might have given this book 3 stars if I hadn't felt so strongly that the author's intent was primarily to convert the reader to Christianity. In my opinion, he should have devoted less time and energy toward that effort and more on actually developing his characters.As one who has diligently studied the origins of Christianity, as well as the other patriarchal religions, and has deliberately chosen not to follow that path, I feel the author is insulting my intelligence by including me among those to whom his god sends a strong delusion so that I might believe a lie. I might point out that it hardly requires \\"strong delusion\\" to disbelieve the improbable - a healthy dose of rational thought will suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE IN THE UFO COMMUNI","review":"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE A COLLECTION OF MINOR ANECDOTAL ITEMS FROM THE UFO FIELD SURROUNDED BY FUNDAMENTAL RELIGIOUS ADJECTIVES; FOR EXAMPLE, DESCRIBING THE ALIENS AS \\"DEMONIC\\".

Southwick's myopia is perhaps best captured by her claim that \\"the Regis Touch\\" transformed Apple. Maybe it was too long ago to remember, but back then, having an actual product made a difference. The idea that things are now moving so fast that intellectual property doesn't matter any more is ludicrous.The work seems primarily descriptive, rather than prescriptive, making it ironically backward-looking, and already dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not relevant with all the hypes -- too general","review":"Being a person working in SF bay area, I quickly learned that this book was among the inferiors of the book on the Valley.The descriptions are too general -- the interviews were too shallow and no specific issues are presented in a clear-lighted manner.Good selections for books on the Valley I think is \\"Accidental Empires\\" by Cringely."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Couple Years Later, This Is Irrelevant","review":"This is a somewhat entertaining read if you can get over the basic fact that the information is outdated. Almost all of the statistics are from 1998 and some of the companies cited as future stars never realized their potential. It was relevant in 1999 but quickly lost all significance in the dot-com meltdown of 2000 that is still continuing as I write this in 2001. Dot-coms now require a path to profitability and companies just don't engage in the same behaviors any more.This books still has value for anyone wanting to know some historical background from the times of \\"irrational exhuberance\\" but the changes in business priorities that have taken place since this book was written have doomed it to irrelevance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent look at Silicon Valley start-ups and mature compan","review":"Southwick's book is full of anecdotes about the successes and failures of Silicon Valley companies. using the metaphor of the Gold Rush she shows how companies staked their claims on niche markets, how they changed their company culture to adapt to growth, and the way they cultivated \\"mind share\\".

I had to have a friend work with the holders and bend them to allow for the other two bottles to be held in the holders. They weren't spaced far enough apart. The wine rack is beautiful, and goes along with my kitchen well, but the actual design and placement of the holders was not designed well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute","review":"I was very pleased with this product.

It is very stylish and will get compliments....... SO, If you are looking for something that looks good then go ahead and purchase this. However, if you want to actually put wine bottles in it, then keep looking. Just as the picture shows, only 2 bottles will fit. The bottle slots are made too close to one another to get 4 bottles in. (This is probably why the picture only shows 2 bottles) I tried to play with it but it is already not too sturdy, so I couldn't get anymore to fit in without breaking it.Also, only one hole is provided to put a screw in (at top). I recommend using a molly and a screw (purchased seperately) if you dont have a stud in the wall, especially if you want to hold the weight.:-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I ordered this item for my mother and received a broken wine rack and no invoice for my order.

The recording quality should also be noted, as they have clearly used excellent equipment to record the performance in order to give the listener the best experience possible. Overall the whole thing reeks of quality and passion, you get the feeling that the performers have a deep love for the pieces.

Bulbs are considered 'consumables', like ink jet printer ink cartridges. But you have to wonder about the ethics of a company that makes owners of their projector pay $349 for a light bulb that probably cost them a few dollars to make. Optoma has created a very nice projector - I bought one and used it for a week. I returned it due to the foul smell of hot plastic that just never went away. I really liked the projector and considered buying another one, but the idea of being ripped off for a replacement bulb, which, of course, only Optoma makes, kept me away for good.

Young shows repeatedly how this recent phenomenon is out of step with the way Christian scholars have dealt with extra-Biblical data over the last two millennia. The book is essential reading for anyone interested in the interaction between science and Christianity, in the history of geology, and in modern young earth creationism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of Limited Overall Value","review":"The author does a fairly good job describing the history of the church's understanding of the Noachian Deluge. With few exceptions, the Flood had been accepted as universal. Then, in response to the rationalistic preconceptions of recent centuries, the church has largely backed away from Biblical truth, and settled for a local-flood compromise. Sadly, Davis Young, the author, himself is part of this compromising-evangelical community.

I have two VCRs with auto tracking and tried them on both and at least twice per episode the tracking would get so bad that the screen would go blank before the tracking could catch back up and the quality was pretty poor through out all of the episodes.All in all, not bad, but I'm sending it back since since it wasn't what I was expecting between the quality of the video and the voice acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offers little to the aspiring box builder.","review":"The book presents attractive photographs of a number of boxes that will stimulate aspiring beginning and intermediate box builders.Though offered to suggest \\"how to\\" construction guidance, especially with plans, the book has only the most meager detail of construction and nothing that can truly be called plans. The introduction warns readers that the boxes presented ought not be copied and if they are legal action is a possibility. The result is a book more bent on preventing copies of the displayed boxes than providing useful information for the box building reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this book thinking that it contain info on tips & techniques, as well as detailed plans; I was wrong.The 127 pages are filled with color photos of interesting boxes, but not much else. There is a materials list for each piece, but no plans or instructions beyond a stylized isometric sketch.If you are looking for a book on boxes to decorate your coffee table, this is the one. If you are looking for a practicle guide to box construction, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pales in Comparison to the Film","review":"Wings is the story of a small town boy (Jack) and a wealthy one (David) from the same town who go to war (WWI) and become ace pilots. They're missed by their sweethearts at home; both boys are in love with Sylvia but she loves David, and Mary loves Jack. Both of them just want to make good with the military.As a fan of the film Wings, I wanted to read the book version written by the talented John Monk Saunders. His wit is present in sparse segments, but for the most part, this novel reads like a rough draft. It reads, \\"And then this happened. And then this happened. And then this happened...\\" without enough character development in between. The result is a pale likeness to a brilliant film. I'd recommend seeing that and avoiding this."},{"rating":"1","title":"mainly for devotees","review":"This is a short book by a devotee of American born mystic Adi Da, some of whose books I have already reviewed(eg, see The Knee of Listening).

It was easy to install(and I am no computer nerd). In fact, I am using wireless to write the review.The reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is because my main computer has to stay on in order for my wireless service to remain on. Everytime my computer \\"powers down\\" the wireless network gets cut off. There might be a better answer than leaving the computer on all of the time - but I am unaware of it. Other than that, the instalation was a breeze and I have had no problems with the secured wireless signal that is transmitted from the device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, as long as it doesn't have 1.4 firmware on it","review":"Bought it based on excellent reviews and the need for the QoS feature. It had the 1.4 firmware on it, which is known to be flaky and did seem to be in my case. I tried to back it down to 1.3 without success, and then tried to upgrade it to a 1.5 Beta release and bricked it. I did an advance RMA and got another one direct from Zyxel. It had 1.3 and has been working as well as all the positive reviews said it would. So, a bit of a hassle in my case, but it ended well. On a positive note, the shipping on the original purchase was amazingly fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great with our Macs","review":"I've installed 2 of these in a PC network and was thrilled with them.

Cannot be unlocked without connecting.","review":"My wired ethernet port died and I needed to get some critical work done. The wireless LAN is off by default and cannot be activated without first connecting to the router through the ethernet or using an indirect method of establishing a WPA key with a USB memory stick. Although I received a message saying the installation via the USB memory stick was successful, the router did not appear in my list of wireless networks, nor did it when I attempted to power cycle the router. Attempts to connect to the ethernet LAN port after purchasing a new PCMCIA were unsuccessful (I used a straight-thru cable). I then purchased a NetGear router and I was able to configure through the ethernet without any problems. Having set up 15 brands/models of wireless routers, this was by far the most frustrating and unpleasant experience I've had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy for a Mac only network","review":"After much frustration with trying to setup the router through Safari on the Mac, I finally switched on the PC.

I've never had to re-boot it and never had a problem with dropped signals. The only hiccup it had was when it stopped working a couple of years ago and a quick search on the internet showed that the cause of the failure was a bad AC adapter. After a quick email to Zyxel support I had a replacement adapter in a couple of days and it hasn't failed again since then.The range on this router is also very good compared to other routers I've had. The only reason why I replaced the router was to move to a speedier 'n' router but I will keep this as a solid backup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and is working perfectly","review":"I am having great luck and find this product very easy to use.

Mine was one of them. Bad capacitors that burst. Zyxel was responsive and sent the power supply without having me RMA mine back.Nevertheless, now, after trying to configure it to work with a new DSL modem, it has frozen up. Did a firmware upgrade and now the router won't open a webpage for configuration. It won't even do a manual reset! So, my next wireless router will probably be a Linksys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doubled My Speed And Fixed My SunRocket Phone Service","review":"If this isn't the easiest, best router on the market, I would like to see what better than this is.

The Vonage adapter was supposed to have QOS (Quality of Service) for downstream PC's, but it didn't work for me.I got this router, and was amazed. It worked great and handled QOS perfectly out of the box - no configuration required. As a test, I called someone on the Vonage phone while uploading at full speed from my PC (bittorrent).

Very versatile.","review":"The Zyxel X-550 Xtrememimo 802.11G Wireless Broadband Router is great. We had a Mac based wireless system using two Airport routers to reach our Dell PC 2 rooms away and our sons' Apple laptops when home from college. The old system had a weak signal and was unreliable. When I hooked up this router to our modem and DSL line we had a very strong signal throughout our system. It even reached the Mac Mini and Apple laptops rooms away. It replaced 2 Airport routers to transmit signals to our Mac OS X wireless system. Consider this route if you have DSL and a wireless system. One quibble is that you can't plug a printer directly to the Xtrememimo. Also the Manual and help desk could be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the weakest Marillion album","review":"This may be an even worse CD than Radiation. Easily the best song on this is This Is The 21st Century, which does not even rank up with their better material. I must be missing something, because it seems that most reviewers really like this CD. It may be a very slow grower, as I did not like either Seasons End or Afraid Of Sunlight on the first several listens, but eventually these became my 2 favorites of the H-era. I have given this CD several listens over the past several months to find what I am missing, but finally have had to give up. I can no longer bear to listening to this disk once they get to the yell-singing in Quartz. I am hoping they rebound on their next release as Marillion has yet to make two bad albums in a row."},{"rating":"2","title":"what an awesome album!!!","review":"this album is worth paying for even if it was single with the song \\"This is the 21st Century\\"... this is my favorite song of all my fish, marillion albums to date.

At the same time Marillion took a great step from the previous albums. This shows that the band is making progress, instead of repeating itself. Progfans may hate this progress, but others may fall in love with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marillion the quintessential...","review":"I started listening to Marillion mainly since I heard \\"Easter\\" on a Dream Theater video. I really liked that song, but the first album I bought was Script For A Jester's Tear. It was wierd, as if I had already heard it somewhere else before, but I knew that I hadn't. I knew that this was going to be one of those bands that you never stray from. There has been a few times when an album wasn't as impressive as the last, but I have to say that Anoraknophobia is the most phenomenal album I've heard (in the Hogarth-era). I can't say that I favor any one track; they're ALL great! I don't know about anyone else, but I've noticed a bit of the Doors in \\"Separated Out\\"...Hey, it's all good."},{"rating":"1","title":"MainStreamMarillion","review":"It's a good CD, it's entertaining and well written. It is not a good Marillion CD. I got into this band because of the music of course, now they are a mainstream rock band, and it looks as if they intend to stay that way. Straight forward drum beats, hooky guitar riffs. We all understand the need a band has to grow and evolve, but to completely change your music style... This band has it's following because of what they were. They will never be a successful main-stream rock band, it's not going to happen. I wish them luck, I'm still a fan, but I'm not feeling the love."},{"rating":"2","title":"not great, but not bad either","review":"well, the title pretty much sums up my opinion of this album. it is by no means week, but at the same time, seems to lack any one stand out track.

I can understand their financial problems, but that's no reason to sell your heart and soul. I would have been way much better to create something that is their own. Don't get me wrong, because it's another good thing to make innovative. However, Marillion is not that kind of band, because their are best in doing what they've done with magical records such as Clutching at Straws, Misplaced Childhood, and Afraid of Sunlight. Another problem with this latest release is the chaotic structure of the music. Whatever happened to the song writing? Endless pieces of music combined with useless sound fragments. The singing of Steve Hogarth fails to impress as well. I'm sorry to say, but Marillion it ain't. All I hear is a bunch of old rocker trying to be hip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear of mediocre music","review":"Limp fisted, hard soft rock which can hardly be said to justify these apparent pretentious release circumstances finds the lightly progressive unit churning out some of their blandest late-career work under the guise of accessibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Marillion Album in a Long While","review":"I don't buy the way Marillion has compared this CD to Massive Attack, for example. I just don't see it. I also disagree with people who describe this album as revolutionary. I don't see it being anything more than evolutionary.That doesn't mean I don't like it however. What I do see (or hear, rather) is a very fresh sound, something that was sorely lacking on the albums Marillion has released since Afraid of Sunlight. Quartz, If My Heart Were a Ball It Would Roll Uphill, and When I Meet God are stand-out tracks. And all the band members are in fine form (despite the wailings of prog-rock geeks lamenting the loss of widdly Rothery solos).It's a shame that Marillion get slagged as an '80s/prog rock/ Scottish heavy metal band. They've been moving away from those genres pretty much since H joined the band.

Eight songs proudly display their talent as a whole unit, and as individuals as well. Drummer Ian Mosely shows off his efficiency in the straight forward rocker, Between You And Me (throw in a little Beatlesque slow-down in the middle). Pete Trewavas, bassist, keeps the pace with a kicking line in Quartz. Steve Hogarth, vocalist, is quite intense in When I Meet God and If My Heart Were A Ball, Keyboardist Mark Kelly is awesome in This Is The 21st Century, and Steve Rothery is his usual exceptional self with a mad guitar jam in Fruit Of The Wild Rose. This is a wonderful Marillion album, although I wouldn't lead first time listeners to this, as it is missing the grandiose piece that has showed up on most of their albums. Also missing are the intense mellower numbers--not your typical Marillion album, this is a rocker!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marillion sell out","review":"This is a caricature of what the band once was.

This is a great live album that needs to be cranked up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glenn Hughes At Top Form","review":"If you are a Glenn Hughes or a Deep Purple fan of the Coverdale/Hughes era you should get this CD. Although I thought Deep Purple took a step back when Ian Gillian and Roger Glover left Deep Purple and David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes joined the band they made some great songs. This CD in my opinion captures Glenn Hughes at his best singing some of the best Deep Purple and his own songs live in concert. His voice is in top notch form and the sound is great for a live recording. If the rock and roll Gelnn Hughes is what you like here it is in all it's glory. At times I can give or take some of his solo stuff but this is kick [...] all the way.

He opened up a whole new world of music to me for which I am forever grateful.Sure The Essence sounds like the Cure but 99% of all bands sound like someone else.

If you are a horror fan and even feel a moment compelled to watch this film, turn on your TV and watch the Weather Channel...you'll be much more entertained. No joke. I'm a horror buff. I was horrified that this film had a price tag. If someone gives it to you free-of-charge they are not your friend. It's like slipping Ex-Lax into baked brownies. Oh Sh--!. Enough.

They just don't feel very absorbent. I have washed them several times now, the same way that I wash my other towels, and they still don't really dry you off as well as our old towels do. I have had this trouble with designer towels elsewhere, but I thought it also had to do with softened water, which we don't have here. I looked at the tags on our old towels, and all of the following are way more absorbent: Martex, Stevens, Feldcrest, St. Mary's and Cannon. Too bad !! Additional information: I am upgrading them from two stars to three. After several additional washings, they are beginning to feel like halfway decent towels. The brand is apparently a sub of Martex... Atelier [by] Martex. I guess nothing's what it used to be...(update a few months later, the towels are fine now. whew!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I just received these and was very surprised to find out how poor the quality of workmanship was. I ordered two sets of bath towels and two sets of washcloths. Three of the four towels have threads hanging off of them with two of the towels having at least ten or more very long threads. Two of the washcloths have threads and one isn't finished off well at the edges. In addition to the sage set I ordered two sets of linen bath towels and two sets of linen washcloths. One of the linen towels looks a bit threadbare on the side and has a few short threads hanging off of it. I don't know how these could have passed through quality control. These towels are not acceptable and I am planning on returning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor craftsmanship","review":"I ordered 2 sets of Supima towels. I am disappointed with the quality and craftsmanship of the towels even before I start using them. Three out of the four bath towels have multiple loose threads, pulled loops or irregularities.

I cannot imagine a towel with such poor craftsmanship can pass their QC and sold as first quality item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Towels change colors","review":"Pure junk, even before I washed it the towels changed color. I purchased 3 different sets being confident that Amazon wont' push crappy quality items, but it is not the case.If after you wash your hands and wipe them against brand new towel the color doesn't suppose to change. The description of them being soft is far from accurate as well.One lesson learned: I am not purchasing any more housewares from Amazon unless I am familiar with the product.Bottom line avoid it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I just finished washing a set of these towels and I was horrified to discover the cotton is pilling. There are little bits of cotton everywhere. I am very surprised this happened since I have purchased Martex supima cotton towels for years. The colors are beautiful and the fabric is soft, but the towel is useless if I am covered with cotton bits when I dry off.I wish I had read the other reviews before I made my purchase.

They even had \\"inspected by\\" stickers. I washed them immediately and they came out of the dryer fluffy and very soft. Yes, there was some lint in the trap but not more than would be expected for a new towel.

While the cotton is fairly soft, the quality of the towels is horrendous. The edges have extra thread, the ends of the towels do not synch, etc., etc. I tried to make a go of it -- cutting loose threads and deciding that most of them would be salvageable. Big mistake. They all should have gone back immediately. You will be embarassed to show these to guests, and based on my first washing, they won't last very long even in their present condition. I agree with the poster who thought these were perhaps not first-run: my set had some with \\"inspected by\\" stickers, and I'm afraid that some second runs and \\"imperfects\\" (to use a generous term) that should have gone to an outlet store somehow made it to Amazon.

The author is supremely well versed in her subject matter. She is very adept at examining the historical roots of a vast and complicated problem. Her analysis could well be applied to modern Pan-Arabic movements (which seem so close to Nazism in their lack of concrete political goals) which are so prevalent today. Similarly, the analysis she provides sheds light on the racist aspects of Zionism. Her analysis of imperialism is dead on. Her realization that anti-semitism has its roots partly in a narrow minded desire to blame someone for certain societal problems and partly from certain historical behaviors of the Jews themseleves is enlighteningAs a useful book for understanding many aspects of the modern mob mentality, it is a wonderful book.

If you just want to know about Totalitarianism, get the volume only containing that portion. This is an incredibly dense and comprehensive history that takes both patience and time to wade through. The journey is well worth it, though, as Hannah Arendt shows the incredibly destructive nature of all that makes one human under a totalitarian rule. It isn't a fun read, but definitely a rewarding one."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible copy of a wonderful book","review":"This is a digital scan of Arendt's classic work using OCR technology. The text is jumbled and riddled with mistakes. The notes are interspersed with the text with no clear differentiation between the two. Chapters begin and end mid sentence. As a result, a difficult book is made nearly unreadable. I strongly suggest reading this book, but steer clear of the General Books edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Microscopic Arendt","review":"First of all, my apologies to those who insist that reviews deal only with the content of the book under consideration. That said, my downgrading of Arendt's marvelous and cogent work is predicated on the microscopic printing in this edition, the Harcourt trade paperback. Arendt's writing is dense, but not near as dense as the printing. The publisher has crammed 45 lines of small print into a less than 7-1/2 inch page, with even tinier footnotes on most pages. I found it impossible to focus visually on narrow segments of text, a prerequisite for following Arendt's complex thought. So I wound up buying the Kindle edition, which lets me set font size to my comfort. I wanted to keep a hard copy, so I'm keeping the paperback, but I'll use it only infrequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much worth it","review":"\\"The Origins of Totalitarianism\\" is in the best German tradition: turgid style,high-flown philosophising. The whole issue is presented in a roundabout way that makes it difficult to see what it is aiming at. I think there is a rambling quality to it that frustrates the reader's efforts to get the point or the general drift of the argument. Also, truths are delivered with an ex cathedra tone above ordinary explanations and analysis. As to the \\"insights\\", I think they are seriously flawed. For one thing, I don't think Stalin intended to conquer the world following the precepts of a guiding ideology. He was much more keen on keeping on to his throne in Russia, rather than risking everything (like Hitler) in a gigantic bet with history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable as historiography","review":"Largely discredited as an explanation for the origins of totalitarianism, this book remains invaluable for the scholar of the historiography of fear, coersion, and the Mass Man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I am sure that there are some important points made in this book, but its turgid prose is so difficult to understand, it is not worth the effort.

This handle also seems a bit too long to me--perhaps it is proportioned for someone taller than 5'4\\". I use the bag daily and overall, I am very pleased with it.

I wouldn't really say that Someday's Dreamers is aimed at adolescent girls, though I'm sure it would appeal to some. In general, I would say the action and romances are too slow to develop and will leave the average teenaged girl bored long before she could appreciate the subtle nuances of the story.This series' creator has taken a more \\"realist\\" approach to things, presenting a solid, stoically paced story with beautifully realistic imagery.At times, the story leaves the viewers confused, but things are explained in time, and it helps us relate to the dazed, confused Yume.Just do yourself a favor and watch it in Japanese...the dubbers' decision to give certain characters Southern drawls to emphasize that they are from the \\"country\\" was stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up there with Miyazaki !!","review":"This anime is so good in so many ways I don't know where to start.^_^ The first thing you notice is that the animation is outstanding and very realistic. The character development is excellent and you get emotionally involved with the characters and the plot much more than even in the average good live-action dramatic film.Yume, the protagonist of the series, is a young mage-in-training. Despite her obviously overwhelming powers, she struggles with insecurity and shyness. We see, however, how Yume's powers come from her intense feelings of love and her concern for others.Obviously the series is inspired in Studio Ghibli shojo like Kiki's Delivery Service, Whisper of the Heart and Umi ga Kikoeru. And it really does measure up to Studio Ghibli standards. I guess that's the ultimate compliment you could give any anime. ^-^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"A very very nice anime.

Although the focus is on FileMaker, the knowledge you'll glean will apply to web development efforts with other databases as well. I reviewed and skimmed the chapters out of sequence in order to get a sense of what the book had to offer. Once I had that overview, I began to read the chapters in sequence and I think that's the best approach, as material in succeeding chapters builds on the previous chapters.

This books \\"chronicles\\" (another tip that this is not a medical reference book) the lives of three women along their TTC journies. It is helpful because no matter where you may be in your personal journey, there is a chapter for you. It's a quick read but it truly does walk you through the main and most common steps of infertility diagnosis, treatment and options. A+ for making me LOL and for the realism it provided.

I agree with another post stating that in no way this book leads you to believe that it is a medical book to help couples with infertility information. I found it to be a good book to relate to with my own journey to TTC the past year and being unsuccessful--more like a girlfriend's guide. I would recommend this book to anyone who is trying to find someone to relate to and feels alone in their infertility troubles. This book helped me relax a little about my own struggles and did add a some humor to a stressful situation.

It provides some much needed levity to a situation that can really be stressful, painful and disappointing. It is not a hands-on medical book, like TCOYF is (and others). Its more about coping with the REAL emotions involved with not being able to conceive and dealing with a world around you that makes it look so incredibly easy.

I really identified with the authors and felt as though I was reading my own story. It just felt so good to laugh, and to know I'm not the only one having these crazy thoughts and emotions while despirately wanting to get pregnant.This book helped me put things into perspective again with my husband (my secrets out...I've been manipulating him for his sperm) and my non-fertility challenged friends.

We liked \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\" best. It covers all the relevant points about infertility and treatments, provides insight into how to improve your fertility, looks into the future for new technologies, and addresses surrogacy, sperm and egg donation, and communication with your future children about their conception.Do yourself a favor - if you want good solid advice get \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Does This Stuff Get Published?","review":"What publishing executive woke up one day and decided every infertile woman (and man) wants a CHATTY, IRREVERENT, and TONGUE-IN-CHEEK guide that belittles men, drones on about insignificant details, and makes light of the infertility process?There seems to be a rash of books like this coming out on the market in the last two years. I'm afraid \\"girlfriend guides\\" are too much reality for me. I'm not one to read gossip rags, watch reality TV shows, or rubberneck every fender bender.I consider myself among those who have lots of girlfriends and not one of them would appreciate this type of book.My husband and I found a couple that we believe are more useful like the Couples Guide to In Vitro Fertilization and the newest one, What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant.

I did do a lot of back and forth to review things or skipped portions that didn't apply, etc. but since part of me felt like I was going through it w/ them (or them w/ me), I wish I knew how things turned out for them.

Occasionally he gives tips on what are common MPRE questions, but nothing earth shattering (conflicts is a big part of the exam...shhhh don't tell!!). Plus, the rules have been revised a little bit since these tapes and they are no longer completely correct (example: the rule about permissive breaking of client confidences has changed).Even if a more recent set of tapes by this guy is available, I'd really think twice. He really doesn't give you any more insight into what's on the MPRE than the rules themselves and I don't think it's gonna help you much in a PR class unless you class is very very very basic and black letter oriented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, cross-cultural Anthropological Study of Islam","review":"This is a classic work on Islam from an anthropological perspective written by a great anthropologist. Essentially it works because it has a gimick--being that it focuses on Islam in two cultures that are vastly different from one another. Indonesia and Morroco are at oppossite pole of the 'Islamic World' and the practice of Islam in each respective country are even farther apart, in the traditional sense. Geertz shows that while these two cultural manifestations of Islam may seem infinitely divergent from one another, they are nonetheless connected and complimentary. While this book now shows its age and has its weaknesses, it's short and contains many insights that make it an enjoyable read. It makes for a good partner to engage within scholarly dialogue while at the same is and equally good partner for casual reading for those with just a general interest in Islam as a cultural phenomenon."},{"rating":"2","title":"grandson loved it","review":"Bought this blanket for my grandson.

The intent may have been to give the listener an example of Bassey's breadth, but what such a historical perspective does is allow one to hear how thin and uneven Bassey's pyrotechnic voice has become over the years. \\"Argentina\\" and Whitney Houston melodramatic \\"Greatest Love of All\\" are troublesome to hear. Missing from this retrospective are Bassey's Bond blockbusters. While her vocal prowess is suitable for such cinematic songs, it completely over dramatizes Cry Me A River, And I Love You So.

So rarely are urban writers able to transcend the particular politics, technology, and norms of historical situations and leave you feeling as though you've pieced the story together yourself from a recent Sunday paper.

I loved everything about the old clock, from its appearance, to the chime with the adjustable volume and automatic night time silence. The new clock's description sounded like it would be the same clock, with only a slightly different face (less ornate). While I wasn't anxious to buy another Seiko, as broken Seiko products cannot be repaired anywhere but the one approved repair place in New Jersey, I didn't see anything I liked in the competing brands. So I bought this clock. It is a big disappointment. The materials are lower quality, which makes the appearance less appealing.

I miss him terribly, and I wish there was some way I could convey this message to those who were closest to him, particularly his mother. Jeff had a talent that is unmatched in my opinion. His music was like poetry, and I cry when I hear him sing certain songs. I highly recommend this book to all Buckley fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good at all","review":"I suppose, however, if what you want is a biased view on the other's religion then this is a good book for you. From a scholar's point of view it takes an exlusivist stance, chock full of misunderstandings and misinformation. In fact scholars don't even use the term \\"cult\\" since it is pejorative. The term \\"New Religious movement\\" (NRM), \\"alternative religious movement\\", or \\"New religion\\" are preferred. This book works to reinforce stereotypes present in society about NRMs. You would do better to check out anything by J. Gordon Melton who is considered the American expert on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larson did no research whatsoever on different religions","review":"Bob Larson is a fake and a phony. Anyone that buys what he is selling diserves to lose their money. He did zero research for this book.

Great book, you should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a teacher, this book is great for classes!","review":"This book has it all: foreshadowing, symbolism, and a 17 year old who uses his head. From fights with polar bears to fantastic description of the Arctic, readers of all interest levels will be engrossed from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story for any age","review":"I found this book in my local library and first read it at the age of 19. I loved it, and it remains one of the best survival stories I've ever read. Allan's loneliness and (at first) hopelessness draws the reader in, and we marvel at Allan's ability to survive in such a harsh, unforgiving place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to share with your kids","review":"Good book to share with your kids, you will both love it. Based on a true story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for children","review":"I originally read this book in 6th grade and now, 20 years later, it is still difficult to put down!

An outstanding gift for any junior high level child."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was enjoyable...","review":"This book was very detailed in the story, which made it easy for me to see what the main charactor was explaining. The plot was very entertaining. I was sucked into this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-Read","review":"I had a very smart and very good teacher in grade school. We had to read a certain amount of books each year, and some we HAD to read as a class so we could discuss them. The Iceberg Hermit was one of them, and I have to say that it was one of my favorites of the must-read stories we had to pick from, right up there with Bridge to Terabithia, Tuck Everlasting, Mrs. Mike and Where the Red Fern Grows.I had lost my copy years ago, but thought of it again recently. So I was pleasantly surprised that it was still in print. I remember how my imagination soared, trying to picture the main character stranded in the middle of nowhere. I was transported to another place and time, and 20 years after reading the book, I can still remember it vividly. If you are looking for some good reading material for your children, this will NOT disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of being a film","review":"I first read this book about 25 years ago and still have a copy that old! It was great to find to references to it on the net, it is a great survival story that captures the imagination of young minds. I am going to dig it out and read it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As exciting as an iceberg floating in the water.","review":"I read this book when I flew to California as a kid. It looked like an exciting book from the cover and I only took that one book based upon the cover.Since then, I have used it as a metaphor for something you must complete but hate doing the whole time.

All that can be considered memories in a computer can disappear in the flick of a switch. But for humans, memory remains. Is it futile to try to share memories with a machine? If the machine loses that data, what comes next? What could come of such a relationship?This disk asks more questions than it answers. It's definately worth watching but it makes it all the more painful to wait for the final episodes. By now the series has become a full blown drama.

The retelling of the crucial fairytale scenes at the beginning of a chapter captured my interest, then the delivery of a lucid analogy to a spiritual truth opened my eyes to a new interpretation of the familiar stories. This is a book to ponder and the way it is written makes the pondering enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have Holiday traditions.","review":"An amazing story about giving.

Provides the right kind of authoritative benchmark behind the \\"whys\\" in planning nutrition for sports and then takes things a step further looking ahead to support planning the how and when to eat for peak performance. Detailed enough for the serious elite athlete yet even without having the science at my finger tips it provides an understandable base line for the weekend jock planning specific sports activity and wanting to do the correct thing...Ties together all those helpful \\"coach-isms\\" we all heard over the years and dispells several that were not afterall in our best interest. I'd like to have Dr. B available as my personal trainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% Too Advanced for Everyday Athletes/Coaches","review":"If you're not a doctor or professional dietician, this book will be nearly unusable. It reads like a complicated medical journal, at best. This would be fine if it had offered general, practical information for those without a PhD, but it never did. Honestly, if you can understand this book well enough for it to be put into practice, you're likely smart enough to have written it yourself.

Not only does Orange revolution excellently document the power and effectiveness of non violent resistance, but it also gives the viewer a wonderful glimpse into the culture of Ukraine. Unlike many political documentaries that can come across as rather flat, Orange Revolution effectively captured these people's thirst for justice. This film looks at the revolution from many different angles and documents the resistance strategy step by step. I would highly recommend this film to any one interested in learning about civil resistance or simply the tenacity of the human spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best DVDs you'll ever see","review":"This DVD shows people at their best lifting each others spirits and gathering for the common good.

When I called Bargain Cell Customer Service, they gave me the complete run-around and would not stand behind the product. All I wanted was a replacement which seemed fair to me, and I was even willing to send the lemon unit back to them at my expense. They refused to do anything for me, except suggest that I could purchase another one of these at full price. This was before the price was dropped to one cent and they were like $5 apiece plus shipping.I thought I was getting a bargain, but instead I got a LEMON. STAY AWAY!!! There are more reputable and responsive third party sellers out there.

This product is a one-trick-pony, but it is very inexpensive and it works. I've recharged my 30G iPOD several times with this item and it works every time. You can also listen to your iPOD while recharging. From a totally drained battery it took less than 2 1/2 hours to recharge, and this was with the iPOD in use.This is a low cost way to get around Apple's incredibe, ridiculous, shameless, asinine, no-excuse, utter CHEAPNESS in not providing a power cord that can be plugged into a wall socket. Without a product like this you have to plug your iPOD into your computer to charge it (the computer has to be on).How cheap is Apple?? They didn't even provide a 5 cent CD with the programing. I had to go on their web site and download the program, which took an hour and a half because I have dial-up.

As soon as I get a new CD, I always listen to every song straight through, unless the CD really sucks. Now I have to skip the dedications and some songs like \\"Apple Pie A La Mode\\". What is that supposed to say anyway? Apple pie with ice cream sounds good, but it has no depth in R&B/hip-hop music. Pop music, maybe they could make it work, but the title ruins it.

SONY thinks beyonce's practice sound is good ? and in survivor she singing about topped world wihtout them,but the 2nd album made by ex-members, grammy was for the others,too. i want suggest that they need to change their names to Beyonce with backups or 2nd edition of Diana Ross and Supreme or Family Business.only good songs on this album is emotion & nasty girlif they still have ex-members Destiny's Child would be REAL new R&B group Sensation but they don't"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I pre-orded the Destiny' Child CD expecting to to be as good as there previous album.

The songs aren't as catchy as their sophomore album, though they are still pretty hot. I like all the songs, more specifically... Fancy, Happy Face, Emotion, Brown Eyes, The Story of Beauty... The K-Mart exclusive track, Dance With Me, is also a good track. It's a shame that it isn't on the CDs sold in other stores... And finally, all the voices of all three girls are showcased on this CD, though Michelle's vocals weren't as prominent as Beyonc�� and Kelly's.

This CD was not well put together and Michelle shouldn't be singing because she has no talent. I hate to write a bad review about this CD because I love Beyonce but the song's on this Cd are so stupid. While there may be a few good song's such as Survivor, Nasty girl, Brown eyes, and Dangerously in Love the quality of the other song's just brings the value of the CD down. If you do buy this CD you will be skipping around a lot. If you want a Destiny'd Child Cd that's worth your money I suggest you go get The Writing's On the Wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its time for a Change!","review":"I bought this cd buying into the hype that it was a new direction for this group, but I found out that it was more of the same.I mean, how many times can you rehash Bills,Bills,Bills. I should have known better after hearing that terrible first single, 'survivor' to stay away from this one.Even though they changed some members it basically sounds the same as the last cd.It was cute, even hype when they announced their independant woman stance but now its time to move on.This cd Is not even worth the used price that they have on it.I hope on their next cd they will feature the other girls more equally and work on better material, but as far as this one, stay away from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have spare change, buy this CD!!!!","review":"This album might be your favorite, or a CD you never wanna seeagain!

I am crazy about \\" Survivor\\", \\"Bootylicious\\", \\"Fancy\\", and \\"The Story of Beauty\\", but I think \\"Nasty Girl\\" is totally NASTY!

Can they sing a song in A flat minor? G or E?? Don't think so. What these ladies need is some real writers. Some bona fide producers who write real songs. This music is the typical junk that is looped, sampled and manufactured on several so called hit records that are on the program directors play-list! Plain boring is what it is. I gave them 2 stars because their in shape, and probably spend many hours in the gym, hair saloon and the nail shop. If their manager spent more time on the musical quality than what he spends on their image these ladies might be well deserving of all the hype. Let one of the other ladies sing lead PLEASE! Or please teach Beyonce some new vocal runs! One more album like the previous two and their musical career is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is uneven","review":"My friend played this album for me and I just can't get into it. Survivor is really about Beyonce be self-center and attacking the girls they throw out the group, not into the beat. Bootylicious really don't work with me. Just not my style. The other song on the album not that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a Survivor","review":"I might be only 11 but I know what good pop music is. And this my friends is by far one of the best.

But \\"don't hate 'em because they're beautiful\\" to paraphrase the old saying. Hate this album because it sounds like somebody's daddy let them into the studio to just do whatever yelling and hollering that they wanted. (Oh, isn't that just what happened?) Although the harmony is good, most of the songs are discordant and hard to listen to. And what is up with the \\"borrowing\\" of the intro music from Stevie Nicks' \\"Edge of Seventeen?\\" Were the girls even born when that song came out? Oh, and we get that you girls love each other, which is very touching but gets old after the 500th time that we hear it. On a positive note, Independent Women Part I is a great song. And the girls do a great job on the old Bee Gees tune (and it is SO obvious that Emotions was written by someone else!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just download","review":"I am disappointed with the CD!

They are just as important as she is, and she tries so hard to steal the show with changing her vocal range so often in a song. A DIVA does not try to be a diva she just is and Beyonce is far from that title. She also protray's a calm and humble girl but seems very much the opposite. The music on the CD is ok, I as said before the other members need to be heard and shown more and let Beyonce take a back seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"This is their worse album yet.

Beyonces voice gets annoying after a while. The songs are really bad. I only like th survivor song. I give it 2 thumbs down!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barf! This won't be surviving in my CD player!","review":"Let's see here, after the halfway descent Writing On The Wall this is a complete and total disaster. While the songs on the last CD were not too bad this CD one the other hand is a pathetic follow up to it.It's the childish, amatuerish, gender bashing music that makes me hate most modern R&B music these days. I literraly am wondering if this juvenilia songwriting that coulve come from an 8 year old was written by some 20something year old because it's literrally unintelligent childish drivel.The title track and Independent Women were good songs but have now completely worn out their welcome and are deeply annoying to my ears.DC had better grow up and put some emotion and soul into their music and improve their songwriting if they want to be considered real singers and musicians because with musical mush like this they will literrally fade from the limelight.Not recommended at all. Go and buy Alicia Keys Songs In A Minor CD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Making Machine","review":"It is now obvious why the emphasis for Destiny's Child is their appearance. I am surprised this album is doing well. The songs are poorly written. Did Beyonce graduate from high school? A ten year old can write better lyrics. But as long as she continues to dye her hair blond and all three of them continue to wear skimpy clothing, they will sell records. They do not care about producing a quality album with strong lyrics and vocals. But I guess it doesn't matter, because DC is a Money Making Machine!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Were better in the past..","review":"I gave this album two stars for the simple reason that there were only three songs on this album that I liked and those happen to be the popular songs such as Independent Women Part 1, Survivor, and Bootylicious. The rest of the album were tracks that I just couldn't get myself to love. I would suggest that maybe if you like one of those songs on there, maybe you should look for the single instead. I just don't see spending the money on this CD when there is so much better.Try The Writing's On The Wall, that was a work of Destiny's Child that was so much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I\\"M SO TIRED OF THESE CHICKS!!!!","review":"This CD was awful...a complete waste of time! Beyonce's writing skills are not all that. There is only one good song on this entire CD that was worth the listen and that was Track 12, \\"Dangerously In Love\\". The re-make of \\"Emotion\\" wasn't bad but all that other garbage was awful.....It's too bad, too cause the first two Destiny's Child CD's were really worth a listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for 2 decent songs","review":"I just have one suggestion... Save the amateur songwriting and producing for BEYONCE'S SOLO album! Whose idea was it to allow Beyonce to produce and write nearly every song on the CD? What's wrong with COLLABORATING with other established/successful producers and songwriters? After all, this was supposed to be Destiny's Child's album, a group effort. Instead the songs sound as though they belong on a soloist's debut album. Surely not the type of material you would hope for on a 3rd release. The only 2 decent songs are Emotions and Dangerously in Love. I'll look forward to Kelly and Michelle's solo efforts because I've heard enough of Beyonce on this album alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The writtings on the wall for sure","review":"This cd sucks!! If they had 0 stars that's what I would have given it. All the songs sound just alike. Nice try at a third album but face it when your time is up, your time is up. The songs are goofy and the hooks are not catchy at all I hate that Survivor song and turn the radio and tv when it comes on. I thought just maybe they might have something on the album that I could bump but I was wrong.The first album was a bust the second was cool now they have reverted back to their old ways it figures. Two or Three hit wonders is what you call them I give it about two more years maybe. ... This album is proof that what comes around goes around when you dump the memebers of the group that helped make you. You come up with albums like Survivor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destiny's Child Fooled Me!","review":"I bought this album because I thought that it would be different and better, but the truth is: Destiny's best effort was \\"The Writing's On The Wall.\\" The title track, \\"Survivor\\" had me so hyped up. I thought the rest of the album would be just as good. Boy, was I wrong. I am so disappointed. I waited for this album for months. Don't get me wrong, this CD does have it's strong points in \\"Independent Women\\", \\"Survivor\\", and \\"Bootylicious\\", but the rest of the album is a waste of money and of talent. I hope their next album is better, and worth all that hype! Maybe they should title their next project: \\"Better Than Before!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm dissapointed","review":"In 2000 LaTavia Robernson and Letoya Luckett left Destiny's Child because of managment problems.

They're just awesome!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"they did it again!!-------- just with different people!","review":"when i first heard this cd i thought it was a big disappointment after TWOTW which was spectacular. What u have to understand is that Survivor is one of those cds u have to listen to about 3 times before it starts to sound good. Once i listened to it a few more times i started to like it more. For all those people who say this cd lacks emotion and meaning i find that extremely funny. i bet the same ppl who wrote that are Britney Spears lovers. If u want to hear music with no emotion just pick up a copy of Oops i did it Again!But enough about that... The best songs on this cd is Nasty Girl(even though its kind of hypocritical), Emotion, The Story of Beauty, Brown Eyes, and Sexy Daddy. Fancy is okay but Happy Face is straightup corny. Survivor and Bootylicious are also good. IW is a great girl power sing. Overall this is a good cd. Dont listen to people who badmouth it. check it out 4 yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great comeback!","review":"I was totally blown away by 'Survivor'. The CD is great - the songs have great heart with great lyrics that make these songs just wonderful. When I heard the 'Independent Women Part I', my immediate response was \\"Oh no, they are the girl enforcement people\\". But now I have come to realize that the whole CD isn't about the first song! Survivor, although played out, stlil stands as one of their best songs! 'Bootylicious' is a great dance track, as is 'Sexy Daddy'. But they still have their spiritual side as is evidenced in the Gospel Medley - which includes the well-known Kirk Franklin hit 'Now Behold the Lamb'.All in all, this is a great CD. Somewhat lacking, but great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better","review":"I really like DC's music and their last album was off the hook! but i'm quite dissapointed with this one. I might have gone off them becuse of the reasons i heard for the line up change but their music was still good. This album probably has about 3 songs that I like. When they started out they where r n b and now they've gone completely pop! I think that maybe they have been a bit over exposed at the moment and they need to take some time aout while they are doing their solo stuff. I Really like brown eyes, survivor, emotions and indipendent women but i'm afraid that's it really. With the last allbum you could listen all the way through and love everything but i think they have taken a bit of a turn for the worst. I do hope that with their solo stuff they are really successful especialy Kelly and Michelle becuse I think it's about time they had the spotlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bootylicious, Independent, Women of Destiny's Child","review":"I love this album! This is my number #2 or #1 favorite album. This album is set just right. You have the fast songs at the begenning to pump you up and the slow songs at the end to cool you down. This album is perfect for cuddling up with you hunny. You could set you cd player to play songs 10 to 14 and have it slow all along. If you want an upbeat party set the cd player to play songs number 1 to 9. Well some people I know don't like Destiny's Child and some people I know don't like Beyonce' but these girls are my favorite Beyonce' and all! Besides Beyonce' is cute!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected from Destiny's Child","review":"When I first got this CD, I was anxious to listen to it since I was a big fan of Destiny's Child's last album, The Writings On the Wall. Well, it was a disaster!All of the songs are mostly with the same dull standard r'n'b beat and aren't original like, \\"Bills Bills Bills\\" or \\"Say My Name\\" were. Not to mention that Beyonce took over the record, barely giving Kelly and Michelle a chance to peak through.Their remake of \\"Emotions\\" was probably the best track on this Cd, along with the \\"Gospel Medley\\".With Destiny's new line-up, I expected this Cd to be even better than their last and to be a creative exploration.I guess I was wrong, because this Cd is mostly just a collection of tasteless songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ok...","review":"This cd was not one of my favorites. first of all, all of the songs sounded too much like the last. Also, all of the songs were really choppy and didn't have a rythem. i just think that with the great voices those girls have, they could come up with a much better cd. i wouldn't recomend that u buy this cd cus u will be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cd Is Terrible!!!!","review":"I bought this cd trying to give DC another chance since they booted out my favorite two girls Letoya and Latavia out of the group. What was I thinking? Someone, please yell at me for wasting my money on this weak cd. How could they make that song Survivor thinking that us fans will not think that they are dissing ex members? They are so wrong, and I should have let these girls go when they kicked out the other two. The only songs that I like on this album are: Independent Woman, not the circus version and Emotion. This cd is straight trash, and to me it does not fit in any category of music that will go down in history. I am tired of their style of music. I love R&B groups who keep it real, like the group 112. Their music is worth listening to. And unlike Beyonce', when 112 produces music it is good quality, not trash like this. I hope that Beyonce's Child learns that friendship is something that should be valued, not thrown away over money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible 3rd CD for Destiny's Child","review":"I liked their other 2 CDS, but this one is so horrible that I resold it to a used music store after the first time I listened to it.

The song lyrics are catchy; all of the Destiny's Child members have a beautiful voice. I listin to it often even after 2.5 years it's still great! I cheers me up when i'm having a bad day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Survivor- NOT!","review":"They gave Beyonce too much creative freedom, on this one. This album lacks the same powerhouse tracks the second album had. It's corny, I also found in the songs like \\"Suvivor\\" and \\"Fancy\\" that they are being really petty by taking [...] shots at their former members. I eventually gave it to my daughter who hardly even listens to it.I know you guys are young, but GROW UP already!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"thank goodness...","review":"...i cancelled my pre-order on this Survivor is the worst song I've heard in my life. incoherent babble I give it 2 stars because of Beyonces big rump the other two backup dancers are hurtin' and can't sing a lick I'll look for this in the dollar bin soon other than that it is \\"Destiny Childish\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"They've gone pop... and gone BUST","review":"Destiny's Child was never really a credible, promising musical act. They aren't really talented and bring nothing new to the table. Such opinion is even more set in stone on their much-anticipated third CD, \\"Survivor.\\" It's funny how they call themselves survivors and still have the need to diss on the former DC members who got booted out, LaTavia and LeToya. Why not move on? The \\"music\\" on here is very disappointing... no songs are downright, blatantly horrible, but sit down and listen to the CD and you won't find a single gem. The aptly-titled \\"Emotion\\" is a mediocre, will-do ballad at best... nothing spectacular, but sweeping and kinda catchy. As far as pop-dance with a little R&B thrown in, you get plenty. The lead single \\"Survivor\\" has a bouncy, addictive chorus. That's it. No songs will stick in your head the way a pop album should. If you want this kind of stuff only different and BETTER, go with Pink or TLC. Destiny's Child has no destiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it stop!","review":"Their performance during the 2001 NBA Finals made it clear that this act makes up for a lack of talent and creativity with skin and hype.

I hope that they come out and blow every body away. its called karma baby!!!basically yall are sorry and someone needs to let you know. this album soundewd like you wrote it while you were on the toliet. it needs ome serious intervention. yall aint even tru to the hood anymore. i bought your 1st and 2nd album, and now the 3rd which will unfortunately be the last. get a job your good at!!!! peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was sad that I didn't like this, but now I'm glad","review":"I thought I liked R&B, but I don't. It was a bit of a disappointment for me when I discovered the real truth about myself, but in some ways I'm glad I stopped listening to this music because my mother was not really in favor of me listening to this. Weird though this may sound, my mother seems to want me to like her music (classical music and popular music from the 1950s and '60s). And if I don't listen to her music, she's gonna be mad. So my decision not to listen to this music was better for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a survior........","review":"I hate this CD!! Noooooooooooot!! I love it!! It was the 2nd DC CD I got!!

They can all sing, occasionally even well, but the songs are recycled riffs with throwaway lyrics that you'll forget within two seconds of hearing them. The Bee Gees, though, will be delighted that DC's cover of \\"Emotion\\" will net them a few more millions (it's supposedly going to be the third single). However, why Beyonce Knowles' father/manager persists in furthering the falsehood that DC is a democracy is bewildering at best and laughable at worst. Just let her go solo already--it can't be any worse than this pseudo R&B stuff she does now ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE Lyrics! A Waste of Money!","review":"I'm so upset that I wasted money on this. This CD is terrible. I gave it two stars because I like Dangerously In Love and Bootylicious.

I wish that I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DIANA (OOPS) I MEAN BEYONCE.","review":"I am not to fond of the new and un-improved DC-3, but I do appreciate good music. The Writings on the Wall was filled with nice ballads and nice dance tracks, but this new \\"Survivor\\" album lacks both. Basically these girls made an album, so every song could end up on TRL, I am wondering did Diana (oops) I mean Beyonce, put any thought into the songs she produced. OHH I forgot she produced EVERY LAST SONG. Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with having a video on TRL, but can there be one non-bubblegum pop song on the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destiny's Doom","review":"Beyonce should take up fingerpainting so that she will not be able to pick up a pen and write anymore songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girls! It's time for a change!","review":"This cd Is terrible for so many reasons that I can't name them all here, so I will stick to my main beef, these girls are overhyped pretty faces trying to sing.Somehow after hearing that ...survivor I bought the cd anyway hoping that they were moving in a different direction, but boy was I wrong.How many times can you rehash bills,bills and give it a different name.They have found a sucessful formula,and I am not angry at them for that, but I think they can put their potential(yes they can be great if they grow.)to better use.So next time concentrate on singing and not looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD from a fantastic group!","review":"SURVIVOR is definitely a cool album. The best songs on this CD are \\"Independent Women Pt. 1\\", \\"Survivor\\", \\"Bootylicious\\", and \\"Independent Women Pt. 2\\". \\"Independent Women Pt. 1\\" and \\"Survivor\\" have been definitely over played on the radio, so that kind of killed the songs. But \\"Bootylicious\\" and \\"Independent Women Pt. 2\\" (as well as the rest of the songs on this CD) are completely fresh and totally rock! Destiny's Child has got some awesome vocal talent and the lyrics are - for the most part - strong and solid. Destiny's Child is definitely one of my favorite female groups. And if SURVIVOR is so bad, how come it's #1 on the Billboard charts right now?! So screw the bad rumors and buy this CD 'cause I know you won't regret it! Destiny's Child proved once again that they're survivors!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Destiny's Child's best effort","review":"I am glad that I traded old CDs for this one at the music store. I would be upset if I had actually paid for it. Most of the songs are just a stream of consciousness babbling by Beyonce. I think that Destiny's Child didn't take enough time to really craft this album into what it could be. They just threw this CD out onto the market in order to capitalize on their popularity from the last album. I am disappointed. And the idea of making little comments in between songs was taken directly from TLC's last album. These young ladies are talented enough that they could have done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"WOW! This is an incredible cd! I could write for ages about all the songs, but I'm not. Anyway, my favorite songs are \\"Independent Women Part I\\", \\"Survivor\\", \\"Bootylicious\\", \\"Fancy\\", \\"Emotion\\", \\"Brown Eyes\\" and \\"The Story of Beauty\\". The vocals are incredible by all 3 girls, and all of them sing lead in at least 5 songs. Also, there was one thing that the old album \\"The Writing's On The Wall\\" didn't have. And that was... good ballads. This album has beautiful R&B ballads even with some gospel mixed into them. You should get this CD now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful","review":"The rumor on the street here in Motown is that Boyence bedded Dave Matthews after a long night of Crystal. \\"Sex Daddy\\" is a playful wink to Dave. The album shows Destiny's branching out. \\"Gospel Medley\\" has a strong nod toward to the choir while keeping the street flava. While this album is one to savor, the question will be what Boyence will do next. Her inevitable solo album (with the working title of 'Noodle') is supposedly a jam band tour-de-force. There is no stopping Boyence. Enjoy her here with the girls and in the future on her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I FOR ONE AM VERY DISAPPOINTED AT THIS GARBAGE THEY JUST THREW OUT.

BUT IT DIDN'T CATCH MY ATTENTION LIKE WHEN I FIRST LISTEND TO THE WRITINGS ON THE WALL. AND BEYONCE JUST TAKES OVER THE WHOLE CD ARE THE OTHER GILRS JUST BACKGROUND SINGERS? MAYBE THEY NEED THE OTHER GIRLS BACK. THE ORIGINAL DC OR MAYBE THEY SHOULD LET SOME ONE ELSE PRODUCE IT OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW IM JUST NOT FEELING THIS ONE.

Both are FANTASTIC!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing's on the Wall is much better.","review":"This is the worst Destiny's Child album of all of them. It takes on more of a pop direction instead of R&B.; Don't get me wrong, I enjoy pop, but not this. The only songs on the album I liked are Independent Women (Part I), Emotions (Although Beyonce oversings on this one WAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much), and the Gospel Medley. Also, the richness and sharpness of the harmonies that were very noticable with the original Destiny's Child lineup, are missing. I must say though, Kelly sounds great on this album.This album just doesn't do it for me. If you want to hear Destiny's Child at their best, go pick up The Writing's on the Wall. Destiny Fulfilled is also much better than Survivor."},{"rating":"1","title":"*sigh* not even napster worthy....","review":"i thought i'd bought the new destiny's child album. yet when i listened to the cd, i realized it was \\"the writing's on the wall\\" all over again. the songs on DC's second album all sounded the same, but i was willing to overlook that because the tracks sounded good (at the time) and had some nice bass lines and beats. this time around however, the sound is STILL repetitive, and the \\"girl anthems\\" are beaten to death. beyonce', meanwhile, seems to have come down with a case of \\"dianaross\\" syndrome, oversinging throughout much of the album and drowning out her two fellow members. it makes me wonder if kelly and michelle were actually ever in the studio, because i sure as hell can't hear a word they're singing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Darn Good Effort","review":"I got this CD from a radio station call in contest and never really touched it since it came out.

Survivor is better than The Writings On The Wall, it has more meaningful lyrics and has a better overall flow. All of the songs are great, written by the talented and beautiful Beyonce\` Knowles. Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland are definitely NOT background singers in this one-they both have a lot of solos and Kelly does a lot of the 'foreground' vocals. My favorite songs from the album are Apple Pie a'la Mode, Fancy, and Nasty Girl. These are songs with meanings and hot beats. I don't know where Beyonce\` finds the time to pen these songs, but they are just so awesome!

I couldn't believe that I had wasted my 10 dollars at Best Buy on that mess. I give it two stars because there are a couple of standout tracks, but Beyonce's sense of beat is muddled, her writing style is juvenile, and the CD lacks creativity. However, if you're a Beyonce \\"groupie,\\" you'll love it because she dominates every single song. Don't believe the hype about everyone singing lead. A verse here and a verse there does not equate singing lead in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible..........","review":"I just bought the Live In Atlanta DVD and both me and my friend agreed that this was the worse album they have put out.

I don't know what else to say other than this album just has singles on it. They are not consistent at all, and the album is just to damn choppy for me.So, in other word it's horrible.

Yes, I realize that they are singing a little lead on some of the songs. However, \\"little\\" is the keyword because I can barely hear them.

My only suggestion for the fourth album would be to let each lady sing lead on at least one song in its entirety. It worked well for EnVogue.

The only songs worth listening to are \\"Bootiliscious\\", \\"Emotions\\", and maybe \\"Dangerously in Love\\". Most of the songs consisted of Beyonce's, usually beautiful voice, whining and screeching through the choruses. Plus, some of the tracks sounded so computerized or artificially manufactured.

This album is real tight but I took away a star because they have this song on there album called Nasty Girl, and it says put some clothes on. Its a nice song, but if Destiny's Child is going to sing it (expecially Beyonce) then they have to act it. For example for the main pic of there album, Beyonce's chest is pratically hanging out of her shirt! Have you seen the pics on rollingstones.com? One look at them and its the exactly oppisite of what the song is saying NOT to do. Why am I concerned? I am 13 years old and Destiny's Child is my role model.

Their latest album relies too much on the success and attitude of their previous. Even the hit title track is weak in melody and chorus, although it is catchy. The track \\"Happy Face\\" stands out on the album as something more interesting than the rest. Otherwise, the songs on this album lack focus, motivation, and emotion.

When they had the old members (Latavia and Letoya) their cd was great, but I guess with the member change dc lost their ability to write quality songs. Destinys child should stop trying to live up to the \\"diva\\" role and be true to themselves. I guess that is what happens when the member who wrote a lot of the songs gets kicked out.

I was shocked when I heard that beyonce wrote all this hot songs. She is talented give the girl her credit. And I finally got to hear my girl Michelle sing. She has a beautiful voice. Girls all I can say is keep it up and stay independent,survivoring and bootylicious. And to the Person who said Alicia Keys album is better, I have her cd and I don't think so. D.C 3 forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't sell out","review":"Sad to see such a talented R&B group sell out to pop music. If any of you frineds say they like R&B and mention that Destiny's Child is their favorite group, chuckle quietly to yourself. After listening to this CD for about an hour, all of the songs began to sound alike. Rin-tinny pop with souful voices trying to outsing each other. I bought it for Independent Women I. Good song. Just skip Ind. Women Part II. It sounds like a song for a kid commercial. So does Happy Face. Poor Beyonce, as gorgeous as she is, she just can't write music. Kelly is actually the strongest singer, but even she can't bring strength to this CD. Save your money and buy Writing's on the Wall. I give that CD four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This CD is very awesome. I got it the day it came out and it was worth every penny. Even if you don't like DC taht much, this CD is worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DC album yet!","review":"This album is really phenomenal. I agree that it doesn't have the hook-laden songs of the last album, but that's what makes it so good. Beyonce has really come into her own -- the songs are thoughtful, creative and compelling. It really blew me away. Best tracks: Survivor, Nasty Girl, Dangerously in Love"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Album","review":"I have to admit I've always liked Destiny's Child. I thought Survivor was going to be a highly anticipated and really good album. Yet, when I listened to it, I noticed there were so many bad and obnoxious songs such as \\"Apple Pie a la Mode\\", \\"Happy Face\\", and \\"Bootylicious.\\" However, I do give it two stars because it does contain some good songs such as \\"Story of Beauty\\", \\"Emotion\\", \\"Dangerously in Love\\", and of course the title track. I'm glad that there is a little more singing by the other members, and I hope that a new album will come which will be better than all their previous albums. Good luck Destiny's Child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good album, and Beyonce is still conceited","review":"I'm not a big fan of Destiny's Child, especially since the other two girls left the group. I'm not fond of Beyonce either I just like her name. Beyonce is too conceited for me. She reminds me so much of Diana Ross, you would think that she's related somehow. She takes over all of the songs, you hardly ever hear Kelly or Michele and I think they have beautiful voices whenever Beyonce will let them sing. I don't own the new album but I did hear sample songs from it, and I don't like them at all, except for \\"Survivor\\" and \\"Bootilicious\\". Until Beyonce comes down from her high horse, and let the other girls sing a few songs or more I'll continue not to like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't you have a option for less than 1 star.","review":"This CD is real live tired!

Beyonce Knowles has stepped out in front and she has hand in writing and producing all the tracks on the album. Ms. Knowles has an exceptional voice and she shows off her range from the high energy title track to the more subdued remake of Samantha Sang's \\"Emotion\\". The mega hit from Charlie's Angels, \\"Independent Women\\" shows up in two parts and is a bumping groove despite suffering from being overplayed. \\"Bootylicious\\" samples Stevie Nicks' \\"Edge Of Seventeen\\" to great results by creating a hyper kinetic beat. \\"Nasty Girl\\", \\"Fancy\\" and \\"Apple Pie Ala Mode\\" are also strong songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank Ya Can Handle This Jelly?","review":"Destiny's Child third CD Survivor I Have to say is one of the best cd's i have bought this year.. The Girls really know how to put togeather some tight songs Thanks mostly to Beyonce's writing. This cd has a little bit of everything for everyone theres Emotion and Brown Eyes that stand out has there real heart catching songs..Bottylicious and Apple pie a la mode to catch your feet..But to me the stand out songs are.... INDEPENDENT WOMEN part 2..tight jam that makes the song sound soo soo soo new:) and THE STORY OF BEAUTY one of if not the best song on the cd.. so yeah go out grab it you wont be sorry you did ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 Stars... What a Mess","review":"Right away, I will say that this album is a hot mess. This album has nothing but fillers and if it wasn't for the turmoil from the original lineup this horrible album wouldn've ever surfaced.

Most people brought this CD because they saw that \\"THE WRITINGS ON THE WALL\\" was a great CD. We all made a mistake and shouldn't have brought it.The only songs I like in the order I like them are \\"Dangerously in Love\\", \\"Nasty\\", \\"Independent Women Part II\\", and \\"Bootylicious\\" Beyon'ce needs to cut out all of the lead vocals and let Michelle's angelic-gospel like voice do all of the work she is doing. Not hating just tired of Beyon'ce and I know that they could do better. The group should be called \\"Beyon'ce and Nem\\" or \\"Beyon'ce and Company\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is pretty terrible...","review":"This cd is a flaccid mess. You've already heard the only two decent songs (\\"Survivor\\" and \\"Independent Women Part I\\"), so there's no need to buy this. It's mostly just embarassing, cliche-riddled, off-tempo tripe, especially \\"Nasty Girl,\\" \\"Bootylicious,\\" \\"Apple Pie ala Mode,\\" and \\"Brown Eyes.\\" It appears as if all that earlier \\"writing on the wall\\" was done in vain; too bad when Destiny's Child cleaned house last year, they kicked out all the talented members."},{"rating":"2","title":"These girls can survive...","review":"Three cheers for Destiny's Child! They really did it this time. The new album is cooler than \\" The Writtings on the wall\\". The songs have the samepartybeats of \\" Jumpin Jumpin\\" and they have really matured vocally. All the songs are written by the great Beyonc��. My favorite songs on the album are: Survivor, Nasty Girl, Bootylicious, and Brown eyes. The lyrics have more meaning, and emotion in this album. I recomend ALL DC-3 fans to buy it, because it really is the best. Keep it up Girls!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Survivor","review":"Destiny's Child third album is out, titled Survivor, a very autobiographical title for their disc, after all of the drama in the group from last year. Beyonce Knowles writes most of the tracks on here, and its a strong effort. Independant Woman makes an appearance on the album, both Part I and Part II. The vocal quality has once again improved, with Beyonce and Kelly and Michelle, who also sing lead on certain songs. The big surprise though is the tender ballads near the end of the disc, Emotion and the sure to be a single Brown Eyes. As well there is a nice Gospel Medley which showcases their beautiful voices in harmony (like many tracks do). There are some nice upbeat songs, but there's no real Say My Name or Bills Bills Bills type songs here, but theres some nice ones which are even better. Its nice to see Beyonce sharing the spotlight with Kelly and Michelle, hopefully there will be less drama this time around. Overall Survivor stands as a strong album most way through the listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD IS TERRIBLE!!!","review":"THIS CD SUCKS! IT'S ALL BEYONCE, BEYONCE, BEYONCE!

It diffenitly works for their image. This album is another hit to add to their list. I enjoyed the harmonies, and was very happy to hear Beyonce step out of the spotlight and let Kelly and Michelle take some of the lead vocals. The styles of the songs vary, which is great to listen to. On the down side, most of the songs were written or co-written by Beyonce, and her \\"girl power\\" lyrics range from questionable to cheezy. While I enjoy most of the songs, some I choose to skip.. such as Bootylicious, which lyrics are extremely cheezy. I love the dance beats of the songs, and the ballads are lovely. I love \\"Emotion.\\" I recommend this album to Destiny's Child fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Someone To Write Your Songs!","review":"Destiny's Child new CD is just that, new and in need of some direction. The girls can sing but unless you are from 6yrs.to 15yrs. old you will not like this cd at all. Advice: Save your money and go out and purchase Alicia Keys. Destiny's Child is on their way out so don't bother wasting your money.They only sold as many cd's as they did because there wasn't really any competition out there. Most of the Female groups had broken up. They were just the only thing available at the time. Do you think they would have gotten all of the hype if Xscape or TLC, would have been on the scene. The answer is NO!Well, think about it! They are to immature to really be a permanent part of the music scene. Please don't take them serious because they are just part of the Nickalodeon Crowd.

Our local music scene is MUCH better than this! If it weren't for makeup, hairstylists, hoochie-mama 'fasions' (designed by Beyonce's mother! no less) and saturation on MTV, these talentless little ghetto girls would be laboring in obscurity, where they should be. All I can say is it's a short ride, save some money. P.S., get hooked on phonics because watching you girls in interviews is painful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More corporate driven garbage","review":"This album really shows how shallow and greedy the DC girls have become. What's even the point of buying the album, the \\"Survivor\\" video is shown about 20 times a day on MTV non-stop? And then we have to put up with all the annoying specials about the group, highlighting them and giving them undeserved praise. The other tracks on here are just as annoying, especially the cheesy ballads like \\"Brown Eyes\\". Do yourself a favor and save your 15 bucks. Why keep adding to this money machine?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this CD! 2 Days later...BOORING!","review":"The first day I got this CD I was totally syched to listen to it. After listening to it for 2 days it got really old. You only listen to the first 5 songs then the rest, well, who cares. 'Survivor' gets old after listening to it for a minute and 'Independent Women' was played way too much on the radio. 'Bootilicious' is all about jelly...?, do you get the point yet? It all becomes really boring. I only gave this CD 2 stars because it got dull. If I could, I would take it back to get my money to go buy the new 'Incubus' CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Album","review":"I just feel sorry for the people who have purchased this God-awful album. It produces not one spectrum of originality. Every song plainly does not come with a point. But I can clearly see this album being bought by a 12 year-old. Because clearly the lyrics are simple. Beat ofcourse is commercial. There whole material is commercial. Most of this material does not apply to most of us anyway. And I this may sound harsh but I think this album deserves every bit of criticism it receives. If you want to hear some good quality rnb music check out Erykah Badu,Jill Scott,India.Arie or even Alicia Keys.Apoc (DC gets no love from me)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Destiny's Child have really improved themselves over the year after their debut album that didn't really succeed came their 2nd album \\"writing's on the wall\\" who's a smashing sucess and now came their 3rd album who's also great in \\"survivor you can find many upbeat songs one of my faves there are:bootylicious,nasty girl and happy face and there are also slow songds there my faves are\\"dangerously in love who's an excellent ballad beyonce really did a great job on writing this amazing ballad.My cd contains another 2 songs who aren't on the us version:Dance with me and my heart beats This cd is really reccomnded GO DESTINY'S CHILD"},{"rating":"2","title":"They will Survive ...","review":"To me, Writing's on the wall was one of the best album I ever had, but when Survivor came in, the strength they have shown can be seen tremendously. Not only trying to maintain their standard, they have also tried to change the style of their songs compared to the 1st and 2nd albums. Although applause should be given to the lead singer, Beyonce', the other two members, Kelly & Michelle should also be given the credits. Because, without them, DC won't be around. My favourite track in this album includes Independent Women Pt1, Survivor, & Bootylicious. It is a surprise to hear the cover of Bee Gees, Emotion. Believe me they are good!! However, it lacks something in this album which I couldn't identify but for sure their MTV is a must see for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Help","review":"I admire Beyonc��'s attempt to be truly \\"Independent\\" in writing or co-producing all of the songs on this album, but I think she needed a little help. With the exception of \\"Independent Women, Part I\\" and \\"Survivor,\\" the majority of the songs on this CD sound rushed and amateurish. Perhaps with a little bit (or a lot) of help, the rest of the songs on this CD could have been polished (or trashed).Don't waste your money on the CD. Instead, turn to MTV or BET anytime during the day, and you're likely to see videos for the only two decent songs on the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"This is a GREAT cd. Even though it is not the same as \\"Writings on the Wall,\\" it is what we have come to love about this group. There harmonies are tight, and the songs are great. The only reason why I gave them 4 stars was the first half of the cd. This portion isn't that great, but starting at \\"sexy daddy\\" and on is fabulous. I Love this group. I just bought it yesterday and have listened to it 20 times. This is a must for your R&B music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Survivor","review":"Independent Woman and Survivor are the only two good songs on the whole CD.

The book does go thru the various aspects of what the author calls SYNC, in ways which laypeople can understand. On the other hand, it seems to me that this is simply \\"normal modes\\" of oscillation, which puzzles people in areas from quantum mechanics to coupled oscillators -- pendulums, etc...So, I think it is a little of reinventing the wheel to call this an emerging science.. It seems to me that \\"catastrophe theory\\" of a few years ago, and a number of other similar items, are really reinventing the wheel.On the other hand, I have nothing against the book, if it simply were to place the current science in this context..(of normal modes), rather than a new SYNC..

I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puppy tolerates; I love it!","review":"My adorable puppy (pictured above) tolerates her play pen pretty well. I put a tarp underneath it to protect the carpet, and then put towels, a bed, her water, and toys in it with her when I can't watch everything she does. This is great when I'm eating dinner in the same room because I don't have to fully crate her, but I can eat in peace. I sometimes can also get her playing on her own very contently while I'm doing laundry or another task where I don't want her distracting me. When I can watch her, I leave the door open so she has a play area that she can enter and exit out of. I have a small apartment, and the 4 panel option fits well in the living room without taking the entire thing.I wish that the adjustment knobs were a bit easier to use. It took a neighbor to help me get them loose enough so that I could configure it to my liking. It's well made, and even if she gnaws at it a bit, I know it will stay standing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Play Yard","review":"I originally purchased this with extentions as a play area for my baby girl that is on her way. I have two large dogs and wanted to have a completely safe area on the floor where we can play and not get drooled on or pawed at. We now have it set up inside the dog door so that the dogs can come in the AC and go out with no problem and it blocks them off from the rest of the house. I love this Play Yard... It's been a complete life saver and the baby isn't even here yet. It comes put together so it's easy to set up and easy to add the extensions. It also folds together to make it flatter for storage. My dogs love it also... they think it's there own little room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful item","review":"I find this item to be very useful. We set it up in the front yard and it kept our 20 month old contained while my husband and I raked and cleaned up the leaves.

The locking gate on this item is a nice feature as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What We Need","review":"The item works perfectly for what we need it for.

My daughter is 14 months and isn't always fond with going into the play yard but it really helps when I need to fix dinner or something and can't follow her around the house to pull things out of her mouth and get her out of things. She can push it around a little but doesn't get too far on the carpet or on the concrete driveway or grass.With plenty of toys and a some snacks she is most of the time content in with playing in the play yard while mommy gets a few things done.So all in all we are very happy with this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was expecting a great product from the reviews I saw. I bought the gate because it is taller than the other play yards out there my son is 1 and just learning to walk he is also very tall for his age. He moves the play yard around like a walker I've tried to wedge it between furniture so he can't move the whole gate. But he manages to get the gate free or he dumps the gate over the gate should be more sturdy being it is made for Tots!! I'm now looking for a new Play yard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well constructed!","review":"I love the cage, but I have a small problem.

There is enough room in it for my dog to be in with his toys and play without being harassed by a toddler. It can also be manipulated to go around items (like a Christmas tree or T.V. entertainment center) that I also would like to keep away from my daughter. So far, SHE doesn't like being in it, but it is VERY effective at keeping her OUT of places I need her to stay out of. It's gate is SO easy to use--just use one hand to push a button on each side and lift the handle. Easy for an adult with finger dexterity, not so much for a toddler. I don't think it would work well for children older than 1 1/2 years old or bigger dogs, as they may be able to overpower it. However, if you have a child that you need to have play by themselves while you do chores, THIS IS THE GATE TO GET!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crisis Averted!","review":"Had I written the review for this play yard before today, I would have given it 3 stars and said it's a bit disappointing and aggravating, as our 13-month-old is able to shove it around the wood floor dragging his toys behind him. But, as of this afternoon -- when I was on the verge of a panicked visit to the ER after discovering one of the plastic hinges on the floor but NOT initially locating the screw that attaches it -- I give it one star and ask you to BEWARE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gate, but wont keep in a climber!","review":"We bouth this last year to put around the Christmas tree so that our daughter wouldn't be pulling ornaments off the tree and breaking them. It worked great! Afterwards, it worked great until she was about two. At that point she would climb it and get out. Also, she eventually learned how to push the whole thing over (which terrified me) and we ended up having to ancor it to the wall. She's two and a half now and we still put her in it sometimes, if she's really tired and we don't think she will try climbing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got two sets","review":"Purchased two sets for my toddler.

I work from home as well as take care of my 10 month old daughter. Before I bought this I had pillows,etc blocking doors and areas I didn't want her to go. Now I just set up the play yard and know that she is safe when out of my site. Highly recommend for all parents that don't have alot of empty space for your child to safely play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play yard works","review":"I got this play yard as an alternative to some very expensive gates to my very wide doorways. I also got the extension to make it bigger. It seems to work well, but the baby wants to be out of it anyway. This is not the product's fault however. It is big enough for an adult to be in with the baby and that works best for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Pen","review":"I ordered this item on Amazon for my little Maltese. We had already purchased the Superyard XT, but we wanted something similar but with a gate so our Maltese can go in and out freely when he pleases especially for bathroom purposes. We ordered the Summer Infant Secure Surround Safe Play with extension thinking it would be just like the Superyard XT (also with extension) but with a gate.The Summer Infant Secure Surround wasn't as sturdy as the Superyard XT and the gate was hard to open (we made our pen into a square). Sure enough, that night while our dog was jumping on the flimsy pen wall the two wall panels somehow bent inward and caught my dog's leg. This never happened with the Superyard XT. I was really upset that that had happened so I definitely don't recommend this product for an infant or a dog.I'm so glad that Amazon made the return process so easy, otherwise I would be even more upset if I couldn't return this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great... with the Two-Piece Extensions!!!","review":"We purchased this for our 15 month-old twins to play in but it was a little small (even with one child and toys it would be small). So we purchased 2 Two-Piece Extension kits and it is awesome. It is durable and sturdy as long as you don't make it into a square or rectangle, I don't know why but it is easy to push over in these shapes. The playyard keeps the children safe in areas that may be too open or not childproof. It is easy to store or take along on outings... just fold and go.I highly recommend this product for people with children on the go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Daughter Loves It!","review":"We purchased 2 of the Summer Infant Secure Surround Play Safe Play Yards so that we could have a large space for our daughter to play in, and flexability. It has been perfect - our daughter loves to go in \\"her space\\" and play, and it gives us some security knowing that she wont dart out into less safe parts of the house in a moment's inattention. We even join her in \\"her space\\" because she likes to play there so much, it is where we play with her!The yard is very flexable in its use - at home, as our daughter is in \\"cruizer\\" mode, we arranged the yard so that her favorite couch is inside the walls, so she can cruise along the couch and get her walking practice! We also take one or two of the yards with us on visits, giving us a quick way to create a safe haven for her in homes that are not necessarily child proofed.Not much more to say other than it works as needed, is sturdy, easy to transport - it was exactly what we needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't need to be made so poorly - not worth the money","review":"To get right to it, it's crap. it's made very poorly, it can easily be flipped over by a child that is able to stand and lean on one side of it, and it is very easy for a child to reshape and move it across the room. On two occasions our 11 month old twins were able to flip it over on it's side and come close to getting very hurt (there were more stunned then anything, and OK).While we don't leave them unattended in the gate very often, it has become clear that even a few minutes is a bad idea. Even if we only put one of them in there we have the same problems.I just can't believe a company would put this out knowing it's so poorly crafted. Personally, I would be ashamed. I do not recommend this product. I know others have had success, but I'm just not happy with it. I can't see it even lasting more then 6 months.Buy at your own risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"This play gate was great until the little screws that hold the top tightening fasteners in started to fall out into the baby's play area!!!!These knobs are to tighten the panels so they do not collapse in, but they do not tighten easily AND when you over rotate the knob the screw back treads out of the hole. we were just lucky to find the screw before our 10 month old twins put it in their mouths."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied customer","review":"i bought this product three weeks ago for my dog and her pupies and so far i am very satisfied with it thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to like it...","review":"This pen WAS great. My little boy who is 17 months old got this around Xmas time last year. We were using it and it was working great. After a while the tighteners started falling off and worse yet, dropping itty bitty screws randomly without warning. As you all know a 1 year old WILL put shiny little things in their mouths. Three times now I have found screws on the floor from the gates. Thankfully, I found them, not my baby boy. It's something I will contact consumer services about since I think these screws are a complete danger/choking hazard to toddlers, and pets for that matter. I purchased 2 of these sets and trying to contact the company is a JOKE. They want the gates back, they want ME to ship them back and then wait for weeks for a possible replacement, if THEY find them to be defective, YEAH OK!! Go with something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for my havanese pup","review":"This worked out perfectly for his house...i keep the door open when i'm home and closed while I'm at work...he's only broke out once in 4 months...as long as the knobs are turned tight the door will stay secure...my puppy is small and he's able to move the gate around a lot if I don't have it grounded between something so I don't think it would be so great for kids..."},{"rating":"1","title":"consider your flooring!","review":"this looked good - sturdy and strong, inside or outside use, gate - but i gave no thought to the smooth wooden floors in our house.

There doesn't seem to be a problem with pinch points, which is very important."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SAFE, NOT SECURE","review":"I bought two, one for me and one for my daughter. My grandson of 16 months wasn't in the playyard 5 minutes when he pushed the whole thing across the room. I saw that it would collapse on him so I took him out. There is no way to secure it to the floor when used inside the house. Perhaps it could be staked in the ground outside to prevent movement. However, we're using it as a fence to block off an area but I wouldn't leave a child unattended. My grandson can move the fence out of the way with no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Good idea but not very useful. Using it outside my son HATED being in here, even with toys. Inside he cried and cried. Get a pack n play, lots more use and not as expensive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I needed a gate to block off my living room from the hallway which has a large opening about 10 feet wide (like all usual apartments in the USA). This gate does not allow to be attached to the walls and can only be setup as a perimeter, just like it shows on the picture. For people who just want to do this and have a small perimeter setup for their kids, it might be just fine for the price that it is. However, in my case this gate does not work. I returned it and got the \\"North States 3-in-1 Metal\\" gates instead which can be attached to the walls as well as be set up as a perimeter. The metal gates are also more sturdy than this Summer Infant Play Yard.As for Amazon.com... I am very glad to do business with them, they were nice over the phone and I was able to return the item without any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hinge, please.","review":"If you are strong, and don't mind using muscle when trying to pry open one of the panels of this thing, the safe play yard does its job. However, like too many safety products that are made without much thought to who will actually be using them (i.e., mothers who are often sleep deprived...bless their souls), this product has a seriuos design flaw: it has no lock/unlock mechanism. What you need is brute strenght to pry the panel up and out, and when the baby is safely in the yard, you need to, again, lift and pry it back into place. Not the most user friendly design I've seen. Summer Infant has another product that does have a door, which we subsequently purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"We love this. We have a busy house with a baby mixed in. This gives the baby a big area to explore and move while still allowing the older children room to use there craft items and small toys. During family time it stretches out to block the baby in just the one room with us keeping him safe from stairs, the kitchen and other harmful things so he is safe and content. I love the cream color as it doesn't show every finger print like the pure white and is just more pleasant to the eye when company comes over. Also great for keeping the dog in one room at the same time as the baby in the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS A GREAT GATE EXCEPT FOR THE HANDLE","review":"THE HANDLE TO OPEN AND CLOSE THE GATE KEEPS GETTING STUCK, I THINK ITS TO HARD TO OPEN WHEN YOUR IN A HURRY TO GET TO YOUR BABY.

Both authors have serious credibility problems and even some of the veterans quoted in the book have praised Kerry's military service as late as 1996.

I really cant believe any vet would say these things about a man who they did not serve with, \\"side by side\\" .

Now, there is no validity or value to any Purple Heart, Bronze Star, or anything else signifying injury while fighting to defend this country.

The fact of the matter is that John F. Kerry cannot be trusted. H elied about his military background. He lied about the US being able to take out Osama bin Laden in Tora Bora. He flip flopped on his position on the war just to push ahead of then front runner Howard Dean during the democrat primaries. He voted for and then against protection for our soldiers and then made that an issue in his debates that the military was underprotected and had relatives ordering armor from the internet.Kerry is the ultimate politician who will do and say anything to reach a goal, regardless of whether it is true or ethical.

John O'Neill, the author, worked for President Nixon. Spaeth, who is in charge of publicizing SBVFT, also handled the vile trashing of McCain's honorable war record in 2000 before the South Carolina primary.Just so you know some background before you read the book.

A true hero. Not to America, but to North Viet Nam, and the Viet Cong. A man who to this day holds a place of honor in Ho Chi Minn City, for his help in defeating America. The male version of Hanoi Jane.

Now defenders of a President and a Vice President who dodged the draft, not for political or moral reasons, but out of opportunism and self-interest, are accusing somebody who served of being a liar and a coward? John Kerry could have done office work in Vietnam, at least he had the courage to show up. But he did more than that. Everyone who was on his boat or near enough to see events transpire says he's telling the truth. Those who weren't there for the days in question, or out of visual range, are contradicting their previous testimony and denouncing Kerry. Gee, who to believe?

Mr Oneil, on the request of President Nixon went after Mr Kerry in the 1970s and to his sangruine was ridiculed by Kerry on the Dick Cavet Show.

Ask yourself why do so many veterans and people who served side by side say Kerry is a liar and a fraud? Why do so many question his superficial wounds, none of which required a single day in the hospital?

This book is just a collection of people angered by Kerry's anti-war stance after returning from Vietnam and a few partisan hacks. As long as you believe this tripe, America is in trouble. In my opinion, Kerry has the best record and sticks to the important issues. Bush has resorted to bashing, which should tell you something about his character. He really has nothing to say.

The way I see it, he can't possibly do a worse job than Bush, and he may even do better. Either way, people need to stop complaining about stupid crap and focus on the issues rather than this pathetic bickering about Kerry's service. If the best the Bush supporters can do is whine about Kerry's service record and whether or not he's telling the truth about his purple hearts, then they're all a pretty sad lot.

At least Kerry was present. The bottom line is that Bush can send troops overseas to fight for his own personal gains, but as for he himself serving in the military, he was simply too ignorant, scared, or both.

However, it turns out that all of his accolades were awarded in a blundering display of incompetence, the likes of which would not be seen again until Bush's proclamation of \\"Mission Accomplished.\\" Indeed, the Swift Boat Veteran's novel paints a scathing indictment of the US military, and how their errors could inadvertently bolster the political career of a man from Massachusetts who chose to serve his country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break...he was under 25","review":"These are bunch of exaggerated and false accusations against John Kerry.

However if you are, I don't know, literate, than you might want to steer clear of this shameless attempt to discredit a war hero. As a Republican who believes that \\"W\\" as the IQ of a baked potato, I'm not exactly a huge fan of John Kerry, and I know there are plenty of issues on which to debate him. However, it sickens me to see the filth that this author tries to dig up all in the name of politics. A quick look at his bibliography confirms the obvious: His sources are biased enough to make Michael Moore look like Jim Lehrer and completely undermines his point.

I served my country proud, and I believe John Kerry did also. I just can't imagine how I would handle this type of character assination if I was a public figure.

It's a damn shame. I voted for Bush in the last election, I will not make that mistake again.

Bush is \\"an empty suit\\" unfit for the Presidency. The evidence would seem to suggest he does not like anybody--which might explain his unfortunate choice of a co-author.In all, this book is a waste of your money.

He scraped some fellow rightwing veterans together who never knew Kerry to spread the lies about him we see here in this book and on their $200,000+ TV commercials.

I suppose those veterans for liars will next claim that Cleland doesn't deserve his purple hearts because he only lost three limbs while serving his country.

The same can be said for the other vets in this book, most of whom weren't even in the service at the same time as Kerry, just simply didn't like his postwar activities. Odd that this book has even become a big deal considering that Bush never even served in Viet Nam himself.For an unbiased, frank look at Kerry's service, read \\"Tour of Duty,\\" or, better yet see \\"Going Upriver: the Long War of John Kerry,\\" a documentary based on Kerry's Swift Boat service and his anti-Viet Nam activities afterwards.

It would be a trajedy if he was ever elected to a higher office than a US Senator. The book does an excellent job to illustrate this about Senator Kerry. Finally, he will meet a man who knows what a philly cheesesteak is and how to eat it, President Geroge W.

You are a Bozo! Stick to selling books and not politics.

So try to cancel that out by smearing his opponents' character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's written on","review":"This book is a complete fabrication. Buyer beware! The only reason why this book was written has to do with the vendetta that some vets have against Kerry. Some feel that he 'sold them out' when he testified against the Vietnam War upon his return. In truth, they could not stand to see themselves be called baby killers. Worse, they are ungateful since they cannot thank him for an early end to that war. Instead, the writer of this book created a myth in order to retaliate against Kerry's testimony of the early 1970's. The real truth is that at the same time that Kerry was practicing his constitutional right to free speech, Bush was shoving white junk up his nose with the silver spoon that hangs from his neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get out the tinfoil","review":"This book has been a topic of debate from its inception, but nearly a decade has passed and history has revealed the sad truth.

I will never buy another thing from this site again! Maybe Bill O'Reilly can take up the cause of how Amazon is letting their own political leanings interfere with good business decisions.

What's more, they're hypocrites who have the gall to support a president who evaded the draft and then couldn't even fulfill his National Guard duties. Even worse, this same president has the blood of nearly 1,000 (and counting) American servicemen and women on his hands. John McCain was absolutely right in calling on Bush to denounce this book.

The overwhelming majority of those that actually served with Kerry support him unquestionably. Even prominent republicans such as John McCain have spoken out against this book as \\"despicable.\\" Read it, but make sure you understand that this book is a well-orchistrated negative campaign tool by Bush's biggest supporters.

If one had researched a bit, one would have reached his/her own conclusion. The question remains, why people from W. side are so negative? it seemed that the only thing they had been focusing upon was to defame John Kerry. Does any one have seen any concrete ideas they proposed about current domestic issues and international problems? In contrast, we see a very positive picture from Kerry/Edwards and their detailed, constructive plans for both our domestic issues and international problems. It is clear in conclusion, when people are losing, they resort to whatever it takes to try to keep themselves from losing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth?","review":"There is one simple problem with the book. In order for their story to be correct, the Department of Defense, the Navy and their own reports from Vietnam would have to be lies. There is a definite conflict between their stories of today with no supporting documents and their stories of 1970's which are supported by the Department of Defense.The major question is whether they were lying in the 1970's when they submitted their reports, or were they lying in the 1990's when a few of them came out and praised John Kerry or are they lying now.Since all the government documents support Kerry and the Swift Boat Veterans 1970's reports, it can be reasoned that Kerry and the 1970 Swift Boat Veterans were telling the truth while the 2004 Swift Boats veterans fail to meet even the lowest criteria for accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought and paid for","review":"I haven't read this book, so don't listen to me.

So I expect hokum. I question why none of the people who actually served under Kerry are interviewed. So all of this is more fluff and innuendo in our current Civil War: right vs. left. I'll even admit my \\"one-star\\" rating is unfair and shouldn't be averaged in - but too bad! (8P)My issue here is: who is this Brian Neff who wrote the Amazon review? This is why I'm writing. How could Amazon allow such a long-winded commentary which is so obviously against Kerry. Man, it's longer than Amazon's editorial reviews of The Bible & Sgt.

If you're reading my review, then you probably know all too well about this book. My suggestion is don't waste your time or money here. You would be better served by doing some real research about John Kerry and his positions on current issues - and not trying to use some recycled 30 year old nonsensical opinions to make an informed decision about the upcoming election.

Thank God for John O'Niel and the Swift Boat Vets for exposing this Bendict Arnold before it was too late.I can't wait untill Unfit For Command comes out in paperback and in closing, John Kerry, when will you sign form 180? What are you trying to hide?

This isn't about George Bush. This about a deeply flawed Presidental candidate who has persistently lied to gain advantage in his political career. If 250 men get together and decide to write a similiar book on George Bush, I'll read it.There is no monentary value for the Swift Boat Vets to make up stories. The proceeds are going to children and families of soldiers. So, based on this well-prepared and well-written book, I have to conclude they are telling the truth.

Why because the President has promoted, encouraged and made possible such a book as this. It is So scary. It breaks my heart. The book has merit as it can show you how well these people can twist things. This book could not have been written by Bush. He couldn't have pulled it off so he got his buddy from the Nixon days and now we have it. Terrifying. It is number one because many such as me have read it.

Anyway, there are alot better \\"reads\\" out there regarding Kerry and Bush than this piece of \\"animosity\\". Also one of the writers (not O'Neill) used to be on the board of one of the most extreme religiousright organizations in America. His extreme beliefs about religion and race would really horrify many who have already read this book. However, that has not been mentioned in mainstream press. Follow the trail.

That these men have the extreme political beliefs reflected in this book is one thing, but to publish them in the hope of inflicting the obvious damage intended to Senator Kerry (and again, in previously articulated allegations, against Senator McCain) causes me to question of what some Bush supporters are capable. It also should alarm all others to the morality of Mr. Bush himself.

One of the men Harlowe, has already been proven to be lying since the navy officially documented him nowhere near John Kerry at the time he claimed he was. Virtually all of the rest of the people in this book are veterans who never served near John Kerry at all and are merely angry about his post-war testimony to the Senate.

Elliott has already stated he shouldn't have signed the affidavit in support of his version of the facts. He's a perjurer by his own admission! Bush's campaign attorney advised these guys. This is Bush's doings, like those vile smears he brought about in a whisper campaign against John McCain in 2000.John Kerry will survive this mudslinging by Bush.

By the way was it just a councidence that the former commander of the Texas Air National Guard was picked by George W to be Commander of the entire US Air National Guard system after he cleaned up George W's Air National Guard file and disposed of any embarassing details such as missed drug tests and \\"no shows\\" for drills??

It is well documented, footnoted, indexed, etc with 2 appendi.Kerry could dispute all of their claims, clear his name and send the Swift Boat Vets off to the dustbin of history by just releasing his full military and medical records, like Bush did to counter the claims of desertion.The fact that the Kerry people prefer to call these heroes liars and frauds, instead of opening the records tells me that the Swift Boat Vets for Truth are hitting close to the bone.It's a great quick read, well researched and well written!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't put money in the hands of these liars","review":"This book is filled with lies and half truths from beginning to end.

Cheney actually had the gall to say he \\"had other priorities\\" other than being a patriot and serving his country. \\"Chicken Hawks\\" is an apt description of the Bush/Cheney team.John Kerry volunteered for ACTIVE duty in country in Vietnam. He was wounded, saved a man's life, saved his boat and all those on it, and was awarded the silver star for valor.

This one definitely belongs in the fiction column though. From the moment it was published, people have been coming forward to refute what it says. One of the admirals who is quoted questioning Kerry has been caught in the fact that he signed the papers for Kerry's commendations and wrote letters extolling him as a fine officer. The Swift Boat veterans who are included did NOT serve with Kerry, so how do they know what happened on his boat? Evidence has been discovered that this group is connected to the Bush campaign, so the book is nothing but propaganda. There's nothing wrong with that as long as the reader knows what he is getting.

Much like Fahrenheit 9/11, there are some facts contained within this book. It is up to the reader to discern fact from diatribe. I watched O'Neill try to debate Kerry on the Dick Cavett show.

Don't listen to their speeches, and don't listen to people named Moore, Limbaugh, or Coultier. Don't believe either candidate when they say what they WILL do, or when they say who the other person really is. Look at what each HAS done, in detail and in historical context.

John O'Neil should have been more open about the fact that the Nixon team appointed him to go after Kerry when Kerry was an anti-war activist. It would have helped with his creidibility.

These assertions that Kerry \\"barely\\" got shot or was only there for 4 months are ridiculous, considering that Bush can't even prove that he showed up to guard duty in Alabama.The neocon establishment, largely comprised of lunatics and cowards who did everything possible to avoid serving in this horrible, pointless war that killed millions of civilians and tens of thousands of young Americans, continues to spread death and destruction under the guise of freedom and liberty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfit for command!","review":"When has Amazon.com started to tell us what is fit for print!!

He seems often, in his numerous tangents, to be merely trying to show-off what he can remember off the top of his head-which is really not much.

And rather than revel in the silliness, Jack Black and Michael Cera seem to be laboring through it.

These are two men that know comedy, yet this movie has very few laughs. It could have been a funny spoof of films like 10,000 BC and Apocalypto but instead it's pretty boring and forgettable.An early scene where Jack Black teaches Cera how to pick up women by hitting them in the head with a club was clver. But sadly that's the one scene I remember being funny. Cavemen picking up women with pick-up lines of today only got small chuckles from me. Many of the other jokes are just tasteless and dumb kind of stuff that you'd expect from the Wayans.The big cast is just wasted. Especially Olivia Wilde (House). Paul Rudd, Bill Hadar and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.

That same clip was on the trailer, which I laughed at, and was the reason I even saw this movie. I assumed the rest of the movie would be just as funny.But it wasn't. First of all, I don't think Jack Black is funny. I think he tries too hard to be silly and goofy and it doesn't do anything for me.Michael Cera's mumbling, awkward adolescent act worked on the show \\"Arrested Development\\", but it wasn't enough to save a bad script.So, besides that one funny scene, the rest of the movie was a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never thought I'd say it, but this made Zohan look good.","review":"Wow, Jack Black does his schtick as the \\"crazy\\" somewhat mentally-challenged doofus and Michael Cera does his as his nerdy sidekick... again.

I have watched other Amazon Video on Demand HD TV shows, so, I know it is capable of HD, but this was not it.As to the movie itself, it was pretty lame. And it wasn't due to the video quality. Normally, when in the mood, I can laugh heartily at a funny Jack Black role, or an Apatow production. This just wasn't that funny.

It tries to appeal to the immature teen audience, but I don't see how any of them could even like it. It failed miserably at the box office.

Most of the movies on my shelf would make most question if I really was a Christian, but I found this movie to be more offensive than anything I've ever watched before. I forgave the first couple of comments, but throughout the whole movie, all I saw was Bible bashing.I had expected a hilarious movie about a couple of cavemen trying to survive in the world. I'm not entirely sure of exactly what I got.The funniest part of the movie was the whole \\"There's a snake on my foot?\\" ordeal.

The movie had some really tired jokes, such as how hunters were 'cooler' than gatherers. Even the jokes regarding the Bible were stale. Looking back, every remotely funny part of the movie was shown in the trailer. My friend even fell asleep during the movie. I even almost fell asleep, something which never happens to me.

But, on a positive note I've now found a cheap sleep tonic.How does \\"Year One\\" qualify for that use:(1.) You never figure out the purpose, direction and storyliine so confusion leads to brain lockup and subsequent sleepytime.(2.) The cheap and overused obscenities, sexual innuendo and who's stupider lines have been seen/heard so many times over the years that overloaded boredom produces an enhanced sleepytime state.(3.) The acting is so mechanically scripted that I was repeating the lines and visualizing the gestures & movements before I heard & saw them leading to repetitive mantra syndrome (a state of unconsciousness with eyes open)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No go: Eurythmics at their worst","review":"This album commits the unpardonable sin of being boring, as not even the best tracks hold up to repeated listening.\\"Sexcrime (1984)\\" and \\"Doubleplusgood\\" are the two best songs, and neither of them has a strong melody line. It makes for difficult listening, especially with a band as fine as Eurythmics.

Here, it just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this for sure ... unless you just have to have it.","review":"I bought this soundtrack in 1984 when the movie adaptation of George Orwell's book came out, simply because it was attached to the movie. I'll try not to use any non-family words here, but this soundtrack sucks. Muldowney's original score is available on CD, and simply imagining it used as intended adds a whole new dimension to the movie. As far as this soundtrack goes, though; skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"So many people did not either understand or know that the Eurythmics had been contracted to write the music that was supposed to be in the film release of Michael Radford's film 1984, but due to contractual problems in the US, the film was released without their music to the film. (It is my understanding that in the world wide release the music from this CD was on the film's soundtrack.) So many people who never read the book, yet were Eurythmics fans, could not understand how they, as a group, could create music that was not up to their regular standards (circa 1984). Not that I am a music snob by any means, but I think they did a great job conveying the feeling of George Orwell's phenomenal book, and Micheal Radford's vision of what music in that situation would sound like. Please read the book and listen to the soundtrack or watch the film with this soundtrack playing...I think that if you do not care for this CD now, it might change your mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD made me angry","review":"Well, in a good way.

As you can guess, I was not very impressed with the soundtrack. The problem is, really, that it was a soundscope designed for a movie. Take the music out of the movie and you may cripple the movie. Think of Jaws or Star Wars or James Bond flicks without the soundtrack. Yuck.But take the movie out of the music, or in this case listen to the soundtrack on a CD, and you destroy the music. Even knowing which song went with which idea or scene could not help this CD. And this isn't a bad band but I do feel that, making the music to mold to the story, creating it for the film, means that removing it from the film handicaps it. Just my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundtrack? Excuse me?","review":"Generally when a piece is refered to as a \\"soundtrack\\" it is assumed to contain a collection of or selections from the background score of a the movie in question. Whether it's hit songs, original music, or some combination, generally that musical score or collection is put together so one can listen to it verbatim without having the dialog and visuals in the way - the \\"soundtrack\\". But this simply isn't that.The CD says on it \\"Music derived from Eurythmics' original score of the motion picture 1984\\". That is accurate. It is derived from the original score, but it is NOT the original score. I've seen this CD for sale at several places and this \\"direved from\\" aspect is generally played down.It's alright. It's Eurythmics music. Eurythmics are good. But this isn't their best by any means. I was very disappointed to realize I still didn't have the actual \\"musical score from the movie 1984\\". A lot of the 'haunting' feeling from the 1984 music is just gone from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot Believe","review":"this album did not recieve high critical acclaim.

The religious information is taught as part of understanding of the history of a particular time.Also this is a middle school text and only refers to historically important aspects.

At the price (which I think is extremely reasonable for a DVD you can watch over and over), I can get many great workouts for approximately the same price as I would pay for one class session at my gym, and for a fraction of what I would pay for just one private session with my Pilates instructor. Products should be reviewed for their own merit and not for whether or not a consumer knew what they were purchasing. This DVD is exactly what it promises in the offer and on the box.

Tie them in a knot and put the knot in the cone and your set. They stay in place and you can slip you shoes on and off. Sometimes, the knot comes out of the cone, but the locks still keep laces in place.My only complaint is that I wanted white to match my white athletic shoes.

You can pick up an NPC or two, but it's not really a party-type adventure.i don't really like post-apocalyptic stuff (i'm more into dragons and magic and stuff), but this game just plain rules. Plus, it's funny, and i love little bits of humor in an RPG (it's not silly/funny all the time, but it has enough cute little parts like a Red Ryder BB Gun to put eyes out and an X-Files reference to be enjoyable). It has quite a few references to various movies, which is cuteThe odd thing about this game is that i've played it through to completion several times and intend to play it again. i tried first with an average guy, then i made new characters - a sharp shooter, a talker, a brute with a 2 intelligence, a bad guy, etc. The game's different each time (for humor, try talking to NPCs when your intelligence is 2). i just really like this game"},{"rating":"2","title":"addictive!","review":"I've never really played many RPGs, but a friend gave me this after he had spent many hours playing.

Fallout has the classic turn based, stat based, gameplay of the traditional rpg's yet adds a whole new environment and style which is immediately refreshing for the genre as well as a variety of game play styles which allow you to do so much more than combat.

It ran on windows 7 64bit and the only problem I had is the cut scenes are a little pixilated but that's it no crashes, bugs or problems.

Story line is incredibly good, the setting of the post nuclear war of drugs, radiation, adrenaline and max. pessimism of the post-nuclear world is incredible. You will be a vault dweller while playing the game, unifying with the character you created. I like fallout's graphic engine, still today, isometric and nice graphics. The only problem is the saving times but it wont cause that much trouble. If they release a Fallout 3, with the same sounds and graphics but with a better story line, i still buy it and rate it 5.

Everything 80's pop could be in the hands of genuine artists. This is Americana before anyone had ever heard of the word.

It's excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums of the '80s","review":"At a time when drum machines and dance beats ruled the radio, Bruce Hornsby almost single-handedly revived heartland rock with this Appalachian-flavored debut. While the simple-minded liberalism of the title track usually gets more press, \\"Every Little Kiss\\" and \\"Mandolin Rain\\" are the truly timeless classics on this disc, and they alone are enough to rank \\"The Way It Is\\" as Bruce's best album.\\"The Way It Is\\" is where it all started, and it is still the essential starting point for the casual Bruce Hornsby fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul touching, beautiful music.","review":"Hornsby's music is beautiful and deep.

The songs are outstanding, and McCoy Turner would be proud of the piano work here. Bruce would go on to greater musical success, but he could never sell as many records again. Strange really, but maybe Jazz/Bluegrass styled pop music never belonged at the top of the charts anyway.This CD needs to be reevaluated, maybe with a reissue? It also needs of to be remastered and lose a bit of the echoey 80s production that was thrust on Bruce. The CD has that harsh sound that many early CDs had. When it is eqed correctly it sounds much better and clearer like the follow up, Scenes From The Southside, which was the best-recorded southern album of the 80s.Having said all that, this is the greatest pop album of 1986. Bruce's best music is still to come! I can't wait for the jazz trio album coming in April 2006."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ever","review":"When I think of true music, I think of this album. Bruce Hornsby's melodies are absolutely the most beautiful you will ever hear, and his songwriting flows like no other. I often come back to this album when I want to relax, and when I want to be sure that I am listening to excellent music. I have always, since I first heard this album at the age of 8, considered this to be THE best album I have ever listened to, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Way It Is","review":"The Way It Is being Bruce Hornsby's solo debut and his 1986 release reminds me of the music that I heard growing up in the 80's. The sound is very similair to such artists such as Elton John, Chicago and Don Henley with similair sounding lyrics. The album was a massive success and reached #3 on the Billboard 200 and garnered great reviews from Allmusic. Great tracks on this release are \\"Every Little Kiss\\" and \\"The Way It Is\\". The booklet has all the lyrics and has a list of whom plays what on the album. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent CD","review":"My copy of this CD got scratched a while back, and I just got around to ordering a new one. The new copy wasn't too expensive and came pretty quickly. I'm so happy to have this CD back again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rangey Release","review":"Bruce Hornsby is not only an accomplished keyboard player, but he is a sharp songwriter. He co-penned with his brother most of the songs on this album as well as a #1 song for Huey Lewis & The News in \\"Jacob's Ladder\\". In fact Mr. Lewis shows up playing harmonica and producing two songs on the album. Mr. Hornsby wasn't blessed with the best voice in the world, but he more than compensates for that with snappy arrangements and a cohesive band. Songs like \\"On The Western Skyline\\", \\"The Wild Frontier\\" and \\"The Red Plains\\" have strong lyrical images and the title track (which was a surprise #1 hit in late '86) is one of the best songs to come in the late 80's with Mr. Hornsby's keyboard work really shining. Mr. Hornsby has toured with the Grateful Dead and more recently played with a Dead offshoot The Other Ones. But don't be throw by that association as this album has more in common with artists like Springsteen, Petty & Mellencamp than the Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been better","review":"I couldn't get into this book all that much. All I kept thinking was \\"blah, blah, blah\\". I actually skipped sentences & paragraphs. The author spent quite a bit of time describing the surroundings (rooms, grounds, buildings, etc.) which I found to be boring. The dialogue was somewhat dull too. I can't even write an articulate review because I'm still half brain dead from reading the book. Compared to some of the other Harlequin books I've read, I found this one lacking and, BTW, I only ever write reviews when I find the book to be unlike what I thought it would be, based on other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"One month later...it work, it work!!!","review":"I purchased this for my 5 1/2 year old son about a month ago. He has been potty trained since he was 3 but has had problems wetting the bed. We were willing to let him just out grow it but when he told me what he wanted for his birthday was to not wet the bed we decide to take things to the next level. Before this alarm we tried everything...and nothing worked. I put the monitor in his room the first week and I would go in and wake him up when the alarm would go off. The next week he was waking up when he heard the alarm on his own. The third week the alarm was still going off once a night but he was catching himself before he was really wet usually there was only a tiny wet spot. The fourth week the alarm only went off a few times. He has stopped wearing the alarm and has been dry the last 5 nights. I don't know why this alarm worked but it did, thank goodness!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have bought this sooner!","review":"My son suffered with bed wetting for too long. People told me that he would grow out of it, I heard about the alarms, but was slow to introduce the idea with him. At eight years old, he was ready to try anything. After only two nights of waking up from the alarm, he had his first dry night. Little by little, wet nights are a thing of the past. I wish that I would have done this sooner. The product works well. The sound of the alarm is more upsetting to me than it is to my son, so I am not complaining about it! All good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Wow did that work fast. We reluctanly bought the alarm for our 5 1/2 year old on the advice of our doctor. Within two weeks, our son had all dry nights. We started using it with all the sounds and the vibration; it scared the heck out of him. We had to negotiate it back on him for over an hour. The next night we switched to using just the vibration with mixed results for the next ten days. The we put back just the single tone with the vibration combined with having our son use the bathroom twice, thirty minutes apart before bed and magically it all worked. He has been dry for more than two weeks now."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works but is pricey","review":"We tried many things before we bought it. No drinks after 8PM, alarm at 1AM for months, and we even brought our kid to see doctor. We were skeptical about it first, but I am glad we bought it. After trying it on for 3 weeks, our 6 year old finally is free of diapers. I think it is very expensive, mainly because there is not a lot of products out there. However, it really does work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"So far so good, although I haven't had the luck other users have, we have been using it for four weeks and he is going less but has not stopped.

With the constant cost of pullups or running the washer and dryer every night, we decided to get this alarm at the recommendation of her pediatrician. The first night my daughter wet as usual. But the second night when she wet, she woke up to use the toilet. She has now been completely dry for three months (we stopped using the alarm two months ago). I wish I had gotten this sooner! My daughter's proud of her accomplishment and I'm proud of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost made it. But...","review":"This is a well made device. I took quite the beating while in use here with our two boys.We used this alarm for about a year total with both of our sons, unfortunately neither one had stopped wetting at night. The first (8year old) was getting to the point where he could make a night or two each week waking up dry in the morning after 9 months of continuous use. The telephone jack connector finally broke and by the time I got a replacement he had relapsed and became frustrated, not wanting to try any longer. So the younger (6 years old) said he was ready to try so try we did. After 3 months and no progress he refused to wear it any longer. I couldn't see forcing either of the boys, they are both real good about the problem and I didn't want to sour them on future attempts. I will say that this alarm/vibrator never waked either boy and it required them either to sleep with Mom and Dad or one of us sleeping with them. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied customer","review":"So far, so good. We were not sure what would work with our 10 year old grandson who has been bed wetting since birth. We have seen progress in the past two months and look forward to permanent dry nights ahead. The Malem alarm works well in waking the child, however, only if the child is willing to wake up and not reset the alarm. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective","review":"The alarm is not loud. It does not wake up my 7 year old daughter. She moves in her bed and the alarm sound gets muffled under the blanket. So far, in the last 4 weeks, the alarm has woken my daughter only about 3 -4 times. I wish this alarm were louder. Also its bulky for anyone under 8 years old. Its kinda clunky.We have gone back to pullups. She will outgrow the problem someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malem Ultimate isn't ultimate","review":"After reading numerous reviews, and getting this recomendation from our doctor, we decided to purchase this alarm. I was very excited about it and had high hopes for it. However, we had to replace the batteries twice a week- learned that the hard way- with a wet bed. And now the darn thing doesn't even work after having it less than a MONTH!! We decided to get the more exensive alarm because my child is a deep deep sleeper and thought 'if we are going to invest in this alarm might as well get the best one.' Yes, it did wake my child up. So I gave it 2 stars for when it was working. However, it's already broken. So lets hope we can replace this one and get another and try again or get our money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken within 3 nights","review":"Product did its job for 3 nights. Despite concerns about the comfort of the clip/cable/shoulder pack, my child (a deep sleeper) awoke in time to get to the bathroom before any damage was done. But when trying to install it on the 4th night, the alarm sounded every time the sensor cable was attached. Both the alarm and sensor seem poorly/cheaply constructed--not what I expected for a $100+ moisture sensor. I'll be returning it and trying a different brand. I'm convinced the concept will work, but I don't think I got what I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"No results after 3 months","review":"The idea seems good that someone (or something) would wake my son if he peed at night. However this isn't working. Granted that he has woken up a few nights, but that is about 4-5 times in the last 90 days. The last several weeks he has not responded to the alarm. We have been very patient and followed the advice of others who have used alarms in the past (with limited and mixed success). The problem is that it isn't loud. He moves around a lot and the sound gets muffled under the sheets.We have discontinued the alarm. 3 months was too long not to make progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works","review":"My son has been wetting bed for 3 years.

We thought it was a weather issue but as months went by (4 to be exact) he couldn't control again his bladder. We decided to buy the alarm, it took him only a week and no more wet nights! I should've used it earlier as he started wetting himself again. My son was very happy because he loved the colors and it was reassuring so he could \\"dream happy\\" and the alarm would help him get up to go the bathroom. Very good product thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can I say...he stopped!","review":"It didn't take my son 2 weeks to kick the habit. I almost thought I paid too much for so little use.

After he got the hang of it and 4 months later still no wetting. great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not using","review":"My son is not using because he did not realize he had to wear \\"NORMAL\\" undies instead of boxers.

You have to be a genius/scientist to get it all figured out. You will have to open the unit and use the stick to change the music.We lost the stick, so now we are having difficulty with the product. Anyway, the product is not working even after 3 weeks. We have broken the easy clip and had to pay for replacements which in my opinion are not worth it.I was waking up 3 times a night and cleaning the sensor with a toothbrush as recommended.

When it arrived, I helped set it up and told him how it would work. He was eager to start using the Malem.The first night, the product did not beep and he woke up in a pool of urine. Same thing happened over the next 4 nights. I readjusted the clip to his very bottom which was uncomfortable for him, but it was the only way to ensure it found urine. When it did, he screamed and came running to me. The clip is so tight on the underwear that he was not able to take it off and the alarm kept ringing for a full 2 minutes. My son was in tears and shock.He is scared to use the product. He has enough problems. I do not want to add more insult to injury. This is not a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt wake up my son","review":"Ive tried and tried to use the malem alarm but have had no luck. My son just won't wake up to the alarm.

It has to be one of the worst selections we've choosen in the past year. For one thing, it's full with editing mistakes, and seems like it was written by someone who doesn't have a strong command of good English writing. The plot doesn't seem plausible (even though it's fiction) because the author doesn't develop the main character, Ruben, enough from his knife-wielding youth to his chase for political office in his late 20's. With some thorough editing, and more character development of Ruben and a supporting figure, Althea Lane, I might give this novel 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Ideas in the Fantasy Genre","review":"I found this book to be a great improvement over Ilse Witch. I finally get the feel that I know the characters as each struggles to survive in Castledown and I enjoyed how the author incorporates the old world technology into the fantasy world. The characters confront the power of a machine that seems an eerie reflection of our own and the reader can't help but wonder if our civilization came before the magical present that is Shannara. The whole situation with Antrax was very well thought out and complex. Of course, the whole concept of sinister science reaches melodramatic heights, but it makes for a more compelling 'villain' than exists in most current fantasy. Brooks definitely brought some new elements to his writing in this novel and almost all was to the betterment of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 2nd Book of Trilogy","review":"This Trilogy is probably the best Terry Brooks installments.

The early Shannara books were just plain awful Tolkien ripoffs, though the middle parts of the saga, notably Elfstones of Shannara, were actually quite good. But this post period is pathetic.Admittedly, Brooks has moved away a little from stolen elves and dwarves and into new types of characters, but his writing is still very stilted and not all that engaging. There is an oily sheen to his work, a career made out of capitalizing on other people's ideas and pathfinding and movie tie-ins.

I am very disappointed in this series - it is nowhere near the quality of the Sword, Elfstones or Talismans of Shannara all of which are stand alone books and NOT trilogies -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci-fi annulled fantasy in Antrax","review":"Ironically, what a way to destroy the generations of fantasy realms created in the world of Shannara. Although Terry Brooks writing talent is as compelling as ever, Brooks' emphasis on too much science fiction, like the introduction of artificial intelligence, supercomputers, laser-wielding robots and so on in \\"Antrax\\", has nulled my hopes that what Brooks is trying to bring to us in the Voyage of the Jerle Shannara trilogy is any fantastic fantasy concepts or elements. Shannara series is engrained in my mind as pure realms of fantasy and because of what Brooks did with \\"Antrax,\\" my sentimental attachment to the Shannara realms has been shattered and turned upside down. With \\"Antrax\\", Brooks has destroyed that pure fantasy world of Shannara which I had loved so dearly. Needless to say, I won't be looking forward to the third installment \\"Morgawr.\\" If I want to read science fiction, I'm sure I can find a host of other books to choose from."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"This Terry Brooks 2nd installment of Journey of the Jerle Shannara was a great read. The book came in fairly quick, took only a couple of days. It was used & had some minor water stains but it made up w/ the fact that it was the hard cover copy. I am very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, epic, breathtaking stuff from Master Terry Brooks!","review":"This book is the crown of Shannara literature.It continues the events led up to by ILSE WITCH in a masterful way. This book is action all the way. Never a dull moment, and the plot twist and turns in so many incredible ways, you're not going to believe it. This is one great rollercoaster ride, and the best Shannara-book thus far.The book focuses much more upon the Red's, Bek Rowe and Truls Rohk (who reappears from concealment), Quentin, and Ahren than on the masterful Druid Walker. Walker Boh's character is the best character in any book, in all ways, so it's a bit disappointing that we don't see more to this enigma in this book.The book is finished with ONE **** OF A CLIFFHANGER!! you're not going to be able to wait until next september. Neither could I put the book down whilst reading, and I finished it in five hours. Buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"ANTRAX:Antrax was everything I was looking for in a book. Its a timeless story with a lot to like. If you like epic fantasy you are going to love this.WHAT'S BEST:Terry Brooks has really come into his own in this trilogy. I've enjoyed reading about Shannara over the years but the early books weren't of this caliber. If you've never read Terry Brooks, start with ISLE WITCH, read ANTRAX and then go on to MOGAWR. If your as happy as I am you'll go back and read Brooks earlier works.RECOMMENDED?Yes, highly. Good plot and characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"alright....where's the fantasy","review":"I enjoyed the book, but it felt too short for me. Terry Brooks is a splendid author, and I like fantasy and science fiction novels, but its weird when you put the two together. To me they do not mix very well. Magic versus science and machinery, its hard to imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"A fantastic novel! If you've read Shannara before, you'll love this! It's quite a bit darker than his other books, but that only adds to the experience! If you've read Terry's Ilse Witch, then buy this book right now, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Shannara Book ever","review":"I have been reading the Shannara series faithfully for 10 years, and I have never been disappointed with a Shannara novel until now. The book lacked any form of character development and was seemingly devoid of any advancement in the story until the last 50 pages when it is too late. I have been hoping for a character to emerge and capture my heart in this series, but none have. There is no Balinor, no Garet Jax, no powerful Leah, Quinten is a huge disappointment.I will buy Morgawr only because I am dedicated fan--I only hope that the next book, the conclusion, will not leave me disappointed with the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Hints At Post-apocalypse","review":"Antrax, the title character is a sentient machine, that controls the city of Castledown. It is very smart and has lured the voyagers to it's awaiting maw. It needs magic to stay alive. After waking years after technology crumbled Antrax found a new power source: magic. It was built as the perfect weapon and ultimate protector. Maybe too perfect. It has outlived its masters but must still follow its orders. Protect Castledown at all costs.It is this machine that Walker knows that the strongest magic is held. But there is no way of extruding it. So he is seduced by the sentient being. Meanwhile, the Ilse Witch, now revealed as Grianne Ohmsford has captured Bek who claims to be her dead brother. He knows that the only way to save her is by using the Sword of Shannara. His only way of escaping is Truls Rohk a strange but undaunting protector. It all culminates with a conflict between the Ilse Witch and Walker Boh. But a new enemy is on his way the Morgawr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling","review":"Just finished the book.The ending bites...you've got to read it!The book is full of thrills and twist and turns. Sword and sorcery,politics, trickery, intrigue, fights, swashbuckling, love, hate...Wonderful storytelling and complicated plot and character relations. if you've read the previous book, Truls Rhok is Revealed!...gotta read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different book","review":"Unlike his previos books, Brooks delves into science fiction with the creation of a machine known as antrax (no, not the poisonous powder). Following the story of Bek Rowe Brooks explores the remenants of castledown, a city from the past which posseses a magic which Walker, the druid, believes will help restore the druid counsel. With an interesting twist, the mission to Castledown is followed by the Isle Wich who has some unknown connection with Bek.With the second installment in this series, Brooks continues his fantastic writing. I definately recommned this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first!","review":"This book picks up right where Ilse Witch left off! Of course this means those that try to read the books out of order are really going to be confused. This book is much more fast paced than the first but unlike the first, the reader really doesn't follow one main character - and none of the characters are together. Each character is fighting his or her own battles - literally! Of course this kept me reading and wanting to find out what happened next to all the charcters! Great book and can't wait for the final book out of 3!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not necessarily for every family","review":"This book, while I'm sure it is considered charming by some, is not necessarily right for every family. It certainly wasn't right for mine.If you are trying to teach your children to use the correct names for parts of the body rather than slang terms--this is probably not the book for you. If you don't think that it is appropriate for children to notice or comment on (let alone joke about) the size of their mother's undergarments--this is definitely not the book for you.I don't usually consider myself stodgy, but I thought the way Baby on Board handled the issues it discussed was totally over-the-top and inappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to exciting","review":"I wasn't impressed with this book at all. Illustrations were poor and so was the story line. It didn't really give my son a feel for what was going to happen. The only plus was it did show the mommy's tummy growing and growing and eventually there was a baby. But it didn't really touch on how the other child felt or how anyone felt really."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good","review":"this screen protector does not fit the nikon p100 or p500 screen very well. threw it away. waste of money. stay away from this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"just a wonderful anthology","review":"This is a very comprehensive collection, worthwhile for students and teachers of classics, comparative literature, and modern poetry and for anyone interested in mythology and literature. One of the attractions of this book is the mixture of poems by modern English-language poets and poems translated from foreign languages. The editor has obviously searched far and wide for poems on Greek myth--poems from Romanian, Lithuanian, Chinese, Bengali, Hebrew, Danish, Hungarian, Polish, and Estonian are included in addition to the expected languages. The poems are well chosen and the translations are masterfully done. Another thing that makes this collection so comprehensive is the sheernumber of mythological characters covered. A great collection in every respect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light hearted, entertaining. Page after page of easy fun.","review":"Just kidding! Actually this book was heavy, depressing, and tedious to slog through. All that means is I didn't like it. I could still tell that La Peste is Camus' best attempt at converting the world to existentialism-- it just wasn't my cup of tea. Skillfully written, well thought-out and planned. Rough going throughout, but it will change you if you let it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!","review":"JE SUIS VRAIMENT CONTENTE! so happy that the book came earlier than the expected arrival time!

The full-throated singing has spontaneous ardour but no lack of repose in the music's more serene moments. Summerly offers the motet, Infelix ego, as a bonus. These readings are distinctive in a different way from those by the Tallis Scholars. The recording is outstandingly vivid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silver Plated British Boatswain's Pipe with Chain","review":"Arrived on time and looks nice, but appears to be cheaply made. Does not function well as a Bosun's Pipe, but it looks good as a novelty item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par.","review":"Text is informative, but the black and white photographs do not depict the procedures distinctly. In addition the text does not seem to be too comprehensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellently displayed erotic massage techniques","review":"Excellent book -- very very erotic -- your partner will sure to be pleased!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not informative or sexy...","review":"The book does not give enough actual advice or instruction on massage itself. It seems to focus more on the idea of intimacy, which can't be learned from a book anyway. The photos were distracting and not useful for technique at all. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I paid $4 for it and that was way too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fractures of the Acetabulum","review":"This book is an unsurpassed masterpiece. If you want to learn about acetabular fractures disgnostics and treatment, you have to pass through it and read like the bible. Keep in your library as a cornerstone in the story of medicine. It is the result of years of work by Emile Letournel and Robert Judet. Vive la France!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a must read!","review":"Of the numerous Vietnam-era tales this one ranks right up there with the late Col. Nick Rowe's Five Years To Freedom for heart-stopping suspense. I believe this book should be re-released as the \\"audience\\" for this type of book is probably greater now than during the 1970s."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Passing of the Night: My Seven Years as a Prisoner of the North Vietnamese","review":"General Risner provides the reader with a gripping and informative account of his seven years in Hoa Lo Prison, the \\"Hanoi Hilton.\\" I have purchased thirty copies of this book to use in my high school U.S. History classroom. General Risner provides the reader with an exceptional account of the hardships and sacrifices made by so many of our servicemen. The book portrays patriotism, pride, duty and honor in a manner that is truely inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else can I say?","review":"This book is wonderfull. It tells the story of one of the secondary characters in Anne's diary, Hannali (ie Lies) Gosens.It's true that it focuses mostly on Hannah, but that's the way it should be. It fills in many of the essential holes in Anne's story and tells us what happened to their other friend Sanna ....If you like this one, I also recommend Eva's Story. It's the story of Anne's posthumous step-sister (her mom married Otto after the war). It's true that the parents never met, but Eva had been over to the Frank House many times and was even at ther birthday party where they watched Rin Tin Tin (or whatever the movie was) and Anne got her diary. Both books provide valuable instight and are necessary to the understanding of Anne Frank."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sad Story","review":"Memories of Anne FrankReflections of a Childhood friendBy Alison Leslie GoldMemories of Anne Frank was one of the most emotional books I've ever read in my life. I found it to be very interesting, and a breeze, to read about the relationship of the two friends. I also found that I could completely relate to the things they talked about, the jokes they played, and the arguments they got into! I thought the book was okay, in the sense, some of the time the book could get really boring at times, but then it would pick wright back up into things such as, some of the sleepover parties, the wait was worth it! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read things they can relate to, and that they can't relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Touching","review":"this story was so touching. it is sounds so realistic and helps show what it was really like in the holocaust. one thing though, if you are looking for information on Anne Frank (for like a project or sumthin)it has none cause its not about anne frank, its about her best friend hannah. it only has one or two parts that annes. y they call it memories of anne frank i don't know...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book for all ages","review":"This book was very touching! I read it about a month ago, and have also read other books about this subject since then, but this was one of my favorites. It was so wonderful because Hannah had to watch over her sister and protect her. I loved how brave she was. She only wanted to survive because she had to protect her sister. After all she had been through she found out that both her parents died but still continued to take care of her sister even when she got sick. I loved this book and thought it was very moving. A very good book for anyone to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Tale","review":"For once a look behind Anne. Her best friend Hannah Goslar was a heroine as well. Anne and Hannah were both amazing young women, and I think that all people interested in the entirety of the Holocaust should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"This book was very interesting and pretty good...and it's all true. It's told from a rather different perspective, though. This book is hardly about Anne. Her friend Hannah is the main character. There's nothing wrong with that if you're just reading for pleasure, but if you want to know about Anne Frank like I did, I'd reccomend reading a different book that focuses on Anne. Otherwise, the book Memories of Anne Frank was very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This blacklight sucks","review":"The specs say it covers 7200 square ft, it barely covers that and is so dim that you can't tell that it does anything.

I read it on my Kindle while touring Berlin and it gave me wonderful insight into the places I was seeing.

The adjustment mechanism on the bottom is not effective to control concentration in a spa. Specifically, I have reduced to 1 chlorine tablet in the floater and completely closed the vents yet my chlorine concentration goes high. This is a large floater. I'm sure it's fine for a pool but it's advertised as a 'pool and spa' floater which is why I bought it. I cannot recommend this for spas."},{"rating":"1","title":"sinking feeling","review":"Of all the things you expect a floating chlorinator to do, float is right up there on top of the list and this unit refuses to fulfill that aspect of its product description. The blue collar at the top filled with water and now it lists along with only one edge peeping above the waterline. It hasn't sunk completely, so it is fulfilling the other half of its destiny, it still treads water filled with three tabs, but not in a pleasing, ship-shape manner any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to be very sturdy","review":"The last dispenser we purchased had come from a local \\"big box\\" hardware chain, and that one fell apart in a year.
