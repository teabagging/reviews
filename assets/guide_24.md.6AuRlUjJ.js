Adventure, social commentary of the 1980's (it is getting a little dated but holds up well). Some may not like the preachy attitude as well. The movie is just the start, all kinds of special features that will keep you entertained and informed. My personal favorite was the text commentary, as it is in all of the movies that I have in the Star Trek (Two Disc Special Collecters edition)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second-worst of the six movies","review":"The movie starts off well but degenerates badly once the characters arrive at earth. The beginning of the movie is also reminiscent (unfortuantely) of the early part of the first movie. In this movie, just substitute an alien whale-lover for V'Ger.There are some humorous moments here and there once the crew returns to 20th-century Earth, but the movie is irreparably marred by a thinly-veiled and silly political agenda on the part the movie's producers. It turns into an embarassing \\"Save the whales\\" commercial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stardate-1980's =Lame","review":"Oh no William Shatner has to save the whales......please!! Come on, this is the worst sci fi movie concept ever. Sending the crew to do social comentary on pretecting the environment. And then there is the fact that the script was terrible and there were some pretty cheasy acting moments. I would even rather watch Starship Troopers or dare I even say Jar Jar Binks commentary on Star Wars Episode 1!!!I'm sure I'll get negative reviews/votes from Trekies who have no life. But they worship their god (william shatner) with so little regard to the real world, that they can't see that this movie is actually worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space. And that shatner isn't a good enough actor to be on a lame show like days of our lives.But the real kicker is that this is one of the best Star Trek moves!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unspeakable.","review":"By far the worst of the Trek Films. It makes the Search for Spock look like Grand Illusion. As a series, the Star Trek Films have been going downhill since The Wrath of Khan.The attempts at humor remain attempts. The characterizations are sketchy. The situations are cliched. And the ridiculousness of a two-hour Save The Whale commercial lifts this turkey right into Ed Wood territory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing It All Back","review":"Like The Trouble With Tribbles,IV may not be the best(II tops them all),but it's certainly many fans favorite.What makes this film work is its humor as well as its warmth and heart.The cast look like they're having so much fun filming it, that it rubs off on the audience.Equally funny is seeing our beloved crew of the USS Enterprise,looking awkward and out of place in the 20th century.The movie is also fast paced as many obsticles(the Klingon Crystal depletion,the search for the whales in the ocean as well as the hospital scenes)pile up upon one another yet successfully resolving themselves.Subsequent film that try to replicate IV's formula end up looking clumsy(V and Insurrection)because they miss the point that behind great comedy is heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long time fan of every trek series... Can't stand this movie","review":"I loved TOS. Saw TNG in my teens ...it formed my values of peace and exploration as an adult, because every character in that series was an outstanding person. Loved DS9 and Voyager both, outstanding. Enterprise: no comment. I don't accept it as part of the ST cannon. The movies, esp II were great.Humpback whales in spaceTransparent Aluminum?No.The only reason I wrote this crappy review was to explain my-clearly contrarian to the Amazonian massses-1 star.

Compare the picture quality of this movie to the episodes of the original shows that Paramount is releasing. Star Trek IV is grainy, and has a soft focus. Why couldn't Paramount had gone back and cleaned up the image of it's Star Trek movies, to look as good as the episodes? As for the film, it is a fun adventure about the preciousness of life. Too bad you can not enjoy it due to Paramount's lazy treatment of it's presentation on DVD..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A whale of a time? hahahahahah.........","review":"This is a classic example of a TOS movie that should have been a single episode. It stretches ON AND ON until you just have to hit the \\"cue\\" button, you're so tired of seeing whales singing underwater!!!! I was also quite annoyed by Spock's endeavor to add swear words to his vocabulary . . . guess it was supposed to be funny, but all it got out of me was disgusted sighs. Not only that, the scene toward the end with the whaling ship was FORCED CONFLICT at its best--did anybody think for a minute those whales were going to DIE?? I think the whole episode was thought up to stretch out the crew's \\"Voyage Home,\\" and the best scene was the last one, where Kirk is officially demoted back to captain. Not only that, \\"Miss Marine Biologist\\" (her name was GILLIAN, guys!!) was extremely annoying--way too flighty for my taste. However, as usual Nimoy and Shatner managed to transcend the script . . . which is the only thing that keeps this movie from getting a single star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great condition","review":"Arrived early and in good shape.

I have enjoyed the latest movies to come which feel much less campy then the ones from this era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Star Trek Movie, EVER!","review":"Even after seeing the new Star Trek movie it still doesnt compare, in my book, to this film. The clarity of the issue, the tight, clear storyline, the comedy (quality, timing & delivery), the great city of San Francisco and its remarkable beauty all make for the most memorable Star Trek movie ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"painted key labels wear off in months","review":"Very light use of the keyboard, only web browsing, wore off the painted key labels in six months on several keys. Too bad such a nice design could not have been supplied a tad more costly but usable. Stamped/inscribed or permanent labels used to be found on even cheap keyboards, so this is a new low in manufacturing, and just not acceptable in keyboards. It shouuld not be sold (I'll just discard my second one kept for a backup though never used and new in box).You can feel that the labels are only painted on and not stamped into the keys by feeling with fingertips how they are raised slightly above the surface, and the key surface is not as slick as the harder plastic finishes. Yet even softer rubber keys can have properly molded labels (think cell phones).Will have to see if the otherwise good mouse works with other keyboards."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most inaccurate book ever written on the subject","review":"This is a review of two halves:The text is hopelessly inaccurate, and can by no means claim to be a definitive work.

Holthusen books are full of lies and inacraces","review":"I am very disapointed in the inaccuracies of the Peter Holthusen's Land Speed Record book.

The car was not named The Michaelson Rocket car.The car never had a 13,000 lb rocket engine it. In fact the car never had a engine in it. The fact is the car was stolen from kitty O'Neil's shop in Filmore, Califonia in 1979. These are just a few of the inaccuracies and lies that Mr Holthusen wrote in his febale attempt to record history.

Other than that, this cd is a waste of time. And its no wonder...only \\"How You Gonna Act Like That\\" was pushed, so that should tell you that Tyrese's own record company had no faith in this cd.

Tyrese is another of the many male artists that contradicts himself throughout the album. He writes his music like everyone that is in a relationship has a ghetto twist to his or her business.

But How You Gonna, I Must Be Crazy*(I love this song), Signs of Lovemaking, On Top of Me, and I Wanna Go There make me very proud to have purchased this cd.

Some compared it to Steve Reich's work. Maybe. But it resembles more his peculiar 'Tehillim' with voices than his excellent 'Music for 18 Musicians'. This weak attempt at 'In C' does not match Riley's spirit, verve and virtuosity.

The first song is about two old men that fish on the pier. I used to fish on the municipal pier at Santa Cruz and that song brings back such memories! Every lyric is absolutely true. WHAT FUN. The Dorados have captured the spirit of fishing. My two hobbies are fishing and music, and this CD has made me a true Dorado's fan.

I'm looking forward to a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding unusual meodic sounds!","review":"As with other releases by Bar-None, this is a compilation of 2 LPs, that are performed by 2 different orchestras with different sounds. The first contains a series of melodic sounds made with unknown instruments- I've been listening for this record since I was 11 (I'm 45 now)- and haven't been able to identify. There's a Harpsichord in some, and tunes played by percussion. A saw can be heard in one of the tunes. If you think this is not remarkable think again: The Moog synthesizer didn't exist for another 10 years! All of the tunes are very easy to listen to, and sound lively and modern. The second LP shows Juan's experiments with strings... Wow! He uses string instruments skillfully and the results is music that you get hooked too. The transfer to CD is quite good and contains the original release LP jackets. This is my very favorite of all of Esquivel's recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"freeing the natural voice","review":"Excellent content with practical exercises to do that gives results.

It's almost humorous how hard these guys are trying to sound American. They just seem like they are intentionally doing cliché after cliché because they think that's what they should do.Anyway, the music has a NYHC base to it, but they add a few subtle metal elements. All the songs sound the same pretty much. In fact, after a few minutes of listening I checked to see what song I was on and it said 4. I wasn't even aware that track 1 had ended. So that might give you an idea how monotonous this album is. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"most vapid Freench movie ever","review":"I had the misfortune of seeing this movie in the cinema and was deeply moved. So much so that I begged some complete strangers who were inspecting the movie posters outside not to see it at any cost. I like difficult movies and I don't mind films where nothing much happens for a bit, but this was just a pointless waste of time. Binoche's husband dies and she spends the film looking expressionlessly at various things, driving around a bit and having a sexual encounter which is about as sexy as cleaning linoleum.

I am interested in installing a few lamp/appliance modules as a simple way of extending the range of my network by utilizing the routing feature of Z-Wave nodes. The literature and packaging indicate that the HAO3 modules included in this kit have \\"Built-in \`repeater' function for reliable signal reception\\" and I thought that the kit would be an inexpensive way to build out the mesh on my network. When I got them installed I learned that they do not. They are classed as \\"Slaves\\" not \\"Routing Slaves\\" and do not forward Z-Wave packets to neighboring nodes, making them useless for my intentions. I have decided to keep them as they are still useful as dimming lamp modules, but since I use very few standalone lamps in my home, their use is somewhat limited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item quickly failed...","review":"Nothing against the Seller because this item came quickly and was packed well...While setting up the controller, one of the lamp modules failed. Looking at other reviews, this seems to be the norm, and they have a high failure rate.The controller module wasn't compatible with Micasa2 Z-Wave controller...or at least I couldn't get the two to work together.So---for the kit, I got one lamp module that worked.I don't recommend these---good luck!~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't add other HomeSettings modules to the controller.","review":"Despite language on the product box that says the HA07 controller will work with \\"any\\" Z-Wave enabled module, it simply won't.I've got numerous other Z-Wave modules. (All are made by the same manufacturer that makes this controller: Intermatic HomeSettings).None of them can be added to the controller making the HA07 unit completly unusable. Returning the entire kit and will turn to another home automation platform besides Z-Wave. I think this platform is way too unreliable.By the way, don't try going to the \\"support\\" page on the HomeSettings website. It's completely empty of content.... seriously! It's a big white page. So much for trying to troubleshoot this issue on my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well as a secondary controller","review":"I have used this both as a primary and a secondary controller. It may not be as useful as a primary controller because the firmware is outdated and one will not be able to use the date and time and DST functions reliably. It works well though as a secondary controller for just turning z-wave modules off or on manually."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I Bought it!!","review":"I love this kit. works great for my living room which i have two lamps in.

X-10 is subject to a great deal of interference and is a technology no longer worth investing in since there's Z-Wave. My Z-Wave system has worked flawlessly. I haven't taken advantage all of this control unit's capabilities yet (it has a built in clock and calendar to turn lights on and off when you're away) but I expect it to work as advertised as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value kit, jury out on Z-wave","review":"This is a very cost effective way to get into home automation. There are cheaper remote plug ins, but they probably wont be expandable to more devices, nor dim, nor have a timer in the controller. Z-wave also has PC based solutions if you want to have computer controlled lighting.For the Intermatic specifically, I asked the manufacturer about support for dimmable CFLs with these adapters and they said no, only rated for traditional bulbs, so if you only have CFL, even dimmable, it's probably safest to get the heavy duty adapters - they will only turn on/off though.I'm having some issues with Z-wave based screw in adapters - not all lights seem to turn on/off reliably so i'm wondering about whether Insteon might be a better overall solution as this can use the house wiring as well as radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product & Outstanding Price","review":"I needed an additional lamp module to expand the Home Steeings system I've had in my motorhome for over two years now.

Anyone with an interest in and respect for Deaf culture and ASL would be better off taking a few classes taught by a deaf person at their local community college.If you prefer a video, please avoid ones like this which present ASL/Sign English pidgin as the langauge of the deaf (Clues to look for are the arraging of ASL phrases in English word order and the use of strictly English grammar words such as \\"is\\".) The true grace and texture of ASL cannot be found here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this video to be very insufficient.","review":"I was very disappointed with this videotape. Too much time is devoted to an example of how sign language is used in everyday life, as viewers are \\"treated\\" to a trip to a doctor's office. The instructor barely scratches the surface of sign language, and at the end of this videotape I found I had learned very few signs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good instructional video, only an introduction","review":"If you are looking for a good instructional video to get you started, then this video *not* for you. Renee Moore, who is a professional interpreter is the teacher of this video. She hardly begins to teach anything. In the first 20 seconds of the video, she mentions that she has no deaf family members, yet Amazon's information says she has a deaf daughter. For example, I thought that she would sign specific groups of words (people, food, clothes, geography) and then repeat them. Basically, The only words that she really shows you how to sign is just \\"hello.\\" Her visit to a doctor's office is a waste of time as it only shows how she does her job of interpreting for the deaf, like as if this video is for a high school \\"Career Day\\". Don't waste your money on this video. Compared to this video, you can get better instruction from a printed book by looking at the illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This tape was a waste of time. You could learn it all from a book. She teaches the manual alphabet (which I already knew), the number signs 1-10, and a few other beginning signs. She wastes too much time yacking and not enough time signing. She underestimates the intelligence of her adult audience. I also thought she would group words together by subject, such as foods, colors, people, household things, etc. She could have put a lot more useful information in this video if she had talked less and just showed the signs. The doctor's office visit was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual meals with a southwest spice to them","review":"Southwestern Soups, Stews & Skillet Suppers provides a dual focus on quick dishes and unusual meals with a southwest spice to them, from a spicy chili-enhanced chorizo chowder to a spicy eggplant stew for two or a barbecued beans and sausage skillet.

In fact, there are few things of ST: Voyager I don't like. This book falls into that latter category. The plot starts out promising, but ends up dragging out several aspects of the plot, including the 'one voice', which isn't really described in the book. Also, the author must love earthquakes, as it seems the planet the crew finds themselves on loves to try to shake itself to death, but the crew doesn't seem to care. Character development is almost null, and the entire crew seems a little, hmm, 'off' when it comes to making decisions. Janeway makes decisions that are not the kind she would make, Tuvok starts to show a little emotion, and Tom Paris is not nearly the wise crack he should be. In fact, Tom Paris seems very mellow in this book. Oh well, not all books can be superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't finish it.","review":"It's extrememly rare that I don't finish a book, especially a Voyager novel. But I just couldn't do it.While this book had beautiful imagery and solid story developments, it had no heart. There was little to no characterization. The whole thing seemed hollow to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was so boring I couldn't force myself to finish it.","review":"This was the worst Star Trek Voyager book of all. I thought the author spent way too much time developing and emphasizing an alien culture that was totally uninteresting.

Even without Ibrahim Ferrer it would have been great, but he puts it over the top. Attisso's guitar and Cissoko's saxaphone are just amazing--not to mention the percussion, which has a voice as important and expressive as those of the melody instruments and singers. Pirate's Choice was my first taste of Baobab, and this recording makes me want to get all the others. This band has a unique sound that you can identify instantly. Only one critism: I wish the producers had included the lyrics with translations in the booklet. That goes for Pirate's Choice too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly Overrated","review":"Unless this is your only O.B. album, there's some filler here. Hommage A Tonton Ferrer is essentially a shorter version (with different lyrics) of Utrus Horas, the first track on Pirates Choice, and the longer version is better played and more hypnotic. El Son Te Llama is a faster, shorter cover of the better-played version from On Verra Ca. (The original version, by the way, is also available on Putumayo Presents Afro-Latino, an excellent compilation.) The remaining seven songs are quite good and offer plenty of variety.

Yet his arrangements are all first class originals. Whereas many other arrangers resort to gimmickry (sound effects and such) Esquivel integrates unusual tonal voices with the standard big band/woodwind/percussion group. It is seamless and quite enjoyable. BUT MAKE SURE AND GET THE IMPORT VERSION. It boasts the original liner notes and, to my ears, a tape that is as least one generation closer to the master (maybe it is the original master). Bottom line is the import simply sounds fuller than the domestic release. It is definitely worth the few extra bucks to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting read","review":"Sometimes boring, sometimes funny. But this book is worth the read.

I stopped using our case book and have been using the supplement ever since I got it. It's incredible how everything is broken down.

However, it is very comprehensive and is no different from the main textbook. If you have the main textbook you will be fine. This book does not condense things.

It is curious why Mr. Chemerinsky couldn't have been this concise in the casebook, but that's beside the point. :)That being said, this is NOT a study aid for finals.

The instruction notes within are as sparingly clear as the fluid strokes of this legend. 30 years after learning the game, I returned to his service technique to remove my own personal lazy, idiosyncratic additions over time. Why pay hundreds of dollars in lessons if you can practice these strokes against a mirror and take them to the court for repetition. Our losing Davis Cup teams would be wise to contain only players who have mastered these essentials.

The first had color distortions like you'd get from poor shielding - nothing seemed to correct this. The second has a similar distortion problem but not as bad, but has a crooked picture - horizontal lines on the screen (including the set's internal menus) tilt such that the left side is about a half-inch higher than the right side. There is no documented way to adjust the screen for this. The picture is otherwise terrific, though color is a little saturated on the factory settings. The picture in picture feature is great, the set has a wealth of AV inputs and even an audio output if you want to pipe audio back through your AV system. The remote is fairly nice, though there are an awful lot of controls for a TV. If the picture wasn't crooked I'd be loving this set, but with one already sent back, I'm likely to change brands rather than try a third JVC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, pre-Forbidden Broadway fun!","review":"I adore this show. Its a goofy, 1950's satire of music, theatre, and New York City.The opening number is priceless, even if the jokes don't all make sense today. It's a sendup of a backers audition, and its studded with mini-parodies of other pop music genres within in.But the real reason to buy this CD are for Charlotte Rae and Tammy Grimes - every one of their songs are hilarious, and its great to hear them both sing some original, funny tunes that no one else has recorded!Track 14, I'm Glad I'm Not A Man, is a song that sums up Tammy Grimes' career and performance style.

Before United Press, which gives out instant news 24 house a day, Currier and Ives would work out a print on some news topic and it was literally carried from one newspaper to the next, \\"Pony Express\\" style. And like today, there was bad news and good, and as much as could be was compressed into one print. Some are on some ugly topics. The prints,a big old dusty book we had around the house, when I was a kid (that would be around 1952) provided endless hours of fascination.

As a VB & VC++ programmer, I ended up reading the book from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for anyone who needs to learn SQL","review":"I have used SQL for a couple years and thought I knew all I needed to know. This book shows you everything! You learn all aspects of SQL including designing and creating databases right down to finding out if your doing an inner or outer join. An excellent book I would recommend to anyone needing to learn SQL for any reason. You can learn as much or as little as you need. And the knowledge will stick with you. It does need a few more code examples but the logic is there explaining anything you need to understand. I started using the things I learned in this book immediately in my job. Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed -- Not for Beginners","review":"I had to buy this book for an online class I'm taking. The teacher probably wanted it because of the [very old] software [on floppys] to use with the class. The book itself is basically on the border of terrible for someone like me who is new to SQL (even though I am a senior CS student). Uses a lots of terminology that he doesn't explain. Not very good examples. Cannot skip between chapters without confusion. Overall, this is the worst computer book that I have purchased. I'm looking for a new one to supliment my learning for the class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT FOR BEGINNERS","review":"I bought this book after reading several favorable recommendations. Unfortunately, they were all from people who had some prior knowledge of SQL and \\"assumed\\" that this book would be good for beginners, because it made complete sense to them when they read it.Having no SQL knowledge whatsoever, I had a hard time trying to fish out little SQL code tidbits that I could run myself, and thereby learn by doing. This book really discourages that. (See the reader review from 1998-04-10.)If you are new to SQL, try Teach Yourself SQL in 24 hours (don't let the title throw you) from Sam's Publishing, which I found to be much better suited for neophytes.Also, the author is member of Ansi SQL standards committee, and it shows. He talks about esoteric SQL topics, i.e. comparing facets of SQL-92 to sQL-89, etc. Not only does this get in the way of the useful content, it is usually an irrelevant distraction that the reader could do without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book for learning SQL","review":"This book reads like a compilation of notes and papers from some standards conference. The author comes off as very full of himself and doesn't need to be bothered by giving practical content to this theory.Much of the useful information is hidden in the author's syntax notation.This book is too confusing for a beginner and too shallow for a pro. There is nothing \\"Instant\\" about this book. I am very disappointed with this WROX publication"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners Beware","review":"Database design and SQL are difficult subjects but a book for beginners should make every effort to accomodate the beginner by simplifying it as much as possible. And, to a degree, this book does that. But there are too many forays into outer space. Consider this passage from page 122: 'You can summarize the rule as follows: if X and Y are columns and X is a key, then for any Z which is a proper subset of X, it can't be the case that Z determines Y.' No matter how elegant, I don't think anyone would argue that this is helpful for a beginner. On the contrary, it tends to make the subject seem as difficult as possible. Hardly a proper goal for a beginner's book. I am about half-way through this book and, increasingly, I am going to MSDN for a clearer explanation to each of the subjects that Celko addresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, deeply intelligent album","review":"I LOVED Lullaby's previous release, Blanket Warm, and at first I couldn't grasp \\"I Never Even Asked For Light.\\" Now, however, both are equally amazing. \\"Light\\" has a more aggressive edge, but the same dark poetry and complex accoustic instrumentation. \\"Hypnotist\\" contains my favorite Lullaby lyric: \\"I dreamt I was a firefighter, but the flames were never real. I dreamt I was an engineer, and I designed it dear, the world's perfect treadmill. I dreamt I was a hypnotist, a farmer and an architect, a poet and an acrobat.

It no longer prints out the splits, it only prints out the message \\"STIT TI\\".I looked online to see what this might mean and someone else posted the same problem, but there was no solution. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the official release?","review":"As of this writing the only home format available for this particular film is this mediocre offering from Video Yesteryear which is derived from a print of inferior quality made worse by the fact the company chose to hastily transfer an existing VHS copy (tracking lines and all) to DVDR.The film itself is masterful and worth every penny; so this is why viewing it in this sad state has motivated me to call upon the original rights holders in an effort to remaster the original French negative (assuming it still exists) and release an official DVD.In my opinion this 1938 remake is better than the original in terms of execution; with the help of sound and added atmospheric cinematography it taps into nerves the 1919 silent film cannot.La Fin du Monde; another forgotten Abel Gance film has also yet to see an official DVD release in its original French form.At some point the studio who owns these films should really consider putting together a box set of Gance's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic","review":"The original \\"J'accuse\\" stands on it own for the period in which it was filmed 1918-19. This is exceptional in its own right - but the tragedy is the horrid copy of what appears to be one of the greaest anti-war films of all time.There is nothing worse than captializing on an inferior product and this has to be the worst transfer that I have ever purchased.Hopefully, Criterion or Kino will do something about this and bring forth a restoration worthy of this great film on dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"I purchased this for my 5 year old in the hopes that she might enjoy the songs and become familiar with some of the sounds of the French language. This is the first movie that she has refused to watch! (and she has watched a number of movies in French) It is very poorly made. The songs are terrible and the children singing them are tone deaf.The MUZZY tapes have worked much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"out-dated future","review":"This was a very nice movie to watch, even twenty or thirty years after I had first seen it. It has that special charm of out-dated SF movies and I enjoyed watching it again. The characters appearing in the film are many-layered, funny and simply interesting. Young Michael York is both energetic and contemplative, both in good measure. The girl and the old man are charming. The visuals were stunning at the time of release, and still are if You do not require 4-5 explosions per scene and jumpy directing. The film is even erotic to some point. The plot suffers some faults, but not as many as most modern movies. Both picture and sound on the DVD are fine. There are not many specials on the DVD, but since these are mostly boring, I do not object to that. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a really good film!","review":"When this movie first opened years ago, I was so blown away that I went to see it again the following night. Although it is somewhat dated, LOGAN'S RUN still has that impressive quality for today's audience. (Add another point if you think Michael York is hot!) Most definitely worth purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logan's Yawn","review":"I first saw this about 25 years ago and had some pretty good memories of it. The carousel idea was especially interesting, since I believed then, as now, that all things are renewed upon so-called death. That is the part that truly brought me back for another viewing.During this particular look-see, I was troubled by the way the plot bounced and ebbed and jerked around and ran itself into logistical walls. There were also too many trite and/or cornball elements. One of the little dome models was apparently made of bubble wrap.I didn't even finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"deathless","review":"This movie ought to be studied over and over again by the people who write and make science fiction films.It is the preeminent example in the genre of how you can have the most awful look, the most inept direction, and the cheesiest, most laughable special effects . . .. . . and yet the film will be universally known and still talked about decades later because of what a solid, solid story it was.About a million times more potent that some dumb monster eating people in outer space!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cult Classic","review":"I saw this movie for the first time on AMC a few months back and after I saw it I immediately got on the internet and ordered it. I love the special effects and set design. The only real negative to the movie is that the storyline isn't really completed and at a few spots in the movie it almost seems like the makers forgot what was going on or what the movie was about.If you liked West World, The Omega Man, or Soylent Green you will love Logan's Run as it leaves all of those movies in its dust. I definately recommend getting this movie and the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tacky fun","review":"Ok. This is not really a fair review. I have been weaned on this movie since I was very young. I would always catch the end or bits and bobs on TV for years and years. Not util I got the DVD did I see the film for the first time. Shockingly dated, bad special effects and it is very slow in a lot of points. But it does tell a story. One could, if they wished, say that this is a parable for the \\"ME\\" generation. How life is over once your 30. How live is about the searching for pleasure. How one person beings to see that life does not end at 30....bla bla bla. But it's just a movie and a fun one. If you could imagine a future designed by the same person who designed all those 70's discos, this is what it would look like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sci-Fi","review":"I liked this movie when it first came out and for me it hasn't lost its appeal.

Then there are the two principals, the fine English actor and actress Michael York and Jenny Agutter (lovely and sexy as always). Basically, though, it's just the whole concept of a world of only the young and beautiful that struck me then and now as an appropriate vision of the future given our culture's shallow emphasis on looks, fame, and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these people that gave it 5 stars!?!?","review":"We watched this movie based on the positive reviews and couldn't believe we wasted our time watching the first hour. After that, we fast forwarded to see if it got any better. It didn't. It should have been rated an R for the female upper body nudity and even without that problem, the movie was a typical 70's psychodelic-music, holographic-artistic, drug-induced? film (in my opinion). I don't EVER want to see it (or recommend it to anyone) again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame take-off from the book","review":"Sorry, but since \\"Logan's Run\\" is one of my all-time favorite books, I was really disappointed in this rendition of it. Certainly you can't expect filmmakers to \\"film the book,\\" but when a book is this special, you want the movie to be so, too. Michael York is just too old and Jenny Agutter, though a wonderful actress, just didn't fit in Jessica's skin. Though I saw the film back in the '70s and now have a copy of it, try as I might, I just can't seem to get past how it botches my vision of this fabulous book. Read the book! An extraordinary, visionary tale!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would actually improve with a remake.","review":"Plot is pretty good, dialogue stilted but could be salvaged, but dear god, please get rid of those cheesy Star-Trek sets and costumes, and that horrible soundtrack. If someone really talented did this it could be extremely chilling. As it is it's about half a step up from William Shatner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"Yes, Logan's Run is a bit dated. Most movies don't stand the test of time. There are too many contemporary cultural references in most movies to avoid this. And Logan's Run is no exception.However, for quality of story, acting and action, Logan's Run is still excellent. The characters are engaging and they develop depth as the story proceeds. Many of the themes are timeless. Our youth-oriented culture, ecological disaster and fear of government are just a few of the elements presented here.Up until Star Wars, Logan's Run was in select company as far as science fiction went. Perhaps only 2001 surpassed it prior to 1977. I still count this film among my top 20 or so favorites of all time and very highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic sf","review":"This 1976 classic sf movie already looked a little outdated by 1977 because of the groungbreaking special effects in Star Wars. But it is still enjoyable movie if you don't mind the cheap looking sets, somewhat silly storyline, Jenny Agutters acting and the obvious miniature models. It's a shame that there are no deleted scenes because, according to the director's commentary, this all got lost. Looking forward to the remake of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Viewing","review":"This is a realy well mad science fiction movie.Some say its outdated,but i think the plot is realy interesting.Its also a well made movie.But i must confess i thought the series of Logans Run was sensational when i saw it as a kid.I have not seen it since the 70's and i would definitly buy it if it came out on DVD.I like this movie and i would reccomend it to those who like Sci-Fi movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised...","review":"I was wary of this purchase due to other reviewer's claims of a poor transfer. However, I found this Blu-Ray Disc to be very clear and clean. The original print used to make the transfer from does have scratches and the colours seem a bit washed-out, and the special effects were 70s effects and not up to today's standards... but there really wasn't very much graininess at all (which is my major peave). So, I was pleased. They did a very good job with this older film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces missing","review":"I won't talk about the quality of the actual movie but I will say that Warner ONCE AGAIN does it's usual sub standard job at transfering a classic movie from video to DVD.

This movie is absolutely terrible. Even in 1976 these are just about the worst/cheapest effects possible. The story itself is interesting to a degree but the execution is LIKE an execution. Jessica/Logan are at least decent but there is just no excuse for the dialogue, the effects, the continuity of the story, the look of the film, or the direction.I rented this today and am a big fan of Star Trek, the original show, and even Planet of the Apes, the TV series, so I am open to great characters overriding aweful plots/effects but Logan's Run is just about as bad as it gets, almost on par with 'Dune', almost. This movie just doesn't stand the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is why Star Wars rocked the world","review":". . . because, before Star Wars, we had to watch befuddled backsewage like this!Just about the time you think the story is starting to make sense, the rug is pulled out from under you and the plot goes ga-ga. In thirty-odd years, I have never been able to decipher why the dome city self-destructs in the end, or, for that matter, why Farah Fawcett (age 29 and a TV superstar) was given a bit part while Jenny Agutter (age 34 and a bit chubby)was given the co-starring role. But I suspect that whatever was behind that directorial decision also explains why there obviously was no budget for a script."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I thought I was going to watch one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made.NOT.The acting was boring and so was the story in which I had a hard time understanding.If this movie is a classic,it should be considered one of the most boring of all-time.Now I see why I didn't watch the so-called TV series."},{"rating":"1","title":"age-ism is a form of race-ism","review":"i saw this film once when i was eighteen on a rented vhs,and i was bored out of mymind by the visuals and disgusted by the theme of the story. enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cult Classic","review":"I have always loved this movie.

At this price, I was very happy with the purchase.The movie itself is just as enjoyable now as it was years ago. Classic story, great FX, and good performances. Fun, sexy, sci-fi movie with the intriguing theme of a sealed world of pleasure and leisure ... but only room for the young.

While I can't imagine why anyone would want the pan-and-scan, which chops nearly half the picture from this visually stunning film, it's here for those who want it.There's just one thing keeping me from giving it a fifth star. There was a Special Edition laserdisc a few years back that had everything on this DVD, plus an amazing collection of magazine articles, prop photos, and other goodies. Some of this material is hard to find, and now that I know that it exists, I would like to see it on DVD.

Although it is clear that a lot of effort was put into the production, even as it steals from Metropolis and gives to the video game Myst, in the end, the unrelenting cheesiness cannot be overcome.

The sharpness and detail does not compare to most of the other Blu-Ray titles I have watched. It is much improved over the DVD version, but that isn't saying much, because the DVD release of this title looked like a bad dub of a bad VHS tape. This Blu-Ray release is comparable to what the earlier DVD release should have looked like. The back indicates that it is released through the Turner and Warner Bros operations, so I suppose that says a lot. I wish that companies such as these would throw in the towel and turn this stuff over to companies that care at least a little bit about the quality of the product, as opposed to how much revenue it generates. They care only about how much revenue it generates, and for the most part could care less whether the technical quality is up to the standard for the media."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent 'old' look at the future","review":"The special effects seem almost silly at times, compared to todays computer generated movies.

Exteriors were obviously off the lot somewhere in southern California. The obviously fake model bubble city reminded me of Disney's Epcot. The acting is embarrassingly bad, and the script, well, it's also a message movie for its times when being over 30 was supposed to be like death. The special effects, such as they are, are cheap beyond words. Yet somehow this relic has remained as some sort of pop cultural icon. Watch it for its unintentional laughs.

Biggest problem with the Playmate is the latch does not work so it swings open unexpectedly. Very annoying. This is basically an oversized lunch box which dumps its contents when put on side. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a cooler","review":"I purchased this cooler at a large retailer in Chicago (so I'm fairly certain it's not a fake if those even exist). This is a lunchbox, not a cooler. If I put drinks and ice in it, the ice is mostly melted within 90min and completely melted within 2.5hrs. My 10yr old handheld Coleman cooler (standard model, not 'maxcold' or anything like that) goes 4hrs before ice begins to melt and can keep drinks cold at least 8hrs, even in the summer sun. I think Igloo should spend less time on fancy product design and more on basic insulation. I don't understand the disparity in reviews for this product so I recommend moving to one with consistently positive reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review is more about the shipping than the item","review":"I realize this is just a cooler but when the item was recieved it was all scuffed and scratched up and had dirt and wear marks all over the handle like it had been used. This is the first negative review I've ever wrote. Next time I will just make the trip to walmart and probably save a few bucks in the process, I ordered on amazon for convenience and got a product that quite honestly looks like its been tossed around a dirty warehouse for a few days before they shipped it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amber Glow coaster set","review":"The coaster set is OK but washed out and flat looking -- not anywhere as colorful as the picture.

Love them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as described","review":"I cannot speak for the product's usefulness. I am merely writing to say that these do NOT like at all like they do online. I bought them as a gift, mostly b/c of the bright colors and contrast. I thought I'd received the wrong set when I received them. The colors are much more muted, there is little contrast. All in all, not that attractive. Also, the box was ripped, so I'm hesitant to give them as the gift they were intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugly stupid prints on stone","review":"Sandstone ruined with ugly prints. The image is not like reality and at no point does the description say they are prints!!!I may try to sand the image off.update: At least the stone is so soft the image came off easily. The resulting stones are all very different, but much better than the original image. I wonder whether coasters designed to be \\"naked\\" are picked to match better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Got what I paid for","review":"The design is clearly a scanned image.

When it arrived it was such cheap quality that I never gave it away. The color doesn't look deep and dark like the picture but red and flat. No one would ever mistake it for real stone. The sides of each thick coaster are not printed and look awful. It also didn't come with a holder for the coaster set. It arrived cracked and the first time I used it, it cracked again from falling off the coffee table.

I'm returning mine and after I get my refund I'm going to buy some plain sandstone coasters."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're definitely thirsty!","review":"I was a little disappointed with the look of these coasters when I first got them. In the picture they almost look like granite. I was expecting a more shiny surface, but they have a dull, matte surface (probably for absorbing moisture). After using them however, I was very pleased. They are heavy and sturdy with a nice cork backing and they really do absorb water! I was excited to see that they can keep up with a cold, iced beverage on a hot day. We were previously using glass coasters and the water would pool up and run onto our coffee table, but not with these! I completely recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference !","review":"I bought this book almost ten years ago for a drawing class I took. I still use it today for reference. This book has to be the most useful book I ever bought while I was a student. I have never gone back to my math or science books. But I always go back to this book. Buy it you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This book contains blurry reproductions of master drawings (Michelangelo, etc.), crudely executed original drawings, hard-to-read text, and at least one error in labelling. Better artistic anantomy books are out there. Three books come to mind: Paul Richer's Artistic Anatomy (from which some of the best drawings in Schider are taken), Eliot Goldfinger's Human Anatomy for Artists, and Stephen Rogers Peck's Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what it is","review":"While this book has many great features, it is a product of its time. I like that in addition to the standard diagrams typical of this type of reference, it contains photographs detailing unique features, expressions and activities such as hands playing the violin and working with various tools. Unfortunately the photographic technology of the 1940's leaves much to be desired most of the photographs lack the quality and resolution to really be useful and many of the motion studies appear to be reproduced proof sheets rather than high quality detailed prints.Not a bad book, but I would probably look for a second hand volume rather than buying it new."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Source!","review":"This book is a very excellent source for any kind of artist who wants to learn anatomy. It starts at the basics (bone structure/skeleton) and works up through muscle and outer anatomy like skin. Although there are no words accompanying the sketches and diagrams - aside from captions - they are very clear and easy to comprehend. However, most of the pictures are of developed, athelete's muscles instead of \\"average\\" or even \\"below average\\" muscle build. It also does not include diagrams (only photos) of younger human anatomy (i.e. teenagers and young adults). Overall, this book is very handy to have around, especially if you're starting to get serious about your art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"I've had this watch less than a month and it already quit working, I never had the chance to wear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"possibly my favorite record","review":"this is a gorgeous record...it's hard to believe i've owned it for 5 years because i still keep listening to it. i think the reason is the songs have a timeless quality to them--ignore what people say about a \\"sixties\\" influence, these songs could have been written in 1920 or last week, and it wouldn't matter. it's pop at its best, but there are elements of waltzes and quasi-jazz here as well. essentially, it's folk music as written by burt bachrach, or better yet, quit comparing them to others and just enjoy. this stuff is great. and your girlfriend will like it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"You get what you pay for I suppose.

I bought the album as a whim from reading an online review and it was really really good.

AIG provides the DVD as well as the MP3s for this 8-part series of PPT-assisted presentations, delivered somewhere in S. California. Of course, Ken Hamm always lives up to delivering the message. Snelling hammers out the geologic/antibiblical bias of conventional geology/theology with great fervor. David Menton's lectures (Menton is retired full professor from U. Washington Med. School) should be listened to by every high school teacher in the country, especially regarding Intelligent Design. His lecture on \\"ape man\\" will blow you away. I've listened to/watched these a number of times. To boot, they are all very entertaining as well. As a caveat, I highly recommend this series, despite the calvinistic allusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honey Crunchie Fabulous!","review":"This is a simple yet delicious candy bar.

I've not had any chemical processing in 5-6months and I refuse to cut off the relaxed part of my hair so I'm in need of a great product. I have a natural wavy hair pattern and I decided to purchase this product based on a friends review. The Ultra Rich Treatment smells wonderful and works wonders especially when used with the ultra rich shampoo. If you're spending this much on conditioner why not buy the shampoo! This doesn't weigh your hair down and when rinsed you can comb from root to tip without a snag..wet or dry! When my 2-3hr hair styling/wrapping process is complete, my hair is softer and truly manageable. Kerasilk is a great product when dealing with dry, frizzy when it rains, natural & processed hair. I HIGHLY recommend Ultra Rich Care Treatment and the shampoo. I've used Super Skinny by Paul Mitchell, Nexxus, and Organic Root and this by far tops them all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cranky makes me cranky","review":"My son, who just turned three, received this toy as a gift. It is impossible to put together, so he's constantly bugging me to do it for him. I struggle with this thing myself, and have to keep looking at the picture on the box in order to get it together correctly. It is especially difficult to get the top part of Cranky fitted onto the yellow revolving disc, and sometimes I just give up (to the sound of screaming and crying) because I am simply unable to get it to fit together. I'm obviously doing something wrong, since another review here says it's easy for a three-year-old to assemble! I much prefer regular Legos that kids can put together using imagination.

It is my every day carry knife, including two years in Afghanistan. The knife has excellent ergonomics, it fits my hand perfectly. Have never had it slip and the lock up has never failed.I really like the blade itself; it's got a great shape, penetrates well, and sharpens up nicely.This is a big, heavy folder; you will always know it's there, so if you don't like that feeling this is not the knife you want.Only one issue with the knife, and that is the blade finish. Like some of the other reviewers, I have had issues with rust. I had to carry the knife in my waistband under my shirt for a while. In less than a week there was significant rust on the blade, even with daily cleaning. I broke the knife down and cleaned it up, but that's not always practical.4.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Water based poly on the market!","review":"I have tried many other water based polyurethanes out there, but none other has the excellent coverage of ZAR.

Very wrong. This was the reason i bought it and am very disappointed. Do not buy unless you have a direct hook up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I've had this unit for a year and during that time, I've experienced the following:-Hissing no matter which FM station is chosen-Alert feature doesn't appear to work properly. Many times I am not alerted to the songs I have saved in my favorites. I'll turn the station and there's a song I have saved, but wasn't alerted.-The lighted display crapped out this weekend. It's dark.I am a Mom and don't ever remove this from my car. I rarely touch the unit and opt instead to use the remote. So the wear on it is minimal. It was a poor purchase at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works","review":"Very convenient to move this unit between the car and the boombox. However the FM modulator would not work at all in our new 4Runner, even with a simple antenna added to it. We use a cassette adapter -- it degrades the sound quality somewhat. If we had it installed again, we'd buy and install the adapter needed to connect the FM modulator output to our FM radio's antenna cable.The red display began to be intermittent before it was a year old, now it completely out (15 months old) and is going back to JVC. Hopefully they'll give us a refurbished unit in exchange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated design, better units available","review":"I purchased one of these when new back in 2004. The unit has worked ok for me, with the main quirk being about once every hour or two, I go through a 3 - 5 minute period of bad reception, presumably as it shifts from one satelite to another. I was unable to utilize the fm modulator as it was weak, but went to a hard wired connection to my radio using a cable purchased from Crutchfield.My main issue with this unit is that there are newer units available for the same or slightly more money, which have replay options and better displays. I would consider those options before purchasing this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Acquiring Signal\\" for eternity","review":"I purchased this receiver in December 2005. It worked like a champ until February 2006 when it began to have issues with decoding the satellite signal.The unit works for five minutes from cold start up, then the audio cuts out. Display still shows program info. Being an experienced PC user, I turned the unit off and back on, repeatedly. The message \\"Acquiring Signal\\" displays permanently, even though the Antenna Aiming screen shows full SAT and TER signal bars.My best guess is that a ROM or RAM chip cooked. This unit runs hot!

Couldn't be happier, and don't see myself listening to regular radio ever again. I didn't give it 5 stars for only 1 reason. The FM modulator is a bit dissapointing. I travel about 100 miles a day in my car and have to change the station I'm listening to the radio on at least once. While the JVC unit makes it pretty easy, it can be a little bit of a pain. Overall, the unit is great. I used to laugh at people having a remote control with their radios, now I see why they have them...just soo much easier to use.

The XM Roady 2 blows this unit out of the water. Immediately after getting JVC Sirius Satellite receiver it started to overheat and then shut down. It is very heavy in comparison making it more difficult to mount in a vehicle. It falls down from the weight. My XM Roady 2 is very light, never overheats and was easier to mount.I contacted JVC about the problem and they had me return the unit at my own expense weeks ago and have informed me since that they have accidentally sent the unit back to someone else who was having problems. I guess that means I'm just SOL. Luckily I have had my XM ROADY 2 for over a year and am thrilled with it.

I would liken it to the the Christian and Jewish Bibles and the Muslim Koran in that it claims that it is the truth in whole as set down by some higher power or other. Some time ago (I believe it was 1955) some people concocted an amusing story of man's evolution form various diffrent species that were all diffrent colors.

Immediately I felt the presence of God and began my dilligent search for more knowledge of God through the amazing insights of the Urantia book. If you have any doubts about this book or feel apprehensive to further examine the Urantia book based on other's dissaproving comments I encourage you to discover this on your own. The Urantia book was not intended to be held up as canon of scripture or to be venerated as past works of holy literature have. Rather it is something that the reader must discover with an open mind and heart. When all is said and done look at the fruits that will become manifest in your life when reading this book.

In truth, the freezing weather decimated the Chinese and, hence, probably saved the Marine and army divisions from being annihilated. Had the weather been good, there would have been no way that 30 thousand Marines and soldiers could have survived battle with 120 thousand Chinese.Aside from this, I found Brady's book to be rather sappy with its frequent and boring flashbacks to Capt. Verity's wife and daughter, and I found its end to be totally predictable from the outset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than gripping","review":"Initially, I was very interested in reading this book having read Breakout by Martin Russ, which I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend highly. It started off well, then Mr. Brady attempted to write words from the mouth of Captain Verity's 5-year-old daughter. My daughter is 6 and she never once spoke like Verity's little girl. Then again, my daughter doesn't have a French nanny like Tom Verity's does. Maybe little girls who do speak differently.I also wasn't quite sure what the flashbacks to his wife, and the privileged life they led prior to her death, had to do with the withdrawal from the Chosin Reservoir. If it was an attempt to get inside Tom Verity, to understand him, it failed to do that for me. I felt nothing for him and was not saddened by his death. He seemed to be an eyewitness looking at everything from afar. Even his understanding of Chinese wasn't much help to anyone.

Destroyed the fighting ability of two of the Chinese Armies, and came out with most of their equipment, their people and their dead. Faced with a winter campaign, a Supreme Commander who didn't believe his own intelligence service and outnumbered more than 10 to one, the two Marine Regiments came out victors.Brady doesn't dwell on the victories of the privates, corporals, sergeants, the junior officers who fought and froze with them.

If you deleted all of the flashbacks to the main character's dead wife, all of the letters he wrote to his three-year-old daughter, and just half of his life growing up in China, you might have a 150-page book. You'd have a short story if you deleted half of the holier-than-everyone-else Marine chest beating, e.g., the Marines were the only ones who knew that the Chinese were attacking in Korea, the Marines single-handedly won the Pacific Theatre of WWII, the Marines were the only troops fighting in Korea (everyone else was running), the Army staff were all idiots, the Marine staff were all brilliant leaders, and on and on, ad nauseam.

This book had about as much substance as the gossip columns he wrote for the newspaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very cold book","review":"The dust cover declaration that this book is the Korean War's Iliad is simply preposterous. It is, rather, a mundane, often boring, account of how frozen bodies are handled in a wartime setting. There was not a single surprise in the book. I have no idea what Verity, the protagonist, is like as a human. And bad enough that, of all names, Verity, was selected, but then to write an exposition of its possible Latin translation takes this book from Greek classics to the sunday comic strips. The repetition of whole paragraphs is an interesting and disconcerting ploy. I kept asking myself, didn't I already read this page?

I was left cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Felt The Cold","review":"I'm not a lover of war stories, perhaps because I fought in one and I find realism lacking in most writers. Brady has proved to be an exception. His depiction of the misery suffered by the Marines at the disaster that was the Chosen Reservior made me grateful that I spent a year in the infantry in the virtual paradise (by comparison) of Vietnam. You feel the cold as the Marines retreat from an untenable position, fighting a numerically superior Chinese army and becoming victims of Douglas MacArthur's meglamoniacal career plans. Brady gives MacArthur a justified raking over the coals and mixes his fictional characters with real ones; Chesty Puller is here as is Bob Hope and others. All in all a fantastic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good way to spend memorial day","review":"I read this book on Memorial Day.

I will try to read one of her other books before I pass final judgement on Spindler. It may just be I don't enjoy her style more than thinking she isn't a very good writer. Sorry Spindler, but I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"15 times","review":"15 Times--that's how many times the phrase \\"muttered an oath\\" was used in this book. I should learn not to read Amazon reviews BEFORE I read a book--that called my attention to that phrase, and I couldn't get it out of my head. I think I basically finished the book just because I wanted to see how many times that phrase was used, and in answer to Out Of My Mind's question--it was 15 times! I agree with the editing--the author needs new editors! I too could see where she was going with this, and who the killer was, early on, but there were a few twists that I didn't see. All in all it was an ok book--a quick summer read, but nothing more serious than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"This was an extremely disappointing read. The killer is glaringly obvious throughout the entire book, though the reasons for it were not (an interesting twist, but not enough to redeem the book).The book lacks color, despite its setting. The author uses the Big Easy stricly for locale and not for atmosphere, trying occasionally to throw in the word \\"cher\\" to make some of the characters sound Cajun.The language was juvenile and overused. I'm surprised no one else was bothered by how many time the author repeats the phrase \\"He muttered an oath.\\" It appears virtually everywhere, several times on consecutive pages, and shows a lack of imagination. I'm tempted to go back and reread the book to count how many times that particular phrase is used, but I'm really not motivated enough to try to read it again.Don't waste your time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bone Cold","review":"With phrases such as \\"damnation and blueberries\\" one has to wonder why this silly book got printed.

Her last efforts Cause of Alarm and this one Bone Cold did not live up to my expectations. This is a story of Anna. anna was kidnapped 23 years ago and the man that kidnapped her cut off her pinkie finger. She got away but has lived in fear since. Now 23 years later someone is out to get her. She believes it is the madman that had her so long ago. This story just does not make sense. You kind of figure out who the bad guy is but the writer is trying so hard to keep you guessing with too far out ideas. The positive the book is entertaining if you don't tear it apart like I just did. If you haven't read any Spindler books. I highly recommend Red and Shocking pink before you read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Bone Cold was a great book. It really kept my attention.

I recommend Bone Cold to anyone if they like thriller books or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"This book was a great read.

As anyone who has read the book will know, that little phrase comes up, Lord knows how many times throughout the story and it started to drive me crazy......... now with that off my chest....... bet you wouldn't think I liked the book?! It actually was a good story -- the style a bit amateurish at times -- but good nonetheless. Also, some of the story line is pretty far fetched which was another negative but overall, it kept my interest. It seems a few of you figured it out early on but it kept me guessing right up until the end. There are a lot of unexpected twists and turns but everything comes together and ties in neatly at the conclusion. If you like a psychological thriller, then I would suggest you give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant backup battery source","review":"We were on a 7 hour flight to Hawaii and needed to keep a 4 year old entertained.

There is a \\"Megrimum\\" at the top of the mountain. It is a very scary ledgend. The people of Instep are afraid of it. So Egan goes up to the top to slay the \\"Megrimum\\".

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept. also came up empty. So naturally it MUST be a dark conspiracy! Please. The contra leaders were adamant that their subordinates NOT raise money via illegal means. Besides, if the Contras HAD all of that drug money, they wouldn't have needed so much US funding. The cartels ended their association with contra armies by 1982.

I think this is the perfect place to point out the greed of the movie studios. Why else would they release a box set where 4 of the 5 titles were previous available? Also, see the new Mel Brooks box set. You will have to buy that just to get titles such as \\"High Anxiety\\" and \\"Silent Movie\\". How about the deluxe Scarface edition from a few years ago, that was the only way to get the original Scarface (1932) on DVD. There are many more examples. Don't get me started on the habit or releasing special editions only months after the first edition came out. Enough is enough!I don't agree that we have to rate the movies (of course they are 5 star films), I can go to Maltin, or elsewhere, for reviews.

Romantic comedy isn't a genre to which I'm normally attracted, but the classic ones of the late '30s and the '40s are a spectacular exception... and this is one of the best.

Let's be frank, the studios suck and will continue to suck. Corporate greed is behind (1)releasing multiple editions of the same disc, (2)shady box set deals, (3)rushed editions of movies using bad prints and poor transfers (anybody remember the Bergman box set fiasco, or the appalling prints used for Ray's Apu trilogy?).It should also be noted that Holiday has been available as a single disc for quite a long time in the UK and other regions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holiday is and should be a stand alone film","review":"Holiday is my personal favorite of the four Grant/Hepburn movies.

It's interesting to note there are two items in this movie that were used one year later in the Grant-Hepburn film \\"Bringing Up Baby\\". The dog in \\"Awful Truth\\" is the same one in \\"Bringing Up Baby\\". In front of Cary Grant's future wife, Irene Dunne claims he has a drinking problem and calls him Jerry the Nipper.

It sits on our lawn and is beginning to lose its form, it looks like the sides are sagging down from the weight of the water. It is already August so I am hoping it will last until the end of the summer. But I am not sure it will. Worthless. Spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold air","review":"Pool has three rings to blow up plus the bottom, kind of a pain. The top ring held air for the first day and now won't hold air at all and we haven't been able to locate whear the leak is. Pool is also really small. Once inflated, does not measure to the size listed. Perhaps the size listed is the exterior walls, not interior making it kind of small even for a 3 year old.Good thing it was inexpensive, I will be replacing with something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I actually purchased this for an adult summer party.

I just finished this book and I can tell you that in my opinion this book is very poor and condensed version of \\"Applying UML and Patterns\\" by Craig Larman (which I just addore) and \\"Web Master in Nutshell\\" (which is pretty good and solid reference/introduction into web related technologies). If you read both these books don't spend your money on this one because you won't find anything new. Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful at all","review":"The book only covers an overview of modeling, the reference application covers only basic diagraming and looses too much time building diagrams that describe interaction between the web server and the page controller: Aspects already handled automatically by web servers which would be better to oversee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only some suggestions on how to model web elements.","review":"Simply stated, the author should *not* be talking about software development, but only introduce his notation and explain it. That's all. His coverage of use cases, OO analysis and design is useless, when not misleading.Leave it on the shelf. Is you need to develop web applications buy something related to the particular technology you are working with (e.g. servlet).For the UML, buy something serious...And, of course, Applying UML and Patterns, if you want a good introduction (and more) on OO Analysis/Design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for UML professionals (not enough meat)","review":"This book is not bad as books go. It is a good introduction for beginners but if you want to write real Web applications you will have to look somewhere else (at least this is what I would have to do) My main criticisms and suggestions for improvement are:1) better explanation of boundary, entity and control objects 2) nowhere is there a mention of statecharts (essential for this kind of application area?) 3) Using packages to suggest that they are the same as architecture is not 100% kosher in my opinion (see page 108) 4) There are other ways to define a logical model for applications than the usual layered model (see again pages 107-108). For example, the SELECT method uses service-based models that are more robust an closure to the real business model. The layers model will be difficult to scale and I am not sure if it is really robust as suggested in the book's cover.As a buyer, I got carried away by the words 'Web' and 'UML' in the book's title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much padding","review":"I bought this book looking for a common language for describing web project requirements and design that we could use for project specification and working with partners. I am an experienced Web Project Manager with a lite experience of UML in the past.The book assumes UML knowledge, but the first 150 pages are dedicated to explaining web technology to the reader. Not quite \\"The Internet for Dummies\\", but hardly critical content?When eventually the author gets into the meat of the Web Extension for UML, it's interesting, but he still spends a lot of time talking about thick-client applications, which really are the exception on public websites. There is one pretty extensive example based on ASP, complete with code. The WAE is useful, but of 300 pages, I found only about 50 useful. A lot of it has already been publisher by the Author on his own website."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be a white paper","review":"There is only enough subject in this book for a white paper. You have to read to page 150 to get to any actual UML.Sadly, the ideas in this book for using UML to build web applications are excellent.

The success rate for that is horrific. It does not seem to mater what your system is based on - AMD, Intel, VIA, etc. Your chances are about 50/50. Six other folks I work with have purchased this game. Only 2 got it to work right out of the box. Two others got it to work with a lot of sweat and tears and then to find it fail later in the game (audio looping problems). The remainder gave up and returned the game. I wish I would have done the same.Support for this game is slow in comming. EA hast left it to you to debug their software and find work arounds for the numerous problems.

It takes a few shots to kill soem Nazis, so that makes it realistic, and the AI (artificial intellegence) is nice, and the have soem really good guns. the scilenced pistol and the sniper rifle for one, and you can carry many weapons, overall, it is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but Moderate","review":"I have bought the game Mohaa(medal of honor allied assault) recently. it has great graphics and av images and the weapons are awsume. the reson i give it a 4 insted of a 5 is because when you play multiplayer it is sometimes hard to find a game in progress, unless you start your own. Another thing is the game lags sometimes if the sereves bad, or if you have a low connection. To get this game its best to have a cable connection. But what ever you got is fine.

After playing the single player demo, however, I must admit that my original assumptions were incorrect. Though I feel that the graphics still fall a little short of Wolfenstein, the more true-to-life style of gameplay more than makes up for it. Though not entirely realistic - i.e. being able to walk w/the scope enabled and carrying over 100 lbs of equipment/guns, but it's still all good... highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTENSE WAR","review":"I DOWNLOAD THE DEMO AND IT WAS FUN AND HARD EVEN IN THE EASY MODE I GOING TO BUY THE GAME SOON THIS MONTH AND PLAY IT ONLINE.I HAVE A E-MACHINE PROCESSER INTEL CELERON D 2.80GHZ 256MB ram AND A 64MB VIDEO CARD AND IT RUN GREAT EVEN ON MEDIUM SETTING BUT THE LOAD TIME WAS LONG BUT ONCE YOU GET INTO THE GAME IT WILL BE GREAT NO LAG AT ALL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 1 flaw","review":"Overall this is one of the best FPS I've ever played.

After playing the multiplayer demo and single player demo, I'd have to say this game has used the Quake 3 engine well. Return to Castle Wolfenstein has to be the biggest joke when it comes to reality for a World War II game, although I can see it being a fun game for some.The Medal of Honor demo immerses the player in the environment it creates with its beautiful shadow effects, terrain, ambient sounds, and clever AI. I was most impressed with the game and can't wait for it to come out.If you play the demo and want some closer to realistic battle damage, play it in hard mode.The reason I gave the game 4 stars is because I haven't playedthe full game, just that one level and the one multiplay map. From that, however, I can tell the game will not disaapoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Linear","review":"The games graphics are okay, though I don't usually like this graphics engine, it seems jerky to me, and I know I have the system requirements to handle. I think it handles physics poorly, it seems like you go from running to standing in one frame of video. Too much of this gives me video whiplash.The game play is tough, but it's straight linear action, and I found that dumb. When pinned down you can't move to flank, you can only crawl forward, so you wind up saving a lot. Plus enemies you can't see are nailing you, and some of that should go both ways. I can't see them, they can't see me.It's basically like battling your way down a hallway. I think the best games in the war genre are battlefield 1942 (worse graphics but cool teamplay especially online) and ghost recon.If ubisoft would make a world war two expansion pack or full version game off the ghost recon engine, it would smoke this weak effort from EA."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOHAA BEATS THEM ALL!","review":"Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault is a brilliant one person shooter set in World War II. The great graphics and cool sounds makes it feel as if you are actually there! The sudden explosions and ambushes will have you jumping out of your seat and breaking into a cold sweat. There are six real WWII guns to choose from with a pistol and some grenades on the side. The campaign is long and challenging featuring some real missions like the Normandy Invasion. Muliplayer online is fast and features 7 awesome maps and different playing modes like objective match, round-based match, survival, or team match to make the game more interesting (You cannot play online if you have a 56k modem it will not work).

Requires a very fast computer with atleast 256MB Ram, 700Mhz and a Very Very good Video card if you want to really experience the charm of the game.2. Different from the PS2 version. The PS2 Version is way better!!3. Moderate Graphics..Nothing Great!!Similar to the prior MOH games!4. No Blood and no Gore.

The historically accurate weapons, vehicles and scenarios all greatly contribute to its fantastic realism. The scenery is magnificent and well detailed and the people look great. Though this is an ultra-realistic game, there are some unrealistic shortcomings that detract from the gameplay. For example, there is no blood, enough said about that. Next the enemy AI is equivalent to that of a rock. Also, the effectiveness of weapons against yourself seem to be seriously downgraded in everything except for multiplayer. For example, i could stand on a grenade and lose only 20 health from its explosion, whereas in multiplayer, and in real life I would die. I hope there will be a patch that will increase the effectiveness of enemy firepower. But all-in-all this is the best game i have ever played. Ultra-realistic, right down to the sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medal of Honor : Allied Assault","review":"Medal of Honor : Allied Assault is a fps set in the real world during the second world war and you get to play an american soldier.

The d-day mission is one of the best levels ever in a fps, it makes you feel as if you are really there and it is quite disturbing, It alone is worth buying the whole game. Mohaa is built on the quake3 engine, I played it on the OpenGL video mode and it runs great. The graphics and sound are great but the main menu is badly designed and confusing.

Order of actions are also very restrictive. If you attack point A then point B, you will succeed, otherwise will fail but A and B are just the same. Some snipers just cannot be killed until they fired at least one shoot at you. The compass does not give you much clues of where to go as many times it points to a deadend.Finding the entrance of the next level is sometimes unreasonable. It is frustrating and time wasting. In one mission you cannot proceed until an enemy tank punches a hole on the wall so you can go through it to the next level.The design of the game is a straight line which you can only follow without deviation. However, the layout of this line is obscure. You have to 'die' many times to find it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great FPS game","review":"This game is an exellent first person shooter that is sure to impress and entertain you. MOHAA is very realistic and features missions in both Norway and North Africa, two theaters not commenly focused on in American schools. while it is disapointing that the game did not featur any American, Italian or Solviet troops. Overall the graphics and gameplay was exelent and can be run on an old computer(mine is 3 years old!). The one down side to this game was that it wasn't very open.

And when you clear the shingle, go to the bunker and camp out, if you try running back to the beach, and make it, you slowly die away..odd, I wasn't being shot.. And sometimes the realilty of it all doesn't sink in: Taking a submarine pen with at least 50+ men in it seems reasonable, IF THERE'S 25 OTHER MEN WITH YOU. Anyways, theres just a few other minor glitches and that's it.Bottom Line: Great Game, a little unrealistic, but fun.

Contrary to most reviews, the game runs beautifully on my PC and unlike Return to Castle Wolfenstein (which is an excellent game itself, don't get me wrong here) which is more like a supernatural FPS than a realsitic one.The way the guns fire, the way the Axis soldiers fall to the ground in pain, the way the camera shakes when hit, all these things come together to make an experience quite similar to the \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" motion picture, which wanted to transport us into the very heart of the horrors of WWII. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault did a great job in emulating that experience and transmorphing it into the Action/FPS genre of PC gaming.The key words here are realism, integrity, and quality. The game's quality and integrity enchance its realism, making this game, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, a classic, realistic FPS for the PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"This game was terrible.

Not only that but the game play is incredible. It may be difficult but it is realistic and fun. I personally enjoyed this much more than Castle Wolfenstein. The game has great sounds and music. The introduction music is great and so are the credits. I don't want to go full details on this game since it is a waste of time. But if you are willing to lose ... then this game is the choice you should make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacking a few elements","review":"First of all, the game is fun to play. It's fairly exciting and the array of environments cant be beat. Like others have said this game is comparable to RTC Wolfenstein, except with worse graphics. The biggest problem with the game is they try to make it as realistic as possible, but forgot that when a granade goes off between your legs, a body becomes \\"bodies\\". There is no blood, and a wounded person is only wounded for a few seconds. The editorial review pretty much says it all. If you want a more realistic feel go with Operation: Flashpoint, if you want a little more sci-fi and better graphics go with RTCWolfenstein. Overall this game is worth the money, but only if you have the ones i've already mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 1st Person Shooter... Lacking in Multiplayer","review":"It has been known since the game came out on the market that an upgrade patch is needed for the multiplayer. This game is immensely lag intensive. My neighbors and I have setup games over DSL and Cable connections, and always report that the game is jumpy, characters jump across the screen, or you find yourself running into a wall you just passed 10 seconds ago. And this is with a max of 90ms ping time.As well, with almost any game that comes out, there are a few who find ways to cheat. I bought the game the day it hit the shelf, and by the time I had gotten home, finished the Africa campaign and gotten online... some bozo was running around in invisible mode shooting everyone. Where is the fun and skill in that?The Single player missions are awesome, but if you're looking for an online medium, you may find MOHAA lacking"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing game","review":"This game allows you to relive one of the worst days in history: D-Day. Unlike most war games, this has great graphics and has amazing realism. This game is a must have for anyone who has watched \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".

The requirements are high; I'm running an Athlon 1.2 with 256 MB, 32 MB onboard video and i was locking up constantly, even with all settings at min and background programs shut down. I used the experience as convenient excuse to upgrade- put in nVidia GeForce3 Ti200 64MB and \\"voila\\", things smoothed out. There's problems EA must be aware of, (see the 'safe' mode for crashes).

I was shocked at the amount of detail, from the sounds of the MG-42s, grenades, screaming of commands, soldiers yelling for their buddies, or mostly for medics, the dying, the impacts of high velocity rounds against metal, and the surrealistic feel of a battlefield.

Robert Plamondon has put considerable effort into making this book readable and helpful, plus it's funny! He covers all the major parts of Role-Playing Games; creating and playing characters, creating a game world and Game-mastering, hosting a good game session, common pitfalls and how to avoid them, and even a section on painting miniatures for your tabletop battles. I admit that some of the material may be a bit dated now, since the book was written some 20 years ago. However, the core of the material is still valid today, and can be an outstanding guide for anyone trying to become a better RPG'er."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great","review":"I had this book about ten years ago, and it is superb. Not only the section on playing an RPG, but also the sections on world building and being the games master.The information is quite dated though, as another reviewer pointed out.

There's some hilariousbloopers too.The Corruptor is the story of a policeman's compromises and the rookie who is thrown into this situation.Spawn is an excellent live-action adaptation of the comic.

I thought this would be a nice way for them to learn Chinese culture. The story and the animation are so uninteresting, they will never watch it. I will never watch it. It's crap.By the way: make sure and check the description. That's right.

You probably will need to be educated about this stuff in the VERY near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"I love this book. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't finished it yet. It's one of those books that you can read over and over and learn new material each time. Matt Ridley's writing style is very easy to follow and he makes the discoveries of science compelling.

Great gift too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for thought","review":"With all the other reviews, you have the details. What I want to add is that -- regardless of whether you agree with the author's conclusions or perspective -- this book will make you ponder the world and its future.

What a mind boggling picture Matt Ridley paints of the human genome - its history and its almost predictable future. This book has the potential of changing the world by creating an understanding of genetic matters that the layman can (almost) fathom. Ridley notes that our bodies, just like the body politic, has no need for centralized control.Of particular interest to those of us who have followed the story of radiation hormesis (the beneficial effect of a toxin in low doses), his reporting of the increased production of the p53 protein when exposed to radiation or chemotherapy agents is pleasantly startling. At last, a preventative/cure for cancer is nearing as we learn to stimulate the body's defenses against rogue cells."},{"rating":"2","title":":) I","review":"I like the way it was written and is a good read.

My problem was with the author's analogies and metaphors. Clearly he's always preached to a captive audience. They are beyond quirky. He's English but that is no excuse. Any way the information about how genes work and mutate is good to know and here it is all in one place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genome, by Ridley","review":"This book is over-rated. The writing is not particulary lucid, and the grammar is often poor. Entirely too qualitative, as a rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always an exception...","review":"Sorry to be the voice of dissent here, but I didn't love it. Decently written, but a bit too simplified, even for the average reader. The major problem, though, is that it doesn't get to the POINT. This books plays up all the quirky little features of the genome--the gimmicks, the bells-and-whistles--but I feel it doesn't explain what the genome truly IS, its deepest meaning for our species and all of life on the planet. For that, try something like Dawkin's \\"The Selfish Gene\\" or Weiner's \\"Time, Love, Memory.\\" Both are written for a lay audience but get a far better grasp on the real truth in the genome."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book for people interested in medicine","review":"if you're interested in pursuing a medical career, or you simply happen to like medical sciences (especially genetics), this book is a great read. the author explains things in a way that you dont have to be a pro to understand, plus, his wit and eloquence make the book fun to read and interesting. i highly recomend this book to anyone...any age, girl or boy, whatever. this is one of those books which you can read several times, and learn something new each time you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing stuff!","review":"This is a very exciting account of the science leading to the human genome. The stories are colorfully relayed and relavence to disease is also made throughout. Of particular interest is the discussion of the Alzheimer disease gene on the chromosome numbered 19 as this disease runs in my family. The other genes leading to Alzheimer's are not discussed but were nicely described in a another great book that I read recently called \\"Decoding Darkness\\" (in fact Mr. Ridley also has a nice commentary on the back of this book). I should also say that \\"Genome\\"has also inspired me to read other books out there on the genome and especially disease causing genes. Highly reommended!Also recommended: \\"Decoding Darkness\\" by Tanzi and Parson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice story - emphasis on story","review":"Ridley is a good writer and it's a compelling read. However, his approach is far too similar to the approach taken by others who have a story to tell - and whose story trumps facts. And he is unabashed about this endeavor. He specifically states in the introduction that he took his ideas about human nature and then went looking for genes within each chromosome to support his story. Not exactly the ideal of the scientific method. But at least he's honest about it. Anyway, if you enjoy books like Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" in which nature is brought into conformity with the author's vision, you'll probably like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, bad cover.","review":"I am in the bioinformatics business, and I loved this book. It should be possible for someone to understand this subject even if they don't have a background in the biological sciences. It is much more fun if you have such a background though.The DNA double helix on the cover is twisted the wrong way. How many other errors of fact are there in the text?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good read, bad science","review":"My main objection to this book it that it is presented as a objective interpretation of scientific data. In the book, Ridley presents the all of his infomation within the very controversial theory of Evolutionary Biology. Whether you agree with this perspective or not, it is clear that there is considerable debate about it in the scientific community. His interpretation of these selective facts isn't really an attempt to bring the genetics to the reader, but rather to advance his point of view to the lay-public. It is very well written and you should read the book if you are interested. But you would be wise to balance his very slanted view with an equally compelling arguments from the otherside, courtesy of Richard Lewontin or Stephen Jay Gould."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors and errors","review":"The title is clever but incorrect.

If I could keep the knowledge gained from only ten books, this would be one of them. I learned far more than just human genetics. The obvious was covered, but by relating it to world history, behavior, psychology, anthropology and sociology, I have a far better understanding of the world and myself. The author's conversational and sometimes humorous approach made a difficult subject enjoyable while still highly informative. I did NOT find it \\"boring\\" or \\"self-serving\\" as some reviewers have suggesed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human Genome","review":"The author of this book did a great job of bring to light the location of some of our genes and its effects. He narrates the genes and its effects on Chromosome 1 through chromosome 22. The book is written by a journalist but he deserves the credit of helping lay people to understand the human genomic basics. I highly encourage students to learn what genes are located on each chromosome and its effects. But beware of the author's beliefs about his attempt to explain the human genome with macroevolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting... But not informative, believable, or reliable","review":"This documentary is about 10% about Kurt Cobain, 20% about the filmmakers belief that he was killed, and 70% about what a horrible person Courtney Love is (according to the filmmaker.) I learned nothing about Kurt Cobain. At all. It's anything but informative, very noticeably and heavily biased, and completely lacks reliability. Regardless of what I believe did or didn't happen to Kurt Cobain, this cannot legitimately be called a documentary. It's interesting... but completely all over the place, and it seems that a lot of it's contents could easily have been fabricated. Kurt's aunt Mari is the only person who actually had anything relevant and true to say about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Kurt Cobain Murdered? A Filmmaker Finds No Fire and Very Little Smoke","review":"In Kurt and Courtney, filmmaker British filmmaker Nick Broomfield investigates the persistent rumors that Courtney Love had Kurt Cobain murdered. There are a couple of good points in the film: viewers get to see the grungy world in which Kurt and Courtney lived and learn something about Courtney's twisted upbringing as the daughter of the Grateful Dead's one-time road manager. Unfortunately, there's nothing else here. Broomfield talks to seedy, down-and-outers who lie about how well they knew the couple. The film spins its wheels, going nowhere. Potential viewers can skip this one and lose very little."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't know what to think","review":"Pursuing a theory that Courtney Love murdered Kurt Cobain, this Brit filmmaker digs up some strange dudes like El Duce, who says he was offered $50k by Love to whack Cobain. The voice-over narration is a bit smarmy, and the manipulation through editing is obvious to anyone with a sophistication about journalism. I'm not sure if the theory is true, but Love was never charged. She is no longer much heard from, however. Given that she was due to be divorced and lose out on millions, it's possible she could have murdered Cobain. More likely is that she drove him to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludicrous evidence","review":"'Kurt and Courtney' is a documentary that tries to imply that Kurt Cobain, the lead singer and frontman of the grunge band Nirvana, might have been murdered rather than have committed suicide. It tires to suggest that Courtney Love, wife of Cobain, might have been somehow involved in the death. The evidence for this claim is so vague, illogical, and unfound that it makes the movie ludicrous. Some people will do anything to make a quick buck; that is why there is speculation behind Jim Morrison's death, Elvis, and many other famous people. Only for die-hard Nirvana fans, but even they might find the film to be rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journalistic piece that misses","review":"I watched this documentary with high expectations, and almost could not finish watching it as I was terribly disappointed with the volume of uncredible witnesses and undocumented facts.I could not help but to feel that Nick Broomfield was trying to make the viewer believe that he began his journalistic piece unbiased, and was only recounting the facts as they unfolded to him. The entire documentary felt contrived however. If he had included only credible witnesses to Kurt and Courtney's life together, the documentary would have been 30 minutes long. Perhaps it should have been only thirty minutes long.He never really goes into the facts of the suicide (murder?). I think a different director will one day put together a better documentary on this tragic event. Broomfield's misses."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste","review":"This is not a particularly interesting, logical or even memorable documentary, except perhaps to those who harbor some kind of obsession for long-dead Nirvana front-man Kurt Cobain and harbor some kind of resentment or anger toward his widow, Courtney Love. The film questions the validity of the finding for suicide in Cobain's case and whether or not Courtney Love bears some or all of the culpability in his death (whether by driving him to suicide or by other more sinister means). No conclusions real conclusions can be drawn from this film except perhaps to find out how not to make a documentary. When sources can be bought for a beer and evidence is shady to non-existent, why bothering questioning?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Monumental Bore","review":"Whether you like or dislike Kurt or Courtney, whether or not you believe any of the conspiracy theories put forth here, well... it doesn't really matter. The film is so severely weighted down by extreme drudgery that you no longer care by the time its over. A chore to sit through. I was hoping for a little Nirvana music if nothing else, but we don't even get that. The voiceover says that Courtney Love's lawyers wouldn't let him use any.

Who could blame Love for not wanting to participate in her own character assassination and the vampiric exploitation of Kurt's life at the hands of National Enquirer stalkerazzi?

How can I say this? Bloomfield himself doesn't believe the conspiracy theory. Even though he drudged up every person who ever stood in the grocery line with Courtney Love, he feels that there really is no substantial evidence against her. So that had nothing to do with the movie, you say. No, it has everything to do with it: this man is out to tar someone. So, when you watch it, keep that in mind.As for anything aside from the content and lack of convincing evidence: the audio can be bad at times (I understand...it's guerilla documentaries, yeah) and the people he interviews seem drunk/high and lend zero creedence to the film.Watch it if you are a fan of Nirvana or Hole.

Hmmm..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love Courtney, Spare yourself and not watch","review":"Well, I love Nirvana and always loved Hole and, yes, Courtney Love. However, this documentary can make even a devoted Hole fan question Courtney's role in Kurt's death. I don't think she hired anyone and even the director himself said he didn't believe the conspiracy theories. Thus, the only motivation I can see is spite.

It tells almost nothing about Kurt, and bags on Courtney the whole time. The interviewer has to be the dumbest guy on the planet. He interviewed almost no one who actually knew Kurt, and when he did they were junkies. God knows what their motivations were (being in a movie? money?), or if they even knew Kurt at all. Courtney's father is in the film, and he is horrifying -- accuses of her murder and is obviously a loser riding on her fame. It made me love Courtney, feel bad for her, and miss Cobain. I am sick of everyone doing a Yoko Ono on her. Kurt obviously loved her, and the other pathetic people in this movie are plainly jealous.

He DOES give voice to those who claim she was behind his death, but HE DISPROVES THEM IN THE END. So what's the big upset? He basically slams the conspiracy theorists more than he slams Courtney Love. And I think he was right to point out her hypocrisy in garnering a \\"free speech\\" award while behind the scenes she's trying to repress any press she doesn't agree with. Hypocrisy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And I thought THE HOWLING was scary!...","review":"... Kurt Cobain was NOT Nirvana; he was a major part of it. This movie is NOT about Nirvana; it is about a major part of the life - and death - of Kurt Cobain. ...

The director never lets anyone finish their sentence and seems desperate to make his point.. They spend several minutes discussing how they're going to sneak up on Courtney Love during rehearsal, but right at the final moment the camera battery dies. Really? Come on. The final shot is an ultra zoomed in close up of Kurt deliberately trying to make him seem like some mysterious Sasquatch home video.

The serrated edge to slice the peel's skin doesn't work well unless you pull it down at a certain angle and with a certain amount of pressure. If you're not careful, you may slice your own finger.

I understand that he's in a hurry (she's married to one of his knights), but still... I just hope for both of them that no sensitive part of their anatomy got caught between 2 pieces of the articulated armor...Later in the movie, knights fight a tournament using a totally unpractal weapon (that never existed at ANY time...) that looks like a set of barbells with points...During the last battle, Mordred wears a golden (?) armor with a full mask... No comment...I'm all for some artistic license, but I draw the line at this utter lack of realism.

I myself would never buy it. When I first saw Excalibur back in the 80's, I thought it was rather boring. Today I don't think it is as much boring as it is dark and dull. The acting is pretty bad and any of the characters are likable. Arthur's voice annoys the heck out of me and the rest seem to be unhappy with their lives and always mad at each other. Merlin runs around and, like a broken record, does his magic with a single spell. Speciall effects are very poor, too. The scene where Uther, under Merlin's spell, rides his horse on the way to Tintagel Castle made me laugh. He looked like riding on one of those \\"quarter-horse-toys\\" that can be found in a shopping mall. I gave Excalibur two stars because it is overall \\"watchable\\" and it does have a few good scenes. However, I consider it as a one time event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Version of the Arthurian Legends","review":"I just adore this movie.First, its beautiful to watch. The costuming and scenery are simply breathtaking.Secondly, the music works so well with it. Music from Wagner's Ring Cycle, and Orff's (?) Carmina Burrana serve the story well.Third, it does a pretty good job of covering the entire Arthurian legend in just over a couple of hours.There are flaws: the armor, while beautiful, is ridiculously unrealistic; no one ever wore armor like that except for modern costume parties. And there are some very gory scenes.All in all, though, I give this my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LEGEND COMES ALIVE","review":"Director John Boorman's take on the Arthurian mythos is lifted from Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur.\\" At times Wagnerian in its big screen depiction, it is compelling, beautiful, moving and infuriating with its blunt, eye-popping theatrics. Helen Mirren is impossible to look away from as Morgana, but it is Nicole Williamson's ominous, sardonic and weird wizard Merlin that jumpstarts every scene he's in. Through Williamson's powerful performance, we see beyond his character and instead focus on the dark magic that manipulates destinies.

I thought it was laughable and ridiculously bad then. I just watched it again on Amazon (for free, thank god); and it is every bit as bad as I remembered. It boggles my mind that anyone could say anything remotely positive about this atrocity. The acting is horrid; the script is idiotic, the cinematography is overwrought, the fight scenes would make the Keystone Kops meet the Three Stooges look sublime in comparison. The armor - don't get me started on the armor. Even the use of Wagner and Carl Orff provokes fits of giggles.

Shades of Shakespeare's Richard III), Gawain taking up Guenivere's cause when Lancelot is late for the duel, the last meeting of Arthur and Guenivere (It is a dream, I have), Lancelot coming in at the critical moment in the last battle (It is the OLD wound, my King). So many.What I really like is the constant use of green light in the movie. Watch closely -- it is EVERYWHERE reflected on on the armor. I think it is meant not as a reflection of the green grass and terrain, but as a symbol of the hope inherent in the legend.

It has an incredible cast and the chosen musical score is superb, including Carmina Burana and excerpts of the funeral march from Die Valkyre by Wagner (it has the best use of Carmina Burana I've yet seen (the Doors is a close second)).

By that token, do not expect non stop battle sequences, one dimensional acting and obviously fake computer cg graphics.

How disappointed I was with it. Even with extensive knowledge of King Arthur, I found the story line hard to follow! It appeared that the 'actors' were reading from cue cards, the 'acting' itself was fragmented, and the entire story disjointed. I kept waiting for the story to become more interesting, and at several points I was tempted to turn the movie off. I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone who has a love of King Arthur. If this is your first movie of that genre, don't bother - you won't even understand the lore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie added to my collection","review":"I purchased this movie along with the Mists of Avalon.

Woe is me!Authority forgets a dying king,Laid widow'd of the power in his eyeThat bowed the will.

Desires can either enslave us or liberate us. That is the human experience and many times we fail, but redemption is always in our grasp. Later in the movie with the charge, the trees were blossoming, the music by Carl Orff was heroic, it was almost too much. We frail humans are so capable of triumph over the tempting tranquility of defeat. A well done film.

BUT if you hate to read and hate reading Shakespeare even more, this is in the end the best movie portrayal of the King Arthur story ever done. It is easy to follow and comprehend. I wish they would redo it in the same fashion and extend it like they did the lord of the rings. This version has a slight feeling of rushing through the story in order to get it out in one movie.

This one followed the basic story we all know; one good thing I can say about it is that it didn't have any of those stupid twists that ruin a good fairy tale.But this movie has less than good acting (besides Patrick Stewart, of course), directing, and special effects. It didn't portray the characters well at all.Next it's definitely R rated (in nowadays's standards), though it could have easily been modified/cut to be available to more audiences.And there isn't much humor. I remember only one part I enjoyed, and that part was only about 5 minutes. The rest of the humor had not much basis.To top it off it's very long - I have no problem with long movies, but to have to endure a long movie that is as bad as this is more than I can handle.I do not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic","review":"The best portrayal, the most lush and, dare I say it?, erotic, of the Arthurian Legend ever to grace film. Director John Boorman managed to squeeze into this film powerful levels of *sparks* (provided by Merlin and Morgana), lust (courtesy of Gueneviere and Lancelot), betrayal (kudos to Mordred) and loyalty to duty (Arthur), all incredibly blended with a score to die for. I have seen this probably 40 times and every time I find some nuance I hadn't detected before. A guy movie. A girl movie. You get the picture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair movie, great DVD","review":"I must say from the outset that \\"Excalibur\\" has never been one of my favourite movies. Though the visuals are undoubtedly spectacular, they are not enough, in my opinion, to offset the clunking script and Nigel Terry's lack of charisma in the lead role. Also, after \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" it's difficult to take any film about King Arthur seriously. That said, this DVD is still well worth owning. Sound and picture quality are both superb and it almost felt like I was viewing it for the first time. Best of all, however, is John Boorman's leisurely commentary. He obviously still holds the film close to his heart and his discussion of it's prolonged gestation is both candid and illuminating."},{"rating":"1","title":"It'll do...","review":"I'm a big fan of the Arthurian Legends and this movie hurts me deep down.I kept thinking this would be a great movie and my mythology teacher even praised it before letting the class watch most of it but guess what folks?It seems my mythology teacher is just stupid!!!The people in my class were either making fun of the movie,sleeping or doing their homework because the movie seemed so lame.I tried to watch it but the facts weren't 100% correct as I was expecting,the actors were terrible and don't get me starting on the \\"dazzling effects and time\\" that they put into this movie.If you're bored one day then I dare you to try and watch this movie,otherwise forget it.The only good part of this movie was the character Morganna or Morgan le Fay as we normally call her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain","review":"A swift massacre of beauty's rooting, one hour into Painbath, one's eyes will become one with the Not.Soon, you realize, each swordthrust has been born in your artery, bleeding the only dependance.It's value attempts a visual supplement, but its own mockery is not even traced sufficiently for the overseeing mythlover.I'm not sure where these other reviewers find home, but clearly there a cry is not equivalent to a leavedrop, nor a tree ancestor to Language.Clearly there Myrddin is crossed in agony, not even sufficiently graphed in pain, supplanted by a garish screen.Meanwhile, Brythonic tree roots still utter words, though muffled and misunderstood."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films I have ever seen","review":"Some years ago I got dragged to see this movie.

However, beautiful scenery and excellent camera work can't negate a clumsy story treatment (granted Le morte d'Arthur is a rich work that is difficult to translate onto the screen, but perhaps an extra half hour to an hour wouldn't have hurt).Nigel Terry turns in a dismal performance. He seems horribly out of his depth through the entire picture except, perhaps, at the very end when Arthur dies; it's at this point he gives the character a maturity and dignity that is lacking in the adult Arthur throughout most of the film. Nicol Williamson looks like he's filling a contractual obligation and seems to play Merlin for laughs. The rest of the actors go about their parts in a pained, self-conscious fashion with embarrassing results.Buy Le morte d'Arthur (from Amazon, of course, if available) and read the legend, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"The movie is dated, shown it's age. Can't watch because of the acting, the way that they speak, everything's just outdated"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie!","review":"This is the best movie ever, Having the unedited movie that is not seen on tv is one of the guilty pleasures. True classic movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excalibur","review":"The movie is a little complicated at times, partly because so many of the knights are dressed exactly a like, making it difficult to know which character is which!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep your sweetie close at the end of this one!","review":"Saw this movie in the theatre with my mom and my sister when it first came out. Wow the intimate scenes sure inspired mom and my sister! I've been watching the findal season of Merlin (Bummer) and thought about this movie and wanted to add it to my library. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"King Arthur tales with a smile","review":"An excellent interpritation of the King Arthur tales. It is not very consistent with the book, but still makes for a highly intriguing plot and interesting movie. It is full of humor, with Merlin being the main \\"funny character\\", performing some standard comedy-style acts, such as falling into water, hitting his head, etc... That definetely does not make it a comedy because all those things blend in very well with the general flow of the motion picture, raising the general mood, but never over-playing.The presence of such actors as Liam Neeson and Patrick Stewart as secondary characters is surprising, but their excellent acting only makes the film better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Once and Future King..., but it will do","review":"This movie does not follow the original telling of the King Arthur legend very well, but, it is one of the most visually stunning movies since Blade Runner, and the music (by Wagner) is wonderful. If you enjoy fantasy or romance then this movie is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Save the King","review":"What can I say but a wonderful movie....costumes and locations were most beautiful.

Pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE SWORD AND SORCERY EPIC","review":"This is sword and sorcery at it's finest.I have used this movie to exsplain my love of fantasy role-playing games and Wagner.If you have surround sound on your tv,then crank this up!,for Wagner should be played loud enough to wake the dead.The story of arthur,merlin,lancelot and guenivere should be familiar to everyone above age 3 so spread some culture today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best King Arthur Movie...Ever","review":"This movie is the closest thing you will find to the story of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, and the Holy Grail. This movie is full of love, magic, and medieval warfare, all of which make an excellent Arthur movie. Especially the medieval warefare. I recommend this movie for any King Arthur or medieval movie fan. This is the best I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourite films ever","review":"You probably know the story of King Arthur & the Round Table already. So...Though I've read a lot of movie reviews that pick upon this film, I love the themes it portrays - especially the flawed hero. Even King Arthur has his faults.I've loved this film from the moment I saw it on the big screen.Filmed in Ireland it is a wonderful visual feast accompanied by a great score. John Boorman's use of classical pieces, such as Carmina Burana would make you think that they were written especially for this film (as in John Boorman's earlier work - Zardoz).It features many faces then not well known; Patrick Stewart, Liam Neeson, Helen Mirren, and Gabriel Byrne, as well as lessor known stars Nigel Terry & Cherrie Lunghi as the king & queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you with us or against us?........AGAINST YOU!!!!","review":"Me and my best friend Steven rented this movie for a sleepover. We were interested in the title \\"Excalibur\\" because in school you have to do a unit on \\"Medieval Times\\" and that day we had just read a story on King Arthur. Me and Steven both enjoyed this movie which is funny in some parts and very bloody in some parts as well. We highly recommend this movie. As it is a very good story and has a never-stopping- action plot. In every scene you are glued to your seat. If you are interseted in King Arthur, Merlin, or the knights of the round table this is the movie for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXQUISITE RETELLING OF L'MORTE D' ARTHUR","review":"Boorman's masterful revamp of the Arthurian legend is a lush visual, and audio treat that is every bit as stunning as when I first saw it on the big screen in the early 1980's. The cast is superb, and whether or not you're seduced by the idiosyncratic peculiarities of Nicol Williamson's memorable Merlin, Helen Mirren's calculating Morgana, or Nigel Terry's quietly, forceful Arthur or, indeed, simply want to hear one of the best cinematic meldings of Wagner's incredible music ever, you owe it to yourself to experience this hypnotically, beautiful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy, Drama, Unsurpassed","review":"Along with other great fantasy films (Clash of the Titans, etc) Excalibur is a visually stunning and well-acted film that is sure to capture fans and non-fans alike. Boorman directs a sublime retelling of Thomas Malory's age-old epic of King Arthur and his knights, Camelot, and the corruption of the Round Table, the final conflict with Mordred and Arthur's glorious death. This version is at once colorful, seductive, and sweeping. For some younger viewers, be aware of some nudity, sex and violence. The music, taken from excerpts of Wagner's incredbile Ring of the Nibelung opera i.e. Siegfried's Funeral March, Prelude to Tristan and Isolde, and Carl Orff's incredible chorus piece \\"O Fortuna\\", it is wonderful music appropriate to the tale of passion, darkness, magic and drama. You will find no other film version nearly as enticing as Excalibur. For hard-core fans, read Malory's Morte D'athur and White's \\"The Once and Future King.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring failure","review":"I just saw this movie in its entirety for the first time and I have to say that it is one of the worst that I've ever seen. I don't see how other reviewers can say that the acting, music, and directing were done well. The voices sound dubbed, the music is heard only a couple times throughout the whole movie, and the scenes are very sloppy as you are never quite sure what is actually going on. Merlin's character is a teeter totter. Sometimes he's weak and stupid, sometimes he's strong and wise. If I was directing this movie I wouldn't focus on one character and then abandon him while trying to involve other characters. As for the special effects, they are terrible even for 1981. I spent most of this movie bored and confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most BORING movies I have ever seen!","review":"I finally gave in and purchased this DVD based on the high reviews I have heard from people over the years. I couldn't have been more disappointed! What in the world were they thinking?? I found the movie miscast, poorly acted, poorly scripted, visually dark and dull, and (as is typical for the most boring of movies) painfully long! Save yourself some money by renting or borrowing this movie before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Move","review":"We tried watching this for an hour and gave up. The acting is horrible. It was like a junior high school play with people hollering at each other. I'll never understand how this thing got such high ratings. Save your money; it isn't worth 5 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh brother...","review":"My husband and I had seen this in the theatre when it was first released. We remembered it as \\"really good\\"...Well apparently tastes change. After 17 years (and one Lord of the Rings Trilogy!) this one makes you laugh or cringe-depending on the scene. The only good part was Sir Percival throwing the sword back to the Lady of the Lake at the end. Thr rest was a lot of clanking, hoof beats, yelling (was everyone deaf?) and hacking. Just plain dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blu-Ray transfer is superior to the DVD","review":"I put on the DVD of Excalibur for the first time with my HD TV and was surprised at the poor transfer, I had watched before, I knew it wasn't good, on a large HD TV it's unacceptable. The Blu-Ray is not perfect but the transfer is much improved. For $10 it's a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I really enjoyed watching this movie. I first saw it at the theatre. It was 1980. I watched Excalibur and Star Wars on the same night. I really thought they both had a lot in common. I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes King Arthur movies. Well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"Excalibur is one of those films you can't miss. I've seen it more than 20 times, it's simply brilliant. It's an epic of great proportions. Everything is well chosen, from the actors to the scenery, from the story to the rythm. This film is plain perfect, the best convertion of the Arthur legend to the big screen. I have a good knowledge of the Arthurian legend, and I know that this film is not based on the most realistic facts known in history, in fact is based in a famous novel of the romantic era, but, I must ask, wasn't that same romantic era that made Arthur and Excalibur immortal? Yes, this is a romantic era film, and it's done perfectly. Also, the soundtrack is very well choosen, from Carmina Burana, to Wagner, It was this film who influenced me to like classical music, specially Wagner. Today I still cry alone when I'm hearing the song from Persifal and at the same time remember the great sorrow of Arthur. Find now the secret of the Grail, who does it serve?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it or hate it","review":"Based on reading the reviews, you either love this movie or you hate it. In my case, it was the latter.The cliche-filled dialogue was shallow and pathetic. The characters were predictable in their blind devotion to the king. The special effects were horrible. All of this would not matter if the fundamental story were interesting, but even this lacked anything that could hold my interest for a long 2 hours. (Somehow my wife and I suffered through this to the end, only to be disappointed by a silly climax.)I am tempted to give it 0 stars, if that were possible. Instead I will give it 1 star. Half a star for a couple interesting fight scenes (other fight scenes were unrealistic) and half a star for trying to be different."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk! (Save the mosic)","review":"When I was little, I heard the classic tune \\"O fortuna\\" for the first time as a sound track of this movie. Finally, yesterday, I had a chance to watch the movie itself. I started with great expectation only to be deeply disappointed. Not consistent, no climax, no character development...just storytelling. Battle scene was disappointing too. Generallly just handful of soilders fight. Even I saw one of a sword simple bent (but the knight 'stabbed' by the bent sword was killed!). Duel scenes look ridiculous. Nudity made me doubt the whole movie. IMHO, it seems to be a cheesy one. Just very long movie without any fun or merit. One star is due to Patrick Stewart of Startrek fame. Excalibur is not worth my 2.5 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have no idea why this film has such a good reputation...","review":"because I really didn't think it was good at all. First of all, it's boring. The first time I tried to watch it, I feel asleep. Second of all, I wasn't impressed at all by the acting. the only character I thought was believable was Merlin--and admittedly the Merlin of EXCALIBUR is one of my favorite portrayals of him--but his scenes with Morgana were just ridiculous. I didn't care for the fantasy land she trapped him in at all. And, speaking or Morgana, I know this is trite, but she is just not convincing with blond hair! Plus, she was too much like a dominatrix or something in this film. I know she's supposed to be evil, but she was pretty anachronistic in this portrayal. Overall I'd say, if you want a good film portrayal of the Arthurian legends, your best bet is the Mists of Avalon, the TNT miniseries."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a winner but passable","review":"This is a decent B movie. Interesting because of some of the early roles of some now-famous people - Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart,Helen Mirren, etc. The acting was pretty bad across the board. Storyline was OK, but how could that be screwed up? Interesting because this King Arthur seemed to be a weasely guy with few redeeming qualities. A lot of clanking armor plate without any reality of what wearing armor does to weigh down the body. Knights going about the countryside in armor without anyone to help them get the armor off or to get it back on."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sent me a copy that would not play!!","review":"Love this movie!But the copy I got would not play in my DVD player!Thanks for nothin\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on my dvd player","review":"Okay..I have never claimed to be the brightest star in the sky!

This is totally my own fault but don't want others to do the same 15.00 mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tempest in Teapot Armor","review":"Hamy, melodramatic, gratuitously violent, plotless, self-indulgent, historically ridiculous, and over long. I've tried to watch this teapot boiler once every decade and it still remains a crushing bore. If there had been advanced video games in the early 80's it should have been one. Cannot fathom what fans see in this thing other than middle earth fever for anything, and I mean anything, that smacks of sword and sorcery.

It is also interesting to see all the superstars that were just getting their start in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DVD WINNER!","review":"I had recalled this movie to be the best King Arthur film in the genre. Amazon had it at 11.99 for the pre-order dvd so I took a chance and I'm glad I did. Excellent action and filmed quite beautifully. The feature where John Boorman's commentary runs through the film makes it seem like he's in your living room telling you why he used a specific type of lighting and for which type of effect. Boorman's commentary adds so much and illuminates the amount of thought that went into the making of the film. I knew this was an excellent film, but on Dvd you get your money's worth easily. Great music, filming, art direction, action, and 3 great- looking women! You'll enjoy it! Boorman is a real artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used DVD: a great risk!","review":"Had to return this DVD since it was not playing on my HD DVD + XBox player. Companies should test every and all used DVDs prior to mailing them to customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Reignites a classic","review":"I loved this movie on its release almost 20 years ago...i have had it on VHS for years and watched it often. Now released on DVD, with the addition of a remastered soundtrack...Dolby Digital 5.1... and superb picture transfer quality..this film takes on new dimensions..although being an Arthurian purist I still cant forgive some glaring omissions, such as the Black Knight and of course Sir Galahad...the character of Sir Percival has to carry the bulk of the hasty conclusion to the film.The photography is stunning, the acting patchy: although Gabriel Byrne in an early career role is good...but the film belongs to Nicol Williamson as Merlin....it is one of cinema's finest performances from this rarely seen actor. I watched this DVD on a Toshiba SD9000 DVD PLAYER ....IT IS A REGION 4 PAL Version disc... I use a Yamaha RX-V995.Audio Video Receiver... and Aaron Main and surround speakers and sub woofer...

They actually released two versions at the same time, a R version and PG version. My mom was one of those mothers who really didn't mind her child seeing violence or nudity; therefore, we saw the R version. I had never seen a rated R movie before. As the movie began, there were people being hacked to death. I was even feeling a bit queasy as Uther made love to the woman he lusted for. It was so uncomfortable sitting there with my mom while these scenes were playing. But the movie has never left my mind and heart. It has been my #1 favorite film of all time. It just has this energy and emotion to it that you rarely ever get out of a book or film. If you liked Braveheart, then you will love Excalibur. It is a movie that will never get old. It was shot in a way that it will never depreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick-ass-movie, it is a got-to-see-it.","review":"Well this weekend, I saw the movie for the first time.

It is based on Sir Thomas Malory's, \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" and retains all of the archetypal, allegorical elements---The Sword of Power---Excalibur, The Lady Of The Lake, The Fisher King motif, the Grail Quest, etc.---of the myth. Nicol Williamson is a delight as Merlin and Helen Mirren is an appropriately seductive, but deadly, Morgana. In addition to remaining faithful to Malory, the film is just beautiful to look at---gorgeously filmed by Cinematographer Alex Thomson. Liam Neeson makes his screen debut and it's Patrick Stewart's 3rd film"},{"rating":"2","title":"realism and magic seamlessly blended","review":"Excalibur weaves a dark and mystical vision of magic through a grimly realistic story of medieval war.

It follows Cohen though his daily life, as he speaks to everyday people on the street and crowds of fans in auditoriums, and feels strangely like a propaganda film at times.The \\"selected discography\\" on the DVD is suprisingly useless and doesn't bother to list most of his albums.All in all, an interesting look at Cohen in his spry younger years.

The game is NOT worth the price (money) because after a few hours of watching little sim people play on your course, you get a little bored. If you are not a fan of golf I do not recomend this game for you. If you are a fan of golf, you will probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"How long will it be enjoyable???","review":"Yes, I played the demo as well and I thought it was great. However, I cannot really see what will make the full version so much better. Yes, you can build more holes, houses,.. but I am not really sure how long all of this is going to be interesting. Will there be scenarios like in Rollercoaster tycoon ???I also found the management part to be a joke compared to other Sim games.I also seem to be the only one who is not really that interested what all the people are talking all the time...Don't get me wrong, I still think it is a great game, I am just not sure if in the end it won't turn out to be one of these games that you play non-stop for 3 days, but then never touch again because you have seen everything there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself (and your computer) the grief...","review":"The demo for this game {if one could call it that) was on the Sims Hot Date, or some expansion for the Sims. It seemed pretty fun, and since they restricted you to 3 courses, I really wanted to know what it was like to build a big golf resort. And so, I got caught in the trap. I went out and bought Sim Golf... The worst waste of money in my life. I quickly became bored with the different buildings (there are so few!), and although the course building tool was kind of interesting, it was far from addicting...The actual golfing aspect of the game required no skill, and the houses you build for celebrities are a plain waste of time...It is a plain waste of time, money, and of course, megabytes. I can't wait 'till the Sims Superstar comes out...Don't make the same mistake I did, and get a better game. This is just a plain disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"its the best golf simulation yet","review":"sid meiers sim golf is worth every penny of the price ... easily the best game this season the only problem is i dont know how to save mt game.p.s. no one has payed me to say this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok...","review":"didnt come with a serial key but was in good condition and runs properly. looks origional but because of a non origional serial key i do question it authenticity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!

Tech support still hasnt' solved the problem. Just a heads up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ol' Sid","review":"I gave the game 4 stars becuase its fun, entertaining, challenging and becuase i like golf. The graphics aren't stellar, but they do the job. The sim golfers have terrible vocabulary, but it doesn't detract from the game really. The test of time is the main question. I found that I got bored quickly with one particular golf course and constantly restarted, but maybe that's just me. This game still respectively gets a 4 star due to the many hours I still spend playing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light game. OK, lets play a round.","review":"The fun of this game is that you can make something from zero into a full bloom golf courses, and at the same time observe the little golfers shout and murmur in your ground. Infact I indeed spent a lot of time wandering on this game!! Moreover, you can play downloaded courses of other designers.However the consistent sound effect and the never-change picture soonly make this game boring, and the lack of strategy makes the game a bit shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rapid loss of interest","review":"Do yourself a favor and pass on this game.

It showed the relation of church and state and how both used each other for gain. It also showed how one person no matter age or station or sex can make a difference in the path of history. It also showed how the rise of nationalism set the stage for the reformation.It held the attention of the audiance both young and old and raised the questions that we wanted emphasized. Over all it was both good for entertainment value as well as the use which I made of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is very interesting.","review":"The acting is very good.

Plays very fast and loose with the facts and all the actors chew the scenery.The character of Joan is totally out of place, like she was picked up off some college campus and dropped 600 years in the past, or like Buffy Saves France.A real waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAaaahhhhh","review":"The worst Crusader movie ever made. Yikes. LeeLee Sobieski's screaming, invincibility was not only not believable, but downright silly. She is beaten, shot w/ arrows and thrown from turrets yet she screams on.

But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys! Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!? Never!Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird. Avoid this film today, folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This mini-series on Joan of Arc is inspiring and well-done.","review":"THIS MOVIE HAS EVERYTHING!!!!! Untouched by the relentless star dust of Hollywood, \\"Joan of Arc\\" captures France during the 1400s impeccably. The acting is superb and the story follows the facts of history. It is truly one of my favorite films, and Joan of Arc is now my heroine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie!","review":"I love this movie so much. I watched it in seventh grade for my Social Studies class. My friends and I enjoyed it so much. We were all crying at the end when they burned her at the stake. Even the guys in our class seemed moved by it. The only complaints I have heard about the movie was that they didn't like how Joan acted, and they thought that she made bad decisions. Well I have news for you. The movie is a true story, they can't change the way she acted. I thought Leelee Sobeski did an awesome job. All in all, I loved this movie. It is my favorite movie of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better have a dozen boxes of tissue when you watch this.....","review":"This is the best movie I have seen in a long time.

Historical description of Joan D'arc are quite precise on this particular point : Joan was an exalted and fanatical women not the pleasant and delicate women that this movie wants us to believe. From this point, I can only say that the Messenger from Besson remains far ahead of this movie not only because it is more accurate but also because of the superb acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged version","review":"This movie was only 90 minutes long. Many scenes missing. Purchased to use in classroom setting. Now I have to search for the real thing. Students very dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performance","review":"I have watched this movie over 20 times on DVD, since i recollect watching the movie aired on AXN over a decade ago.The story may not be extremely accurate, but the performances of Joan (Leelee Sobieski) and Bishop Cauchon (Peter O'Toole) stand out completely - seems they have lived the character and not performed the act of playing the character. Almost a 3hour run movie, it keeps you glued to your couch. I would rate this movie even better than the Mila Jovovich version of Messenger: Joan of Arc."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good, the bad, but nothing ugly","review":"This is one of the better Joan of Arc movies. Yeah, Leelee does look the part, but, at times, her acting is flat, at other times, really good. The historical inaccuracies are bothersome: Baudricourt's hens did not stop laying eggs until he gave Joan a letter of introduction; Joan did not willingly let herself ride off with the Burgundians; Bishop Cauchon was not at Chinon, Joan never returned home after she met Baudricourt, and there are others. I felt the best actor was Peter Strauss, followed closely by O'Toole. Yes, it's worth seeing again. However, to know more about what really happened, one should not get their history homework from movies. Start reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie!","review":"I was completely moved by this movie. I had known very little about Joan of Arc and this helped so much! The scenes were so realistic and Leelee Sobieski was wonderful! I was inspired by this true story and cried throughout the film. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Joan of Arc (1999) Sobieski","review":"Visually this movie is pleasing; it is also a respectful handling of the subject. Historically and in other details, it is woefully inaccurate. For the \\"real deal\\" read the transcripts of her trials, which are available in their entirety, or Mark Twain's \\"Joan of Arc\\" for a condensed, but wholly accurate shorter version.

Yeah right, it took more than a few days to convince.I like the other Joan of Arc movie much better which is titled as \\"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"I had to stop watching this film after about 20 minutes because the acting was so horrible.

No superlatives are really necessary when describing these masters and sadly most are now gone. My only problems with this DVD release are that all of the music performed on that great evening is not presented here and that the tape pitch wavers a great deal. Most noticeably on Bags feature of Lover Man. It also saps the power and impact of John Lewis beautiful touch on the piano. In addition the audio and video are out of sync in several spots. I very much recommend this DVD due to the fact that you have Diz, Max, Bags and John Lewis on the same stage. Hopefully some day soon this will re-released with the care and content which it deserves. All in all there is much great music and humor here which simply exuded from the great John Birks \\"Dizzy\\" Gillespie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diz...","review":"Dizzy's dream band boasted some of the most prolific musicians in the industry at that time. Milt Jackson, John Faddis and Max Roach are smoking... The sound quality and image are fair compared to some of the newer DVD jazz releases, however not bad at all for the era it was originally recorded. Dizzy's vibe shines through with unique interviews and mini-jam sessions offering insight to the rhythm behind jazz and his Afro-Caribbean feel.The next best thing to this album is his soon to be released \\"United Nations Orchestra\\" which hosts such Latin/Brazilian musicians as: Giovanni Hidalgo, Flora Purim, Airto, Paquito DiRiviera, and the incredible Arturo Sandoval."},{"rating":"2","title":"More more more","review":"The DVD is way too short.

Legendary Myrna Loy is in the movie and looks very much like her younger self. She aged well. We can talk about the movie but the real reason that we buy this movie is because we want to see sexy Suzanne Somers naked, by at least tv standards, covered with ants. Suzanne rivals Janet Leigh in \\"Psycho\\" as the beautiful blonde, whose life is cut short in the first half. This will be a classic. Buy and enjoy. Also, Suzanne, if you read this, please take a break from health books and selling your customized items as a product line. We miss you as an actress.

There is no substance to the book aside from the widely advertised \\"how far away is the horizon?\\" question. (The answer is: square root of altitude in feet times 1.23 equals distance to horizon in miles). That's it, the rest is padding and pure pap. There are also several blatant errors in the text.

I am a big fan of Berman's writing and thought \\"Secrets of the Night Sky\\" was an excellent book - \\"Cosmic Adventure\\" is also a fun and enlightening read, but is less about astronomy and more philosphical in nature than \\"Secrets.\\" But it's still very worthwhile - Berman manages to make you see the extraordinary in the commonplace, like the chapter on water's unique physical properties.

Another great cloudy-night read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic read!

Richard Matheson has forgotten how to write anything but dialogue and minimal descriptions of what is going on. This is not good writing. This book is very short and very simplistic. Coming from someone who has produced some amazing books in the past, it leaves me wondering what happened?The overall story could have been great, but no time was taken to develop it. It could have been expanded a lot to make it much more interesting. The parts that were supposed to be scary were not built into at all, leaving absolutely no feeling of suspense or tension whatsoever.The only way that this book was even worth the time was because it took less than two hours to read...and about that long to write from the looks of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rest on your laurels...","review":"Weak, uninteresting suspense novella that reads more like a long, corny treatment for an episode of NIGHT GALLERY.

Didn't have time to listen to Hopper's commentary (other than a few minutes), but am taping it now and will check it out later. Great package!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up","review":"Came fast and was as advertised. It was for my wife for her birthday and she loves it. I would def recommend this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"The movie is obviously worth 5 stars any day, but I am biased because I love it. A star, almost two, were deducted because Amazon's streaming is not up to par with Netflix or even YouTube (but there are no ads! but that should be expected as a consumer...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow-moving and boring","review":"Easy Rider's reputation as a classic doesn't resonate with me. Simply put, the film is boring. Most of it is little more than endless shots of the cast riding their motorcyles, and equally endless scenics rolling by. There isn't much dialogue, and each scene is very disconnected from the next. We get hardly any sense of who the characters are and why they are acting the way they are. Different themes in the film - freedom, prejudice, community, and hypocrisy - are tossed around aimlessly, with no sense of cohesion, making the viewer wonder just what the film's point is (when he isn't yawning). A classic it may be to some viewers, but to this one it is just a giant snooze."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Overated Film in History","review":"I first saw this film when it was released in 1969 and thought the critics of the day had gone collectively mad. Everyone in the entire film, whether it's \\"heroes\\" Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper or their antagonists, are annoying. Jack Nicholson is the only one that attempts to create a character out of his role. There is no story and theneverending vignettes are pointless and/or pretentious. The script, if there was one, consists of Dennis Hopper saying \\"man\\" every fifteen seconds.This film was dated when it was released. Today, it's laughable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haiku review: trippy and hippy, but definitely essential viewing -- captures the late '60s American mood like no other film","review":"American dreamsDrugs, cash, girls -- an endless highwayIt's true, we blew it"},{"rating":"2","title":"great price","review":"cant wait to give it for a gift to a special friend who loves riding. great prices, shape and received fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I got this item because I loved the movie.

Is about this two homeless rebel riders that travel around USA to meet people and getting \\"high\\" with them.There isn't to much naughty words but the drug use is FREQUENTLY and the 60's soundtrack like hard rock and country music is also frequently. This movie can be known as a hippie movie than a motorcycle movie.The bad things were: NO action, NO high speed and a uncool ending.P.S: If you are a 60's fan then you should also buy Midnight Cowboy and the Woodstock concert so you can have three movies including this one that represent it's time in a very COOL way!ADIOS."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive 60's counterculture movie","review":"This movie is not dated, it is a brilliant relic of it's era that should never be looked down upon. It remains an honest retrospective of the way many people viewed the hippies at that time. The campfire scenes and of course the scene with Jack Nicholson on the motorcycle with \\"Born To Be Wild\\" in the background are some of the cinema's greatest moments. The acid trip scene towards the end has been lately looked down upon, but it is truly imaginative and a great example of some of the greatest psychedelic cinemotography. Every film enthusiast should own this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still The Best","review":"Still one of the best \\"buddy\\"/\\"anti-establishment\\" movies of all time.

To me this is American Cinema at its finest.If you like stories about freedom this is for you. To paraphrase Jack Nicholson 'Lots of people like to talk about freedom but they don't want anybody living it'. Its a sometimes surreal adventure, but it makes its points well.The wide screen version enhances the, already superb, cinematography.I give this film my highest recomendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"true to the time!!!","review":"I was 17, living in East Texas (about 50 miles from Louisiana) when Easy Rider came out. The South was an angry place during 1967-1971. That anger was mostly used to strike at the different and extreme... the different and extreme according to low to mid class whites. The movie reveals a great friendship between two, then three, traveling partners. Their friendship wasn't any different or perverse than those of people in the states through which they traveled. However, the prejudice that lived among the angry, older generation of the southern states proved to be unaccepting, even violent.Though made with little money, the way it's shot, and the characters it produces makes Easy Rider a great classic movie.I recommend you buy it. If you don't understand it the first time, watch it again. You will come to agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated garbage","review":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen.

The American Film Institute includes this bomb in its list of 100 greatest American films, so I thought I'd check it out. This film is so bad that I can't even think of four other films to insult by including them in the same list. Sad to say, but by the end of the film, I was actually rooting for the rednecks--and wasn't disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"painfully hilarious 60's drivel","review":"I watched this the second time in film class in 1970 with a professor who claimed to have watched it 40+ times, teasing out the deeper nuances. That seemed excessive even given the zeitgeist of the times. Watching it once would be excessive now but for the insight it gives into the completely vacuous values of the 60's. Some aspects of the 60's have held up well (Jimi Hendrix still sounds great), but this movie isn't one of them. If you can listen to Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper babble with the other stoners on the commune about doing your own thing in your own time without bursting out laughing, you need more drugs. I would give this one star but for the fact that the music is pretty good, it helped launch Jack Nicholson, and Fonda has gone on to do some very good movies and Hopper some great ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Rider","review":"I bought it because my brother was coming to visit and it was a big hit when we were kids.

It has one thing to say, that could be said in about 10 minutes, but it spreads the \\"message\\" out over way too long. The ending is truly shocking, and somewhat redeems the tedium of the earlier parts of the film that tend to drag, drag, drag.

Great music adds just the right touch to this excellent film."},{"rating":"2","title":"You had to be there","review":"Its no use trying to explain the value of this movie to people who werent alive at that time. No need to defend it, either. Young people of any generation usually think they know everything anyway, so why bother. But there was a time before the internet and cell phones, and easy rider is a strong youth statement from such a time. The movie making itself might seem dated, but the impulse behind this film is real in a way that 10 Fast and Furious sequels cant match. And this movie will always be a snapshot of rebellion; from the real life pot smoking done on camera throughout the movie, to an acid tripping Peter Fonda hating his mother out loud in the graveyard sequence (his real mother took her own life when he was a boy.) Theres plenty to be critical about in easy rider from a technical standpoint, but as a low budget attempt at capturing a larger cultural mood of rebellion at that moment, it does quite well. You had to be there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding ! The Road Movie that you will never forget !","review":"How to make a movie with almost no money ? Watch Easy Rider ! It's a terrific journey ! The story is simple but the actors (if they really are ;) are really fantastic. The Nicholson performance is unforgettable. EASY RIDER is a CULT movie and it still explains very well how the US society was in the 70's. Try to get the 30th anniversary remastered version including a very funny retrospective documentary to better understand the whole concept of Easy Rider.A once in a life !"},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED!","review":"Can somebody please explain to me how this awful movie became one of the signature movies of a generation? Did this movie come out during a lull in full-length film productions? Were there no other movies that had a decent story or camera work? The cameraman appears to have seveal seizures during the filming, and apparently, Dennis Hopper was too strung out on coke to realize this during the editing process. Also there appears to be a huge gap in the plot line--a lack of decent ideas and dialogue that doesn't make me laugh at it's pathetic attempt to be hip and/or serious. There are only two things good about this movie: the soundtrack and the fact that this movie propelled Jack Nickolson's career. Other than that, this movie should be burnt, or at least end up like the main characters do.Hippie Pete"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Rider","review":"I AM OVER 65 AND WHEN I GOT THE DVD I WAS A LITTLE BIT DISAPOINTED.

Do not be fooled, I love horses and horse books, it's just that this one, put quite simply, is one big yawn. It is often sold with a gold chain with the \\"Pie\\" on it. The chain isn't even worth the price: No matter how gentle you are with it, it will eventually break. Until the 15th chapter, there's no excitement, no cliffhangers...not even any tragedies for pete's sake! Just a bunch of silly nonsense and 'classic' dumb 'english' language. It's VERY confusing and hard to understand. I mean, I don't mind some good old-style language, but for heaven's sake! I may sound like an overly critical old-style book hater, but I'm not.

At the finish of THE START I rushed out to purchase volume 2, THE NIGHTMARE YEARS, but could only find volume 3, A NATIVE'S RETURN.

Jordan goes into exhaustive detail on the setting from here on out, instead of leaving something to the reader's imagination. \\"The Dragon Reborn\\" follows the standard elements of the hero-tale, true, but it's none the worse for that -- the Wheel of Time is an epic, and is plotted and characterized as such.Jordan is especially skillful in drawing upon elements of Arthurian and similar legend in this installment, with his own highly entertaining interpretation of the Sword in the Stone.

O, and that prose! How many people are \\"stone-faced\\"? How many times are woman going to \\"fold their arms under their breasts\\"? Why is everyone so sexist?

However, I'm still not entirely sold on the idea of certain plot devices which allow us to glimpse the future - 'the world of dreams', Min's visions and certain ter'angreal - because they give the impression that the character's choices will ultimately turn out 'alright' in the end (a sense of destiny). There's nothing really wrong with that, in fact it adds an epic quality to the situation, but it does tend to lessen the drama. Still, it's not enough to significantly detract from the quality of the characters and storyline, which have now become so unique and familiar that you genuinely care what happens to them.

This is not a failing of the novel or it's writer, on the contrary, it's what makes the novel brilliant. This is the first time Jordan really showcases his talent for narrative. In 'The Dragon Reborn' you have an entire story that is titled for, and written about, a character that grows and develops mostly off screen, leaving us to fill in the blanks of the dark paths tread, and trials endured by Rand al'Thor. His journey takes him from a mostly naive caricature of a farm boy to a very real adult character who may be slipping into madness. That said, the book still fails to grow its on screen characters. Some may say Mat evolves, but we've never had chapters written from his point of view until now, so I don't know if this counts.Book 4 is where the series begins to excel."},{"rating":"2","title":"It keeps getting better","review":"This book is excellent. it builds so many characters, almost none of them more important than the next.

It begins to explain the complex plot which, up until this point, was still very hidden to the reader. It begins to reveal an enemy which had barely shown its true face to this point and finally showed signs, however random throughout the book, of action.Again, in my opinion, the sections of the female characters are horribly boring but the ending is amazing just like all the others of the series.All in all the novel is a good read and worth the time it takes to read the hundreds of pages within it"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST OF THE SERIES SO FAR!","review":"In the previous 2 books, RJ concentrated on the story more than the charactors. In the Dragon Reborn, The charactors come to life in an exciting and rich enviroment of treachery and surprises. This is the book that sets the standard for the rest of the series.

Most of the novel was about the other two ta'veren and not Rand, not even 50 pages were dedicated to The Dragon Reborn and half the time he thought he had already gone mad. The introduction of Faile was excellent and her being a woman made it better, I was hoping her jokes and wise cracks would make up for Mats lost time. All in all this was a good book and still worthy to be in the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"The Dragon Reborn is as good book as any other in this wonderful set. I'd probably read it again immediately if there wasn't so many sequels to this book to take a look.One of the best things in Dragon Reborn is Rand's still continuing insanity.

Rand's insanity's only getting worse as the saga continues.Believe it or not, here in cold Finland there are lots of people who read these books. I even know personally over half a dozen Jordan fans living here, so Wheel of Time really must be something special.Do thee a favor and get this book, or start reading the WOT from the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I read the Eye of the World and the Great hunt and I figured this would be as good...but oh my god was I wrong. After reading the entire book, who can tell me what actually develops? NOTHING! There was no point to this book. I could've skipped the entire thing and just gone on to the next one, because nothing important happens except that Rand gets Callandor, which has never even been mentioned before this book. And how the hell does Rand even find out about Callandor? Nothing is explained in this book, and its just terrible. I expected more out of Jordan, and this book has just killed my interest in Wheel of Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Another amazing part of one of the best series I have read. Focus is away from Rand and you get to know the rest of the crew!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fantasy","review":"Like the first two of the series, in this third volume, Jordan's character development and his development of the fantasy characteristics of his world entice us with tidbits of power that the characters and ourselves can only wait to find out. Again, this is a VERY enjoyable volume, with the suggestion that if not, you read \\"The Eye of the World\\" and \\"The Great Hunt\\" before this one.If, somehow, after reading the first two volumes, you are not completely hooked by this one, then all I can say is: escape now while you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"So. The big bad Ba'alzamon is just a servant of the REAL bad guy! This just keeps getting bigger and better.

Stop reading here.","review":"If you value your time and your money, I'd recommend you to stop reading this series at this point. The Wheel of Time was intended to be a trilogy, and the authors' decision of making it twelve books instead has certainly proved the be the downfall of this series. So why don't we read it as a trilogy? The end (no spoilers) leaves a lot of questions unanswered; however, it ends close to as it should have ended on the first place. Heed my advice, oh readers who have reached this far, for if you don't, you'll find yourself pretty soon damning the time you decided to continue reading this series after reading this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheres the Dragon???","review":"This is the third book in the Wheel of Time series. Jordan applies the same formula which he had used in the previous 2 books. The story keeps dragging on than suddenly in the last few pages, some action happens.I still dont know how the strongest fort of the world, the Stone of Tear, which cannot be break by any Army, is very easily taken by Rand and Co and some Aeil. The Dark one as usually visits Rand dreams, proposing Rand to join him and Rand rejects him.I'm mostly annoyed with the female characters who are always rude and full of ego's.Dont expect much with this book and the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is where I get off!","review":"After just finishing The Dragon Reborn, I've decided to abandon this dreadful and apparently endless series. I am truly amazed at the rabid devotion of Jordan fans to The Wheel Of Time. Obviously a great number of people are mistaking quantity for quality. Comparisons to Tolkein, Shakespeare and FAULKNER are totally laughable. Jordan is a patently formuliac writer milking a profitable series for all it is worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"The entire series is one big boring RPG","review":"I read the first one and was interested. I read the second and I started to bore. I barely could get through the third. 500 pages of wandering around the same cities over and over again. The plot is so telegraphed from the first page to the last. I was not surprised once. Everything is so damn predictable. The entire series is one large and boring role playing game. Characters level up and gather new tools. Every book has a leader boss to beat at the end and guess what after that book you have 11 more hero bosses to kill until the final level. I wonder what will happen then. This whole story could be fit into 3 or 4 books and they would probably have been awesome. Instead we have like 14 books. Are you kidding me. I am getting off this hamster wheel. RIP Wheel of Time series."},{"rating":"1","title":"the last readable of the whole serie","review":"after this one, from the 4th ... it is just not worth the time.But even this one gegins to slow down.pages and pages of nothing, should have skipped 300 pages and jump straight to the end..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Jordan you have outdone ourself again!","review":"I love these books! im already done through Fires of heaven but i still go back to reread them. In this book they dont say much about Rand (The Dragon Reborn for all those who dont know). Though he leaves Rand out till the end this is still a very exciting book. In this book rand proclaims himself as The dragon reborn and sets off to stop his dreams from being troubled by fulfilling prophesy. Mat, who was plagued by the Shador Logath dagger is finally healed from its terrible curse. We also learn a bit more about Aiel (though you learn alot more about them in the Shadow Rising). All in all this is a great book and Mr. Jordan did an outstanding job on this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely good - but not as good as tGH","review":"This book was very good and features one of my favorite fight sequences between Matt, Galad, and Gawyn. Personally, that scene alone is worth reading this book. Like the title says, it is not as good as \\"the Great Hunt\\", but I also enjoyed it more than \\"Eye of the World.\\"The characters develop a lot more in this book. Throughout this book you can definately see how the saying \\"the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills\\" holds true in the world.This book is one of the shorter novels in the series thus far and is not a difficult read. It is interesting and entertaining - and of course, necessary for the future books.My friends and I are avid WoT fans and often determine that book three is one of the best, but not the best book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the first three","review":"I welcomed the change of emphasis in this third book. I was glad to follow Perrin and Matt and learn more of them. Each of the three major characters is fascinating and this third book does reward the reader for following through the first two books. The manipulations of the Aes Sedai do become more complex, and the conflicts between the ajahs are well developed.I might groan a bit at the thought of seven more novels published with the promise, or is it a threat, of at least two more to come. However, so far, so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really I rate it at 4 and 1/2 stars","review":"There are only 2 things that bug me so far about this series. I can skip whole books and still get the story. I read this one before I read The Great Hunt (book 2). And the second thing is that THEY ARE TOO GOOD!!! I have so much trouble putting the books down to do other things that I'm supposed to be doing! These are really good stories and I'm glad that I finally decided to try reading them even though I don't normally read this kind of SciFi/Fantasy. Only if you have a lot of time to commit to reading should you dive into this series! Because you won't want to stop reading them until the end of the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good end to the first trilogy of WOT","review":"Dragon Reborn really marks the end of the first phase of Wheel of Time, where the main characters were truly in adventure mode the entire time. Although I was disappointed with Rand's infrequent appearances, the other character viewpoints are fun and fast paced...all centered on Rand beginning to meet his destiny. Not quite as strong as the first two books, but still a solid read."},{"rating":"2","title":"another good installment","review":"rand's insanity is becoming more prevelant...some interesting plot developments and character creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"very compelling read yet dies in places.","review":"I believe this is one of the most intense books i have ever read to date yet, the author leaves alot to the readers imagination so as to give a sence of control. There is unfortunately too many places where the story leaves you thinking this has absolutely no relevence, but i have yet to find an author who can sustain the complete attention span of any reader when tranversing so many different topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far my all-time favorite of the series","review":"This book is the best of the series. Or at least I thought so. It had some really cool scences in it. I had a really hard time putting this one down. I loved every minute of this book. And was just enthralled by the characters and the way they were developing throughout it. The best book in the Wheel of Time Series to date"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dramatic, but sounding finished","review":"This was overall an excellent book to read. I was horrified to see that the title of the book was Dragon Reborn, but in reality it had very little of Rand in it. And from the looks of it, I thought that Rand had already gone mad from the tainted One Source. I also thought that expanding on Perrin was a good idea, since you don't really know about him, except for the fact that he is a Wolfbrother. I really enjoyed seeing Perrin come to terms (kind of) with his abilities. My only problem was the fact the title did little to show what the book was about. Rand played a very small part in the plot. it also sounded like the series was finishing up, and I really didn'y like the way it ended. I mean, god, you'd think Rand would become another Kinslayer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"definately read it if you liked the first 2 books","review":"Though the story did not progress nearly as fast in The Dragon Reborn as it did in The Eye of the World or The Great Hunt, I have to say that this was a fast and enjoyable read as there was lots of great character development. If you enjoyed the first two books, this one will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I consider The Dragon Reborn to be one of the best books in the series. In this book, Robert Jordan really pushes the plot forward, new and interesting characters step up, old characters reach new heights of development, and the plot reads like a great thriller, weaving new threads in the pattern. The sad fact is, after the next book in the series -- The Shadow Rising -- the Wheel of Time starts to take a major downward spiral into mediocre plots (if you can call them plots), no character development, and a backstory that has become so convoluted that you almost want to give up. Enjoy the first four books in this series, because the good is few and far between from that point foward."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dragon Reborn ( The Wheel of Time)","review":"This book is an excellent set up for the next book in the series. It holds your interest and keeps you wanting to find out what happens next. I would strongly reccommend this to anyone who has a love of fantasy and action."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dragon Reborn","review":"Rand Al'Thor is the Dragon Reborn, destined to defeat the Dark One and give his life to save the world while he destroys it in his madness.He sets off alone, searching for his own identity in hopes of proving what he is to himself. He searches for Callandor, the Sword That Is Not a Sword, the Sword That Cannot Be Touched. No hand but the true Dragon Reborn can break its wards and draw it.But, as with everything, it is not that simple. There is always a challenge and it is a battle to the finish that threatens to send him over the edge of sanity.Robert Jordan continues his tale with the third installment of The Wheel of Time, better still than the Great Hunt.With four dimensional characters, a vivid vision and the most complicated plot of any story, Jordan transcends the fantastic, discovering a tale truer than any text book, a story for all stories, a legend for all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"Jordan has reached the peak of the story in this one, it starts out fast and keeps going about the same pace, but you can tell that the story will be slowing soon, but it's still is a wonderful read the characters are gaining more and more personality, and they seem like they could be real people, you find yourself wondering if this whole ordeal couldn't have really happened in some point in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depth not quite realised","review":"The depth of the first two books in the 'wheel of time series' is not as apparent in this, the third book in the WOT series, yet it still is a facinating read with the characteristic dark Jordan underflow. The Dragon Reborn continues a series reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings but which manages to escape the trap so many fantasy writers have fallen into. The characters are dealt with in depth, and a strong storyline will ensure that the next book in the series will soon be yours...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mat, Perrin and \\"The Girls\\" Do Their Thing Well","review":"Just finished it last night. This is an exemplary book. It's filled with action, development of the several characters' personal relationships and qualities, and humor. In \\"Dragon Reborn\\" Rand takes off on his own not only to meet what appears to be his destiny - drawing Callandor and thus demonstrating he is the Dragon Reborn - but also to lead enemies away from his friends. Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Nynaeve and Elayne are caught up in the swirls of fate or chance, and are propelled toward Tear, too. They participate in terrific action as they all encounter minions of the Dark One. Mat stands out as he shows how brave, resourceful and downright funny he is. The \\"girls\\" and Perrin also show that they are courageous and steadfast, and Nynaeve and Egwene begin to strongly develop their skills or talents. Perrin is falling in love!? This is fun reading. Get it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not the best of the series.","review":"Jordan's Wheel of Time is a great series, but the third book is quite a change from the first two. The main character, Rand, barely plays a part until the last few pages. This book focuses on three female characters, with plenty of male-bashing and travel descriptions thrown in. The two secondary characters, Mat and Perrin, also have big roles, fortunately--Mat was my favorite character in this book. I do enjoy the general writing style--including the detailed descriptions of people, places, and even horses--but more focus on Rand and less focus on male-bashing would have brought this book up to the standards of the first two. On to Shadow Rising..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the lot","review":"I've read all of the Wheel of Time books so far, and The Dragon Reborn is by far the worst of the lot. The story is boring, and all too similar to the first two (main characters are seperated, have to make their own ways to Wherever City). Really only the very beginning and the very end make this book enjoyable. The sad part is, if you're a Wheel of Time fan...you have to read it. Otherwise you can't read the rest of the books...But don't worry. The Shadow Rising, the next in the series, is one of the best books ever written by any author; it's faster-paced, has more action, more...storyline, more EVERYTHING. Almost as though RJ new he had to apologize for this waste of a gazillion words..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where oh where has our hero gone?","review":"So Rand is the Dragon Reborn, and this is the title of this book, but he nearly completely disappears from our story? Again, another 700 page book needing a serious editor to cut it in half. And for people who supposedly love each other, it's amazing how shabbily the characters can treat each other. Too many characters to focus well on any single story, it's easy to forget what's going on or what has previously happened. As I've said before: these books need a good synopsis and Glossary. All that said, when there is action, it is good rousing action with world-shaking possibilities. But still not a Tolkein."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be good at one fourth the size","review":"I love long books, but this one has far too many pages for its plot. While wading through endless pages of tedious description, I had the distinct impression he was being paid by the word.The first book was ok. The second was not really ok. This one was pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This is the worst book in the series I have ever read! I had never read a book as boring as this! Even a text book is better! I was really satisfied with the first two books, but this one was just HORRIBLE! All the women are either beautiful or handsome! Aren't there any \\"ugly\\" people in Robert's stories! Its a good thing I didn't abandon the series afterwards becuase some parts are interesting after. I recommend that you skip this book becuase it is the most boring in the world and will only decrease your interest in reading the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"yyyyyyyyyyyyaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwn","review":"I've read this book before, in the early 80s. It was written by David Eddings and it was titled, \\"Pawn of Prophecy.\\" It featured the young farmer of unknown parentage who sees a mysterious shadowy cloaked figure trailing him at times--but it's always gone. It has a blacksmith of virtue and oh-so-practical values who doesn't like to hurt people or be called \\"Lord.\\" It has a mysterious dark-haired, beautiful sorceress who is very imperious, allows no nonsense, and can often be found brushing her hair before bed. It also has an old storyteller who has more skills and knowledge than others would believe--he's more than he appears. Oh, and there's a connection between the main characters and wolves. Jordan has ripped off most of these elements in this book but FAILS to cite his source, which to me makes this plagarism."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the series","review":"This is possibly the best book in the series to date.

They're all so much alike, I mix them up. They're all manipulative and astonishingly irrational And why are all the men so confused all the time about women?

Otherwise your birds end up with no food and you have many fat squirrels running around. This book gives you ways to handle this situation whether you mind the squirrels, or just want them to be in their own area.It rates various feeders, complete with photos, showing you the drawbacks and benefits of each one.

Typically, one of those passages is reproduced in the study guide. Discussion questions are included at the end of each section.

To those who are not interested in this stuff, he proposes a study of \\"causes and effects\\" in human affairs.This book was written more than 100 years ago, and some things seem to be irrelevant in our modern world.

Well, to tell you the truth the game play is not bad at all, with the exceptions of the conerbacks AI, which is a annoying flaw sometimes. But usually everything runs really smoothly and you really feel like you are playing a real football game. And as for the graphics, if they were any better the players would have to be real, live pictures of players moving across the screen. Everyone is very realistic, it is probabally the best graphics I have ever seen in a computer game. All and all it is the best football game on the market and well worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad!!!","review":"I've been playing the Madden NFL series for a long time and the 2002 version is significantly better than the 2001 version. The improved graphics and gameplay (A.I is smarter now) makes it fun and challenging. The scoreboards in the stadium now reflect actually time left in quarter, the actual score and other stats of the down.What was disappointing was the fact that they used very much the same sound bites from the 2001 version so the color commentary is boring to someone who has played previous versions. Sometimes the color commentary makes no sense whatsover.Overall, a good upgrade but beware of the system requirements. You need RAM and a good graphics card loaded with RAM as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madden 2002 PC version is a sight to behold.","review":"Just for coming so very close to the Playstation 2 version, I give this game a 5-Star rating.Just a caution, this game requires a 600MHz Processor and a 32MB video card with 3D capabilities.

The Players are not accurate in their ratings. I have Dave Moore as TE and he drops almost Every pass that goes to him, even when wide open! I'm tired of Madden and Summerall making comments on that (He just dropped the ball...) The defense is way bad, especially the cornerbacks. I like to play as a linebacker and the defensive backs keep giving up the big play. Not realistic at all. Too bad, I like Madden 2000, but not this one.

The computer will always end up winning any game you play. I have started several different Franchises, but have only won 1 game! One example: I was ahead by 1 point with about 50 seconds left, and 6 of my men missed a 80 yard for touchdown RB screen pass.The CPU will NEVER run a balanced offense, if they are ahead by 21 points with 20 minutes left, they will still throw on every down! Expect about 400+ yards passing every game for the CPU. MOST frustrating...9 drops in 1 quarter??? 50% of the time a reciever will drop the ball when he gets hit. The graphics are AMAZING, but a SOMEWHAT REALISTIC game is more important to me. Hopefully Madden 2003 will have a better CPU offense and better human controlled defense."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay...if you just play exhibition games","review":"The commentary is the same stock audio that they have been using for the last 2+ years.

I have always considered myself an excellent evaluator of on field talent and have enjoyed the free agent, trade, and draft systems of the previous football games I've purchased...Madden 2002 is woefully lacking in these areas.

I like season mode better than single game and season mode provides interesting play, player progression, and management. However, the pass defense for human controlled teams is bad and unrealistic. The human rushing game is quite effective yet the cpu rushing game is nonexistant. This provides skewed statistics. Overall, the game is fun to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"This game has wonderful graphics. The franchise mode is also very good. I like the way players can get better or worse in their ratings at the end of the season. But, their are some aspects of the game that do need help. The game can get boring only after playing about 2 or 3 games. The annoucers are lame, and don't even know what ther are talking about. Also, the gamplay is slow. Madden is very realistic but needs to add some arcade style in it. That is about the only problem. It is fun to go chat with other people in the online lobby and play them. But, while playing another person online the game goes very slow with many bumps and does not work well. Plaus, the update option allows your rosters to be up to date and that can help you. You will not want to buy the new version just because of the old rosters. I rate this game a 2 1/2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Very Disappointing.

The excellent cast (except Charlie Sheen) was outstanding. But the performance by Emilio Estevez was one step higher. His portrayal as \\"Billy the Kid\\" was phenomenal.

The mechanic never gets anything done, because he knows that even eating a peach can disturb the universe.That is the situation out of which Alan Rudolph makes an immensely clever, funny, thoght-provoking and touching film.

And more than once, I found myself wondering what the heck was going on. Maybe I just didn't get the message that Boorman was trying to convey,or maybe there wasn't one.

I liked it but it left me somewhat baffled. After seeing it again it makes more sense...I think. I believe director-writer John Boorman is trying to say is that death is necessary to pertuate life. Alot like what \\"The Lion King\\" said but in a more askewed way. Whatever! These kind of film's were in vogue in the late Sixties-Early Seventies in the wake of Kubrick's \\"2001-A Space Odyssey\\". Lot's of ambiguity that either leaves the audience angered or worshipping Zardoz. Question. Did Quentin Tarantino get the inspiration for Zed from this movie. You know, \\"Zed's dead baby.

Sean Connery is a fine actor with a fine body, past and even in 2009. 1974 when this film was released was in the time of self serving ideologies. This film is the epitome of this but with visual reminiscent of he Trip (another equally bad film).The actual special effects were interesting, carnival-like and keeps you involved in the film, though the substance does not. I understand Boormen films are much better now a days.It never really pulls it together outside of defining the essence of why God and man constantly are redefined through the life of an individual. In 2009, nothing here has not been better explored by other venues.Beelzebub is more relevant than knowledge is itself. Mr. Connery's next film with Mariam in the title is far better as a firm.But for the collector it is a must have!Borish spin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourite films","review":"I love this film, as well as John Boorman's later work \\"Excalibur\\" - though they are two completely different films.Zardoz features some post-hippy post-apocalyptic visions of the future. I love the themes in this - a select few harbouring all that's good in society; art, poetry, science, and yet they are monsters.\\"He who fights a dragon long enough soon becomes one himself\\" - not the most typical Sean Connery line, but this is such a way-out film anyway.But then again, my brother-in-law watched this & he couldn't help snigger at the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vurry strangge.","review":"When half the reviewers praise it with 5 stars and the other half pan it with 1 star, that pretty well leaves it up to one's personal taste, doesn't it?

Of course, like all SciFi, there's a message, which in this case was melodramatic. Do we really want to ... (don't want to give away the what we want). It's all silliness, and somehow Sean Connery fits the part perfectly. The cinematography could have improved, and it was obvious that it took place on English country side somewhere.

I think I've seen this film ten times or so and it continues to grow on me. Perhaps I just enjoy Boorman's lush but rather odd productions a bit too much, but beyond all the jokes (why is Sean Connery in a big red diaper for most of the film?), Zardoz has a fascinating science fiction plot far better then all the star wars/trek nonesense, laser guns galore.

Zed spices things up for these immortal buffoons by being different and, oh yeah, by having a male organ that works! I kid you not! The rest is mainly Zed finding out that what he thought would be heaven is actually pretty dull. Unfortunately, so is this movie!

Connery spends a big chunk of the movie in diapers.When Boorman wrote it he must have siphoned off some of William S. Burroughs brain fluids, dried it, cut it with LSD, , blended it with tequila and embalming fluid and scarfed it down as a breakfast drink before his morning writing session. I've only seen it all the way thru once, but I'm told that if you watch it often enuff patterns do emerge and eventually the movie makes sense. Of course at that point you have gained knowledge Man Was Not Meant to Know and will go insane as surely as if you'd gazed on the full raw visage of Chuthulu Itself.

My first review of this never made it onto the site, I probably sweared too much in it. Anyway, this is a HARD-CORE sci-fi movie. It has deep undertones and messages within it that you have to really pay attention to or you'll miss them. You can tell Sean really isn't into the role. He has the look on his face that he is making a piece of crap and knows it. But hey he has bills to pay. The hilarious part is seeing him in what one Youtuber dubbed \\"hooker boots\\". The film is at times so wierd and bad you find yourself not being able to forget it after viewing it. Watch this if you love BAD movies and watch if you love a film that demands analying afterward.

From the opening scene where there's a guy's floating head (with a drawn-on mustache) talking to you, to the giant stone floating head that's really an airplane of sorts that spits out rifles, this movie is the worst of them all.

If you're a masochist, and you love feeling awkward, then watch this flick.

The ideas, the execution, the acting, the writing, the directing, the editing, the lighting, the camera work, the sound, all exemplify why so much pre-Star Wars 70's science fiction is not worth watching. Just because it's wrapped up in a pretty new dvd package doesn't change how bad it is.Let's see, the hero is a killer and a bunch of immortals want to die, so he kills them. There that's it.

At first viewing, I was disturbed and my gray matter was stretched from the very opening sequence -- the head of Zardoz moving around on the screen while a voice-over spoke about God in malleable terms the likes of which I had never heard. Then Sean Connery appeared and he exuded a virile, marauding energy that hooked me into the plot. After the bare-breated women inside the dome made their appearance, this film was destined to be a cinematic milestone in my life.

Why do they have to be naked? They're hideous looking in the face and body. My God, my eyes! If this is the product of the \\"love\\" generation and what they found to be entertaining and mindfully stimulating, no wonder our society is crazy.

A bonus in this situation is that any female students who are watching will become amenable to slipping off to another room. I can't recommend it in any other context. It's plain terrible, and not in one of those ways that it's so terrible that it becomes good. Too bad there's no \\"zero\\" star ranking. Or negative stars.

The coach analogy has worn itself thin (at least a dozen career writers claim to be America's career coach -- and some of them actually offer real substance in their books and columns). The little boxes with \\"keen\\" advice are embarrasing. It feels like Ms. Kleiman is writing for the lowest common denominator or thinks her readers are just plain dumb. I guess the underlying problem with this book is that is doesn't say anything that hasn't been said before, usually better, in other career books and it does not respect the intelligence of its potential readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impact Nailer","review":"This is a second unit for me.

I wish I had spent my money on something else as I feel like it was completely wasted on this game.The graphics are pretty awful, even taking into consideration the date this was made. It feels very rushed, which is likely the case as EA probably knew people would buy it no matter how crappy due to the franchise. The save points feel awkward, as most of them are in the middle of objectives. There is basically no deviation from the main objectives to do (no exploring, no side-quests, nada) expect for quidditch after it's unlocked (which was boring to me). Also, you'll likely put the volume on mute after about 10 minutes because the constant repeating/yelling of spells is grating on the ears and nerves.I didn't even bother finishing this game. A video game has to be pretty bad if I'd rather just be bored than play it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for Kids, but not so much for those over 10yrs old","review":"I do remember liking this game as a kid. But now it's very hard for me to play. The game is full of bugs, is slow, the character's mouths don't move when they talk, jumping is awkward, and overall, the graphics are terrible by today's standards. The only level I really liked is when Harry is under the invisibility cloak and has to go past all of these obstacles and past Filch and Mrs. Norris.

Now where's that noise coming from? I don't SEE anyone talking. *looks around* Hence the four stars.But this game is fun, a perfect game for a bad day.

It's not extremely difficult. Some of the challenges take a little more skill and wit than others. The saving graces of the game, and what makes it so cool, are the characters and the scenery. It's like you are actually at Hogwarts with Harry and his friends. The storyline skips around and if you are not familiar with what's going on, you might be confused from time to time. But for the Harry Potter reader and fan, this game is simply a must have. It is GREAT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids!","review":"This game appears to be directed towards kids that haven't spent their days connected to a joystick and adults who really haven't played much either.

I am an avid gamer and expected nothing short of perfection when buying this game. I will say that the graphics are well done and the game play was really fun, albeit short lived. I finished the game in about 6 hours. I know I am an adult, but my son will be done in about another 12 hours. The thing that really bothered me was the inability to go back to the places I had previously visited. There was only one direction in this game and that was forward. So to find every secret and get 100% of the game you need to start a new game from the beginning or take your time going through, which then can be a drag as you are always excited to get to the next thing...

He's a master of the Disney action games, so this one is pretty easy for him. However, it keeps him on his toes, with just enough \\"scare\\" to keep him interested. I know the game reviews panned this game, but we've found it highly entertaining around here. There are only a couple of minor \\"flaws\\" that I see: 1) the broom flying is awkward, and, 2) when restarting after a \\"faint\\" you must see some cut-scenes over and over again without being able to skip over them. Not terrible things to overcome, by any stretch.

Admittedly, I may not have given this game a chance. The graphics are poor and movement is archaic. What's up with using the arrow keys? What ever happened to games which allow you to use a joy-pad or mouse (more effectively). In their haste to release a video game to accompany the movie craze, EA has classified their loyal customers as well as the general public as idiots willing to spend money on any kind of \\"Harry Potter\\" junk. From what I can tell, this game isn't even worthy of release as freeware. Perhaps the game improves later. I wouldn't know because the flashing blue, red, green & yellow lights all over the Hogwart's castle walls gave me a headache.

This is a very entertaining game with a lot of puzzles, foes, and characters. There are only a few cons that I could see:1. The beginning is a like a scrapbook. What I mean is that you can't play at the Dursley's, Diagon Alley, or even at Platform 9 3/4. This really makes the game shorter. I would have loved to have explored Diagon Alley. Instead, you are taken right to Hogwarts before you can even do anything in the game.2. The graphics aren't the best 3D graphics around, but they are still very nice and vivid.3. The game seems a little short. I wish it could have been a bit longer.Other than that, this game is awesome. I loved the different puzzles and rivals that had to be faced.

During the game there were quite a few levels or puzzles that I would find very complex (example: Quidditch, Fluffy, racing Malfoy...) and would gripe and complain about them untill they were beaten, and that ussaly took about a week.

Sheesh, if I hadn't seen it myself, I'd never have believed Harry Potter could [be] suck so bad. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans are very pointless to collect; all you do is give them to Fred and George who seem to own you!

My 6 year old has spent half of the time he's had with the game watching me get through the hard spots of the game for him (and I usually have to make multiple attempts myself.) We have finally given up the game at the point where we have to chase Malfoy on the broomstick and knock him off - it has proven to be an impossible task. My 10 and 8 year olds have not had any better luck than I have. The least Electronic Arts could do is publish a strategy guide to take away some of the frustration.

I expected something along the line of \\"Escape from Horrorland\\" based on the R. L. Stine books where there are a series of puzzles and interesting explorations based upon the plot of the book. The plot is irrelevant in this game. This is merely a set of puzzles for finding the classrooms while you collect jelly beans and wizard cards. The old game series Commander Keen did a better job of that.For example, Harry travels from class to class but there really is no classroom set to explore. Just think of the experience if he had been able to explore his Potions classroom.It's obvious that this was a quick marketing attempt to make some money off the book. BORING, BORING, BORING. Shame on you Rowling for allowing this to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Buy","review":"For the $ I spent on the game when it first came out, it is sure worth it. The game is challenging, yet fun. I loved how you could explore the school in-between classes! For me, the Quidditch games were very tough, but once you got the hang of it, it wasn't too bad. One thing I would change about it, though, is the fact that the character's mouths did not move while they talked. This did not, however, in any way affect the game, it is just my personal preferance. The puzzles kept me playing for hours, and the game went basically along the same storylines as the book, except for the fact that it seemed the whole story took place in a day! I have still to beat it, though I am at the end. The game was a very enjoyable experience, and a MUST for all Harry fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good game...","review":"This is a nice game... But it could use a few improvements. First off: MOUTHS. I wish they had made the mouths on the people move! It looks like the people who made the game were too lazy to make the mouths move.Second: You can't skip cutscenes... You have to sit for a long time watching Fred and George show how to walk on the carpet and pick up a bean.Also, the characters keep changing voices so one second Filch will sound mean and nasty and the next second he'll sound as nice as Dumbledore. Oh yeah, speaking of Dumbledore; he has an AMERICAN ACCENT! ... The game has a very good, easy to follow story and very nice graphics. It's also REALLY fun and challenging.

To say I was disappointed is an understatement. The story was bizarre (which is not always a bad thing) and confusing. Sibyl Smiles wants a baby but doesn't want a husband so naturally she turns to her friend and neighbor Hunter Llyod. The conflicts from this situation are not well explored and there is another confusing side plot involving Hunter's involvement in a high profile trial. There was too much going on and the resolution of the conflicts don't make sense. Overall I ended the book with a sense of puzzlement over what had just taken place. Stella Cameron usually hits with me but this was a rare miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not crazy!!","review":"I hadn't read a book from Stella in a long time, and thought this one would be interesting, but instead I was confused and annoyed by the inconsistancies in the story, for example, the idea of a young woman wanting only impregnation just didn't fit my concept of the time period, the men realizing they've said the wrong thing over and over, and Hunter's conspiracy plot. I was going to write my first review, but was intimidated by the glowing reviews I read. I thought I'd have to read it again because I must have missed a lot.

This book is the first by Stella Cameron that I have read and may be the last. Please tell me that the quote by Linda Lael Miller on the cover: \\"Nobody does suspense and sensuality like Stella Cameron\\" wasn't a joke! I couldn't buy that a respectable woman in this time period would intentionally get pregnant without being married. I was also completely turned-off (read: \\"grossed out\\") by the cucumber scene!

I believe I will just keep waiting for Joan Wolf, Carla Kelly and Mary Balogh to write again."},{"rating":"1","title":"very interesting","review":"This book is fascinating as an example of early psychoanalytic treatment, but I disagree with so much of what goes on that I can't give it a positive rating. The appalling power dynamic in the text shows just how much Dora herself matters in all of this. Again, if it's being read purely as a historical text (or as a guide for how NOT to analyze a situation or treat someone), then that's great.

The minute I beat Web Spider I knew, and instantly in love I went out trying to back track through the series and acquiring them all!Seriously, go to Ebay and try to buy a copy of Megaman X3 for less than 50-60 bucks.

Just wouldn't call the racing megaman game a reward as much as just a fun game to go along with it as I said, take or leave, but megamanx collection has it all, intact, and even a little extra.

Beat is finally getting some attention here and it's about time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressively Violent","review":"Pretty good movie, where vioelence creeps up as the movie goes on. Kitano plays a cop which gets violent as the movie goes on. He starts by slapping a street punk, then moves onto kicking a businessman who had a one night stand with his sister, continues with punching a dope dealer, and finishes by killing several drug dealers, and his own sister. This is a very good and entertaining movie, but it is purely fictive. As a foreigner living in Tokyo since 1998, I never heard or seen any violence in this country. I would recommend this movie for a few reasons. It is a good cop movie, it shows good scenes from Tokyo, and gives some insight to Japanese culture (except the violence part)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Violent Cop","review":"Beat Takeshi stars as a cop named Azuma who goes about his job in a very violent way. When a fellow cop is killed, Azuma looks to settle things himself.Like a lot of Japanese movies, the story moves kind of slow. It's always deadly serious and sometimes people will just stare eachother down for a minute or two. But if you look away for a second, somebody will be getting beaten down and there may be need to rewind. While the the movie has a slow pace, I didn't find it boring one bit. I really like Beat Takeshi's style and I will have to seek out more movies from him. He is a bad dude.I was thinking about giving this just 3 stars, but Beat Takeshi is too cool.3.5/5The DVD from Fox Lorber Films has slghtly above average picture quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"i thought this would be a book about stars!

Even when I click on \\"surprise me\\" there are no samples of the pages inside. How on earth can I make an informed decision if I have no information? This lack of information makes me suspicious.

It can lead to some very confronting issues such as: the ambiguity of belief, the need for dogma and many other \\"shattering\\" realizations.

The pages don't even match up. It's readable, but not usable as a reference and it leaves out many of the awesome effects for your first reading. So since it sucks for your first reading of the Principia, and it's useless if you want to look up a specific page, it's honestly not worth the money when there are much better copies available for roughly the same price. Furthermore, this copy's poor quality probably outweighs the benefit of having a hard copy, so you could probably just use one of the many free online versions, many of which include graphics from the original which this does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY A DIFFERENT COPY!

I couldn't put it down the first night I got it. Most of the stories are great, one or two were ok, not even good. I would recommend this book for anyone over forty, for me it brought fond memories of life of the late forties and early fifties. I know that most of you in your forties were not born until 1960 or later, but if you were like me most of the TV movies when we were kids were from that era. I especially like the Perry Mason story, Perry's discription in the book is very different from the TV Perry Mason.

Both North and South, Books 1 & 2, are the perfect compliment to the historical setting and diverse sentiment prior to and during the American Civil War. The original television miniseries departs a little from John Jakes' published work, but overall the epic makes for good watching. A great deal of the first movie was filmed almost exclusively in and around Charleston, SC. Bill Conti's musical score fits perfectly with production. When the series first aired in Autumn 1985, I was glued to the television set and raced back from military field assignments so as not to miss an episode. At the conclusion of the first miniseries I was overjoyed that there was a second series in production, which aired early in 1986.

YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY THIS GAME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"First of all there is nothing in the description of this product that says you are required to pay $9.99 a month to play!! You can't play unless you subscribe & then they say their rates can change at any time!! They also say this is a \\"low\\" user fee?? Pretty hefty sum to play a game I bought! My son is pretty disappointed. I'm disappointed, too, with the false advertising. There's a big difference in playing on-line & paying to play online. Unless you are willing to sign up via credit card & fork away $10.00 a month to play this game, find something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This game is the best sports game for computer I have ever played.

I finally found in very small print on the back of the box that there is a SMALL monthly fee, to a kid 9.99 is not a small fee.That's fine is they charge but they should make that perfectly clear like in big letters on the front of the box. I was really disappointed because he did really like the game. I wrote to EA game hoping that maybe they would reinburse his money but I'm not holding my breath. So unless you're willing to pay the fee don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This game was fun at first, but then it got repetitive, boring and dull. The beta testers all have the nice cars, and as a newbie it will take you ages to be able to afford anything decent. Plus it's just like the Need for Speed games, which I have never liked. The initial price of the game is just like any other computer game, but then you have to also pay each month to continue playing! There is no offline single player mode, so you either pay or you don't play. For the initial price it's worth it, but when you add on the monthly fee it's definately not. Needless to say I won't be buying another EA computer game for a LONG while. Don't waste your time and money on this game unless you absolutely love classic cars and don't mind wasting money each month to play a game that is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor city online","review":"I was disappointed when I received this game.

From the beginning however, I always wished the game had included a version that would run offline on your computer, as all other Need for Speed titles before it. After having passed level 30 in experience, and having a nice collection of rare cars in the game, I felt cheated by EA.Recently I filled out an online survey from EA, reguarding the new Need for Speed Underground 2 game. In this survey, there were a number of questions about what we the customers would like to see in future NFS games. Many provided answers that include muscle cars and online play. I consider this a glimmer of hope that they might create a new/better version of MCO in the future. Espesially if enough people show interest in the survey. NFSU2 is ok, but I'm still sore that NFSU1 is why they decided to pull the plug on MCO."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is OK. But find another book if you can.","review":"I bought this book based on the first review. I found the book not so great. It showed some tricks. But I know more tricks than what the book has shown--I am just an average science major with no teaching or math degree on my belt.The 3x5 card approach does not seem very smart, either.

And it's not that fragile but the Vulture Droid...It's kinda easy to break if you're touching and playing with the wings and you'll be so ticked off when you'll half to re build the wings back onto the droid so that's why I usualy put the Droid somwhere safe and don't play with it, I only play with the Starfighter because it doesn't break all the time.

Trying to define everything in the universe regarding the roles, purpose, fundamentals, morality, psychology, etc. of the individual, the organisation, and the executive in 296 pages of content is not only adventurous but naive. As a result the content does not have much of a sense of purpose, with no real goal achieved at the end of it. The scattergun approach used in this book makes it a tiresome and belaboring read.The title of the book is totally misleading. I suggest a new apt (boring) title for this book : \\"Philosophies of Organisation and Executives' Roles in Them\\".For MUCH more RELEVANT reading, I suggest the likes of Drucker and Schein for their often excellent content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I purchased this Sarong for my wife and she absolutely loves it.

We have the islands and the natives would rather we leave, the setting for a conflict between US Forces and the Filipino natives.

It mentions passive-vs-active voice once -- on page 218ish.It covers only the most superficial points, like audience analysis, maybe a bit on the research (vaguely), and the like. Then it offers reams of the most general expository verbiage on how to go about the most wide-ranging of writing tasks (letters, research-papers...).There are already books about writing business letters. There are several books on writing a thesis or dissertation too.Compared to those, this book fails with style.If you are interested in learning technical writing, then you almost definitely already have a working mastery of everything that will be presented in this book.This book would be well suited to 7th grade junior high-school students in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for a younger crowd","review":"I bought this book for a class I am taking in my seinor year at college and after reading a couple chapters from the beginning and the end of the book I felt like this book would be better off for a younger crowd.

It's a huge disappointment! Three songs have been deleted because the producers wouldn't pay the royalties. And worse, the (remastered! ) 5.1 sound is horrible - parts of the orchestra and vocal backup have been placed arbitrarily in the rear which is not only distracting but gives the sonic effect of listening in a cave. It's surround alright, but a totally phony surround. Finally, the subwoofer output is almost nonexistent. Buyer, beware of this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundly Disappointed!","review":"Owned the LP record of this concert in the late 70s.

But this book discusses the phrase in the European context. Here, it covers both abortion and the death penalty. The book is a summary of various decisions made in numerous European courts, along with commentaries on those decisions. Broadly, abortion is shown to be legal in most of Europe. While the death penalty is banned throughout. There is even a brief discussion of eugenics, via-a-vis theraputic or medical abortions.An ironic comparison to the US occurs, though this does not appear to be made in the text. An American who opposes abortion often also supports the death penalty, and might use \\"right to life\\" for the former, without appreciating the direct contradiction with the latter. In Europe, \\"right to life\\" is literally interpreted in the banning of executions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I saw this video and I was overwhelmed with great emotion.

Like other annoying travel companions he talks nonstop about himself, providing endless boring details about his favorite coffee brand, high school prom, etc. Also he claims to be an authority on every topic, though he clearly knows nothing about the issue, and provides a stream of incorrect \`facts.'This is very unfortunate, since the book takes you to the most interesting places, and introduces you to some amazing people.

He doesn't seem to have a whole lot of skill with the language, and maybe it's just the English major in me coming out, but I expect better from my authors.

I personally know 3 of the characters in the book... and all three have their names spelled incorrectly. And they are not difficult names! You would think that his notes and his research - if as meticulous as he professes - would surface such discrepencies. This makes me wonder what other careless attitudes rendered such blithe mistakes.I have lived in Alaska for 14 years... and his pitifully boring ramblings provide nothing in the way of entertainment. Facts (or are they) piled on top of eachother. Overly dramatized passages that make me know he is thrilling himself with ineptitude.

I did finish the book and at the end, I did find that I did get a slight peek of Alaska.It seemed like this book was a rough draft of his notes with no flow or structure to hang these stories on.Save your money and look for this book in your local library.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},{"rating":"1","title":"downhill since the last book","review":"I bought and loved Jenkins' A Walk Across America.

Peter Jenkins' book is the closest one can get to being in Alaska without the cost of an airline ticket, lodging, etc. He captures the true essence of Alaska and the many who reside there.

Quirky but readable, the father-daughter relationship is the heart of this book and one wonders how much is factual for Ms. Sherrill & how much is it the way she wished it could have been.

On FIFA 2002 you can score if you get the power of the shot right.New Passing and Shooting Systems make it more realistic to play. You can now pass the ball into space and make players without the ball run onto the ball.More skill moves. What I want to see! It hasn't caught up to the International Superstar Soccer Series yet, where you can do rainbow kicks, tap-ip's, and trademark moves, but it's getting there.So, buy FIFA 2002 now because it's a great game and it has improved a LOT from FIFA 2001."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST OF ALL FIFA'S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Impossible to play in \\"professional\\" and boring in \\"amateur\\".

Marking is unheard of, my defenders stand around like dummies and wouldn't even attempt to make a tackle on their own.

I figured since there was nothing else on I would go ahead and watch it. Well, despite the bit of sleazy content I couldn't really identify what the actual plot was. My only guess is that Mickey Rourke is trying to get Kim Basinger to see the erotic side of art pictures along with having a relationship with her that is only based on sex.

I found it difficult to care for either one of them. I don't find manipulation, humiliation, and game-playing very erotic. A man who can't get excited unless he's degrading a woman, and a woman who appears to find that attractive, are not what I consider sexy. For me the point of this film was waiting to see how long it would take Kim Basinger to finally snap and decide she wasn't going to put up with it anymore. It took her too long, and I found it hard to respect a character who has so little respect for herself. Rourke's smug arrogance was also not very endearing.

That's it. Rourke's smugness is so bad it's sickening and Bassinger, despite the great figure, looks cheap more than beautiful.Kudos to the photographer for some nice closeup shots and some wonderful color, but the story is so weak - no character development and no plot - it's unable to compensate.

The story was boring, the acting was terrible especially by the main actor, he was terrible in this kind of film. I have always seen him in westerns where he fit in just right, but to me stands out like a sore thumb in this movie, he doesn't have the ump that is normally shown in these type of films.

But there are some \\"minor\\" issues that some people may have problems with, such as baptism that is not immersion and hinting at the possibility of married people still being married in heaven (see Matt. 22:23-30). Furthermore, it is a little vague on exactly who is going to heaven and who is not. And there is a MAJOR PROBLEM: at one point in the movie Peter receives a message from Jesus that includes a statement along the lines of \\"or I will come back and be crucified again.\\" This is a major theological problem, as the one crucifixion of Christ was sufficient (see Hebrews chapter 10). Such a shame for an otherwise excellent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for Deborah Kerr and Peter Ustinov.","review":"Quo Vadis? is one of the worst sepctacles ever made; D Kerr and Peter Ustinov are the saving graces here, Peter Ustinov as Nero, and D.

He ruins all fims he is in, and yet was used over and over, because Hollywood was afraid he would tell more to the House on Un American Activities, for whom he supplied many many names.An informer, liar, and blacklmailer, his career ended with MacCarthy, thank God.Avoid this and all Taylor films; he's terrible, and terrible even without the facism."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE WORST BIG BUDGET FILMS EVER MADE","review":"This movie has the worst acting I've ever seen.

Star Robert Taylor seems somewhat out of place with his flat, contemporary line delivery early in the story, but he steps up his game when the drama calls for it.

Most vampire films have bad characterization and the gross sensuality of romance novels shot through gauze and sepia filters. This story was more tangled and raw. Outside of the predator-prey aspect, both the main characters were isolated, damned and hungered for escape through another. In fact it seems that this story characterized the vampiric relationship with their prey as the least like the quest for a snack. The film presented a very believable and desperate random collision between these two with the course of their contact having a sexual energy and charmed hunger that made far more sense in a modern context than any stylized neo-victorian posing ever could."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOLID INDY PSYCHODRAMA!!!","review":"Captivating!

Hence, the word: 'captivating.' Fessenden succeeds in giving the streets of New York City a certain 'gothic' feel while his actors excel on all fronts. My favorite character, besides them all, is Lenny - you gotta love'em. \\"On the f*%$in poop deck, man!\\" More impressive...

I absolutely loved this book. Black is a wonderfully interesting person, and his story is like none that I have ever found anywhere else--the story of a hobo in the early 1900's, who steals, does drugs, lives like a bum, rides the trains, and eventually decides he's had enough, settling down to a more conventional lifestyle.He is the kind of person you want to meet and have a beer with.

The simple prose gives you a wonderfully clear picture of what it is to be an outsider and a drifter in the 1920s. How accurate it is I don't know, but the feeling it gives you while reading it makes the universe of the story very real. I relate it to On The Road not because it is similar in quality (it's not) but because it conveys the romance of being a hobo, traveling the countryside and making your own way very well. The picture painted for you can be so convincing, like On The Road, that if you look up from the page and the weather isn't as it seems in the book, you get surprised.The sympathetic protagonist gives an insight into how it comes to be that a person we may see as antithetic to social norms can become that person that we see.Well worth reading if you are interested in people, travel, drama and mirth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piece of History","review":"You Can't Win by Jack Black is an autobiography that captures a time during the early 1900's. A time of depression and despair, but also a time of opportunity for the right type of people. Jack Black was one of these opportunists and he took advantage of the soft spots in security.Like any human, Jack Black made mistakes and served time for it. Whether it be the prisons or addiction, he made attempts to escape. At the end, Jack Black settled for a modest job at the library, but went to become a prominent figure in the media."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thief of Hearts","review":"One of the fascinating aspects of Blacks's account of his adventures as a career hobo/thief is how naturally he slips into the life without conpunction or remorse. It is a matter-of-fact, unapolegetic point of view that seduces the reader into being an accomplice on Jack's escapades across a rough and tumble, turn of the century American West. It is a country that is huge and wild and there is room for an untamed soul that defies authority and moral convention. Like Sam P.'s WILD BUNCH, this is the saga of a disappearing breed who lived by their own laws. Black connects with the outlaw in us who yeans to steal life on his own, uncompromising terms and suffers the consequences of his mistakes without whining. Jack Black is a natural storyteller who knows how to spin a yarn and, in the end, he is the master thief who makes off with our hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Win Won","review":"A true story about a house burglar in the Twenties who escaped the law by riding the train to another town where he did the same thing again. It's Americana at it's best. Someone ought to write a ballad about this man using his words. \\"There's a lot of law at the end of a rope.\\" \\"A hang man may be your only hope.\\" \\"In a blind alley you shoot and shoot first.\\" \\"Old grudges are opened. Old hates are revived. Stool pidgeon's beaten and the turn key's denied.\\" \\"No one is eating the damned hang man's stew.\\" \\"I never borrowed money I could not pay back.\\"Hobo's are not derilicts and after you read You Can't Win you may feel the same. It is a great book that admonishes the prison system where there is no cure for the human condition if you put the human in a jail cell.He ended up working for a library in San Francisco. How he died nobody knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I know the Blues!","review":"I always was interested in the Blues, but not enough to actually figure out what made one kind of blues different from another or how they got that sound. It was also hard to know how to buy good blues records, because once you get beyond the obvious classics you basically have to rely on whatever the record store clerk personally thinks is good, unless you know someone who's really into the blues. And I've never seen a Blues book that came with a CD before, so you just had to imagine the songs they were describing. This book was a lot of fun to read, and with the CD, I really \\"got\\" what it was talking about. I'm getting it for Christmas for some people because it's really ideal for people who want to explore the blues but don't know where to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"All in all a very good book and CD","review":"This book is pretty much exactly what a for dummies book should be. It's an enjoyable light read about the blues. The coverage is extensive and written in an entertaining fashion. The knowledge of the authors is indisputable. I only have a couple of complaints:This book was written in 1998 and not updated since so the contemporary blues section is missing some obvious important new comers (Eric Bibb for example) and online resources are hopelessly out of date ([...]).I expected the Playing the Blues section to have a little bit of theory and perhaps some tips for each instrument but its about putting together a band that could play the blues. Given the authors experience I don't doubt the value of this information but I just wasn't expecting that information and question what percentage of readers need that versus some getting started tips on playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have just finished reading the book, and while it does offer a lot of good information, I think it tends to be biased and incomplete. Many of the finest blues pioneers were either omitted completely, or given one mention in a sentence about somebody else. No blues history is near complete without in-depth mention of Reverend Gary Davis, Mississippi John Hurt, Pink Anderson, and others. There is not a fence around art. There is more to blues than electric guitars and feedback. And by the way, I would argue with the point that the banjo was played in blues before the guitar- though I am not dissing the banjo at all. It's just that the modern banjo is a comparatively recent instrument. I think if someone wants to learn blues history, go to the very good PBS documentaries first. And listen to everybody!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong CD track info......or wrong track?","review":"This book is ok...not great....but ok for someone who is wants to cut their teeth on the blues. The main problem I have, is with the CD. Overall it's excellent except for one problem. The 10th track is listed on page 349 as Walkin' the Boogie(alternate take) by John Lee Hooker. After listening to the CD I realized they're dead wrong. The recording is Willie Dixon doing Walking the Blues. Two totally different songs with a similar name. I contacted the publisher about this omission but have not received a response or acknowledgement to date. It is a shame....because both of these artists have made significant contributions to the blues and to confuse them, seems to suggest that not enough care was taken when this book was first published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book ,could be better!","review":"I enjoyed reading this book .I especially enjoyed the accompaning CD.I think it was a compehensive book about the Blues.My concern is that it failed to convey the love of music,the distinguised authors obviously have.It has a who is who chapter which I belive is comphensive but still It reads like,for lack of a better description,a phone book.I have listened to performers performing on a stage tell their own stories or events in Blues music that are fascinating and that just stick in ones mind.And soul and flavor of the music just comes through.Ofcourse performing is not the exactly writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the music, read better books, live the blues...","review":"I really resent the titles of the \\"XXXX for Dummies,\\" since as a teacher I think it creates self-images of inadequacy...

John Hurt, Muddy, etc. Listen and enjoy and support your local blues organizations and clubs. Books for dummies.

It is tailored to the bulk ration system used by NOLS, and applies primarily to groups camping together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Here's another classic example of a reason so many people dislike science. How can we expect people to put up with the bad language and lack of motivation and application? Textbooks ought to set an example of good writing. The authors do not pay attention to the reader.

More to the point, I work entirely with other RF engineers and every person I showed this book to shuddered and began spouting off profanities at it.Although the book does start out simply enough, the chapters tend to give only a brief overview of the material. The real trouble starts when you try to work the problems at the end of each chapter. With no solid examples or clear explanations of how to proceed, I found myself referring to my other RF textbooks for support.I have no doubt that if you are borderline Genius, this book will make perfect sense to you. ...But for us less than genius personality types, keep looking, your book is still out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"you get what you pay for\\"","review":"I just loved this adorable bejewled butterfly toe ring when I saw it online!

I purchased this book because I've purchased other Dummy books thinking I would get a simpler or even exciting understanding. I like psychology but not everyone is an effective communicater/teacher. This book was no better, I was expecting the writer to make it fun & easier for those who want to learn the subject. I found it completely a waste of time and over my head. I'm a B+ student and I was frustrated alot with the meanings or interpretations given...after scratching my head, I checked out the book cover and low & behold ...the writer also has a PHD -- enuff said. If you already know psychology then go ahead it purchase it, but if you're someone who needs a good understand and need someone to KISS (keep it simple, stupid) keep your money in your pocket. It's a great book but not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"No footnotes for a plethora of references","review":"I found this book to be dry, superficial, and boring. The attempts at humor mentioned by other reviewers do not cut it. It ranges unevenly from being too technical in some areas to too general in others. However, my biggest complaint is that the author makes numerous references such as \\"research says...\\"and \\"according to...\\" but there are no footnotes or bibliography for follow up. No works are cited, just names of psychologists."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love the movie......","review":"If you love the movie \\"Angela's Ashes\\" as much as I do, please buy this companion piece. Anyone with immigrant ancestors or who comes from a family where a father was absent due to drinking and a mother had to struggle to keep going for her children can appreciate the poignancy and introspection offered. There is a hauntingly beautiful song at the end of the documentary that speaks volumes about what life was like for Angela and it is a song that unfortunately still rings true today for thousands of mothers around the world and here at home.

This is a wonderful saga of the McCourt family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mccourts of New York","review":"Very disappointing.Disjointed effort on behalf of a McCourt nephew. Seems more like a school project rather than the touching journal that resulted in Angela's Ashes. Some frames are out of focus(not an effect). Too much focus on Malachy, not even-handed. Turned a well-intentioned story into a drudgery. Not even enough photos that would have made the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice piece of history","review":"I enjoyed this dip into a pocket of history that I knew only by allusion from other works.

Their set-up included a mockup McLaren Mercedes cockpit with a flat panel on the front (just like the drivers have when they'r ein the garage!) and then pumped up to a huge projection screen so other race fans could see how you were doing against Michael and Rubens.

Every cd they have put out is awesome and I listen to them all the time. I know that people always compare SS to Sublime. I love Sublime and always will, but Slightly Stoopid is better. SS always has a great show and never sound bad. When Sublime would put on a show, they never really sounded like a cd they released, but great music.

Though SS is not Sublime, I can't come up with a better way of classifying them. Basically, if you like the Long Beach Dub All Stars, you will like Slightly Stoopid. Acoustic Roots is a very chill album, much like the Bradely Nowell and Friends album.

The Truth based story of the Massachusetts 54th. Only the beginning of black heroics during the Civil War.From the dignified talent of Morgan Freeman, to Denzel Washington's Academy Award winning performance as a militant loud mouth runaway, great acting to suit everything else about this film. And another level of respect achieved for Matthew Broderick indeed. So many standout scenes, but most memorable, Denzel's beating.

There are so many memorable lines and moments in this film. There is not a more powerful scene than when they find Denzel Washington's character to be a deserter. He is then brought before the entire regiment and is flogged with a whip. But when they rip his shirt off, he has too many wounds to count from previous whippings, most likely as a slave. Col.

There's a lot of other issues that go on with the Civil War and the general is having trouble having to direct african-american soldiers into war, especially a good friend of his named Thomas.While based on a true story, this was a decent civil war movie for it's time. Matthew Broaderick is pretty well cast as the general.

It still was good though in the way the plot was laid out, in the way they went into their first battle and had victory and little casualties. It made the men feel like they were invincible and nothing could beat them. 'Trip' was my favorite character as he 'put his money where his mouth was'. My favorite part was when Trip went to get his pay and when he was told he was only to get 12 pounds instead of 13 pounds he convinced everyone to rip up their pay sheets. When their leaders saw this they then to tore up their pay sheets and would not accept any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for TV quality","review":"Having read such glowing reviews I ran out and bought this movie. I was very disapointed. It has the look and feel of a made for TV movie. Everyone looks as if they just hopped out of the shower. The battle scenes appeare to have been filmed on a freshly mowed golf course, the putting greens possibly. The confederates are as well clothed as the union soldiers. They all have boots! The music indicates when you are supposed to feel moved. I can't feel moved 50 times an hour. The characters all act and talk as if it were 1989. This has been my least favorite war movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good!","review":"This was a very unlikeable civil war movie. Matthew Broadrick is miscast as a commander of a black regiment. Denzel Washington talks too much like he was in 1989. Were all of the blacks in this regiment really runaway slaves? Wouldn't they have been free? I just found this movie very stupid and unwatchable. Also, how can you make a civil war movie without showing the other side, the Confederates? Watch Gettysburg and Gods and Generals instead. Those two movies are the most realistic depictions of the civil war ever made and they actually make you feel like you're part of the conflict that shaped this nation. Glory, on the other hand, is just a sugar coated depiction that blinds those narrow-minded watchers from the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glory","review":"GloryI had purchased this as the \\"edited\\" version and it is definitely NOT edited.

This movie was one of the few movies to acurately reflect (from a historical aspect, as I have no person knowledge obviously) the struggle of the first black infantry division of the Union.

From beginning to end it is filled with blatant distortions of history. Whipping in the Union Army was abolished prior to the Civil War, so the scene where the black soldier is flogged is pure propaganda meant to inflame rather than to inform. Additionally, the vast majority of the soldiers of the 54th were educated free men from the North, not runaway slaves. What a slap in the face to the real 54th. Plus, Matthew Broderick is a completely misscast as Col. Robert Gould Shaw. Broderick portrays him as if he was some sort of a fop, not the young but tough soldier he really was. And last, but not least, Fort Wagner faced South with the ocean on its left flank, not on its right as shown in the this sorry excuse for a war movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW.........","review":"I can only say this movie is NOT to be viewed lightly. I enjoyed every minute of it and found it suprisingly interesting while still being historical. However it was extremely intense. Not much bothers me, yet I almost fainted during the closing scene and nearly cried.It depicts the story of Colonel Robert Goul Shaw who has agreed to lead the 54th regiment-the first all African American Regiment. I don't reccomend this for people easily upset by blood and gore but its a wonderful movie that finally gives credit to the African American soldiers who fought in the Civil War and is layered with both thought provoking and no frills blood and gore scenes. History/war fanatics and moviegoers alike will enjoy this movie but it's definetley not for everyone! Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Classic","review":"The message of this movie transcends both time and age. When this movie was first release, I took my young son to see it. He thoroughly enjoyed it, and it presented him with many questions about our country and race relations. I now have it on both Video and DVD. My son is now a young adult and this continues to be one of his favorite movies, and mine too! It is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"best civil war film ever made","review":"let me begin by say this was the most emotional film i have ever seen,i neerly found my eyes turning bloodshot red in the climatic ending\\"i sad almost red\\"not only emotional but this film is true based on the first black regiment in the civil war.the wardrobes are authentic lookinking the battles are very realistic and the characters ah! the characters so wonerfuly acted.the film diminstrates how willful the human soul can be,and how man can endure brutality for what he truly belives in as the case for the black regiment in this film.you must see it to belive it and here it to feel it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Civil War films...","review":"Stunning epic of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first African-American troops of the Civil War. Moving, eloquent, with impassioned performances, sweeping score (this has got to be one of Horner's best), and battle scenes that will shake you to the core. And hey, everybody cries at the end of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up!!!","review":"By far one of the best movies that I have ever seen. This movie gives a personal touch to the heroic story of the 54th Massachusetts regiment. Their story is very important to the history of the U.S. and should be told. The movie was done tastefully. I am happy to have it in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie bad strategies","review":"This was a great movie. The cast was amazing. Sets, direction. Everything was great but when the troops would go into battle I kept thinking what horrible field strategies they were. It was like the troops were just marching into the line of fire.

What I really wanted to see was the black bars at the botton and top of the screen; the true widescreen version. But buyers beware. This is a glorified full screen version (know your screen ratios, folks) and I got burned. Is there a true widescreen version of this film? It deserves a better transfer than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tape broke at the very end of the movie.","review":"This is one of my favorite movies, I cry everytime I watch it and could watch it all day staight.

This will not make me change my feelings about Amazon.com either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glory Review","review":"Glory - Film ReviewThis movie starred Denzel Washington as Trip, and Matthew Broderick as Colonel Robert Shaw. It portrayed the African - American involvement in the American Civil War. It follows the 54th Massachusetts regiment, lead by Colonel Robert Shaw. It was based on the books Lay this Laurel and One Gallant Rush, which were based on the letters by Colonel Robert Shaw. I liked the film, as it was not boring and it contained action scenes I would give it about 7/10. One of the scenes was when the black 54th Massachusetts were denied as much pay as the other white soldiers, so the officers in charge of the 54th refused to get pay as well. Another incident was when the regiment went to attack Fort Wagner, a fort of about 1000 men, they failed, Robert Shaw was killed and the fort was never taken."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See For History Students!","review":"Loosely based on the book, \\"One Gallant Rush,\\" the movie, \\"Glory\\" is a must see for Civil War buffs and students of history.

Denzell and Morgan Freeman were great, and I was pleasantly surprised with Matthew Broderick.I did not see the movie until recently (on TV). I immediately went out and bought it on DVD. Well worth the money.I thought that the scenes leading up to and including the battle at the end of the movie were more tense and felt more real than other battle reinactments (ex. Private Ryan, Braveheart, etc.). The fact that it is a true story only makes it better. This is another example of a part of American history that many American know nothing about. I don't know if it's because of September 11th, but I find myself wanting to learn more and more about events in our great country's history, and I'm happy to now know about the 54th Massachusetts Infantry and their story.Background soundtrack makes it even better. Buy the special edition DVD!!! I'm not going to summarize the events of the movie as you can read it anywhere else on this page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Sensational","review":"If you haven't already taken the chance to see this CLASSIC, you can now watch it with absolute clarity, both in sound and sight, thanks to the wonderful advancement in technology - DVD's. This movie is by far one of the best war movies ever depicted on the Silver Screen. Its stellar cast (including Academy Award Winning Actor Denzel Washington and Andre Braugher, one of today's most under-rated and under appreciated actors) delivers a truly remarkable performance and made me a fan of a war I shunned as a high school student. To miss this movie is to deprive yourself of, not only an OUTSTANDING movie, but a phenomenal piece of American History very rarely talked about in traditional History classes. This DVD, packed full of extras is one for your home video collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Glory","review":"For once I wholeheartedly agree with the editorial review of this film. The acting is first rate, the action scenes are rich in content and believable, and in the end the whole film is uplifting in spirit if not in the fate of the soldiers. I saw this film when it first came out and it made a solid impression that stuck with me, when I saw it had come out on DVD it reached \`must buy' status. I honestly cannot say whether this is an accurate representation history-wise but it sure makes emotional viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie and DVD are both stunning","review":"Watching Glory in DVD is reason enough to purchase a DVD player. The soundtack in Dolby Digital 5.1 is perfect; if you have a nice set of speakers and a large subwoofer you will be rewarded. As for the film, suffice to say, it is a classic. The last scene when Broderick & Company charge up the hill, knowing that they will most likely die, will bring tears to your eyes. After watching this film for the millionth time, it makes me even more proud of the bravery and courage shown by all of our troops in past wars and even more disgusted by our current commander-in-chief WJC, who chose to smoke weed in Russia rather than fight in Vietnam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glory the best movie!","review":"I think Glory is a great movie.

I reccomend everyone to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical True Story","review":"I saw this movie in my 8th grade history class and never forgot it, our entire class was in tears! I bought it to show it to others and cry everytime, it was a very significant part of our nation's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving Experience","review":"I am neither a miltary history or Civil War history aficionado, so I'll defer on matters of the film's historical accuracy.But if you're interested in a gripping, moving American war story, beautifully rendered in period costumes and sets, and depicted with outstanding performances, this is it.The story of the Massachusetts 54th reminds me of several historical \\"could haves\\" that filmmakers enjoy dramatizing. Here, it's the idea that perhaps the experience and sacrifice of soldiers like those in the 54th could have had a salutory impact on race relations immediately after the war. Like I said, perhaps. How this was, at the individual level, the struggle to almost the correct the wrongs done a century before.Anyway.For me, it comes down to this when I saw it in the theater: there wasn't a dry eye in the house when the lights came up. Maybe that says something about the film. Or about us. I hope everyone who decides to watch this is as moved as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray sound and video are highly disappointing","review":"We were expecting a great blu-ray master from this wonderful movie, but were sorely disappointed. The blu-ray transfer is dismal both in sound and video. The picture is very grainy and murky with the colors quite off. It looks as if the studio had taken the cheapest way out of the process that it could have. The sound is also very lackluster and disappointing and does not have the clarity and punch we expect from the latest format. The studio cheaped out and ruined a great movie for this format. Shame on them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Civil War Movie !!","review":"Glory sets the gold standard for Civil War movie making. Even if there are some portions of this movie that may be considered historically inaccurate by experts, Glory still excels in bringing the story of the Civil War to the big screen in a high quality manner. The casting is top notch, the storytelling is excellent, and the production qualities (staging, special effects, etc) are first rate. Glory is a template for how other Civil War movies [Gods and Generals and Gettysburg] should be made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Eyed Child of Fortune","review":"What can I add to what already has been said? This is a most beautiful and touching movie. It inspired me to read many books on the subject of black regiments as well as the letters of Col. Shaw. Even though the movie has inaccuracies, it is a wonderful naration of a little explored subject. Of course, the cast is superior but I felt as I watched that Matthew Broderick gave us a real insight into his charactor as Robert Gould Shaw as well as resembling him. I suppose this would be considered good acting but he is so true to the role that he is transformed and there is Shaw himself.Everything comes together in \\"Glory\\" to make it a most memorable pictue and one that I have seen dozens of times.glory"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glory is a VERY good film","review":"Glory is an excellent movie to portray the Civil War. The first time I saw it was in my History class as we were studying the Civil War. It is really good historically. The music is really great in the movie and the characters and events can attract you into the movie greatly. It is a really good Civil War movie and I would recommend it. I rate this move 5 stars. It has a lot of famous actors in it too. Over all, this movie is worth 5 stars and I would watch it if I were you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glory and Praise","review":"By far one of the best films ever! Glory is the perfect combination of cinematography, score, directing, acting , and writing. Matthew Broderick and Denzel Washington star along with other memorable actors (Cary Elwes, Morgan Freeman, et al) and convey the story of Robert Shaw and his regiment of African-American soldiers. Although it's not a long film, the writing is concise and the audience gets to know every character so that when the end comes there won't be a dry eye in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Film, Great Actors","review":"I believe that the only reason this film hasn't been remembered more is because it's about the civil war period, which doesn't get much coverage anymore.

You have the flamboyant scoundrel Burt Lancaster on one side and the stoic gentleman Gary Cooper on the other. They form a loose allegiance and friendship in French occupied Mexico. And that's the main focus of this film. This movie is just filled with so many cornball theatrics that you just can't help but fall in love with it. And there's a twist or a turn around every corner. That's what makes it so good. Director Robert Aldrich mixes lessons on etiquette with lessons on sharp shooting. Even Emperor Maximilian gets to show off his marksmanship prowess against Cooper and Lancaster in a very entertaining scene! There's enough action, witty dialogue and beautiful location photography (by Ernest Laszlo) to please most movie fans. The large cast includes Cesar Romero, Denise Darcel, George Macready, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson and Jack Elam. The film's greatest asset is Burt Lancaster's smile.

Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster are two of my favorite actors. They don't make movies like this anymore. My beef, is that they call this presentation a Blue Ray quality movie. There is nothing Hi Def about it. Even the close ups are are not sharp. This is the second straight Blue Ray I have bought to be of poor Quality. From now on, I'll read the reviews.

While the visual quality ranges from fair to very good, the audio is atrocious. Instead of simply cleaning up the old mono tracks for the toons, the company that released this DVD went ahead and \\"remastered\\" the soundtracks to the cartoons ==> ERGO, witness sound effects that NEVER existed in the original toons and horribly imbalanced soundtracks!Save your money...Hopefully, someone WILL release better versions of these toons in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true disappointment","review":"Purchasing this DVD was a big mistake.I expected to find some hidden animation treasures (like those found in The International Tournee of Animation tapes). No such luck. Many cartoons in this DVD are quite familiar and can be seen (even more clearly) on the Cartoon Network.This Cartoon Crazys DVD projects a rather blurry image. For instance, the Max Fleischer Superman cartoons included suffer in comparison to the much superior visual quality found in \\"The Superman Cartoons of Max & Dave Fleischer\\".Sound enhancements are actually annoying and unnecessary. They don't seem to meld seamlessly within the original soundtrack. In my opinion, those extra sound effects, with Dolby and what not, are reminiscent of Ted Turner's infamous obsession of colorizing every black-and-white movie classic.Except for some interesting historical facts and trivia provided, I think there's little to recommend here."},{"rating":"1","title":"In stock, not in stock?

Just recently we have taken the vest off and she really can swim on her back without assistance and on her stomach with some supervision. I have used the vest for last summer and this summer. I recommend that you rinse it out in after every use and keep it out of the sun or the materal will break down. One extra thing they could do is put some cushioning on the bungee cords under the arms. My daughter loves it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"Although initially our 2 year old was doing pretty well with this in the pool, after an hour, one of the strap came off and the other one was close to ripping off as well. I'm sure that if this would not have happened, I would highly recommend this device to assist in teaching children to balance themselves in water and begin swimming, but unfortuantely, this is a major health hazard and they should be recalled. I advise all parent who have purchased this to inspect it thoroughly and of course, not leave your child alone in the water for even the briefest moment. Perhaps this one was a fluke but nonetheless, I intend to contact the manufacture and file a complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best product for teaching toddlers to swim.","review":"Our family has tried several different aids for teaching our kids to swim at an early age.

I can't recommend this product more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my best purchases","review":"Bought 2 of these for each of my toddler sons before heading to the beach for 2 weeks. They were perfect for the pool! Gave both of them (19 mos & 3 yrs) confidence in the pool. It was the first time swimming for both of them and they were both jumping off of the side into the water the first day! They were easy to get on, adjust, get off, and dry. They were not cumbersome at all and neither of my kids minded having them on at all. My sister bought them for my nieces too and she loved them as well. I would recommend them to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not us coast guard approved","review":"It is a nice product but when my son used at the township pool they told me it can be used because it is not US coast guard approved now I have to buy another one with the coast guard label"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made and Possibly Dangerous!","review":"This swim trainer is a good idea; however, the straps tore the first day. Could have been very dangerous if I wasn't right there in the water with my child. I attempted to repair them, but I just don't trust that they won't rip again. I believe there was another reviewer who said the straps did not hold; therefore, I don't think it was a fluke that this happened. I do not recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe For Any Age","review":"We bought this item for my toddler son. It was truely unsafe from the beginning. Problem is that his face stays underwater and he cannot get his balance. We then tried it on my 4 year old, the same thing happened with him that he could not keep his face above the water. It looks like a good concept, but we did not get the \\"SAFE\\" feeling from it.

The chapters with Junior or undercover cops are pretty interesting but Susan could have been made a bit less complicated and a lot more interesting.The story is basically about Susan who is a New York District Attorney who specialised in repossessing proceeds of crime. New players in New York's garbage removal industry are having their dogs' heads cut off or drivers' heads smashed in. The Mafia doesn't want new players and the hot headed, low IQ'd Junior, son of mob boss Tesla is addicted to violence.

Helpful insights on how to keep a positive outlook on the future, viewing your teen with compassions and understanding as we confront the many challenges this condition demands for both the teen and the parents.

Just a little. He still spends more than half of the film in shadow to hide his weight, and mumbles his lines as if he just wanted to finish the scene and go home. The fight scenes are not as sloppy as others I've seen (though I love the \\"15 shots to the crotch\\" scene), but the shootouts go way over the top. Lots of wild shooting, no aimed shots, and ridiculous amounts of blood. Speaking of that, how Eddie Griffin got conned into playing a sterotypical gangbanger beats me. Wait a minute--it must've been one thing; PAYCHECK! He throws the clock back 10,000 years for African Americans in this film with his moronic portrayal of a sleazy, filthy mouthed gangbanging dope dealer. And what's up with the raccoon on Seagal's head??? We all know you're losing your hair Steve--give it up and show us the bald spot in the next film.

I love Red Alert 2 and Tiberian Sun was good too, but Westwood really did a bad job with this one. Im surprised on how it got this many good reviews on Amazon.

Although i am not one of those fanatical C&C fans, i do love first person shooters (fps). The AI is the most horrible i've ever seen in a fps, and i've played a lot of games. The characters look like boxes, Havoc's personality is a cardboard cutout, the script and story line is hilariously bad, and Havoc's lines are corny. Most of all, both the single player and multiplayer are desperately below par. The single player was much too short, the bosses are too easy to kill, and the scenery is atrocious. The multiplayer is just as bad, since the base defences are much too difficult to bypass and you can only carry one weapon at a time. Westwood truly disappointed me with this game, i thought they were capable of a more thought out and prepared game.

It deftly weaves within this the intricate story of the emperor's love for his daughter and his childhood friend and their ill-fated love affair.The acting is top notch, especially Jiang Wen's portrayal of the emperor. He convincingly conveys his cruelty while allowing us to believe the love he has for his daughter and childhood friend. I never question the conflict within him because his portrayal makes it believable.Though the backdrops and sets seem almost muted compared to the larger-than-life emperor, this movie still manages to sweep you away in the stunningly lavish and rich scenery.

I was SO disappointed. Like a lot of Chinese movies, there's a lot that is not translated. It was unnecessarily bloody in the beginning, with extremely stereotyped characters.

Nowhere on the (actually quite nice) packaging does it state that this CD was taken from a vinyl album.Buy it if you want, but I guarantee you'll be disappointed.A further note. Whether the original masters still exist, I have no idea, but 'S-S-Single Bed' features on a UK compilation album (the excellent 'Guilty Pleasures') and DOES sound like it comes from the aforementioned mastertapes.

Other companies churn out performances, often of questionable video quality, and almost always with minimal liner notes. The Jazz Icons series unearth beautiful performances of musicians at their peak creativity. They then match these wonderful performances with thorough liner notes about the musician and the performances.I hope that this endeavor continues until all of the unseen performances from Europe are released. There are many musicians that have not been covered by these releases, such as Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Ben Webster, Errol Garner, Stan Getz, Ornette Coleman that would be very interesting subjects of future Jazz Icons series. Our job is to spread the word, and keep purchasing these, to encourage future releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"presents good surroundings about real-embedded system","review":"This book has wide contents about embedded system but brief.

Although neither of the two LPs reissued on this CD were commercial successes they are chock-full of superb adult-oriented Philly Soul from one of Philadelphia International's classiest and most sophisticated singers. In retrospect, Billy Paul's PIR recordings foreshadow what label bosses would accomplish with Lou Rawls during the second half of the 1970s. Billy Paul's laid-back, jazzy, breezy and sophisticated singing style deservedly earned him a place in the hearts of fans of romantic Soul fans--all of whom will love this reissue."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most comprehensive veterinary history","review":"An excellent overview, from ancient times to newer history.

This is the second half of his journey, through the Balkans and Danube lands. He has an ear for peoples' opinions, the oddities of Hapsburg imperial goulashes of different ethnicities & religions--most of which would be erased by the coming war. One has the sense of a \\"last glimpse\\" of the highly cultivated, varied human landscape of Europe before the war and Cold War divided its peoples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Between the Woods and the Water","review":"This is the continuation of, \\"A Time of Gifts.\\" The English youth continues his walk across Europe to Constantinople. He picks up now in Austria, on to Hungary following the Danube valley. I wanted to quit reading this - page after page of allusions to east European history from Roman and pre-Roman times, Hungarian geography, reflections on Slavic languages. Esoterics I cannot appreciate. Still, they lured me and challenged me. These are places and these are people - Magyars and Gypsies - we seldom find in writing. We are introduced just as an era is about to end and everything is to change.

Descriptions of such places is only rivalled by the brilliant characterisation lent to the protagonists throughout. Added to this is the poignant reminder that so much of this was to be destroyed by the occupying Nazi forces only a few years later. The variety of experiences written with supremely masterful imagery makes this book a must for those who have an interest in this part of Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre War Eurpoe -- from the Inside Out","review":"I loved this book and other writing by the Author. Reading this book is like travelling with a friend. The author tells a beautiful tale of Europe just before the war. His style and tempo are close and personal, and when you reach the end of the trip, you know that you have encountered the Europe of a bygone era. Here in Canada many of my friends parents' were born in Germany, Hungary, and Romania. I tell them that this book is required reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book was extremely well written by an author who understood history.","review":"I have an abiding interest in Europe during the 1930's, the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany and the final collapse of those countries that belonged to the former Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Wait a year or so and get it for a song, even an out of tune one.

Things blow up spectacularly; this game really pushes current hardware. I use a Athlon XP 1700+ and ATI Radeon All-in-Wonder, and I'm upgrading the video card because higher resolutions are too slow. Note that the game warns about reduced framerates under Windows 2000 (I'm upgrading to XP, too).The missions all seem pretty short (I've played about ten of the thirty). They seem quite variable in difficulty. Sometimes caution is called for, and sometimes a mad, all-out rush is necessary. It's hard to tell when each is appropriate.The sound and video of this game are phenomenal. If you're looking for something to take advantage of your high-end system, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much more arcade than simulator","review":"I was originally disappointed by the low fidelity of this as a simulator. Having flight experience in real helicopters, I was hoping for a lot more realism. My first few minutes of the game were a great disappointment as I realized that all of the aerodynamics that make a helicopter tricky to fly (but extremely fun) are not replicated in this game. Also, I could not find any way to aim the gun manually without moving the whole helicopter. Most combat helos are able to move a turret without the necessity of moving the craft.As a game it is great. After my initial shock of not being able to boost the realism, I sat back and decided to enjoy it with the mindset of playing an arcade. It is much more fun to play if I think of it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy if you have a video card with a TV out!","review":"I have never gotten this game to function with my video card. After a mission loads, the game crashes every time. According to technical support, this game is prone to do this with many video cards with a TV out, and hat they're developing a patch to fix this. It's been almost a year and no patch has appeared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game too difficult","review":"This would be a great game if it had a very easy level of difficulty. The Easy setting is still far too difficult so that I cannot finish the missions. There also are some minor problems with some of the graphics flickering at times. If these were fixed I would rate it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn to do amazing renderings with markers and pastels","review":"As an upcoming concept designer I've been searching for a book which explaines the techniques on how to render a sketch with markers and pastels. This book shows you how to rendering different products with the same technique. Some of them do almost look as if they were a photo. It is much of a Japanese styl, but it really illustrates your idea. Actually, iF Amazon would have shown the cover you would see whats really in this book. If you like those illustrations done by industrial designers, drawn with markers and pastels on vellum, with flying perfect lines, amazing shadows, you will love this book.BUT WAIT! The only bad thing is that it shows you how to work the SAME tachnique on a variety of objects.

At the time I was a beginning knitter, pretty mind-boggled by the information in this book. I used a few of the lace patterns to design dishcloths and put it back on the shelf.Now that I am designing my own patterns and have gotten to be a much better knitter, I've picked this book back up again, amazed at the wealth inside.Modern knitters not exposed to Mary Thomas might not be so pleased with the hand drawings, though they make perfect sense to me now. Also of interest are all the historical references and pictures and once accustomed the quaint, old-fashioned language there is an immense amount of technical information to be had for the designer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book if you design your own knitting patterns.","review":"This small book is jammed full of great stitches and knitting information. Even more, it includes some drawings of some of the more difficult stitches while being knitted (drawings or swatch photos of all stitches as well). There are some photos of finished items, but no instructions (it's a stitch book, after all) but they are great for inspiration and show how a stitch might look in the finished garment. There are many good suggestions for how a stitch can be used (check out the texture index too!) Since the book was originally printed in 1943, some language is out of date. Not for a beginning knitter. Doesn't have the staggering breadth of later stitch collections.

What has happened to him? It seems like he's incapable of writing any other kind of version of himself. As for the film, it was okay, but didn't have much to say.Manhattan is the opposite of that. It has something to say. Or maybe Woody has always had the same thing to say and just decided to keep saying it over and over. I love the way Woody is so changeable in Manhattan, as are Diane Keaton and his best friend. Their feelings keep changing and they have to try and keep up and figure out what they really want, if anything. Even at the end, you don't know if Woody will wait those six months. My guess is no, he won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhapsody in Black & White","review":"You don't have to have been born and raised in Manhattan to fall in love again with each viewing of this contemporary masterpiece, but I was and I do.

Whether Woody is exploring universal truths, questioning our morality, bemoaning our mortality, or hitting you with an Allenism like an uppercut from the floor, he's got you for all 96 minutes.

Not only does he star in this intriguing movie, he also directed the movie, but wait there's more... Woody also wrote the script. The movie was released in 1979 and helped mark a true departure for Woody. Gone were the days of the quick and easy comedy (but not for long), while this movie heralded a more mature Allen and dramatic endeavors.The plot is essentially about Allen as Isaac Davis, a divorced New Yorker that is dating a high schooler (an impressive Mariel Hemingway), who realises he is much more suited for his best friends girlfriend/mistress. Allen is his usually solid self, while Karen Allen is well-cast and suited for her role.This movie is short - clocking in at under 100 minutes - and is filmed in balck and white. It is a great movie with stunning cinematography. Highly recommended. 5 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is My Last Woody Allen Film!","review":"Allen is a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer dating 17-year-old Mariel Hemingway who then falls in love with his friend's mistress Diane Keaton.

It's gorgeous. That said, Allen's character's relationship with Hemingway's character is completely creepy.

I know this movie is rated high by most other people, but unless you love Woody Allen I would pass on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"CREEPY","review":"the cinematography is beautiful. but THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT A CHILD MOLESTER IN A LOVE TRIANGLE. I found the psuedo-sincere tone and romantic sugar coating to enhance the repulsion caused by the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Allen movie","review":"As a seventeen year old, I find myself to be one of the few teenagers who is into Woody Allen. Now as a seventeen year old, I find myself to be the only teenager obsessed with Woody Allen. And this movie is the reason why. I first saw Annie Hall, then Sleeper e.t.c. but this movie is absolutley brilliant. Never has a movie captured Manhattan so vividly like this movie has. Gordon Willis' great cinematography really makes the city a secondary character, next to an all star cast consisting of Micheal Murphy, Diane Keaton, Woody Allen(of course)e.t.c. and a great cameo by Wallace Shawn. This film is brilliantly shot(in B&W), acted, written and directed. If more teenagers would maybe watch films that made them think and really feel, this a great one to get you started."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of teh best Woody Allen movies","review":"This is definetly one of the best (if not the best) Woody Allen movie. It's in B&W which adds a lot to the movie, the music so great and the plot is very inetresting and funny.It's not the usual Woody Allen type comedy, but much deeper and smarter movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woody and New York, in Quintessence","review":"The film's memorable visual overture, set to \\"Rhapsody in Blue,\\" exquisitely captures the beauty of Manhattan: gritty and poetic and pulsating. This is a movie rich in textures, thanks to Gordon Willis's lush black-and-white cinematography and Woody Allen's fine script, which casts a somewhat forgiving eye on its tangled web of relationships. Ultimately, and as only Woody can, the film's bittersweet ending, while not upbeat, manages to be uplifting. Memorable performances from Allen, Mariel Hemingway (her finest performance--bar none), Dianne Keaton, and Michael Murphy. Meryl Streep makes her film debut in a small part. The VHS version was widescreen when widescreen wasn't cool. I only wish that there were some additions for the DVD version, but it's hard to imagine Woody talking about one of his films in such detail. The details are on-screen, I guess, and that's good enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless comedy--as good as it gets","review":"One of the most beautiful, funny, and heartbreaking comedies ever made--a love letter to Allen's favorite city and a wise examination of the absurdities, miseries, and joys of love. The opening sequence could make a mountain hermit take a tour of New York."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manhattan - a defective DVD","review":"This is one of my all time favourite movies so I was thrilled when I received it as a Christmas gift.

We had played a Barney memory game on CD that had a similar concept, so he was familiar with the idea. The game has a LOT of individual cards, which is pretty overwhelming for a 3-year-old. They are broken into four color-coded sets, and the instructions recommend starting with just one set for beginners. I highly recommend this since using too many cards to start with makes the game too long and frustrating for a 3-year-old. Maybe older kids can use the full set or multiple sets without getting bored. We both enjoyed playing and matching up the pairs of cards. He even beat me the first time we played! Although I had to keep reminding him that he could only turn over two cards at each turn. All in all, I think this is a good choice for a child just learning to play games and follow instructions, and is a good brain exercise as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Finest Rock&Roll Film Ever Made","review":"Nothing can compare 2 Purple Rain. It is indeed the finest Rock&Roll film (starring a genuine artist, PRINCE) ever made. Purple Rain is Prince's baby in every aspect.

But this anniversary two-disk release is worth seeing for some of the stuff on the bonus D.V.D.. In particular, the M.T.V. PURPLE RAIN premiere footage features appearances and interviews with Little Richard, John Mellencamp, Eddie Murphy, Weird Al Yankovic, Sheila E. and Pee-Wee Herman. The M.T.V. host asks Eddie Murphy his opinion of PURPLE RAIN but Murphy dodges the question, saying he is such a Prince fan he liked it. Diplomatic of you, Eddie.The M.T.V. program also shows Prince Rogers Nelson for just a moment as he enters the party. Walking past the crowds and cameras, Prince says nothing. (One will note that \\"Personality\\" is a song Prince never sang.) But then, Prince may have chosen to say nothing rather than say we will like the movie.Make sure you read the February 13, 2000, review of PURPLE RAIN for a comprehensive summary of the film's flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Baby Baby...What's it Gonna BE?","review":"If you don't love this movie I don't want to know you.

Look, I would like very much to colonize a planet only with people who love \\"Purple Rain.\\" We would get it done! What is it? Name it.

I must have seen Purple Rain at least 30 times and I can recite every line. There's something about the energy of this film that just captivates u. I love the score and it's no wonder it won Prince an OSCAR. Woohoo! Purple Rain is is genious and the music is timeless. It's hard to believe there is actually a sequel \\"Graffiti Bridge\\", but who really knows that and who kares, right? Eye do! They r both great mooveez, Prince can of course do no wrong, he is tha best artist that ever lived. I have recently been in a Prince funk and watched all of his films over the last week, watching all of them at least 2 times each and they never get old, I can watch them a hundred more times.

His direction and editing for the musical portions of this film are perfect. But the plot that serves as the backdrop is somewhat weak and fragmented. Morris Day is supposed to be Prince's romantic rival for Apolonia, but in a scene where they are drunk and showing affection for each other in back of the night club, he doesn't even try to hug her before Prince sweeps her away on his motorcycle. The film's musical numbers are not to be missed, Take Me With You and Computer Blue being my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"another world","review":"Purple Rain single handedly defined a subculture that had never before been seen by the public eye.

I went through three copies of the LP and four cassette tapes before I ever got a CD! The movie is, as usual, great, but I feel that they could have transferred it better for bluray quality. The extras were great! I'd never seen anything about the making of the film and was surprised to see interviews with the filmakers and stars (no Prince, Morris Day or Appolonia in sight).

This movie isn't \\"The Godfather\\" but it's disturbing that \\"Purple Rain\\" was a masterpiece that defined an important moment for Prince in his career.If you base the movie for what it is without the music to gulde it the bad acting,barely a story. But the music was the driving force of this film. I enjoyed revisiting this moment in time. The HD DVD transfer is a mixed bag was really good; the Dolby True HD is awesome!! The bonus features are folked over from both DVD releases in which makes this the full package for fans of the movie and Prince. I think with the movie and music joining toghether to creat a entertaining movie. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end justifies the means","review":"OK, so it's a dismal premis for a movie. The main character is horrendously egocentric, and he beats his girlfriend. Not very happy. But, the music rocks! And, somehow I can't help but feel excited and pumped up at the end of the movie. Why did Baby I'm A Star never get extended airplay? The filming is pretty good for an 80's movie, and though the acting leaves a bit to be desired, it's pretty much par for the time, and above so for the genre.Regardless of whatever you may find slightly lacking, the feel at the end of the movie more than makes up for it. It's definitely worth adding to your video collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner skimps on DVD treatment","review":"Great film, as everybody already knows, but the DVD is very disappointing. Maybe Warner can use the upcoming \\"20th aniversary\\" of the film as an excuse to put out a new and improved \\"special edition.\\" There have to been many deleted scenes, because if you check out the trailer, there are a few clips in it that were not in the movie. Aside from that discovery, you should just keep your VHS copy for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost to horrid to describe","review":"After viewing this film, I think it's a miracle it didn't destroy Prince's career. The man can sing and dance, but an actor he is not! In fact, the only actors in this traffic accident of a movie are Morris Day and the guy that played The Kid's father, Clarence Williams III. And at best, Day is a comedien, not an actor.

Astonishingly bad that is. From what I understand, Prince is actually a pretty nice guy with lots of musical talent, but this movie won't win him any nice guy points. Okay Seinfeld may have lampooned the \\"Puffy Shirt\\" but Prince seems to even sleep in them. His outfits are so flamey even Dennis Rodman would tell him \\"tone it down homey\\". The acting is at the quality level of your typical porno movie, and the script...well all I can say is there should be a death penalty for bad scriptwriting. The only notable exception is Morris Day, who can act! I actually liked Day and the music of his band \\"The Time\\" compared to Prince's wierd rock & roll funkadelic poopy music. The movie desperately wanted me to like Prince, but I was unshaken and never got to liking the little purple sprite, sorry....All in all, give it a miss.

I was disappointed in the quality of this DVD movie. Most of the scenes are just too dark to enjoy. It's like they turned off all the lights. I wonder how this happens to movies? Age? Heat?

Two hours I'll never get back. When I watched this movie, my emotions ran from amusement, to boredom, to disgust and finally to rage. This is nothing more than an over-long commercial for Prince, and a monument to his colossal ego. Thank God for the \\"bad guy\\", Morris Day. He was the only likeable person in the movie. Clarence Williams III was also excellent, and way too good to be wasting his talent in this pap.

All these years later, I can tell you the music has held up better than the motion picture itself. To watch PURPLE RAIN today, make sure your remote control has fresh batteries as you will want to fast-forward through the film's awkward, often dull story to reach the next super-charged concert song by Prince, the Time, and Apollonia 6.Too bad PURPLE RAIN did not settle on what by default was its most interesting non-musical aspect: the rivalry between the two bands that headline the local club. Instead, a romance that seems to blossom through slap-fighting and visits with a dysfunctional family in full bloom fighting distract from what might have been an engrossing battle of the bands.Last but not least, how come no one calls the police in the movies, even when a goon is throwing a woman in a garbage dumpster on a busy city street during the daytime?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best you can buy out there...","review":"the best present i have ever baught, sister loves that i got her both at once, plus its the all time greatest movie ever by a music artist"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely film.

I was required to go through the 7 Habits at work and it was such a waste of my time. It's common sense with Covey's veiws added. Sorry, but not everyone has the money or resources Mr. Covey does and thus his 7 Habits are not very usefull in the long run to most people. Also take note that Mr. Covey is Mormon and you can tell it's an influence in the writing of the 7 Habits as he recommends readings from his Mormon works.

Meanwhile, back at the \\"LDS Ranch\\" their little followers discriminate against middle aged single women in the workplace--apparently, they prefer bare-foot & pregnant types--I know this because I've experienced doors slammed in my face by a myriad of their LDS-run companies. MR. Covey should write a book addressed to his fellow LDS \\"sheeple\\" on how to treat \\"outsiders\\" with respect--otherwise, their lies & cult behaviour will be more & more exposed & will only send them to their demise (ask a Catholic priest!!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the bible instead!","review":"Steven Covey, although he is exceptionally talented at writing, among other things, is a Mormon.

Honestly, as a minister, I write sermons week in and week out and I keep this book at my elbow for reference. I have hi-lighted, underlined and notated this book through and through. Covey truly hit a home run in distilling seven principle-driven habits that, when applied, can change one's life for the better.

I was expecting another crappy \\"Make a pie chart of how you use your time\\" sort of book, and this is not that at all. It's all about taking control of your life from the inside out - even with things you didn't realize you had control over, like how to deal with a break-up =-)It can be a bit theoretical at times, and so if you're looking for a light read, this isn't for you. However, if you love learning truth, you'll find a lot here. The amazing thing is that the book covers things that you know deep inside, but Covey presents it in a light that not only promotes understanding but causes it to stick with you.My initial reaction to 7 habbits was a feeling like a thousand different theories and ideas that I had been thinking about finally came together to form something beautiful.

This book takes you through the change, which will affect how you perceive and act regarding productivity, time management, positive thinking, developing your 'proactive muscles' (acting with initiative rather than reacting), and much more. This isn't a quick-tips-start-tomorrow kind of book. The concepts are sometimes intricate, and you'll want to study this book, not skim it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth re-reading","review":"I just re-read Seven Habits. I may have learned more this time than the first time through. It's profound and affecting, though Covey's preachy tone sometimes gets in the way of his message and at times he can belabor the obvious. Still, it's a must read. I also recommend his First Things First, as well as First Break All the Rules, and above all Barry Maher's Filling the Glass, which is at least as powerful and profound, never patronizes and replaces Covey's moralizing with humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far like what I'm hearing. ^_^","review":"I got this b/c as a full time step mom I really don't get the time to read my kids r both tween's so with drama of all sorts to deal with this is how I tend to get most books lol but still I like this one so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"Arrived very quickly!

The rest of the book is repetitive. The book is a constant contradiction to the concepts it preaches. Covey repeatedly condemns the band-aid solution to a problem while at the same time suggesting that by reading a book people can solve the problems of their lives, this in itself seems to be a band-aid solution. Preaching is an appropriate term to describe this book. If you enjoy others telling you how to live your life, not to center yourself around your family or to constantly visualize your own death, this is a must have book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been touched!","review":"I laughed at the title when I heard about it first time and I kinda looked down readers of this book before. I knew it got a lot of rave reviews and still didn't feel like reading it until one day... So think again, if you are making the same mistake as I did before. You have no idea what you'll miss.One of the most important habits I learnt from this book is 'Be proactive'. I stopped whining about situations and always kept working in my own 'circle of influence' since then.Be humble when you read this book and you'll learn a *lot* from it.Though I would say I'm still far from success, this book greatly contributed to the last promotion in my corporate life before leaving for my own business.I don't write my own mission statement and Big Mac is waaaayyy too far from being a great meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 habits of highly effective people","review":"The book is a great read for the person that wants to get focused on a life balance.

In this CD (with the blue cover) you are constantly interrupted during Covey's interesting seminar, by a woman narrator who talks about what Covey is getting ready to talk about.

I realize that it has been helpful to many people, but it just doesn't do it for me. Mr. Covey seems to be a master of the obvious. I find the book boring. It doesn't engage me to finish the next section. I don't find many of his examples to be exciting. I don't find his commentary to be very insightful. It's just a lot of empty fluff.The book seems to be written at a very low level. Perhaps that makes it useful to the maximum number of people. To me, its just too light weight.I had an opportunity to see Mr. Covey speak several years ago. When he started talking about writing a \\"mission statement\\" for his family, he really lost me. To me, it just seems weird and unrealistic.I have found Wayne Dyer's books to be much more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The enemy of the best is the good!","review":"I read this book years ago and have recommended it to my colleagues and employees. The book clarifies the path from dependence to interdependence, a path many people do not fully understand. I have been a CEO for the past 20 years and have never been one to settle for second best.

It has ideas like take your life into your own hands, don't let life drive you.But it doesn't tell you how to do it.For instance if I tell you Be a great basketball player, that's not a habit. You have to do several smaller steps to become one, which the book doesn't tell you.It's also not motivating.If you want a good book, read the \\"magic of thinking big\\"However, be aware, no book can change your life, like many reviewers say.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biblically inspired.","review":"This book is a refresher course in biblical values. In my view, the only sin in the New Testament is pride, as I willnot count all the sins previously mentioned in the Old Testament. Those sins being sloth, gluttony, lust, adultery(adultery meaning something much worse and horrible, however this is because of young people) and others.For Dr. Covey to take the time to write this self-help book is very reassuring, as it means that more people willturn to the source and read the bible, preferably in Aramaic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a hit if you continue to think your own thoughts..","review":"Well, Stephen Covey really gains popularity, but I still wonder why it is so easy to earn money on the obvious? It is a good book, but with a wrong approach from the reader, it may turn out as a religious book or a bible. I guess that's not what Stephen wants, but if you keep your head cool and adopt the goodies from the script, the book may be a shortcut to a successful life in many ways. It is still essential to think by your self, your own thoughts. With a correct approach this book should be a good help for people with minds stuck in dead ends...bearing in mind that no one but yourself can do the necessary work. Read it, judge it, use it, but most important: Improve your life with or without it. Dale Carnegie would perhaps have written this book if he had been alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended for all who are Serious about Success","review":"Stephen Covey's work is one of the greatest influences of our time. The principles are good practice at work as well as in our personal lives. The book version is a bit intense, but the concepts were easier for me to grasp in the audio form. After listening to this series many times while driving in my car, I find that the these valuable concepts are burned into my bio-computer to help me in all types of situations. I highly recommend this resource in the Management Skills Seminars I present to all who are serious about being an effective leader at work, home, or their community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change must come from within, the principle of inside-out","review":"An excellent book that shows you how to change your life for the better. It will help you to become a highly effective person in all areas of your life but you have to work at the 7 Habits and really live them. Steven deals with how we see the world, our personal paradigms and how we can CHOOSE to see the world through eyes that are open to change, CHOOSE to welcome and celebrate other peoples points of view and differences and how we can CHOOSE to deal with our lives in a positive and confidant manner.A unique book that deals with the unique you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"very good book, according to my wife as i am not a reading person, any way you can read a preview before buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"good advice. hard to implement, but bought book to remind me to keep trying.

I became bored very quickly and almost felt anger that this man had taken MY hard earned money!!! 40 pages would have been ample to cover what this person has blown out over 300 plus pages.

So here, instead, are two snippets which seem to me to sum up the whole spirit and content of this SERIOUSLY OVER-RATED book:On pages 86-88 we are told that we must all be proactive, because being proactive is better than anything. Particularly if your boss is an ignorant tyrant - in which case you should proactively start sucking up to him before anyone else gets in as No. 1 \\"yes\\" man.You should also learn to practise emotional blackmail wherever you can. Treat other people nicely, so that they always \\"owe you one\\", especially your friends and relations (Covey calls this creating an \\"emotional bank account\\"!) (pp.188-202).So, if that's your idea of how a \\"successful\\" person would behave, then this may be the book for you.If you're aiming for something with rather more integrity, however, then I'd recommend that you avoid this book like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot's of Ahh Hahh's","review":"I found this book to be helpful and inspiring.

The same thing happened with Steven Covey. I was hoping for some good advice from an author recommended by Bill Clinton, but instead what I got was advice on making personal mission statements, and thoughts about how a quadrant II focus is a paradigm that grows out of a principle center. This was not helpful for me. Maybe I am just a partially effective person. Not sure. I may go back and skim the book periodically, just to be proactive, but probably not, because I don't want to bring my iPad into the bathroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common sense organized.","review":"Common sense and then some.

The seven habits are (1) Be Proactive, (2) Begin With the End in Mind, (3) Put First Things First, (4) Think Win/Win, (5) Seek First to Understand, then to be Understood, (6) Synergize, and (7) Sharpen the Saw. Number five is fairly self explanatory, though all these fundamental principles are a bit more complicated than their titles might suggest. Regardless, they reall can make a positive impact on your life, both personally and professionally. As the author states, true success encompasses a balance of both personal and professional effectiveness. Well written, easy to understand, and highly practicable advice. I owe many of the successes I've had in my life to these materials. It only takes a day or two to read them, yet you'll undoubtedly refer back to the book again, again, and again. Very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Common sense that can be summarized in a few pages, not a whole book","review":"There is no great insight from this book, but just common sense that is told with a complex language that is quite difficult to follow at times.

Stephen Covey hadn't helped me at all with the thousand page boredom with everyday common sense in it. When I first saw this book, I thought it was very helpful since so many people bought or recommended this book, but when I began to read it, I thought all of it was totally rubbish and nonsense with absolutely no help for me. All it talked about was beliefs, and it was meant to be something to change you're habits. If you're planning to buy this book, DON'T, as you will regret it. Instead, I would rather recommend \\"7 Habits for Highly Effective TEENS\\" for teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"I'm giving one star only because there is no \\"zero star\\" designation.

I had to present material from it at two work-related seminars. It is tough to read. THE SHEER VOLUME OF USED COPIES AVAILABLE SHOULD INDICATE IT'S LACK OF ENDURING VALUE. People just are not keeping this book! The amount of effort spent in analyzing the habits and applying them is astounding. You can roll this book up and squeeze it into the \\"Golden Rule\\" and save yourself a lot of time and effort. The anecdotes are mildly amusing. This book is not for the person who is directly involved with the 1)customer 2) project 3)product (choose one or more)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book reminded me of a long-winded church sermon.

Covey is very POSITIVE, his endless encouragement to go out and \\"quit whining and do something about it\\" can be infectious (of course this message involves plenty of diagrams and long, tedious passages). If he could keep the book pitched at this level I would be an enthusiast, unfortunately he does not...This book is interesting - partly because so many people swear by it - but I did not find it GREAT and remain slightly puzzled by all those converts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to its reputation","review":"Not that this book needs yet another booster, but I really wish I had read it years ago.

Somewhere along the line (from a certain kind of parent, perhaps, or a certain kind of teacher?) they learned that IIDHIAW - \\"If it don't hurt, it ain't working\\". Or as Jane Fonda put it: \\"No pain, no gain\\".And some people have captured that message and turned it into a book.Well, this is one of those IIDHIAW books. And readers who believe that pain is the only effective teacher will love every morsal of this trite nonsense.Readers who enjoy average to high self esteem, on the other hand, will most likely hate it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the cassettes first","review":"If you're a busy person, you're likely to be attracted to this book. But if you're a busy person, it's difficult to appreciate this book because it takes quite a bit of concentration. What worked for me: Listen to the tapes first--while you're doing chores at home or cleaning up your office space. The tapes will win you over, and you will be ready for the book. I love reading portions of this book over and over again. I apply these principles at work, as well as in the classroom when I teach. Covey is a gifted teacher, and this book will provide you the guidelines and tools to succeed at what is truly important to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"why americans need the obvious spelled out","review":"Typical american plastic people language stating the absolutely obvious.

Basically, I hated this book. The author makes assumptions about human nature while showing no prior research or experimentation. Also, his language is way too flowery; if an author has very flowery words that have no meaning in themselves and he gives them no meaning, this is the sign of a bad book (such as: \\"look inside yourself\\", \\"How you see the problem is the problem\\", \\"a deeper level of understanding\\".

The vocabulary is cute rather than useful or insightful. I'm glad that many have obtained value from this book, but I just see it as seminar-selling hoopla.

In many ways it's a general purpose psychology book, dealing with such things as motivation, organizational skills, and how to deal with stress. It's chock full of seemingly unique information, and interesting quotes and tidbits. For example, it states \\"Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.\\" The book isn't boring or repetitive, and is written in a pleasing, conversational manner.

We are spiritual beings having a human experience.\\" The Seven Habits are showing us the importance of having principles-centered life as opposed to one governed by occasional moods and prejudices. Once we realize who we are and where we want to be, we could change our environment - we could shape it according to our aspirations, and choose the people and events we want to associate ourselves with.

I loved listening it in the car while I was driving to and from work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Reading","review":"Most of the self motivational suggestions, although accurate, have been regurgitated in every self help book over the last decade and as a result were uninspiring. It is extremely difficult to believe that I could lessen my stress by following Mr. Coveys P/PC Balance Equation and classifing my daily/weekly activities into the 4 Quadrant Time Management Matrix. Perhaps Mr. Covey has the time to list each of his key roles and create 2 weekly goals for each role and then document those goals on a weekly scheduler, but I certainly do not. In fact, I believe that the committment to adhere to such a system would result in my stressful demise. I am disheartened that I had to write such a vitriolic review of this book. After reading many rave reviews I had grandiose expectations from Mr. Covey and that has surely led me to this level of disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the time it takes to read.","review":"This book is not about an instant life transformation. It is about creating a mental perception change and the acquisition of self-purpose in life for success. This book is a little longwinded and a challenge to get through. You will need a highlighter to write notes in the margins to enable you to keep track of the valuable points and \\"Habits.\\" I found the diagrams extremely useful; they help to clarify the valuable information contained within the book. The overall message of this Motivational self-help book is excellently delivered through the 7 habits and will help the reader become a highly effective person if they act on the advice.

I am apprehensive of authors who see their writing as a cathartic exercise. The book is supposed to be about effective habit. The church has nothing to do with it (unless only church going people can aim to pick up these habits). Its annoying to see Stephen mention church and god every so often. The book is a total let down as far as I am concerned.Stephen and everyone else should read \\"How to get ideas\\" and \\"Ideaship\\" by Jack Foster to understand what engaging writing is all about. I guess when authors don't have a lot to say they hide behind buzz words hoping readers won't get it. I am amazed at how people got bought in by his empty talk.Do they even understand what he is taking about?P.S - His charts and diagrams make no sense. I am an engineer and i read charts and graphs everyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't help","review":"I was excited when this book first came out because I really needed the help. But i must admit, this book did absolutely nothing for me. My boss still walked all over me. My ex-wife still hated me. My kids still wouldn't talk to me. And the bottle still called to me. The only thing buying this book helped was Covey's bank account. If you're considering buying this book, i strongly suggest you look elsewhere, like the Catholic Church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid miniature edition","review":"Like another reader, I somehow buyed this edition which is microscopical in size. There are two problems:1) I guess the text is abridged because the content is not very cohesive.2) As the book is so small, it is impossible to get a sense of the structure of the content.If you had asked me right after reading the book what the 7 habits were, I wouldn't have been able to answer to you.

I for one think that living my life by following a mission statement and 7 habits sounds like a drag. I don't think our reason for living is to be \\"effective.\\" I'm not sure what it is for and I like it that way. It is good to not always react to things and take control of your life (Habit 1-Be proactive.) Keeping your priorities straight is smart advice also as is trying to be a better listener and understanding what others are really trying to say. There is nothing wrong with self-improvement, so I can see where this book could be handy. Yet, I must wonder, has Covey said anything in this book that hasn't been said before or that isn't blatantly obvious?

If you don't like a book...hey, that's one thing. To pretend like you're an all knowing intellect who thinks they know what's good for everyone is a totally different ballgame....and ironically, a ballgame that makes you the kind of individual that Mr. Covey is describing...but that's just my opinion.A very good book......'nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless miniature version!","review":"Didn't expect to receive a miniature version.

Leadership is not about dragging people through projects and initiatives, but rather, it is inspiring them to see the value in those ideas and to create an environment where they are encouraged to excel. In my management consulting career, I have been most successful and effective when I am able to get others to \\"own\\" their ideas. That means focusing on results, while allowing individuals latitude to discover their own best processes. What do those who work for you do when you're not around to oversee their efforts?

This is what really made things happen for me. I started to see myself in a totally different way, which allowed me to change from the inside out, not just in a superficial way, like so many other self-help books have (at least for me).

It's an outrage, really. He's trying to tell you how to live your life. He's trying to change your beliefs. That should be up to the individual, not some book. You should not be listening to this man who himself has never done anything important. Do a complete philosophical review of your life. See if all your thinking needs to be changed. Covey begins with the assumption that you should stay where you are and make the best of it. That really means he's indoctrinating you for your employer. It's outrageous. I'm sure that it conflicts with many of your religious beliefs, readers. You should think about that. Don't do this half-way fix that's going to try to make you feel better and do nothing to help you as a person. Go to someone -- a philosopher, priest, psychiatrist -- who might actually give you help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hand it to Covey--And A Recommendation","review":"The Seven Habits of... does indeed show you how to be more effective. What I like about the book is that Covey isn't just a cut-throat, success-at-all costs adviser. Embedded within his \\"system\\" of effectiveness is the recognition of the importance of quality of life; while your professional bottom-line is likely to improve if you follow his advice, that's not the whole point. Another book I recently finished and loved, which gives practical advice with a strong undercurrent of wisdom is The Mindful Money Guide. It addresses all the various aspects of one's financial life and can help improve your fiscal bottom-line, but without losing your soul. It's also fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People","review":"Highly recommend this book for anyone sincerely wanting to make a difference in their life and the life of others. I recommend that to get the most of the book, that you study it rather than just reading it. You need to take notes, make a journal and teach these principles to others in order to really make a difference in the change you desire in your life and the lives of others. Merely reading this book will give you greater insight to change but applying the principles found in the book as I listed above by using them in your life will give you the most for your buck.I would personally like to thank Stephen Covey for writing this book and the work book too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i like this book","review":"if you're bored with life or if you love life, it's for anyone. this book will help us realize why we want what we want, and what we should and shouldn't change based on desired results, and where we will end up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bill of Judeo-Christian Goods","review":"This book poses as a guide to personal efficacy but is too deeply colored by Covey's religious views. Throughout it he speaks of \\"correct principals\\" which our clearly his Christian values. There are many great authors out there who have covered this ground with greater depth and made it more useful to the reader without trying to convert you to a their personal value system (I recommend Lou Tice and Albert Bandura). This book may not help you be more effective, but it will definitely teach you how to become more like Steve Covey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I had high hopes for this book but the beginning was boring and very repetitive. As much as I tried I could not finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Personal Growth and Development","review":"I have read and studied approaches to personal growth over the years. In recent years due to health challenges that pursuit has taken on more spiritual pursuits. I have read and listened to Stephen Covey for almost 20 years. I had the great pleasure of hearing Stephen Covey in person. I happened to bump into Mr. Covey during a break in the day's activities. He was walking with several people and I apologized for interrupting that I might have a brief word with him. He was patient and totally attentive to what I had to say. I felt as though we were long time friends and that he was genuinely interested in me. Stephen Covey is the real deal. His teachings are not about techniques and personality. They are about principles and character. Take the time to do the exercises. They will benefit your mind, your body, your soul, and those around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid model","review":"If you haven't read this book, you should. It has some good ideas and presents a solid model. My only concern is the focus on time management and the personal planner. If we are to become a society entirely obsessed with time management and personal effectiveness, perhaps we are missing the joy of rambling without purpose. But, if you need greater time management and effectiveness, there are some excellent and helpful concepts in this book. I have found the circle of concern/influence to be a timeless lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"illuminating","review":"This is a book which will change your life! I have finally found a self-help book which really concentrates on profound matters and provides readers with a systematic set of exercises to improve their life. I have finally found an American author who claims that success is never fulfilled until it is shared with love and understanding. All other theories on life improvement seem to focus on private success, money-making and antiseptic strategies on how to persuade people to do things you don't even believe in. Follow this magnificent book and you will learn how to live and love better."},{"rating":"2","title":"sure it may be","review":"Sure some people speak on about it being all common sense. And sure people can say that it repetitive. But the fact is, if its such common sense why do most people not follow the advise?The truth is something only becomes common sense through repetition. And the more something is repeated the more likely it will influence the subconscious. So of course the book is common sense and redundant for it has to be for people to be influenced by it. I personally liked the book and I hope others do too. If not, I hope some other book out there can tell you what you want to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life......","review":"I was reading a Dale Carnegie book at jury duty 10 years ago when a fellow juror told me he had also read the book I was reading. He then said he had read pretty much every book out on personal growth and that hands down the very best one in his opinion is the 7 habits. This guy just lit up as he started talking about how much it had changed his life, so on the way home I bought it for myself and started reading it that night. I could not put it down. It rang of so much wisdom. The thing that I love about the 7 habits is that it is a systematic, wholistic, and step by step approach. If you follow the 7 habits you will figure out what your true mission in life is and also have a framework to achieve it. It touches on everything that is important Family, Friends, Health, etc. Like the guy at Jury duty told me, I am telling you. This is the best book ever written on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple yet profound!","review":"I really enjoyed reading \\"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\\" by Stephen R Covey. Covey starts with the premise everyone is born with these traits and one has to practice and cultivate them.My favorite chapter is \\"WIN/WIN\\". Covey's premise is there are 6 paradigms of humans interaction and that WIN/WIN is not a technique it is a philosophy of human interaction. Relationships can be mutually beneficial, everybody wins! \\"It is not my way or your way but a better way, a higher way.\\" This chapter reminds me of the \\"Golden Rule\\" (Do unto others what you would like them to do to you) which I was taught as a child.Another book I really enjoyed was Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment by award winning authors Ariel & Shya Kane, This is a wonderful book of short stories that are all about accessing the moment and living a satisfying and fulfilling life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definite Must Have","review":"The \\"7 Habits\\" are what separate successful leaders from others. Stephen Covey lays it out so effortlessly yet with the passion of someone you know has been there and done that. Our company presents an annual four-day leadership retreat and the \\"7 Habits\\" are the foundation around which the exercises and discussions are built."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of rubbish","review":"I was doing pretty well with this book until I came to the part where he was demonstrating effective listening skills with a conversation he supposedly had with his son about staying in school. The conversation was ridiculous to anyone who has teenage children. With just a few choice sentences he convinced his son that staying in school is the right and proper thing to do and the beauty part was the kid thinks he convinced himself! Rubbish! This was a dialogue made up by the author to make a point although he says it really happened. If it did then I'm Santa Claus. I stopped reading at that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Effectice People","review":"I feel a lot of what's written here is a rip off of author L.

Never felt that 'a ha' moment. Even tried the CD's but, again, I was left cold and only temporarily inspired.However, I know folks that have changed their whole productivity patterns as a result of this book - so I know that it does good for some folks. I'm almost jealous of them for having such success!I like Tony Robbins better even though Covey considers him nothing more than a pep talk. Robbins is more my age and much more dynamic of a personality (entertaining). I'm productive in my own way and style; and having fun on this globe still rules over any acedemic or professional accomplishments that could be derived by trading my world for a seat in quadrant 2.But, who knows, I may find the inspiration to try this 7 Habit program one more time, just not yet. Again, that is only because I've SEEN it work for others in a BIG TIME way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive Self-Help Fluff","review":"This is the most overly-used and overly repetitive books I have yet to come across.

If you get something from it, great, but any critical reader wont be so tricked into thinking they have become enlightened."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Turn Yourself Into A Robot","review":"I don't know why so many people think this book is so special. What I saw in it was just ideas that we all know explained in a way so complicated with confusing drawings and schematics that make the book very annoying. Even without this practice of easy concepts into rocket science, the ideas seem unnatural and contrary to the things that make us human. Maybe it is just what some people want so they can translate each activity into a formula or a matrix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ethics Might Count","review":"Covey has 9 children and 49 grandchildren, and a personal empire.Is this a habit we should all emulate to make the world a better place? Or is it the ultimate statement of the self-seeking greed that has created the world of suffering we live in now?For some books, the author's personal life or lifestyle are irrelevant. But when someone is pushing their concept of Christian ethics on others, they had better look in their own hypocritical closet first. Or maybe Brittney Spears should write a book entitled \\"A Life in Service of Others: using fame and wealth that you didnt earn to benefit the less fortunate.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Common Sense","review":"This book is overrated.

They are the books, How To Win Friends And Influence People, The Little Guide To Happiness, and this book, The Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People. All best sellers, and all deserving to be.

If you have a teen who you wish to mold then I suggest books like these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"The book is not at all what I expected.

Corporate America's visionary managers who happen to have read this first have bought into its \\"pull yourself by your bootstaps\\" mentality and indoctrinated all of their subordinates into this operation groupthink as well, which accounts for its specatular ability to still make money for the author.If you have the ability to set goals and plot out logical steps to achieve those goals, then skip this book. If you have reached the management level already or are in sales, this book reiterates what you already know. Covey will add no insite to you, other than your ability to decipher why your co-workers keep \\"sharpening their saws\\" around the water cooler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it's common sense! But we all need reminders.","review":"The reader from 3/97 is unduly harsh and critical. If he/she had \\"sat down and given some thought\\" he/she would realize that not everyone is as smart and wise and \\"effective\\" (Not!) as he/she is. Some people need a little help.

Poor job, Stephen!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting to me.","review":"I have been told countless times that I have to read this book, and that it is quite fantastic. Unfortunately I found it quite dull to read. I used to have a paper copy of the teen version(Seven Habits of Highly Effective Teens) of this book, but gave it away due to lack of interest. I was finally coerced into buying this digital copy by my boss who thought that all of his interns should read it. I was informed that it was much better than the teen version.

As a psychotherapist and success researcher, I see so often that the ability to actually make meaningful changes in our lives is an enormous challenge, even when the desire for the results of those changes and the seeming willingess is present. Sometimes it is even hard to notice our ineffective habits, as they are so second-nature to us. Therefore, we need something more to make new habits permanent and workable. Dr. Covey offers a bigger context, speaking as he does about our life's mission and our ability to discover and offer our unique contribution. Additionally the advise he offers is practical. In my experience of studying and working with successful people, they have both -- the context and the practical solutions. This book can result in greater satisfaction and success when \\"used as directed.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"7 Habits, Zero Insights","review":"Most overrated book of the decade.

Guess I'll have to take my loss, but I will not be so trusting anymore. I think I deserve some sort of credit for getting such a disappointing book, not as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either you got it or you don't!","review":"This book is filled with some useful knowledge. However, many of the issues brought up are things that usually people are born with and they can't be learned. Successful people were observed to find these characteristics, and they didn't read this book. I am very doubtful that many people will read this book and walk away a much grander person. One will probably find one or two things to work on, but the book is too wordy and long to be worth most people's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Earn the Hype","review":"Covey has some good principles, but those that make the most sense are really stating the obvious.

I remember seeing this movie on the big screen when I was little.I was so moved by young Larry Fishburn performance that I found myself crying right along with him during the big tearjerking scene. So much talent even at that young age of 12. It's hard to believe that the sweet kid in \\"Cornbread Earl and Me\\" grew up to be the mean Ike Turner in \\"What's Love Got To Do With It\\"! One of my favorite movies as a child, \\"Cornbread Earl and Me\\" is now one of my children's favorite.

It features outstanding acting, excellent cinematography, and incredible musical scores! My favorite part in the whole movie is the song that introduces the main character \\"Cornbread.\\" I hope that you enjoy this movie as much as I have and do. In fact this movie has inspired a small Cornbread groupie movement amongst the counselors and lifeguards at a certain up-scale mountain resort.

Here's the kicker: I gave them the system requirements for the CD Burner, my system specs, and how I had the burner set up. So after that I contacted I/O magic's tech support, and I still haven't gotten a response after a week. So this thing is coming out of my computer and going back to the store.

This is one of those books I would suggest to anyone wanting to know what it is to walk their talk and LIVE their path.

I miss the good 'ol days!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie! One of the best!","review":"I absolutely LOVE this movie! I first watched this movie on the Disney Channel when I was 5 years old, and it was one of the first movies I watched and actually liked back then, this and Care Bears. It might sound kinda crazy, since I'm 13, but there's a few things about Rainbow Brite that I like. First, the characters are really cute, especially the sprites, and the animation and music is great. I watched a few of the old Rainbow Brite episodes on tape a few years back, but I think the movie is much better! My little brother saw it last week, and he's totally for it! Oh, and if some of you anime fans out there like shows like Sailor Moon, you'll like this, too! Get it and you'll see what I mean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Very pleased with how fast it was received and the great condition it was in. My grandbabies love the show.

I had the dolls, I saw all the episodes, I was so into it. Years later, I see the movie on cable and I must say it was a lot better than I thought! The plot was really cool, and it really took me back. Best of all, even though it's supposed to be a kids movie, it blew me, a teenager, away! Thanks Amazon for bringing it all back. By the way, now I'm into Sailor Moon--No doubt I got a thing for chick heroes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Stealer that's right!!!!","review":"Rainbow Bright and the star Stealer is totally a movie to own if your big on 80's cartoons.

Rainbow with the help of her horse Starlight the magic of the color belt and a newhero name Chris, Rainbow must save the world from lossing colorforever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I remember","review":"You can definitely tell times have changed by watching older shows such as this. The colors aren't as vibrant as I remembered. I let my 3 and 4 year old nieces watch this and it didn't hold there attention very long. It does make you realize the educational strides we have made over the past few decades, though. This movie showed when good vs. bad; good wins...much like all cartoons of that time. Now adays cartoons are teaching our children the alphabet, numbers, sharing, caring, and even different languages! I say stick with today's programs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price!!","review":"What a savings, I used for a special project and it worked perfectly for what I purchased it for, thanks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves","review":"Love the book.

What a disappointment! The sound is terrible! How can it be worse than his GH CD from 1987.I bought Wichita Lineman Remastered from the same label \\"Capitol\\" and it sounded great.

Everything just works in this video, a real treat to watch and has some good lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Warming Memories","review":"This is a wonderful story the was quite enjoyable to read. Mr. Smith paints a vivid picture of the life he experienced growing up in a small town during the 30's and 40's.

The second thing that appealed to me was that it rocks! The Nelson Riddle Orchestra stuff is particularly good. With Riddle realizing that Dean's approach was more laid back than Sinatra's, his arrangements fit Dino's style perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 decent if unremarkable & 1/2 truly wretched","review":"The two stars is for Road to Ruin only!! It's a decent story although somewhat slow. A fake marriage of convenience, a false charge of murder, and a trumped-up scandal -- plenty to work with here.Metzger's 3 short stories, however, are abysmal. The first is mildly entertaining only becuase if the hero's terror of losing his hair. The second is fairly interesting even though the reader can sense what's going on from the very start, until the the end when the revelation of the truth makes absolutely no difference. The third story is so ridiculous that I can't even discuss it. One word will suffice--Elvis! Egads! All 3 equal a big fat zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum!","review":"These have a great taste and go great with my raw recipes.

This is coming from someone who is not black, but watches this movie set black people back 100 years. From the domineering husband to the fake African homage. Then to top it off, they make black people seem like they have no sense at all.I mean, you got the father, who talks in a fake English accent. Then the mother who acts like a total victim in the whole movie. Plus add the recluse brother and the political activist brother, especially with their constant bickering and you have got another civil war type movie, only modern and black. The people who made this move need to crawl back in a cave and stay there....."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"I bought this camcorder back in November of 2001. I used it until March, when it got stolen. I really enjoyed owning this camera. It's light, easy to maneuver, and the menus are easy to navigate. However, it did not take very good shots in bright light. It comes with all the cables and software necessary to hook on to the computer and to the TV. RCA discontinued this model, but if you come across it, buy it-I recommend this camcorder to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay camcorder with consolidated features","review":"I bought this camera from the HSN.com for... with an upgraded 16MB removable memory. The picture quality of the video is better than a VHS-C camcorder but not better than the ANY Sony 8mm camcorder. Don't let the 400X digital zoom open your eyes. A Sony with 320X digital zoom doesnt break-up compared to the RCA w/ 400x. The still feature of the RCA is only good for close ups with good lighting. It is 480x640. This is one of the lowest resolution settings on cheap digital cameras. I believe that this is equivalent to 0.3 megapixels. For the price it is okay. But for... you are better buying a Sony 8mm camcorder at Walmart for... and then the 2.1 megapixel Sony digital camera for the same price.

I've seen it a couple of times and I find it mysterious, moody, visually lush and interesting, and suspenseful. And I can't remember when Scheider was better (except, maybe, in JAWS). Don't let Maltin's review scare you off this one -- I think it is a great rainy-Saturday-afternoon movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Mystery","review":"One of the best hommages to Alfred Hitchcock around, but it also stands on its own as a super mystery.

Without this option, you cannot download, customize or select a design. If you can't do that....you can't print the tattoo for your phone. The site was: [...]. The link no longer exists on the Motorola site.Amazon, Motorola & Avery all use outsourced Customer Service agents that speak broken English but do not understand clear English.

Buy a case or pre-made sticker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"I would have rated it 5 stars, however, use of the \\"clear transfer sheet\\" is tricky. I ended up just carefully applying the tattoo without it, and it came out great. The printing does not rub off at all (as one customer reported); it would definitely rub off of the \\"practice sheet\\" or the clear sheet, but maybe it was due due to the type of printer used, i.e., laser. It is meant for inkjet printers only. Anyway, I downloaded the software and then used my own .jpg files. It looks so cool. I'm ordering a new pack to use on my friend's phone. Additionally, the tattoos stay on, however, they can be peeled off, so I plan to change the tattoo when I want something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware (If you own a Mac)!","review":"The software that is enclosed with this product is only usable on a PC. The software is needed in order to design your phone tattoo and in order to communicate with your printer (correct printing). Perhaps, I should have checked to confirm that the software was compatible with Macs. I didn't realize that the software was basically THE ONLY WAY to get these tattoos designed and printed. So if you do not have a PC do not even bother buying this; unless you are crafty and decide to design it by hand with markers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these","review":"This is a fantastic product. I love that it comes with a bunch of practice sheets so you know exactly what you're printing out. The software is really easy to work as well.

The work Pastor Russell has done towards the Jewish people, is unfounded today. And the Jehovah's Witnesses who claim him as their founder have turned their backs not only on him, but on God's chosen people, the Jews. This book is recommended to all interested in learning about Charles Taze Russell, and his ministry towards the Jewish people, and how today the association he founded, [Associated Bible Students - biblestudents] continue his work in comforting God's covenanted people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnifique Marker","review":"It's true; the picture quality is poor to middling.

I wish I had read this book before going to Greece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Historical and Scientific Evidence","review":"This book is great for anyone researching the Delphinic Oracle tradition. It also sheds light on a very economically legitimate career path for women in ancient Greece. I used this book for research while writing a young adult historical fiction novel. I was not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Well Written Account","review":"This book is amazing. It is basically about the Oracle of Delphi. It talks about the oracle in ancient times, controversies, and the modern answers to her way of communing with Apollo. I learned a great deal about the oracle, like how she freed some slaves, and how she predicted what that king was holding. Another thing I liked was I got a lesson on geology, and chemistry. I would recomend this book for anyone high school and up, because it does contain a lot of adult words."},{"rating":"2","title":"90% Finished","review":"While I enjoyed the book I got the distinct impression that the book was rushed to print. A minor note to start that there is a mistake in a quote from the Histories by Herodotus. And the maps and pictures..... Well they are of horrendous quality and quantity. I still don't know what present day Delphi looks like. The stunning view when one comes down from the mountains? No clue. But we do have a picture of someone from the 1900's wearing a gas mask and full page to boot! I found the most glaring omission was of the geological map of Greece that was rescued from the garbage pile. This is the Rosetta stone of the book but one is left to imagine what it looks like.Overall 4 stars and -1 for the lackluster effort to finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"The Divine Dance confronts issues of image, integrity, dating, family relationships, friendships, and maintaining a personal relationship with Christ in an eloguent and upfront fashion.Using the analogy of life as a performance, Shannon Kubiak accurately paints a picture of the pressure facing young women today.I it a must read not only for young women but women of all ages!I couldn't put it down.

If that weren't bad enough, the glue holding the band together came undone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!!!","review":"Dont be fooled by the picture. This item is not worth the $58. It looks like it should only cost maybe $15-$20 at the most. I have never written an Amazon review before but this watch is so terrible I felt I had to warn others. This watch is SO HARD TO READ. It has to be tilted in just the right way to see the numbers. Worse than that is its impossible to set the time. My fiancee and I both tried (YES we did read the instructions) and still no luck. Whenever we made an attempt to set the time the watch displayed a bunch of weird symbols so we had to constantly reset it.

Maybe it's just me, but I just couldn't figure out what this guy was getting at---and I've read and enjoyed MANY good new age books, so that wasn't the problem. I had the very distinct impression he was trying to make the draconian rules & ugliness of the bible more palatable. But to me it was like perfume on a stinking body. To his credit though, he wrote this back in the dark ages when you probably couldn't sell anything that didn't sound Christian without being branded a witch.

Listening to the songs does require some attention as there are layers and subtleties plying one's ear, competing for your attention. Hints of Pink Floyd's Meddle (San Tropez, for instance) and more than a passing kinship to the shimmering sound of The Shins or understanding elegance of Warm in the Wake are apparent.The air of lushness is sustained by piano and organ, but punctuated with unexpected percussion, jaunty guitar, trumpet, flute, and even some banjo. The mellotron proves both their best friend and worst enemy at spots--take your pick. At times, the band seems content to drift a bit and borrows a bit too much from the cupboard of its predecessors, but all in all, \\"The Fast Rise and Fall of the South\\" offers an interesting escape on its flight of fancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat's all-time favorite toy","review":"This is my cats all-time favorite toy.

In addition to development of the core game I also oversee development of new mini-games that we host on the website.Game Development Essentials is going to be my go-to resources for all new projects. The book covers every aspect of game development and breaks them down in easy to digest pieces. As my title suggests, this book is going to help me speak to business owners, programmers and designers to make better games for the end user. I particularly liked the section that broke down how each generation relates to games. The games I help to design are not meant for me and this book helped me rethink how I should approach Millennials.Anyone could use this book to create a checklist of what needs to be considered from conceptualizing to shipping a new game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game Essentials","review":"Excellent book as an introduction to developing games - My students (and i) found it very hard to put down after reading through the first chapter!One question i have is about the instructor resource on DVD mentioned in the book.

So to hear an ATB remix of an Enigma song is a dream come true for me. This single is totally worth buying if you are a fan of Enigma, ATB, ambient world or trance-techno music.The Enigma version of the song has a more progressive break-beat with faint chants, spoken female voices and a very cool synth melody - energetic and atmospheric yet melodic.The ATB remix has a more house-trance beat, a very dreamy atmosphere and the arrangement is totally hypnotic! The perfect mixture of ATB and Enigma fuse together for what is becoming no less than a major club hit around the world! Hopefully, the single will get released in the US eventually as well.In the meantime, buy this import copy while you can. The digipack version will be for a limited time only and it features a multimedia track containing the music video which you won't find anywhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Basic Instincts, Social Life\\", Excellent Single","review":"Of Beginning, I bought this single by the video, but soon, I discovered that the video was an aggregate to an excellent disc.The two versions of ATB leave me without words, and the version for radio contains all the sounds, mixtures and beat of the original version.The digipack format is excellent and if you have not bought it, what delay you. :)Greetings"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad use of airborne troops","review":"Very much the most excellent good guys against the very bad bad guys.

If you're looking for the full color full sized reprint you want this book:LoveBunny & Mr. Hell Volume 1 TPIt's a cute idea, Love Bunny is a ditzy neurotic former kid sidekick who dresses like a Playboy bunny, Mr. Hell is a demon she befriended. Together they fight crime.But once writer/artist Tim Seely sets up the plot there's really no where to go. A lot of the humor is repetitive and Love Bunny never develops more of a personality than nice but dumb.Adam Warren's Empowered series draws on a lot of the same themes but is a lot funnier and has much more engaging characters.I'd give this one a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute!","review":"These earrings are great for any Jeep lovers like myself.

University of California Press made a mistake by including color illustrations and giving this a high price. It was always pricey for assignment for college classes, and now its out of print. It would have been better to give up the color illustrations and lower the price. But in any case this book it is worth looking at for anyone interested in the Aztecs, Mesoamerica, or native American cultures."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor, second rate biography","review":"This is one of the most disappointing biographies I have read in a long time.

Features such as highlighting recently used functions for quick reference, and dynamicaly generating reports and information are incredibly usefull to me. I hate manageing my finances, but Quicken has made it take alot less time.It's easier to manage budgets, plan taxes (The tax forecaster is helping me plan my refund for next year!), track investments (New this year is the Employee Stock Purchase Tracker!), plan a house (the mortgage calculator also has links to mortgage companies so you can shop online), and manage your bank accounts (Auto reconcillation is a real timesaver!).Bill Gates, you may have a new battle on your hands, as I give this years version to Intuit Quicken 2002!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am addicted to Quicken","review":"I have been using Quicken since it's early DOS versions. In my humble opinion, there is simply no better way to organize all of your finances. Most banks and credit card companies will allow you to download transactions directly into Quicken (no file download from the institution's web site, and then import into Quicken) -- I'm talking about knowing your recent credit card transactions within a day or two (in case you are not the type to enter them in right when you get home). Manage all your brokerage accounts, 401k, IRA, track your mortgage, car payment, etc. It is all there, and come tax time - you will be sitting pretty when you need to import your neatly categorized Quicken transactions into TurboTax or TaxCut.You will not be disappointed, I highly recommend Quicken 2002 Deluxe or Suite."},{"rating":"2","title":"707's best album despite the fall out","review":"707's \\"Megaforce\\" was a great album that featured Kevin Chalfont on vocals. Their guitar hero unknown, Kevin Russell, rocks almost every song. The song was used in a movie of the same name (a lame movie at that). The band apparently has some personality issues thus this line-up only lasted for one album. That is too bad because this was a great album. Kevin Russell's vocals were good and so were Kevin Chafont's. The re-release was welcomed since it needed to see the light of a laser. The bonus songs are nice as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book!

He wasted another 2 years making us try the only cure he knows - increasing doses of metformin.Well, it all started with this book. The book is an average read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heal your body by understanding PCOS","review":"This book gave me lots of explainations for this condition. if you are thinking about reading it, then, like me, you want some answers, and some guidance as to how to live with PCOS.This book gave me these answers. Full of helpful advise, lots of in-depth medical guidance for you to refer to when you see doctors, but all the information was easy to understand. As a sufferer of PCOS, this was a good book to give me guidance in how to live my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"PCOS - ????","review":"I had never heard of PCOS before my OB/GYN gave me my diagnosis that I had this syndrome. I was very anxious to find out all that I could and still go back to this book when I have questions. More women should ask their doctor about this syndrome especially if you are watching your diet and exercising but not losing weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Informative","review":"The book offers a good synopsis of PCOS. However there are overly technical details (reference chapter 2 regarding types of blood tests, etc.) which pad the pages and make for unuseful reading to the lay person. The book comes across as more of a work in progress rather than a serious paper on the topic. Items are repetitive throughout which again appears as page-padding. Mention is made of one particular subject that was to appear later on in the text (i.e. how PCOS will impact on your female fetus) however, this never materialises. The author clearly has a passion for the subject, but unfortunately the text is poorly articulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and hopeful","review":"As someone who was just diagnosed with PCOS and knew very little about it, I was hesitant to buy this book because I wasn't sure how reliable it would be. But I was very pleasantly surprised. I felt confident that the author was very knowledgeable about the syndrome. The information is not flooded with incomprehensible medical-speak, but also provides you with the medical facts you need to know. The food lists and recipes for managing with diet were very helpful. I feel there were very clear suggestions about how to talk with your doctor, medication management, diet and overall empowering oneself to become involved in your own medical care. I appreciated the chapter on the emotional impact of PCOS as well, as it certainly cannot be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Patient's Guide to PCOS: Understanding--and Reversing--Polycystic Ovary Syndrome","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who has PCOS or thinks they may have it. It does a wonderfuld job explaining PCOS and it's symptoms and other medical complications that can be associated with it. It really has helped me understand more things about this disorder, as well as how to fix problems that it can cause. Great book, it has been very very helpful to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but could be longer and better designed","review":"It does the job of being able to slide theTopeak MTX Rear Bicycle Basketoff and on theTopeak Explorer Bicycle Rack with Disc Brake Mounts, but it could be about 6 inches longer to accommodate the fourth set of mounting holes in the basket. It looks like Topeak had the left hand creating the basket and the right hand creating the Fixer 6.By not utilizing all of the mounting holes in the basket, it tends to bend backwards a bit. I fixed that problem by wedging a piece of wood under the basket and screwing it into the basket. But, the basket still sways to the left and right because it is only being held by the middle and the screen mesh of the basket allows it to flex too much. This could have been fixed by adding a bit of support to the sides of the Fixer 6.Anyway, if you are looking to attach your Topeak basket and use it for light duty then this is for you. 40+ pounds of backpack?? No way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so small?","review":"I really don't understand why this fixer was designed so much shorter than the track itself. I have attached a milk crate to it (the Topeak wire basket seemed smaller than I wanted and too flimsy. This was not a 5 minute project, as I had to work a piece of scrap wood into an adapter plate, since the milk crate would never have safely attached directly to the fixer). After about a year of occasional use the milk crate is constantly becoming more unstable. I feel like the whole setup would be more stable if the fixer made use of the full length of the Topeak rear track and sat flat on the sides of the rack rather than leaving the sides of the mounted object hanging so far out."},{"rating":"1","title":"works as advertised","review":"It works as advertised, it should have a locking feature built in, at least it should be optional.

Lots of unique rarely seen photos. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value, nice raised letters","review":"Pretty simple item, but it is well worth the price. This nicest part is that the letters are not only painted on, they were cast into the opener itself and raised slightly. This is nice b/c eventually the paint will probably rub off, but the raised metal will not :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"This opener is sturdy and well made.

It works well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IN LEFT WING ARMY RAGS WITH WOODY","review":"High camp Woody Allen that plays like a crude film smuggled in from over the border where people don't laugh. Woody and the dead posturing soldiers is my favorite bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely funny political farce","review":"Incredibly funny, broad, slapstick, surreal political satire as Woody takes over a Latin American country to impress a girl. A few bits feel dated, and it didn't make me laugh quite as much as 'Take the Money and Run' when I recently re-watched Allen's 'early funny films', but it still has more than it's share of great comic moments. The whole trial sequence is genius worthy of the very best of the Marx Brothers. (Or, in a more modern context Monty Python)Personally I don't love the score -- it tends to underline jokes that don't need the help. It was after this that Allen went away from having music written for his films, using existing pieces instead, which became a huge part of his filmmaking style.It's really past time for the rest of Allen's great early work to join \\"Annie Hall\\" and \\"Manhattan\\" on blu-ray"},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny look at dictatorship","review":"Woody Allen's role of a guy just trying to be normal is anything but abnormal. Louise Lasser is wonderful as Allen's equal. The film doesn't really get going until Allen heads for the jungles of San Marcos. He goes through guerilla training and finds a way to get cole slaw to feed an entire army. Great Castro look alike costume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woodman's Worst \\"Funny\\" Movie","review":"\\"Bananas\\" has to be the worst Woodman comedy ever made. Even as a major fan of Woody Allen, I have to admit it was a waste of time to sit through the one and a half hour of trying material. The usual ingredients that make his movies tick - clever dialogue, self-mockery, good rapport between leading cast et al - were clearly lacking. This is definitely one Allen movie I will not re-watch and one DVD I will not be keeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yipes!","review":"It seems that all of you really love this film, but I feel that it is the weakest Woody Allen ever. Yeah, Take the Money and Run and Sleeper were funny, but Bananas is such an un-focused film. The timing is off, and the characters are weak. Don't get me wrong, I love Woody Allen, but it feels as if he tried to put the same gags from Take the Money and Run onto another plot. If only the timing was better and the whole thing was more focused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slipped, lacks appeal","review":"This is a good movie for people who don't like to think too much. While better than watching (un)reality TV or monster truck rallies, as far as I'm concerned this isn't a film for fans of Woody Allen, it's just a series of really thin gags which make me want to. Woody's \\"Sleeper\\" is a more sophisticated version of \\"Bananas\\" (and it was better shot) and of the two, get the former. This is one of those \\"earlier, funny ones\\" referenced in the usually underrated \\"Stardust Memories\\". Like \\"Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex\\", it isn't a high point of his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Woody's best films, still hilarious today....","review":"This was Allen's second film, and it's one of my all time favorite Woody Allen films. It's still hilarious, filled with brilliant dialogue, incredibly funny setpieces (some of the best of Allen's career), funny performances, great satire, and a great musical score. Allen would go onto deeper material and even greater films, but I still love this one. With Howard Cosell hosting an assassination attempt (still funny even if you don't remember Howard Cosell), to Allen getting food for his revolutionary outfit from a local diner, Bananas is filled with brilliant comedy. Some have complained that the film is a bit rough, but that didn't bother me that much. Most of Allen's comedies are consistently funny, and there are few, if any, lulls in them. This is great comedic filmmaking, something future generations should study and emulate."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Must Suck Out The Poison","review":"This is classic Woody Allen from the early years. Allen's earlier films were satiiric masterpieces with a generous helping of slapstick thrown in and this is one of the better ones. There are so many funny scenes but when Allen is kidnapped by the rebels in a fictional latin country and wakes up in their camp the results are hilarious. His training includes the \\"Suck out the poison \\" line in the event of snakebite, Each of these tough rebels is asked to repeat...\\"What do you do ?\\" Response.. Suck Out the Poison..then Wood responds \\" I never suck the leg of anybody who I'm not engaged to\\"The dinner at the Dictators mansion is equally hysterical....Allen shows up with a bakery box full of patries and El Presidente turns up his nose and says.\\" Prunes...I don't like Prunes.\\"Just a sample of countless funny and memorable lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice Actors Sing Azumanga Daioh Character Songs","review":"The Azumanga Daioh Vocal Collection CD includes full versions of the Azumanga Daioh opening and ending theme songs performed by Oranges & Lemons, \\"Ear-Playing-Tricks Cake\\" (\\"Soramimi Cake\\") and \\"Raspberry Heaven,\\" respectively. It also includes Azumanga Daioh character songs sung by the Japanese voice actors (seiyuu), which fit their characters very well - with one notable exception. In the Azumanga Daioh animation (anime) series, Koyomi Mizuhara, aka Yomi, is a terrible singer. But on her character song \\"Everyone's One Way\\" (\\"Sorezore no One way\\"), Yomi sings wonderfully. The Japanese voice actor for Koyomi \\"Yomi\\" Mizuhara is Rie Tanaka, who also does the speaking voice and the singing voice for Lacus Clyne in Gundam Seed. But, in speech and in song, Yomi and Lacus sound nothing alike - a testament to Rie Tanaka's range and versatility."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sure it is a great film but only if you speak both French and Russian","review":"Shame. Seems like a great film but can't seem to find the English subtitles.If indeed they are not provided in this copy that might be a good thing to mention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed at cuts","review":"If anyone knows how to find the original Emmanuelle 2: The Joys of a Woman, please email me. I was very disappointed at the cuts made on this supposedly restored version. The NC 17 rating made me believe that this was the uncut version. None of the original movie was so hardcore or explicit as to force the producers of this version to cut it. Call me a perfectionist, but the original movie was an erotic masterpiece, very artsy and with a feminine sensibility at its heart, which makes it a pleasure for couples viewing together. This version is still very good, but if you saw uncut version first you might find this a bit tame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon think I bought this...","review":"And I did actually buy Emmanuelle 1 on bluray and 2 on DVD before... But my DVD version of Emmanuelle 2 that is in the PAL system, has the truly delicious bath house scene and the film would be a huge dissapointment without that scene, so I surely understand the other reviewers rage here - when that scene got cut away!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy installation","review":"Bought for 2012 Dodge Ram 1500, regular cab, Express.

Nonetheless, I love this movie. I think it's hilarious.

It shows that if you're clever enough and have enough tenacity (not to mention talent) that you really can \\"make it\\". The Swingers were fantastic! For me, they were a stand-out in the film. The soundtrack is awesome. The only thing I would love to have changed about this movie is the sound quality with some of the dialogue. At times it's hard to hear what's being said.I hope this will be released on DVD in the US one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinatingly Awful...","review":"I saw this film in my teens and couldn't believe just how bad it was. Now in my 40's, it's a stunner of a bad film that belongs right up there with the Golan-Globus musical disaster \\"The Apple\\". Every musical number is jaw-dropping bad. This film is a product of the 80's and should have remained there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Fun Romp","review":"Slightly dated, conventional story, but still good with memorable performances by all the main characters.

Ted Danson is hilarious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed attempt at comedy","review":"Made in America fails to bring in the laughs, and worse, it presents a great opportunity to deal with race issues, yet never deals with it beyond \\"He's white? He can't be your father!\\"This film begins with a promising premise. What if a black girl found out her father, a sperm donor, was actually white? But instead of creating a fascinating mix of social commentary on race and brilliant comedy, it gives us slapstick. And unfunny slapstick at that. I laughed... once.This film's one saving grace is Whoopie. She adds some energy to most of her scenes. But even she seems unexcited to be in this movie. It's one of her least funny roles. Made in America also gives a young Will Smith a role, and it's clear from the start that it wasn't until after this film that he matured as an actor.This movie is only for really, really big Whoopie fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"riverboat","review":"i am very happy with this show.the sound is very good,picture is not bad and the stories lines are very good,these old shows are so much better then the garage they put out today.i would say buy this you won;t regret this"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good series!","review":"This is a very entertaining series, lots of good guest stars.I am a Darren McGavin fan and this is a good vehicle for him.Good scripts and a decent production.Not remastered but very watchable and worth having in your collection.I wish there was more seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"MsRaines","review":"This Application Study Bible, has to be one of the best ones I have come across.

Overall, this is the best bible I have ever owned. I have coupled my studies with the ESV Study bible, which is coming out in a week from now in paperback! The life application bible gives you applications to use in life, the ESV study bible gives you more facts. Too bad we just can't have it all in one book - it would probably weight 10 pounds! HA!

The Bible lays flat; the spine is flexible (paperback edition), the pages have a nice feel to them, and the text doesn't run into the \\"crack\\" of the Bible (sorry, I don't know how else to say it). The references are placed in the \\"crack\\" so the text is much easier to read than most other Bibles. I have read almost half of this Bible and the spine has not shown any wear (no cracking). The cover does roll a bit, but that's part of the character of a paperback Bible. I like to have the flexibility, which is one of the main reasons why I purchased this over the hardback edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good small Bible to carry","review":"I enjoy using this Bible.

Unfortunately, the CDs require that you listen, read the book, and follow along, so it's not possible to just listen and learn; you need to refer to the book while listening. The sound level of the dialogues is much lower than the voice of the person leading the lessons, so you have to adjust the volume every time he talks. This is distracting and annoying. A disppointment, on the whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great machine, when it works.","review":"I bought one of these from Target about 8 months ago. I took it home and was really happy with it for about a week. It makes great coffee and keeps it hot longer. After a few days though, it quit brewing a whole pot. It would stop about halfway or less through the brewing cycle. It took it back and got a new one. It lasted about 8 months and started doing the same thing.

Too bad, its a great machine, when it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning about book size!","review":"This is a great book, BUT this particular version is meant perhaps for a library story hour or a preschool.

Not recommended to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Beginner's Book with a Dead End","review":"This is really a pretty awful novel. It begins well: bloody handprint, interesting neighborhood, pretty young mailperson who is the central character. And then it grows. Meyers introduces more characters, most of whom are vaguely defined and about whom the reader cares very little. As a matter of fact, one of the victims--also the best friend of Brette the mailcarrier/heroine--is so obnoxious and mean, her death goes unmourned by anyone, even the characters in the novel!The novel goes on....and on. The plot gets more twisted and pointless. The characters become more vague and ill-defined. And finally, in the last scene the murderer dies in the swamp much like the one the reader has been mired in throughout the novel.There are lots of beginnings but the book becomes exactly what it's title implies: a \\"Dead End\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Romantic suspense.","review":"The mystery is a bit weak, but this book was very character driven, and I really liked that. Sam and Brette, and Eric and Hank, and even the minor characters of Tucker and Sally, were perfect in their imperfections.Brette gets involved in the disappearance of a local woman through a Halloween prank, and with her surly neighbor, Sam, through another disappearance. Hank, her son's best friend, and almost her own son, vanishes, then re-appears a few days later, but too late to fix a tragedy. Sam, who didnt want to get involved with anyone or anything is dragged into the mess, and in the meantime, his past is revealed to the gossipy and close-minded small town. Still, he can't resist Brette, or her son. The missing woman takes a back seat to Sam and Brette's relationship difficulties, as they try to work things out. It is a tender, stormy, and intense love story with strong characters.

It appears to have been \\"mastered\\" from the VHS issue... and not very well at that. Truly a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie but DVD has truly dismal video quality","review":"Everything about this DVD movie of Michael Crichton's The Great Train Robbery is marvelous except for the truly abysmal, grainy low resolution quality of the video itself. I don't know what the source of the problem is, but the result is one of the worst DVD's I've ever viewed when it comes to the actual video quality of the product. Virtually every scene is grainy and out of focus. It's a shame such great sets, great acting, great costumes, and great plot are all marred by the genuinely bad video quality. In sum, if you value video quality, do not buy this DVD. And, just to be clear, I'm not judging this DVD against a blu-ray. I have seen VHS tapes with as good and even better video quality than this DVD has. Someone should make a new transfer/copy/version of this, or even better, make a good quality blu-ray.

You would think. No pun intended, where did this film go off-track?For starters if you're going to make a heist picture you should at least make the participants likable. We're really in Sean Connery's camp after he murders one of his henchmen. The only apparent reason that Connery is given a hero's cheer at the film's conclusion is because the script dictates it to. The heist is thrilling, but so what if the perpetrators leave you cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trigger Happy","review":"This is a very interesting autobiography. The best summary I can give without spoiling it is that makes the reader feel a bit like a bystander in a Trigger Happy TV episode. There are some references in it that you may miss unless you are British or a close member of Joly's family, so if you are, for example, an American, then you may not get some of it, but don't worry, because he has a lot to say about Americans. Overall, it's not always great, but many times I could not help laughing out loud while reading it, once at a cafe in Berkeley, which somehow caused a middle-aged hippy lady on the left to hit on me and an inebriated gentleman on the right to strike a conversation on literature. This book helps break the ice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet's Back-A Must-Have for Any BSB FANatic","review":"I would definately recommend the Backstreet's Back Christmas Edition to any Backstreet Boys fan. This limited edition CD includes several great songs not found on any other BSB CDs. It contains many songs not on the US edition of Backstreet Boys, such as Like a Child and 10,000 Promises, in addition to several songs not found on the initial release of Backstreet's Back Canadian and European editions, such as Missing You and Christmas Time. If you like BSBs music, you will probably like this CD as well, because the style of music is very similar to BSBs other CDs. While the Backstreet Boys are definately one of the biggest groups out there, I would not recommend this group to people who do not like boy-pop, because that is what this album is. This CD is definately a must-have for every BSB fan, while most other people probably would not like this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitachi Driver","review":"I'm not rating the item, I'm rating the add.

They just can't get this whole 'theme' idea down. They did a good job with their 'Cartoon Crazy's Goes to War' edition showing some rare classics that haven't been shown on public TV due to their heavy stereotypes of Nazis and Japanese. They also show some old training films drawn for soldiers in WWII. The great thing about this DVD is that all the cartoons are related to 'War' like the title states. It deserves 4 stars. On the other hand, the other DVD included in this set, 'Cartoon Crazy's- SciFi' loosely sticks to it's title. Example: 'Cupid Gets His Man' and 'House Cleaning Blues' and 'John Henry & The Inky Poo'. What a waste. There are a few good superman cartoons on here, but Winstar made 2 DVDs full of Superman cartoons, so just buy those. 1 star for Sci-Fi. So if you can, only get the War edition and skip the Sci-Fi edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh...","review":"I am beginning to wonder of ANY of these people have read a single Objectivist book.

This book falls flat on its face. The author spends most of the story explaining and re-explaining the Family relationships between the characters and describing their wardrobe. She fails to develope any story line of substance and her wonderful villian Jonathan is a wash out. Obviously this is not the last of the books if you read the last chapter(will not divulge its contents) But unless the next book is better than this one - don't buy it -its not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Satisfying Read in the Coninual Saga of the Womam of Substance","review":"As usual Barbara Taylor Bradford finds a way to entwine newcharacter's into the story to keep it going...I found myselfnot wanting this book to end as I did the other's.Without giving away the story line, I'll say I was surprisedat some of the changes in the live's of the main characters.AND I wouldn't be SURPRISED if we haven't heard the last ofthis family's trials and trivia's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"I have read all six books in the saga of Emma Harte.

Maybe it would have been less torturous as a paperback, so I could have skipped pages of meaningless repetition, but as an Audio Cd it was excruciatingly lacking in excitement or plot. The positive side of that is that usually I have difficulty leaving the car and audio Cd when I get to work when I'm at a great spot in the story, but since there were no good spots, it was very easy to walk away from. I give it two stars only because it continued the saga and therefore is of some interest to people hooked on the series, otherwise, it wouldn't be worth one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only so-so","review":"I loved A Woman of Substance, but reading this book, I felt like the author was phoning it in. No real plot development -- the bad guy is mean and sinister, does nothing that affects anybody, and then apparently dies. Big deal. And the characters lacked dimension -- the good guys were lovely and honorable and admirable, and the bad guys were laughably sinister and evil, like cartoon characters.

I found this one so weak and confusing that it has taken some effort to finish it. Now, for devotees, it's a must, but it needs more strengthening and better editing. Perhaps 'nit-picking' but 'antibiotics do not cure viral bronchitis'. That's a fact.The five pages of genealogy would be better served with a chart instead of text; like the English monarchs.

If you like to precisely control what you're playing (especially if you play Metal), do not get these strings. The coating is too slippery and feel uncomfortable. And most importantly!! The tone is NOT bright and the sustain is horrible. They can't hold a chord without fading quickly especially if you bend a lot.

After a wooden reindeer falls from above the street after Santa's wooden sleigh and wooden reindeer are hung above the street, the reindeer is Prancer. There is a gap where Prancer used to be. Jessica later finds a reindeer in the woods, and she realizes it is the real Prancer. She tries to nurse it back to health after he's injured despite what her father (Sam Elliot) thinks. Later the whole town hears about it. After she's involved in an accident while trying to free Prancer after being put into captivity when her father sells him, the whole townspeople from the gruff veterinarian (Abe Vigoda), to a lonely aging bright red-haired neighbor (Cloris Leachman) give a party for her. Her father understands then, and they take Prancer up to Antler Ridge for Santa to come and get him. This is a perfect film for everyone to enjoy around the holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prancer DVD","review":"I first saw this movie when it came out.

Would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical movie","review":"Prancer is magical. The little girl who plays Jessica is a fabulous little actor. She's real; not precocious and obnoxious like so many children's roles today (the film is from 1989).

Overall, definitely a four out of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical and Touching!","review":"A Modern Classic! This film gets better every year I watch it. Sam Elliot is great for this role and plays it perfectly. The charming little girl who plays the starring role is perfect.

She hides Prancer in a tool shed and does chores around the neighborhood to pay for his feed (Prancer is animatronic, so I doubt he eats much). Jessie decides to write to Santa Claus about their predicament and gives her letter to a shopping mall Santa, instructing him to deliver it to the real St. Nick. But you can't trust those phony-bearded department store Santas - the guy gives her correspondence to the town paper, who publishes it. The secret is out, and Dad is mad.

The acting is terrible, the story isn't very good, and, for having been made in 1989, the picture quality is bad, even on the DVD version.

My kids, 7 and 4 watched this video in our car dvd player. They became very upset when, in the first several minutes of the movie, one child explains to another child:1. There is NO Santa Clause2. How could Santa go down all the chimney's in the world in 1 night, it's not logical3. There also is NO GOD4. And NO HEAVENThis becomes especially upsetting in the movie because the child who is being told this, sadly exclaims, \\"this(no heaven)can't be true because what about my mom?\\" (Her mom is dead and the child had previously thought her mom was in Heaven.) This sad, upset child then tells the other child, \\"You are not my friend anymore.\\"At this point, I ejected the movie from the DVD player.

John's voice and guitar are both out of tune and he drags terribly in several songs. This doesn't sound like a raw and more intimate version, as some have claimed here, it sounds like a poorly performed and recorded version. It makes us long for the studio engineer to speed things up and correct those off-pitch notes. Sorry, but that is my opinion. Some people, like, say, Eva Cassidy, sound great live, and some people don't. John may sound great live, I don't know, but he doesn't sound good in this recording. Problem is, this album makes me think he is probably not good live, which is why I think he would be better off living on his rep from the studio version, or re-taping some newer live versions of these songs. He really is a good songwriter, and these old performances hurt him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside Wants Out","review":"For any new John Mayer fans, this is the bare essentials and the deep down makeup of what John Mayer is. These eight tracks of more intimate versions of some of the Room For Squares songs are necessary for any John Mayer fan. This album, from 1999 is the quintessential record for people who would like a few extra tracks from John Mayer. These songs are more about John and his guitar, not so much the studio scene. I love this album. I gave it 5 stars and I highly reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is so young here!","review":"Wow....this album came out before Room for Squares which was the first album of his I listened to.

This isn't the Art of the X-Files, introduced by William Gibson (maybe William Gobson would have been a better influence). It's a bunch of X-files images interspersed with melodramatic \\"art\\" and groaner explications. \\"The creative act takes another aspect when the spectator experiences the phenomenon of transmutation; through the change from inert matter into a work of art, an actual transubstantiation has taken place, and the role of the spectator is to determining the weight of the work on the esthetic scale.\\" Oh, please. There are also lots of very large images of the title mottos.

Kathleen Milner continues to delude herself into thinking she is an author and artist. Through this book, she proves she is neither. Her embarassingly poor illustrations look like the paintings brought home by my fifth grade daughter. Ms. Milner's writing is equally amateurish and self-indulgent. I have recently attempted to read the 3rd Edition of \\"Tera\\". It is beyond me why Milner thinks anyone would be interested in the stream of conciousness ramblings about her mundane personal life, which pepper each of her offerings. My only conclusion after reading this pathetic Vanity Press offering is that Milner is a narcissist and a charlatan. Do not encourage her by buying this \\"book\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will inspire you.","review":"This is a book about a troubled teen, Declan, who loves to snowboard. He unfortunately gets into a gang that likes to graffiti on things. One day, the gang starts a fire and ends up killing themselves. Declan does not get killed. Instead he has to go into rehabilitation for about 6 weeks. This rehabilitation center was in the mountains. There was snow on the mountains so Declan couldn't resist snowboarding. The only problem is that he almost killed himself about three times. Only two of those times were accidents. The third time he tried to kill himself because he was fed up with his life. That turned him around. Now because this book isn't very long, I don't want to give out any more information because it might give away the ending.

It naturally stood out strongly because it is not smooth jazz, or at least what I think of as smooth jazz. Peter White is smooth jazz, with boring drum machines, limited tone, and just plain fluff. ZB represents the long lineage of fine true jazz guitarists that came before him, from Charlie Christian through Wes Montgomery and Grant Green, then George Benson, and now with the likes of Chris Standring and Norman Brown. This is real music, with soul and punch, and great variety of moods on one disc. It's worth every penny. I also have Laidback and Groovin' (which I found in a Tucson used music store in '99, after searching for a copy for 6 months...) They are both wonderful, full of passion, with a little bit of an edge. This music will keep you smiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm all Laidback","review":"In this order I must say, Groovin', Laidback and Uptown Groove. Too bad Zach is gone, his cd's will always be in an important place among my other cd's. After 2:00 Am on the East Coast is a relaxed song for making you think of your most emotional experiences. I have the idea of how Zach creates his music and puts so much effort into it, since he plays many instruments. Knowing Zachary has always been a caring and emotional person, all of that show in his music. I love this life too Zach. Be sure we will all be Thinking of Alexis.

The music has a pleasant range from cool jazz to funky R&B, and the melodies will sound great at first, and better with each listen. I've had it in constant rotation in my changer for almost a year now, which is saying a lot for a 400 CD collection. Zachary's guitar has that Wes Montgomery/George Benson sound, only he avoids the string section that those two tended to add, which always reminded me of easy listening.

I much preferred the South Park episode of MECHA-STREISAND that accurately portrays the actress as a 50-foot tall robot that eats people, shoots missiles from her nose, and yearns to take over the world. The scenery and costumes are good in Yentl, and the plot is fairly engaging (though it follows the usual cliches of cross-dressing ala Shakespeare, Bosom Buddies, Tootsie, etc.). If you took out the singing, the movie would be much better... and about 20 minutes long. It's worth seeing, I guess, as long as your remote mute button works.

The direction is brilliant and the intense scenes where the scholars, including our friend Barbra, are debating the written words are enchanting. All the music is superb both in audible appreciation and timing in the film.

There are lapses, here and there, and the first quarter of the movie is a bit languid, but as soon as Anshel and Avigdor begin their journey, the wit and romanticism that has always been at the heart of the best Streisand performances breaks through. All the actors are wonderful, down the small roles, and Streisand's obvious care is apparent. Her direction is strong and full of great feeling, and the look and \\"feel\\" of the movie oddly reminiscent of Dutch painting.

My tape is getting worn and I would love to hear all the songs in 5.1 sound. Babs, no disrespect or anything but what ever the problem is WORK IT OUT!!!!

Streisand pulls off one of the most impressive directoral debuts that I have ever seen. The film looks as though it was made by a veteran director, and every scene glows with love and care.Streisand recieves great performances from both Mandy Patinkin and Amy Irving, but it is Barbra herself as Yentl/Anshel who steals the show with her moving performance.This is a musical, but it's different in the fact that it is Yentl's internal dialogue and thoughts that are put to music, and most of the time she only sings when she is alone and no one can hear her. The music is wonderful and complements the story extremely well. \\"Papa Can You Hear Me?\\" and \\"A Piece of Sky\\" are among the most memorable songs.Just when I thought the movies had lost their ability to touch me comes along this beautiful and uplifting film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Streisand is the best!","review":"I have always been a Streisand fan, much to my hubby's chagrin.

When it first came out in the theaters I went with my wife to see it and I totally fell asleep. The only other time I had ever fallen asleep in a theater was when we went to see Reds (Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton).

Quite honestly, I have NO idea what they were thinking about in releasing this now (two years ago, before BD won the war, this might have been welcomed).As it is I would recommend that most folks stay well away from this in the hopes it will encourage La Belle Streisand to make this the first BD release of her many wonderful films.

The beauty and sensitivity of his writing and characterizations winds up lost in a vortex of Babs' narcissism and the result is close to sacrilegious. One can clearly see the level of Streisand's abilities in the conversion of such a timeless literary masterpiece into a pure exercise in kitsch and cliche, while perpetually playing \\"mirror, mirror on the wall....\\" Judging from the reactions often on Amy Irving's and Mandy Patinkin's faces, they were both perceptive enough to know it, but classy enough not to come out and say so.

No doubt this aspect of history will enrage any modern , independant woman. So Barbra disguises herself as a man to get an education.

And the score, which remains lush and captivating, does not quite fit, though again, it is easy to let it sweep you away. On its own terms, as a series of musical videos, the movie is near-brilliant -- the camera intoxicatingly swirls in time to the music, and bends around each tree and door frame with a knowing sense of surprise. There is an inherent sense of choreography in the camera work of this film, which comes from Barbra's obvious musical sensibilities. Amy Irving enchants and Mandy Pantinkin heats up the screen with a powerful and energetic performance. The ending, with its bow to Funny Girl, is way way way over the top -- you almost expect immigrant Yentl to take off in flight herself -- but then again, it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"andre's review 2","review":"I have been looking for this product the pass five years I've had two copies the price is too expensive I love the sermon but I was hoping somebody had it on disc I would only purchase this at half the price and why cant you play this on Yahoo music player?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fleischer's Superman/Lost Episodes","review":"First of all, l was less than pleased with this DVD set, and also the one that preceeded it. The sound has modern sound effects dubbed over the original sound track (why? the original sound effects are fine) and the original sound track has been messed up to sound \\"tinny\\" and like it's coming out of a tunnel! Image Entertainment has also released a DVD set with all 17 cartoons on one set. I originally bought the laser disc version of this release, some time ago. On the laser disc, picture and sound where fine, except they had the opening title only on the first short, with the end title, only on the last short. Someone elses review on the dvd version said the quality was not good, well then l would have to say to collectors, do not buy either of these dvd releases. You are better off with the laser disc set, or the vhs tapes, which are all better quality, and no tampering with the sound on those!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sound editing.","review":"Stay away from this version.

The picture isn't that great either.Pick up \\"The complete Superman collection diamond anniversary edition\\" instead. The picture is clear and the sound is crisp. Plus it has all 17 episodes where the inferior \\"Superman The Lost Episodes\\" only has eight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this latest David Morrell effort. I have read all his books and thoroughly enjoyed them, but this one left me wondering why I even finished it. The \\"hero\\" is a shallow, uninteresting man and solutions seem to just fall in his lap -- or bed, as the case may be. The \\"sex goddess\\" that he dumps his girlfriend (who, by the way, nursed him back to health in the beginning of the book) for is a business tycoon who apparently can't function without him after their first meeting. Lines like: \\"I'm afraid to sleep alone.\\" and \\"I've never experienced anything like . . .\\" are straight out of a daytime soap opera. My conclusion: Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly crafted \\"double story\\"","review":"David Morrell is one of my favorite action authors. Usually a great story teller. But, Double Image is poorly crafted with one story and one buried short story that doesn't fit well into the novel. I was very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Morrel's Worst...","review":"Unfortunately, the Booklist review is quite accurate and Double Image is comprised of two stories that are poorly integrated. Additionally, the character development is weak and character motivations seem \\"out-of-character\\" and contrived. On several occasions I was tempted to disspose of the novel. Though, with morbid fascination, I continued reading to uncover how many more irrelevant and unrelated plot twists Morrel was going to throw in. The story itself is worthy of a 1 ranking, while following the mistakes of a prominant writer (Morrel) earns a 5, thus averaging a 3 overall. It was a very dissapointing read in light of Morrel's previous efforts. Also, it's always a shame to give away ~$20 for a book that doesn't entertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could a book that started so well end so badly?","review":"I'll admit that I'm only an infrequent reader of Mr. Morrell's works, but what I have read, I've almost always enjoyed. Not so with this new novel.What begins as another of his routine thrillers, with a seemingly superhuman villain killing all that the hero holds dear, ends about half-way through and turns into -- I don't know what. The book jacket describes it as a cross between _Vertigo_ and _Basic Instinct_, but it was just garbage. A supernatural explanation would have been better than what we eventually got by way of resolution. The book reads like an aborted screenplay for a really bad movie. Why Morrell felt the necessity to dovetail these two unrelated plots together is beyond me. It's almost as if he had enough material for two novellas and said \\"Maybe my readers will buy this, they're stupid!\\" The book is so disappointing, I think, because it hinted at and promised so much more. Avoid this at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slick entertainment made for a movie script!","review":"This book was quite a departure from Morrell's previous works (most of which I enjoyed) but I liked it much better. There was a little of everything to enjoy from action to romance to psychological suspense. The plot twists were excellent and I had to discipline myself not to peak ahead. The only negative was the length of some of the action scenes. Excellent book, I think you will thoroughly enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable, but","review":"A recent convert to Morrell I bought this book in eager anticipation to be left disappointed. Two distinct story lines that I felt never linked sucessfully left me with lasting impression that the book could have worked but did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I have enjoyed so many of Morrell's books but was let down by this one. The lack of focus was almost unbearable. I finished the book feeling very unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh-oh","review":"I love David Morrell, I have read everyone of his books. The action, the characters, the spy habits. But this is not like his other books. Does David Morrell question his desire to write spy novels anymore? This book is not what I was expected at all! It totally lacked Morrell's famous tension. Foremost, I was disappointed with the trashy themes, I had to skip ahead several times because it got so graphic. Is he going through a mid-life crisis? Well get over it, love your wife, and go back to writing exciting action novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly disgusting!","review":"Coletrane, the main character in Double Image, is as annoying a character as is conceivable. During the majority of events in this book, he usually is found whining, being scared, and thinking almost exclusively about himself and only himself; for example, he deserts the woman who put her life in danger for him and barely thought twice about it. The course of this book is saddeningly predictable. In addition, it seems to be about 4 books all crammed into one...first, a terrorist stalker, then suddenly, a mysterious picture of a woman, then next, a vixen with 60 boyfriends and a thing against men. And throughout the entire book, the inconsistencies in plot and minor details all add up to a completely unpleasurable reading experience. Buy this book only if you'd like a good laugh at idiocy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where, please, is the David Morrell of yore?!","review":"I agree with the \\"reader from Texas\\" -- I was very disappointed in this book. I've read almost everything Mr. Morrell has written, and feel that his work has declined in his last two books. I think his earlier post-\\"First Blood\\" was terrific; maybe he needs a sabbatical. But I basically skimmed the last two-thirds of the book, wanting to know the who-dun-its and why-dun-its; if it hadn't been a David Morrell book, I don't think I'd have bothered to finish it, but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terribly dull and stupid novel.","review":"I was looking for a light entertaining read when I picked up this book. Many quotes from critics praising this novel and its author, David Morrell were provided . I found it to be stupid and unbelievable. Because it is so far out, the many action sequences turn out to be dull. It is really a rough patching together of 2 novels. In the first, the prime minister of Bosnia is chasing our hero around LA trying to murder him, his family and all his freinds. In the second novel our hero gets mixed up with the most beautiful woman in the world, She is also rich and exudes (would you believe) static electricity. He gives up his girl to go to mexico with the goddess. She turns out to be a diobolical serial killer. After he puts her away his girlfreind (would you believe) returns to him. I wondered how such poor writing gets published. Then I found out Morrell wrote the Rambo series.

One of them ends partway through and is not at all plausible (I'm sure foreign militants leave their country and stalk photographers that caught them in the act all the time--I've just never heard of it). Too much graphic sex and violence with not enough story to back it up. It doesn't work, and I'm not sure the war crimes-stalking thing would have worked anyway.. it's way too bizarre. The other plot line was okay, and with some more fleshing out, could easily be a book of its own. I do see what he was trying to do with this, but I, personally, found it convoluted rather than complementary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below par for the great author","review":"Admittedly it has been some time since I poured through this latest offering from David Morrell, but I'll throw in my two cents anyway. Of all the Morrell I have read this was my least favorite. I didn't connect with the motivations of the main character at all, and the storyline was way beyond belief from someone who generally skirts this line thin but successfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating-we've come a long way baby!","review":"The voice of Dinah, daughter of Jacob, relates this story, from a young girl to a woman to what was then considered an old ladies point of view.

Ahhhh but the new moon and the red tent...that was a wonderous time.....women today should be so lucky to enjoy the comaraderie and the support of the women in the red tent. Childbirth...that is another story. If we went through what they did, we would not have a population problem. Thank God for drugs and Lamaze.

This is your book if you are looking for ideas/phrases like: the end of advertising; revolution in creative business strategy; left brain meets right brain; brand and company DNA; we face new times that require new tools.The lack of research behind it makes this book more a local man's tale and a long opinion, which in turn causes the book to fall into repetitive ad and business jargon clichés.

But in order to be nice and to contribute to the general good of society, let me explain it to you: If a movie has the word \\"kid\\" in the title, it is a must-miss. More specifically, if the title starts off with \\"the\\" and is followed by an adjective or a noun that seperates the kid of the title from other kids, it is subject to the \\" 'Kid' in Title Rule.\\" Examples are \\"The Skateboard Kid\\" or \\"The Invisible Kid\\" or \\"The Dirtbike Kid.\\" Anyhow, \\"The Magic Kid\\" follows this rule to a tee. It can be very dangerous to the alone and unaware viewer. The acting of course is terrible, but TJ Roberts adds a special degree of hateability to a movie that's bad enough as it is.

Millinery belting ribbon, as Ann describes, has a scalloped edge; and grosgrain ribbon, which isn't used in hats (at least for the inside band) has a straight edge.

Unfortunately, there were two drawbacks to those presses: 1)The glass beakers were fragile and I replaced a glass beaker about every 6-8 months; 2) I had to have a separate thermal carafe to keep the coffee warm (I would brew a large pot to get me through the morning). This Columbia thermal press appeared to meet my needs better so I bought it. So far it has proven to meet my needs pretty well. I think there is still a little room for improvement in its insulation because it does not keep the coffee quite as warm as I would like after about 2 hours.

For such an expensive item, I think a quick e-mail is in order.While the carafe functions well in keeping tea warm and no leaves ever got out, I'm disappointed in the quality and in Bodum's customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Maker","review":"I've become addicted to pressed coffee and have tried several pots, none of which worked that well or quickly failed with regular use. This one is excellent. It pops in the dishwasher for easy cleaning and seems very durable. It keeps the coffee at a drinkable temp for more 2 hours. If you like pressed coffee, get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and classy","review":"We have been french press coffee drinkers for years now. After going through 6 glass Bodum french press makers we finally happened on this one. Not only is it a great coffee maker but it doubles as a carafe too! The coffee stays hot for at least an hour, albeit not quite as long as our pod carafe but it is long enough. The only drawback is that it can get very hot on the outside when you initally pour the boling water into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I debated whether to get this model or the smaller model from Bodum. This larger model is really not that large and would probably work for 2 people who each enjoy more than one cup of coffee in the morning. It is well made and very functional. However, I would estimate that the coffee only stays warm for approx 30 minutes, maybe somewhat longer, not 2 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much less silt, won't break, keeps hot, tastes incredible,","review":"What other reasons are there for a press? I can't think of any more right now. I bought one of these because I love great coffee and it sure produced it. My wife loves it because there is no sludge or silt! (way less than other presses and of course you need coarse grind, maybe commercial percolator grind but I never used it) When it comes to a grinder I use a Capresso conical burr grinder and it seems to do a perfect job. I did get sludge and silt in the bottom with that grinder with other presses, but not this one. You do have to put some hot water in it before for it not to cool the coffee and to keep it hotter, but that would be with most coffee makers. It would be so easy to pour in a thermos or other caraffe to keep it hotter longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bodum Columbia Thermal 51 oz Stainless Steel Coffee Press","review":"So far I have not had good coffee in this press. I am still trying to get the right amount of grounds. It does not keep the coffee hot like I had expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Better French Press","review":"I tried several french press coffee pots before this one. The first was glass and broke. I do not like items that are a lot of trouble and replacing glass is definitely trouble. Next I purchased a 32 oz metal double-wall pot. It was hard to use and never enough coffee. The Bodum Columbia Thermal coffee pot is the best I have found. It is easy to use, does not break, keeps the coffee warm and has enough volume for the morning.I am satisfied and not looking for another pot."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOD!!","review":"Well if you like good coffee or tea this is the way to go. I have a few french presses and this is by farrrrrrrr the best I have used and I did a lot of looking before buying this one. No worry of breakage, coffee stays hot much much better than the glass ones and the clean design looks great on you counter, I constantly have people ask about it. I could not be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"I got this because my small glass press isn't big enough for entertaining. I went with stainless so I could take it camping. I'm not concerned with the insulating properties so I haven't really tested that--it does keep coffee hot longer than a glass carafe as you'd expect, but I don't know how long.After about 4 uses, I had the coffee sit for about a half hour and sure enough, as others have reviewed, it tastes a little rubbery. This might fade, and it's not present when freshly brewed so it won't bother me much. I usually don't have a second cup so long after my first. But it is kind of icky.The pot washes easily as does the plunger. My old press has a much more complicated plunger that is a bit more of a pain to wash, but this one comes clean in the dishwasher.I use regular grind coffee (like Seattle's Best standard) and it works fine.So, good press, but coffee tastes like rubber if you let it sit too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First French Press","review":"I was making a move and needed many new house wares and decided instead of a percolator I would try a french press based on the recommendation of the coffee shop staff I go to daily. The problem was they were all so small and wouldn't make much coffee. So online I went and found this large one. I like it well enough and after a few test runs have gotten the amounts down to my taste. I love the way it looks and bought the matching creamer and sugar from another vendor to complete the set. The only down side is the sediment that's left on the bottom of your coffee cup is a bit more than coffee made with a percolator, but not enough for me not to recommend this product. Clean up is a breeze with warm soapy water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great french press","review":"I have used glass French presses. My last one broke and shattered on the floor. It also didn't keep coffee warm for more than 5 minutes. This is an excellent coffee maker, keeps coffee warm and fresh for a longer time, and is not so fragile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice alternative if your french press cools faster than you drink","review":"Recommended as an alternative to a second container. We tried this because our glass Bodum French Press sometimes cools faster than we drink our coffee. This is a nice alternative to a second container like a thermal carafe or pump pot because you only need to clean one item. The press function is not as smooth as a glass Bodum French Press but that's because you are using a stainless container and a rubber press. This press is attractive and will last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used every day for the last year","review":"This makes GREAT coffee. I agree that is it not piping hot after one hour, but we usually each have two cups max within half-hour so a non-issue. Big advantage is the size of the press, which is perfect when we have company. We even take it on family vacations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"big press","review":"It was the largest french press I could find. It's probably not one of the better ones out there, but the biggest I could find. So far it works great, it keeps the coffee warm. I'd recommend the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned for good reason","review":"I usually just read reviews and use them to make my purchase decisions. I actually did the same with the Bodum Columbia 12 cup press. That's why I'm writing this. This product has recieved many positive reviews and I felt compelled to buy it. I have to say that I was not a great product for me. It simply does not keep the coffee hot very long (I even pre-warmed the carafe with very hot water). Now...I like my coffee hot. So, if just warm is OK with you, maybe this is not an issue. I found that the lid did not fit very tight. Maybe that was the problem. Anyway, I returned it and found a BonJour thermal coffee press a TJ Maxx for $24.99 which is smaller (1 liter or 33.8 oz., called 8 cup) but actually keeps the coffee hot for well over an hour. It's a little small for 2 people but I like it better because it's vacuum insulated. I can always make another pot if we want more. BTY, the coffee tastes really good out of both presses."},{"rating":"2","title":"good coffee","review":"This thermal press works very well. We use our hot water tap to fill it up. By the time we get our mugs and cream out, it is ready to press and serve. We have to be careful not to pour it too fast or it will drip and spill. It makes a smooth cup of coffee and keeps it hot for 2 hours. It comes out shiny and clean in the dishwasher. It also makes a good pot of tea with loose leafs. It is also nice to be able to bring it to the table and serve it there with guests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks...","review":"This Thermos starting leaking on the fourth use, about a week after it arrived in the mail.

I previously owned a very old PC that was extremely slow (233 Mhz, 3 GB HD...), so upgrading so drastically was quite a shock. It takes roughly 20 seconds for the PC to start up and be ready for your use, which is very fast. CD burning is extremely quick. I havent tried the DVD burner yet though. I am also a gamer, and this computer does gaming justice. I have more than enough room for all my games on the 160 GB HD! And all my games run very fast and smooth. But they aren't the very top of the line games, but rather games like Command & Conquer. Also, I've noticed my dial-up connection goes ATLEAST twice as fast than on my old computer. I also bought the eMachines 17\\" CRT flat screen, which is a great accessory to this computer.

Oh, and any time you can hear a legendary performer sing the Purple People Eater song you've got to know you're in for a treat!Soound quality was terrific throughout and the liner notes in the booklet give newbies like me context.

In fact I enjoyed the album so much that I made sure that I found the resources to build up a decent Prince collection alongside my Bowie stuff.Sign 'O' the Times was the pinnacle of this genius' career. It was then, as it is now, a unique and varied album. If you are one to dabble in this man's music because you have heard a few songs you liked, Sign of the Times is the record to invest in. Fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince's Masterpiece","review":"This is by far and away the best album released in 1987. It was Prince at his best, and his best is always better than anying else out there. From the first song to the last the man gave us one brilliant note after the other. His voice never sounded better, his songwriting never more poetic, and his musicianship never more magical. This album will surely satisfy any true music lover. Truly there will never be another like him, and it will be interesting to see if he can ever top this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated genre-defying album","review":"even with the recognition he has received, prince is one of the underacknowledged geniuses of rock 'n roll. as prolific as dylan or neil young, prince seemingly shifts genres and styles effortlessly, always creating interesting music, almost without peer in the current pop music scene. from sly stone to little richard to p-funk to joni mitchell, prince has assimilated and made his own a ridiculous range of styles and sounds.this album is my favorite. it spans everything from gorgeous ballads [adore, slow love] to topical commentary [title track] to all-out funk [housequake] to pure pop [starfish and coffee]. prince is a brilliant vocalist and performer as well, ripping out santana-like solos and easily adopting a variety of vocal styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Creative Artistic Peak of Prince","review":"The creative peak of Prince's entire career, bringing together a broad spectrum of musical styles and genres together brilliantly in one collective dose. The haunting title track, along with the playfulness of\\"Play in the Sunshine,\\" the P-Funk/James Brown stylings of \\"Housequake,\\"the jubilance of the \\"Ballard of Dorthy Parker,\\" and the soulful shouts of \\"It\\" will keep you hooked the entire way through. And those are just the first 5 of 16 tracks. You haven't even reached Disc 2, yet!Sign 'O' the Times is without a doubt Prince's creative and artistic best of his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Album","review":"I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes, well quality music. At first listen, one might think this is very strange, but it really grows on you. The second disc in my opinion is just a masterpiece in itself. It isn'tMusic from the Motion Picture \\"Purple Rain\\", it's actually a lot better. The best songs (in my opinion) are: Sign 'O' the Times, The Ballad of Dorothy Parker, Starfish and Coffee, Housequake (although pretty cheesy), U Got the Look (it gets boring), If I Was Your Girlfriend, Strange Relationship, I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man (the best!), The Cross, and Adore. Adore is a pretty everywhere, and not as accessible of a song as anything on Purple Rain, but with enough listening it gets better and better. As I said Before, I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear good music, and is tired of that pervert Michael Jackson."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's the stuff!","review":"Prince created his best album ever in Sign o' the Times, blending rock, pop, funk, and saucy soul balladry seamlessly to give his listeners both a demonstration of his undeniable musical genius, as well as a history lesson as to where R&B has come from and what it has become. Melodically and lyrically, his best work. Highlights: Ballad of Dorothy Parker, If I Was Your Girlfriend, I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince - Only He Could !","review":"Only Prince could get away with creating a sound totally unheard of to the music industry! Never before has anyone been able to take several experimental sounds and rhythms and combine them into a brilliant chart topping album like Sign 'O' The Times. Prince combines the sounds of an electric xylephone and a deep funk bass rhythm with a snappy snare drum in the title track and follows it up with Housequake, which lives up to it's title. Everything in between is a musical trip that slows down to the album's end with a slow, romantic love ballad titled \\"Adore\\". Warner Bros. was very much pleased with the content of Sign 'O' The Times, and you will be too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what it's all about!","review":"This is Prince's first epic.Variety and tight production are thrown at you from all angles, and there is something here for everyone, while the 'purple genius' performs on a high level.

Any 30+ music lover probably has this essential album in their collection, but to all you youngsters who want to know why Prince was inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame, this is partly why. The guy is a genius on so many levels when it comes to music. The guy simply crossed genres like no other and for so long, and just as good as Elvis did.There's no need to list any stand out tracks, anyone who gets this album will enjoy most of them anyways.

Finally, the DAK engine died, and we looked for a replacement machine. After a lot of thought, we went for the smaller machine, with some reservations due to questions of whether it would be too small.Not a problem. We got it, and immediately made great bread. The recipes are simple, and the bread comes out perfect baked in the machine, or pulled out and baked in the oven.

My mother complained that the first use was an issue, but it's probably because she didn't get the measurements correct. We will probably buy the larger 2-lb breadmaker once my wife and I have kids.I would engineer this product slightly better for the amount of money. The lid doesn't have a stay-open position and can slam shut. It's hard to remove the breadpan because the handle is hot.

I've had this for about a week and have made the French bread, basic white bread and the raisin bread. With the exception of the raisin bread the breads have turned out perfectly (and I've only used the recipe booklet that came with the machine). The raisin bread didn't rise as much as the other breads (I think that may have been due to the cinnamon)so I won't try that recipe again. Regardless, I am excited to try other breads in the machine using other bread machine cookbooks.My only quibble is that the handle should be a little larger as it scrapes against the side of the bread as you take it out of the machine causing crumbs. The crumbs then land on the bottom of the unit near the heating element. Cleaning it out isn't too cumbersome, but it's a bit awkward.Otherwise I'm very happy with this purchase.

I am sending back. I noticed other reviews are stating the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really pleased with Zoji","review":"I am really pleased with this machine. I've made 2 loaves and they both came out great! I totally appreciate and agree with the advice of another reviewer to use \\"Smart Bread Recipes\\" by Woodruff. Though the book is only available in the \\"used\\" section, it is worth the price - the breads are whole grain, delicious, and healthy. The tips on using diastatic malt powder, lecithin, and ascorbic acid are very helpful. I made the Corn Rye Bread yesterday; the Dijon Rye today; and tomorrow I'll make the Russian Black Bread. I'm baking them and freezing them for later use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not from Japan","review":"The only reason I'm not giving this machine 5 stars is because it's not made in Japan, which I was kind of expecting given the high-ticketed price, though it was not mentioned in the description. So I was a bit disappointed when the box arrived. The loaves do come out tastier compared to my first \\"trial\\" breadmachine of $30, which is about equal in weight, but this one is only half as big! Very compact and sleek! This one has a much heavier baking pan which gives the bread a nice crispy crust. I don't think it will easily bend or break even if you drop it on the floor. Overall speaking, I'm still glad I made this splurge. If you are not too concerned about the price, go ahead and reward yourself with this nice piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"breadmaker","review":"The bread maker works very well but I wish I had gotten a bigger model. The bread is firm and the crust is crispy. There are other settings but I haven't tried them. Overall, I am very pleased with the Zojirushi -- just some regret over not having gotten the full size."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little bread maker","review":"I love this bread maker. The bread is excellent and very easy to make. I'm a single guy and a grazer. I used to graze on expensive food like meats, cheese, etc. Now I eat bread instead. Save me a lot of money. It seems well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty","review":"Makes good white bread and great French-style bread (crunchy crust but not hard). The bread toasts well be the pieces are too tall to fit into an ordinary toaster. It's fairly large if you have space constraints. Very quiet, doesn't get too hot. Has a delay timer that's easy to use, and an \\"other ingredient\\" beep for adding that which should only be stirred in.An excellent bred maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun baking toy","review":"I have owned the Zoji for over 2 months now and have been enjoying the bread making experience. However I find that I have to watch the kneading phase closely to add more water / wheat to get the consistency right, and as such have not been perfectly successful with the timer function. You get about 5-7 slices of bread from the 1lb loaf and takes approx. 3.5 hrs to bake. I wish it had a light so you can view the bread through the viewing window. I have been using a flash light to do so. I also wish it had a way to store and auto-release additions like some other bread makers have (we have to wait for the beep to add the additions). Overall, I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A small gems","review":"I were looking for a toy to make home made breakfast.I am so glad that I pick this bread machine over other bread machine, and over a waffer maker.This is small enough that I can keep it on the counter all the time.

I'll glad I went for the 1 lb loaf machine, because it's all my wife and I need. There's no use making a huge loaf and then expecting to eat it over several day because bread without preservatives and industrial drying goes stale in a day... If you want nice fresh bread, then you need to bake it daily.The bread texture is good out of this machine. I was a little worried that all we would get was dense bread, but this machines options allow me to make a nice light loaf. And the french bread setting (5hrs making time) is fantastic.Don't skimp on your ingredients. Buy proper high gluten 'bread flour' or pasta flour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Really Good Bread!","review":"An excellent product that produces an excellent product. It has settings for: regular or firm doughs, regular or light crust, quick baking (for rapidly rising doughs), french bread, dough only (if you wish to bake it separately), cookie/pasta dough, cake, and jam. A timer can start it for you for a delayed cycle. You place the liquids in first, then the dry ingredients, and last of all the yeast, so that the yeast remains dry and inactive until the bread making begins. I purchased \\"Bread Machine Magic\\" by Rehberg and Conway at the same time, and it was a good idea, since they have great recipes, and each recipe is sized for one pound, one and a half, and two pound loaves. The one pound loaf recipe is what you will need for this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific little machine!","review":"I did a lot of research and purchased and returned several machines from various manufacturers before ordering the Zo Mini.

The National was great and just died of old age. I went by the ratings for the Zojirushi and am very disappointed. I attempted to make 4 loaves going by their recipe and only one of the loaves turned out half way decent. I found that most of the time the ingredients just sit there, no kneading, resting they call it! Well all I would get at the end is a burned up mess of unstirred ingredients. I have returned it to amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bread Machine Fire Purchased from Amazon","review":"I purchased the Zojirushi 1-lb Bread Machine.

In the remote parts of the Islands we're told bread is hard to come by .... so what was the solution? Many boat owners bake bread on board, but I've never been good at making bread, even in a full size kitchen. I own the larger Zojirushi and have been very happy with it, but space is an issue on board the boat. Decided to try out the BB-HAC10 model. The machine arrived yesterday and I made my first loaf last night. Everything worked perfect!! This morning we had delicious toast. We had no jam --just butter -- so the true flavor came through. It was wonderful. I'm sure we'll be the envy of our cruising buddies with this nifty little breadmaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bread!","review":"After paying attention to the directions that tell you to put the yeast in a depression in the flour away from the liquid, I got great results!

But I find that I don't make it as often as I like because it is very time consuming. So, I decided to buy a bread machine.Unfortunately, despite the glowing reviews and my own sister's recommendation, this product did not live up to my expectations. Every loaf I made did not rise as much as I would like and the bottom crust always turned out tough and almost burned.Faced with the decision to have inferior bread on a more frequent basis, or much better bread on an irregular basis, I decided to return this and go back to making bread by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"great machine ! Perfect for more than just bread.","review":"Great bread machine. Easy to use... The breads cook up just the way we like them. The delay timer is wonderful for having fresh bread in the morning or whenever you need it. The size of the machine is perfect for my counter. Am planning on giving one as a gift. Definitely a 5 plus star rating.Update 2/15/2013: This machine is still great!! I have used it for bread and making other things. Making cookies is the best. I have adjusted my recipes to follow the cookie recipe that comes with the instruction booklet. It continues to work for me!!! If it ever goes out, i will be purchasing another!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great for a small space","review":"I don't have a lot of counter space so this is a good size.I used it several times since I bought it and I only ended up throwing away the bread (which turned out too heavy and hard) twice. I think that was due to old flour and most likely incorrect proportions of the ingredients. The other times, the bread turned out great. But I have sticking with the soft cycle though.Clean up was relatively easy.Its great to use the timer and wake up to the smell of fresh bread in the morning, but I guess any breadmaker with a timer can do that. This is my first breadmaker and it is perfect for my family of 2 so far.I would give it 5 stars if the price was lower."},{"rating":"1","title":"bread making works for about 1 year","review":"I still have other products made by zojirushi that have lasted over 3-4 years. But this one is disappointment.Here is why:1) Used only commercial available high quality breadmix and yeast from day one the bread was less than normal quality in terms of baking function. I was still happy for 1st year as it was atleast doing the grunt work of getting bread ready regardless of baking quality.2) after one year no matter what yeast or what breadmix I try, the dough never rise enough and baking makes it like stone hard no matter what setting i tried.I even tried rising the dough outside with manual method and just added dough back to this machine for baking and it still does not bake it right. My whole experimentation with this zojirushi machine is failure.Only thing this machine can do is knead the dough for you and still functioning after 3 years for kneading only.Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"It is perfect for me although, the had to refer to another bread cook book to be successful at making a loaf of whole wheat bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious bread.","review":"My wife just loves this machine.

Toss in the ingredients, plug it in, and it will let you know when you have fresh bread!

I use it at least once a week. I have toyed with recipes and finally found the perfect loaf. The machine is 5 Stars. However...The kneeding blade sheds it's non-stick coating, a thin plastic like film. With all of the reported toxic effects from plastics that break down with heat, I am concerned about this. I called the company. I was told to buy a new blade. That doesn't address the problem at all. The new blade will have the same problem. The price charged for a new blade on this website, $11, is outrageous considering that replacing blades will be an ongoing expense.Zojirushi needs to find a coating or an alloy that will provide a non-stick blade that doesn't shed possible toxins into the bread. In my phone call they wouldn't address the toxin issue.Oh, the bread pan looks to be coated with the same film. So far no shedding from the pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a poor loaf of bread","review":"I have a large bread maker which I was using less and less because of it's size. I thought getting the \\"mini\\" breadmaker would work better. I like the size of the smaller machine as I can keep it on my counter and handle it easily. However, I was very disappointed in the quality of the bread. I tried 3 different recipes. One was the Seven Grain Bread recipe using the \\"Firm\\" setting. It came out damp and soggy; the Cheese and Onion just didn't work at all--didn't rise; was just a lump. I tried a modified recipe with partial bread flour and wheat flour. That worked the best, but the loaf was very small, hard, and lumpy. It was very difficult to get decent shaped slices from it. I guess I'll go back to my large breadmaker or just make bread the old fashioned way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spoofing the action hero movies","review":"Real Men is a delightful spoof of the action hero type movie.A light hearted three way cross between James Bond, Get Smart, and The X-Files.This movie has some really off the wall gags in it.

It is very detailed, and slightly shocking at the same time. Dominique just sets herself up for stalkers and other obsessive weirdos...Anyway, the thing I like most about this is that she has written this herself, and that the book gives the reader an idea of just what the life of an elite gymnast is really like. A good read, and a must for Dominique fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Although this is a great read it is more suitable for younger children (around 10-year-olds) however if you're a Dominique fan I'm sure you'll love it.

I LOVE French films, Theater of the Absurd, Surrealism, Dada, Ionesco, Beckett, Genet. I think all the actors in this film are tops, especially Bernard Blier. But this movie is like a high school exercise in all of the above styles - it's shallow, predictable & not at all imaginative. The only thing that saves it for me is Michel Serrault's cameo scene in the beginning. Maybe I would liked it more if I were dependent on sub-titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"comedy's hard to do...black comedy even tougher","review":"I'm a fan of \\"Get Out Your Hankerchiefs\\" so assumed this offering from the same director would at least be enjoyable. I kept waiting for something funny to be done or said. I waited and waited. \\"The Trouble With Harry\\" or \\"Dr.Strangelove\\" are both great black comedies. This strives to be in their league but falls way short of the mark. It's possible that something's lost in the translation because to give the subtitles a dry read is to only further understand why French people revere Jerry Lewis-silliness in a somewhat surreal setting (wow, listen to that alliteration) does not necessarily make for a good comedy. Also the lack of subtlety (in every way with every character)makes this particularly off-putting. I'm at a loss as to how anyone could consider this even mediocre, much less brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-blowing","review":"This is certainly one of the best black comedies I've seen, and probably the most surreal (and absurd). The movie creates another reality that sharply contrasts with the one we're used to seeing and yet seems piercingly real. The actors are simply superb, the atmosphere is carried out to perfection, and the plot is simply awesome.This movie demonstrates what happens when two kinds of 'logic' (yours and the absurd one) crash.This movie is definitely one of the best French movies of all time. At least that's what I'd say..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark masterpiece","review":"This is a truly a flawless, dark and absurd masterpiece. The pace is very slow, the script theatrical, and the camera shots add an expressionist and \\"film noir\\" dimension to it all. Not to mention great acting by Carmet, Depardieu, Blier et al.If you have enjoyed movies like Barton Fink, Fargo, Cible Émouvante or even Dr. Strangelove, you have GOT to watch that movie.There is no action here.

DVD releases this disk fails to deliver on the potential of the movie. It offers full screen format instead of anamorphic widescreen or the letterboxing available on the laserdisc release. The production notes are insignificant. The movie begs for a commentary track. Even a spotter's guide to the cameos or appearences of Landis' hallmarks ('See You Next Wednesday' and 'The Girl from Ipanema') in the film would have been nice.Hopefully WB will realize that this movie didn't sell on DVD because they packaged it poorly, not because people don't want to own it.

As the red hot, central vamp character, Marie, Landis has Anne Parillaud (Le Femme Nikita herself!). With gallons of blood, gangland goings-on, and laughs aplenty, IB proves that, in the right hands, horror and comedy are a match made in heaven (hell?)...

I can see it would just be a matter of time until one of my guests tips over the bowl trying to get it open or closed. It's not that you can't open the lid--you can--but why would you want to give your guests a test of manual dexterity after a relaxing dinner?

I found it very hard to find a good stopping place, so I barely put the book down. It was a marvelous book, but it left much unsaid and unfinished at the end.

I ended up about a foot short of what I needed, but when I measured everything I had used, it only added up to 15 feet (I even added the cut ends, just to be fair). Should have just gone to the auto parts store in the first place. Didn't save me any time and certainly didn't save me any money.

The trilogy argues that we are at the beginning of changes as explosive as those wrought by the industrial revolution. Castells roams the world as he documents economic, social and political changes and speculates about the future. The author worked on these books for 12 years and this represents his life work. I actually would rate the trilogy an 11.

The mixture of very clever writing by Mortimer and the eloquence of Mckern in the part as Rumpole combine to rivet the viewer throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Change","review":"The episodes presented here are a welcome change from the high-voltage intensity of American crime dramas and a fitting tribute to Leo McKern, a great actor who is sorely missed.Having not seen the early episodes, I enjoyed watching the affectionate and somewhat bittersweet relationship between Rumpole and his son Nick, when he chooses not to follow in his father's footsteps and leaves for the USA with his American wife -- whom Rumpole has managed to alienate through his defence in a rape case.Regular viewers will enjoy observing how the characters changed over the arc of the series, such as the evolution of Marigold Featherstone from a bouyant young woman married to a barrister on the way up to a cynical and disappointed middle aged wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better the second time around","review":"Enjoyed it the first time -- perhaps largely for its quirkiness and polished acting.

Even the local Lego store fails to keep it in stock, so I purchased it through Amazon.com.It is a fun project, with a number of working parts. The model is complex, and this intricacy adds to the fun.The main trouble, though, is the instructions. Unlike all the other Lego Star Wars models we have put together, this one does not list the parts needed at the top of each page. As a result, it is sometimes tricky to determine exactly which pieces are used in any given page. One has to examine the illustration on each page very carefully, to see which pieces are being added on that page.

Every scene is hilarious, nearly every line is a complete crack-up. The Beatles needed to be spoofed and they gave their blessing for this project. My guess is they even found it funny (though I doubt John liked seeing Nasty's wife portrayed as a Nazi).The capper is the music. Some of the songs are just brilliant rip-offs, combining two or three elements of three Beatles songs.

The commentary is much louder than many of the song sequences - notably Hold My Hand, Love Life, etc. And the special features are rubbish - unedited, clumbsy and unfunny outtakes from the Jagger/Simon interview sessions and Eric Idle's pointless 23 years on intro.

Basically, there are only a few laughs, and they weren't specific to the Beatles so it could've been put in any mockumentary. What also disappointed me was there was not much interaction of the Rutles - you don't get to see them talk to each other much, which could've provided many funny moments. The song parodies weren't that funny, either.What I did like was the visual aspects of the movie - they really did get the look of the Beatles throughout the years pretty accurately. It was also good to see many of the original Saturday Night Live cast and they provided much of the few funny moments in the movie.If you want to see a funny mockumentary, check out \\"Spinal Tap\\" and \\"Fear of a Black Hat\\".

The lyrics to the music are just too plain - really lacking jokes.Maybe rent this one from the library, but you can save the money - you'll see my copy up on ebay soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and concise","review":"Though not as large as I anticipated, the guide does manage to discuss the authors that make French literature what it is, and does the discussion in a highly readable manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"This book is about Angel and her first love Drew, who was tricked by Angel's twin sister Aiden into marriage in the past. Now Aiden is dead but she still seems to hount Angel and her relationship.This one was pretty good for a book of this series. Unfortunately a lot of them tend to be little surprising and sometimes even boring. But not Angel's Don't Cry.It had really good parts, e.g. the whole mystery about Aiden and the feeling Angel had that someone was in her house, that was pretty exiting. The town and the surrounding were described as very pretty and that's important for me. I didn't really expect it to turn out the way it did and that is not very often in Silhouette or Harlequin books.So if you are able to get it, do it and read the book, you shouldn't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS STOVE!!!","review":"This stove design is very good in theory, but when they made it they did not test it. The air vents need to be much bigger. Even when fully open, the creosote builds up in the stove pipe so fast that it chokes off the chimney. Chimney and spark arrestor need to be larger to accomodate the smoke. You cannot make a fire small enough to keep smoke from coming out of the door when you open it. Don't let the apparent great design fool you. This stove is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It!!","review":"Amen to the first review!

For the first 3.5 hours the 8 man tent was filled with smoke (toxic?) from the sh***y paint that was not heat resistant. After 50% of the paint fell onto the ground the thing could not keep a fire going, vent adjustments are too limited and flue is too small. The flue is lacking a damper and lets all of the hear go out the top. I too had the issue that when I opened the front to add a log the smoke filled the tent and gave me a headache and then went out @ 4am since after 6 hours of constant tending it couldn't keep a fire going on its own. I used it once, I will be throwing it away. Complete waste of money. Don't let its good looks fool you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spoof This!","review":"Charlie Sheen is impeccable in this film!

I think it is great that a book could captured a feeling such as that because like in the real world,some men are the same as Chad. This book is a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted dialogue.","review":"I found this entire series to be kind of stilted and boring. The idea for this book was a good one, however NOBODY talks like these characters. All three of the male \\"heroes\\" said phrases like, \\"I am never gonna get married. No woman is ever going to trap me into marriage. Maybe it worked for my brothers, but not for me. No sir.\\" But like over and over and over again. And in each book a similar phrase can be found. There was no artistry to the descriptions or their thoughts. A twelve year old could have written this book. I almost don't even believe Connie Mason wrote this. I've read many of her other books and they were fantastic. Books that made me emotionally involved with the characters, books like: Sierra, Tears Like Rain, and A Promise of Thunder. This book DID NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's no Gods and Generals","review":"I was hopping that this fictional account of the civil war will have the same riveting battle scenes and in-depth account of the human struggle as the war escalated, but it was quite disappointing.

Therefore, I know I wouldn't be reading the second book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficially developed characters with litte feeling","review":"This is a wonderful series of books covering the civil war from the Southern viewpoint through the eyes of a Yankee sympathetic to the Southern cause through highly stretched circumstances!!!

All it did was get jammed about 6\\" into the toilet's drain. HOPELESSLY JAMMED! There was nothing to prevent it from moving forward except the u-bend of the toilet, and apparently, the broad knob at the end of the auger was too large to take the tight turn. The more my husband and I tried, the more the ball-shaped knob at the end became crushed and twisted, but it never would take that turn through the tube. What a waste of money.

When she nails the note, she can sound as good as Nancy Wilson (Heart) in her prime. When she doesn't, which is more often then not, there's hell to pay.

THIS BAND RAWKS!!!","review":"Seeing this band live is a life changing experience, especially if you are not too fond of female rockers. She has changed my opinion of female rock! Lzzy Hale, of the band Halestorm, not only f*cking RAWKS, but she is very easy on the eyes - hot, HOT as a matter of fact- and such a nice person to meet. The entire band made it a point to meet all their fans and didn't rush us through like so many bands. They talked to each one of us and genuinely wanted to know some personal things about every fan! Lzzy's voice is the best female rock voice I have ever heard and I know this band will be very successful. Total entertainment from start to finish, they leave you wanting more. I bought the CD and just love it because it's the same on disc as live!!!!!! This is a must see/hear band if they come within 200 miles of your hometown. I, for one, cannot wait until they are back in range again, I will be a fan for life!

I mounted a 1600LM light which mounts with a O ring type mount to the center. On each side of the the center light I mounted LED flashlight type bicycle lights. Each of the lights has a high, low and flashing option. This gives all kinds of lighting options for just about any condition. It looks cool too. Another great product from Topeak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke First Day of Use","review":"On my first trip using the Extender, I attached the extender to my front handlebar and then attached 2 six inch Cree flashlights to the extender. I put my bike on my car and dropped my car off for service. I bicycled out of the repair shop's parking lot after dropping off my car. No more than 15 feet of the repair shop parking lot, I heard my flashlights hit the ground. The thin bar that connected the two parts in the picture had broken into two pieces. The part attached to the bike was still attached. The part where you put flashlights was on the ground. What a waste of money! FYI - That thin bar is not solid metal. The core is made of something that breaks very easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart buy","review":"It has a complicated instalation process, but it is worth it. It can be tightened down enough so that it won't move. It even fit around my front fork, imagine a bike with fog lights. It's made with allen screws so there's no worry of stripping the screws either. I just wish stores sold them locally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well","review":"Used to mount GPS and cycle computer above Ortlieb handlebar bag on our tandem.

Then, toward the end of my first ride with it (~2 hours), it just snapped. The shiny chrome-looking bit connecting the base to the bar extension appears to be metal, but in fact is cheap flimsy plastic. I'm just glad I was less than a mile from home and my computer wire and air zound tubing kept it from falling into my wheel. I didn't think my air zound horn bit, cateye strada cadence computer and small headlight were too much weight, but I guess I was wrong. Do not waste your money on the cheaply made piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked out well!","review":"I mounted this on the handlebar stem of my recumben to hold a front light. I had to use electrical tape around the bar to get a tight fit, but once its on its doing its job well. I wish the mechanism for attaching and detaching it from the bar was a little easier.

I could not get the mounting base that attaches to the handlebar to tighten properly. In fact, the metal strap actually deformed and simply wouldn't stay tight. Maybe I did something wrong but I seriously doubt it. As with their handle bar bag, they seem to have a problem with mounting brackets. They LOOK nice but form follows FUNCTION! I have a lot of Topeak products on my bike that I would highly recommend but they really have a problem with handle bar mounts. I noticed that most of the other reviews for the Extender were favorable but I had a very bad experience with mine. So, just make sure you keep your receipt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gadget!","review":"Such a cool little gadget! I bought this to mount a Sigma bike computer/heart rate monitor on. The computer is wireless and has to be within a certain proximity range to both the transmitter on the front fork and the heart rate monitor belt that you wear around your chest in order to get accurate readings. After a couple of trial locations, I found it worked best if I mounted it at a right angle to the handlebar stem, angled to the left side and somewhat parallel, but lower than the left side handlebar on my bike. At this location, the readings are very accurate and it's very easy to see and use the computer. The Topeak Bar Extender is very easy to install, is well-built and is very sturdy once installed and it looks great too. The design offers excellent flexibility for mounting just about anywhere at various angles and lengths. Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"May have another please","review":"This thing is GREAT. I bought it because my bike light went bonkers.

Unfortunately, this movie deals with serious political and social subjects, not so much satirizing as editorializing. The point of view would have been that of Hollywood, America's Pied Piper, even when the movie was released, but now is dated at best. School shootings, 9/11, and the war have put a distance between then and now. The smarmy villain of the movie is, naturally, an agent of the U.S. government; and there are no other villains on this earth. There are only a few funny moments: the Coneheads' bedroom furniture, Mrs. Conehead's method of vacuuming the carpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIZARRE DISASTER FLICK","review":"Perhaps the CGI effects are too gimmicky and some of the acting a little stiff, but VOLCANO DISASTER has some unique twists in its storyline that elevate it anyway. A young volcanologist (well played by Chris William Martin) loses his wife in a volcano eruption. He had promised her on the day of her death that he would accompany her on a trip to her homeland in Italy, which he does after her untimely demise. Once there, he meets a strange girl who has some kind of mystical connection to his dead wife. The villagers think she's demented, but it seems she may have some kind of warning for the young widower. The supernatural overtones help fill out the otherwise routine plotting, but the volcanic eruption at the end is well staged and involving. Not bad for an unknown low budget film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but I wouldn't pay alot for it","review":"My mom and I love to watch natural disaster films, so I got this one on a whim.

Annie Chun makes a great product. If you are going to do microwavable food for lunch, then you should be eating her products.

It is very difficult to put any kind of body into my hair even when using special products. This hot air brush does an amazing job of creating body. There are two heat settings.

No light reading, at well over 600 pages it packs in details from across disciplines and was widely read on both sides of the Iron Curtain: today its many insights on military strategies, issues, and the logic of amassing thermonuclear armaments still apply. It was the first book to examine the underlying logic of making and keeping nuclear weapons, originally created from a series of lectures, and provides both military and college-level collections with strong insights on military might and strategy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating look at nuclear strategies","review":"It's good to see this book back in print, even though nearly 50 years have passed since it was written, because it analyzes a topic of vital importance to national security. Author Herman Kahn is the man (and his book) who was the genesis for Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, \\"Dr. Strangelove.\\" The book gives the reader a chilling look at strategies in which to wage *and* win a nuclear war. It is definitely an iconoclastic work for the factual and dispassionate manner in which mass casualties and future birth defects are discussed and quantified --- with graphical information plotted logarithmically by order of magnitude. In retrospect the work is quite outdated, but the discussions of nuclear-powered aircraft and available mine-shaft space are amusing.

The only reason to buy *this* one instead of another cat/kitten book, is the dummies-lay out.

If you want to learn about all the different ways your kitten can die with examples, you might enjoy this book. This book is also not well organized.

It's hilarously bad. Ruth Buzzi in spandex and big hair is just weird on so many levels. The producers bleached Adam Baldwin's hair blond in this movie. I think they did that otherwise you wouldn't be able to tell him or the other 'star' apart. If you like 'wrestling' you might enjoy this movie. IT's about 2 roommates who happen to be cops. They are suspended from the force. They try their hands at other jobs as construction workers and strippers. They eventually decide to become 'pro wrestlers' and are trained by Ruth Buzzi's character and her husband. The climax is the match against the Soviet Unions 'pro wrestlers'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie sucks, strip scene is amusing","review":"The movie as a whole sucks.

There's not much evidence that Mr. Wren has ever liked cats, \\"Henrietta\\" included. True, he admits as much in the introduction (well, that makes it alright), but the few genuinely affectionate details come second hand from his children, who should be writing their own books, not his. When Mr. Wren isn't subscribing to a general I-hate-man and-beast facsimile of humor, he finds time to:1) Complain constantly about Henrietta's upkeep2) Begrudge her a redemptive talent for eating house rats (paying her board I guess).3) Eat a cat (yes, a cat) at a Chinese restaurant (but he didn't tell Henrietta, *giggle*)Read carefully and you'll see that Mr. Wren really wishes he'd abandoned Henrietta or his book contract or both. Maybe someone should pay a real cat lover to write the travel/cat book he wouldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not charmed at all","review":"I'm glad I'm not the only one who was taken aback by this book. First, as a long-time cat owner, I find it hard to fathom that any feline would enjoy being shipped, time and time again, to new and frequently inhospitable locations; Henrietta would have to have been *very* unusual. And the Wrens manage to lose her in Cairo (somehow, she finds them again), then dump her off with relatives for a year when she becomes inconvenient. Another reviewer mentioned the atrocious \\"since I'm an investigative reporter, I forced myself to eat cat in a Chinese restaurant, and it was kind of tasty\\" anecdote. It's really miraculous Henrietta lived as long as she did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for cat lovers","review":"Do not give this book as a gift to a cat lover such as myself. Henrietta's first owner only had her because she never bothered to spay her female cat. Instead of responsibly finding good homes for the kittens, she placed the kittens with anyone who would look twice at an offer of a bottle of scotch (and cheap scotch, at that). Mr. Wren adopted the cat as a thoughtless and last minute Christmas gift, a common way animals end up in shelters. He goes on (and on) to explain how he tried to get rid of the cat so he'd be free to travel. I didn't get much past that, but I take it they lost the cat several times in foreign countries, and who knows what the poor thing went through. I work for a humnane society and see too many animals neglected and subjected to such misconceptions as contained in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not particularly interesting or amusing","review":"I'm sorry, but the anecdotes in this book are not nearly as interesting or amusing as the premise would suggest.

Haye's poetry is angry and blue. It's wild and yet contemplative, structured and yet abstract. Which means nothing in terms of a review, but he is possibly the strongest voice in American poetry today. His words are powerful and relentless. He is the future of American poetry and he's already arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Unique","review":"This poetry was modern, unique, insightful, absolutely brilliant. T.Hayes is spicy! I cannot say what was better - reading the poetry or simply looking at it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this 0 stars if I could.","review":"This is hands down the WORST purchase I have made on Amazon. I know, I know, you get what you pay for. Yet, I failed to see any mention of the fact that the sapphires would have visible chips, pits and cracks in them (one of the chips covers almost half of the sapphire). This was going to be a gift, but it's such a terrible piece that I can't imagine giving it to anyone. If you are thinking of buying this - save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thorough treatment of UML, VB and their integration.","review":"Mr. Reed's book explains the UML and its use with VB application development very clearly and concisely.

The bamboo blade sinks deeply... blood on red armor","review":"A reinterpretation of (Kobatashi's Masaki) 1962 film of the same base title: \\"Seppuku\\" released as \\"Harakiri\\" outside of Japan. (Takashi's Miide) film is much more humanistic in its approach and offers a darker and arguably more honest foundation for the motivation of the plot. The 1962 film is much more adherent to the core of and trap of Bushido as an apologetic to the feudal system and its hypocrisy. Both films are excellent and are worth seeing back to back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai","review":"A poignant film from start to finish. This film doesn't simply only pertain to the age of the samurai, it presents questions relevant today; Is honor worth the holes it communication it creates? Action is not a primary theme, it is not necessary either. The cinematography is beautiful, and the acting was masterful. No effort is needed for slipping into the world of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything the title implies","review":"Well done. A movie that will keep your attention even though you are trying to look away. Well made and worth a watch for the samurai enthusiast seeking that edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, Poorly-Paced, Manipulative","review":"Well-shot as is typical of Miike's work. Unfortunately the middle 80% of the film is a disastrously-paced and emotionally manipulative slog. We're told everything important about the characters' stories in the first five minutes and spend the next 2 hours watching a backstory in which neither character nor the plot is expanded upon. The larger part of the film is just an emotional snuff-film, wherein we get long scenes that dwell on the suffering of the characters for no real reason.The end of the film manages to fail even by the more straight-forward standards of a Samurai revenge flick. We're left with a final seen in which the Bad Guys stand around and shrug, \\"gee, that wasn't so bad.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye- opening","review":"I found this book to be very graphic as well insightful. It inspires hope as well as courage. The book starts our hard to read but that is expected when it was written on Polish then translated into English. Once you get into the book though it really becomes quite an easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"1991 Studio album, great lost disc.","review":"What can I say about this album? If you like Sammi Smith then you will want to add this to your collection. Its a great piece of traditional sounding country that came out in 1991 (not 1995). Somehow this slipped under the radar, being a small label (Playback also released Jeanne C Riley's Here Jeanne album the same year) they could have gone under or had no promotional budget. There seems to be very little info about this CD online so my main reason to post this review is to confirm that this is a album of original material, not a compilation and worth snatching up if you are a fan of Sammi Smith or other classic country female singers. This is truly a lost gem and I believe her last full album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, if you like folk music straight from the heart...","review":"Bob Neuwirth delivers this offering in a manner that allows one to understand where he's coming from in each song. Thankfully, each song has its own story and feel, yet you are able to easily recognize Bob's unique vocal quality. \\"Great Spirit\\" is an anthem for living and \\"Busted Bottle\\" is one of the most relatable, well-written songs in any catagory of music. You will enjoy all the sounds in between, like the driving, train-like rhythm of \\"Winter in Berlin\\" and the rooty-toot-toot horns of \\"Biggest Bordertown.\\" This release is truly a must-have in your folk music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 yr olds with Plastic Swords","review":"OMG - even \\"The scantily clad Princess Tritia of Blue Land\\" can not save this movie.Perhaps more scantily clad princess warriors that are less clad would help the ogle factor but the movie would still be absolutely pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you like cosplay","review":"I have not seen many of the Asian \\"B\\" movies, so I am not sure if this is pretty standard fare or not. Acting is, well, lacking. Seriously, it's one big long cosplay movie. About two thirds in it, the girl gets tortured several different ways, I thought that was to much S & M, I fast forwarded past all that. No woman should be portrayed that way for that long in a film.

I have no love for dispensation eschatology myself so that is not what bothers me.The big problem is that this is an attack on the Bible. The teaching espoused here comes not from the book of Daniel. It comes from the liberal's view that Daniel was written during the time of Antiochus Epiphanes. This is necessary because the liberal presupposition is that no one can prophesy the future.Another outworking of their presupposition is that the fourth beast of Daniel 7 (fourth kingdom of Daniel 2) is not Rome but Greece. Again this is because of the liberal view that Daniel was not capable of prophesy about a future power, so the prophesy cannot be about Rome.And in their view, Jesus cannot be the Messiah of Daniel 9:25-27. And so it goes until the book of Daniel is made devoid of any real meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I love this man's films - from Ju Dou (an early classic) up to The Road Home (saw it yesterday in the theater - beautiful...), but this one is really a bummer - none of the sweeping visual style or strong emotion, but lots of wandering around experiencing the dull, uninteresting pain of bureaucracy. Perhaps there is a China-specific commentary being made here that is of interest to some (most of the positive reviews here dwell on that), but if you like Zhang's movies for their more universal themes, don't disappoint yourself by watching this.If you've only seen one of his films and are interested in more, make sure you've seen Ju Dou and Raise the Red Lantern, as well as the lesser heard-of Shanghai Triad, which will also satisfy any Gong Li requirements you might have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I just found this to be boring propaganda","review":"This film was obviously much appreciated by a great many people but I found it very boring.I usually enjoy foreign films and I enjoy thought-provoking films not action films.I loved \\"To Live\\" and enjoyed \\"Ermo\\" but I found this film dull as can be.The premise of the film is that a young woman's husband is kicked in the crotch by the local village chief for a perceived insult. The young wife protests that the chief was in the wrong and takes this grievance to higher and higher levels of Chinese bureaucracy.Personally, I feel the message of this film is that the Chinese government is very caring and is concerned about the lot of its most vulnerable people and that, moreover, the government is composed of very wise and uncorruptible men. I personally am rather skeptical!The only reason I didn't give this film one star is that it does have some presentation of life in a rural chinese village."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I first saw Gong Li in \\"Raise the Red Lantern\\" So I had to see this one.Here she plays a pregnant peasant woman, wife of a chili farmer. Who receives a kick in the groin, from the village chief. Because he believes the farmer insulted him.Qiu Ju is hell bent on getting an apology for her husband. She is more determined in this than her husband.The chief offers money but throws it on the ground, saying then she will be forced to bow to him as she picks it up. She refuses.She sells their chilies a little at a time for money to travel to the city, to see if justice can be got there. But she's a country woman with not much city experience or money, can she do it?I won't spoil the ending---- Good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justice","review":"A woman's husband get kicked where it counts by an official. Thus begins a wives long trek for Justice. A truly great story of how she will only settle for not less than Justice. Gong Li plays the pregnant mother of the man violated.

It's great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an enjoyable movie!","review":"Not One Less is an excellent movie in that it depicts the relationship between the various layers in the state and rural China. Also, it reveals how the main character (Qiu Ju) in this movie didn't give up on her need to receive justice for her husband being kicked by their local chief."},{"rating":"2","title":"The justice is blind but, from time to time, opens its eyes!","review":"Once more, the genius of Yimou Zhang is carved in relief through this simple and zealous story about a woman who decides to take to the last instances, an abominable act of aggression and cruelty exerted by the mayor of a small village over her husband. She is pregnant, but although this circumstance, she doesn't give up and just accompanied by her sister, she will do the best she can in order the justice was made.A story whose influence comes directly from the Italian Nero Realism, well narrated and magisterially directed, by this master of cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS ALBUM","review":"I'm a big fan of MT, and to be honest with you, this album was one of their successful albums. This was the 4th album from Modern talking released in 1986. Even though, \\"romantic warriors - the 5th album' and \\"in the garden of venus - the 6th album\\" are still decent, those last 2 albums before their first split up were not nearly as good as the first 4 albums. so this album was the end of their \\"GOOD ALBUMS ERA\\" for most people.

It feels like a stage play, all artsy and full of unusual sets. But the actual story is weak and feels like a series of pasted together moments. If you're in the mood for an interesting visual experience/experiment, try it out. If you want a good action movie, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie worth the buy","review":"Definitely an interesting movie, I liked it a lot.

Sword-fight after sword-fight, bare knuckle power beats up many, many, many bad guys; and always for the right reason (something about freedom?), etc. The visuals grab you at the beginning; the comic-book scenery back to live-action is interesting for about 10 minutes, but nothing changes in this dull, 1-dimensional no-brainer. There is NOTHING of any interest to hold your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap looking Sin City wanna-be.","review":"The film attempts to follow in the visual story telling of Sin City, 300, The Spirit etc., but fails. The story line and the acting leave a lot to be desired. The movie is full of popular actors, but no stars. You recognize mostly what I can only guess are out of work actors. This is a typical Saturday afternoon made for cable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"I sat through this at a film festival last year and everyone in the audience I spoke with afterward agreed that this may be the one of the worst films of all time. It is boring, moronic, and clueless. The only thing it has going for it is a nice visual flair... which gets you through about ten minutes. Everyone involved in the making of this atrocity should be ashamed.

A real turn-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shine needs to Re-Born","review":"\\"Born\\", Bonds first album, was an incredibly inspiring and amazing album: varied, passionate, deeply enlivening. \\"Shine\\" is the opposite; repetitive tunes- uncreatively commercial and superficial; simply mediocre.

I wasted $18 on an album I could't bear to hear more than once...what a contrast to their other work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond Goes Down.","review":"The day bond's first album came out, I was at the mall with a twenty in my hand. I was extremely excited when I heard that their second album would be out soon. I purchased the CD and was VERY DISSAPOINTED! Being a violinist, I felt that the skill quality of their music had gone down. Their first album showed off much more of their talent and intrigued both worlds of classical and pop. This one seemed just pure pop. I like to play music by ear, and it was fairly difficult to learn some songs on \\"Born,\\" but \\"Shine\\" was a breeze. I feel that their technical merrit and gone waaaay down. Also I DID NOT CARE FOR the pictures. I feel sad that my (used to be) favorite group sold out and began to dress blehishness because they didn't feel they could sell albums by pure talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"For kids only","review":"When I was a kid we had this kind of kitsch, called \\"Hooked on Classics.\\" It was inspiring and a lot of fun.

Kije.There's no way this album would please a lover of real classical music. It's puerile to an adult.I'm not against anything that's good for music education in the aggregate.

I found it more techony than the first CD and there's not much complicating parts like in the song \\"Duel\\" from the first CD. As a figre skater, I was hoping to skate to the second CD becuase too many skaters already skate to the first CD. But there are only a few songs in the second CD that are skatable. The melodies of the songs are ok, but not as good as the first CD (except for the re-written songs).

I was blown away. I couldn't wait till the release of their follow up, Shine. I recommend it to anyone and everyone, and I think it should appeal to everyone. I'm 15 and loads of my friends think Bond are cool, but I also know loads of adults who think they're great too. The CD is diverse, new and imaginative - with the perfect balance of classical tracks - including Palladio by Karl Jenkins and some Albinoni - as well as tracks by modern composers - Fiennes et al - as well as works by the girls themselves. They are obviously so talented and this CD is a definite MUST HAVE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond's 2nd album","review":"The new Bond CD is very good. It has the same enhanced musical style of their first CD. One song is a Led Zepplin cover, however the James Bond music cover is quite good. All the music was performed up to their high standard.

Overall, I would recommend it to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I was transfixed by Bond 2 years ago. Born, both CD and Live at the Royal Albert Hall (RAH) were excellent. Last year I bought 50 DVD's for all my friends to help \\"promote\\" it. Shine, on the other hand, will have totalled one purchase. Something's very wrong with Bond. They went from RAH to sleazy UK clubs to teaching; their Web site is very disjointed; and Shine smacks of a Hollywood remake. James Bond theme was already released in their DVD. They've gone from being \\"sexy\\" Divas with world class strings coming first - to - cheap looking regulars. Nothing special anymore. Pity, really, and for an ex-pat I was proud to have them as another export."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Picked up three{3} copies of \\"Shine\\" so that I can have one in my car & one at each place I work.

I could hear their violin much better, much clearer from their first CD \\"Born\\". In this second CD, there are a lot of background music, digital effects, etc. that made it difficult to hear their violins. This CD is a bit too commercial. The background effects masked the ladies' true talents in violin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close and almost perfect","review":"I had really high hopes for the release of \\"Shine,\\" and the girls were only a chord off the scale. I think that the girls played magnificently; it was the first song that made me want to skip it. Some Euro DJ has decided to remix \\"Allegretto\\" / \\"the DeBeers Diamond is Forever\\" tune into some [weak], synthisized beat. I can't stand what they did with that, so when bond came on with it, I almost wanted to turn it off. All their tracks are full of the energy and renaissance of classical music.Their music expresses so many emotions, but all put you at such ease and state of relaxtion, it's the perfect choice for any stressful situation. My favorite track is either Kashmir or bond on Bond.If you found \\"Shine\\" a masterpiece, then \\"Born\\" will blow you away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"Ok, most of the songs are high energy and great to dance to. I love the fact that it also has electronic sounds. It's great to bellydance to. If you really want to feel this music, put this one your stereo with the highest volume. It's catchy, cute, but not bubblegum pop. I love this. It's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!! These girls rock!","review":"Bond is absolutely amazing! I loved every second of the CD and I never can get enough of it. I am 15 and play the cello and love orchestral music, but nothing compares to the unique style that these girls have.

Oh, did I forget to mention their cover of the James Bond theme? This time around, two of the \\"Bond girls\\" actually pen their own cuts (Haylie Ecker wrote \\"Sahara\\"; Eos Chater created \\"Ride\\"), lending the girls' sophomore release a more personal touch.

I didn't catch the name of the video (now I know..it was Victory), but I told myself that these girls really make good music. The next time I saw Bond...at the Miss Universe 2003 Pageant. I was attracted to the music that they were playing and after that I went straight to the record store to buy this album. I popped the CD into the player and listened to it. Tracks like Allegretto, Fuego and Ride are really incredible. The music is very unique and it soothes my mind. Since then, I always listen to this CD everyday.

The sex scenes are also ridiculous and not a very good idea (many little organisms live in saltwater).This book has moments of adult reading stewed in with writing styles more appropriate for the 'Babysitters Club' series.Though this book will be the last Kenner novel I open; I really blame the editor for allowing much of this material to ever see print."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect doorway into this exciting dynamc era","review":"I have been searchinjg for the complete Marlborough for years, had originally wanted the hard bound early edition but difficult to find complete setes.

His voice isn't quite the rumbling thundercloud it would later become -- in parts he sounds quite like Randy Newman -- but that wonderful Brown mix of humour (never at the expense of others) and poignancy is already in place. Sixteen songs, most of them unavailable on any other Brown release, and nearly all essential. 'Ella Mae' -- a song about Greg's grandmother that's also about the dignity of a well-lived life and how we live on in our children -- doesn't have a whiff of mawkishness or sentimentality about it, and damn near moves me to tears every time I hear it. 'Dream On' -- a beautiful example of Brown's shaggy-dog storytelling -- always provokes a grin too. That this disc was unavailable for years is a crime.

I first read this book in grade 6 when everyone else was reading about babysitters or high school twins and it introduced me to a whole other world of mystery, magic and myths. In my mind this lovely tale about the last dragon of his kind who travlelled far and wide to discover the preciousness of the written word is a wonderful book for children and adults alike. It helps us realize that stories such as this and any other form of learning and expanding the mind are the teasure we should be stiving to protect. I adored this book as soon as I read it.

The plot spirals downwards from there, leading to NOTHING. That is, as other readers said, the book had no discernable ending!The characters, Ben included, are all shallow--there were numerous places in the book where I just wanted to scream at Ben for acting as dumb as she acts.

I also love the L.A. dating scene as the novel's backdrop. I could relate to Benjamina Franklin's plights. She makes the same relationship mistakes she warns her readers about. She is a tad neurotic, but isn't that the reason why we read these books in the first place? Isn't neurosis one of single women's signature traits? How to Meet Cute Boys isn't food for the intellect.

But my viewing partner agreed with me that this one was a big fat let down. How many minutes of this film had Julianne Moore in it? Five? So what is her name doing on the opening credits? The ending is also pathetic. Oh, it's ok Harrison. Gosh, we're real embarrassed and sorry about all of this. Forgive and forget? Uh huh.

I am just appalled that there is no lossless audio. For those of you that don't know, Dolby Digital 5.1 is DVD quality audio. Ripoff. The picture of course is a bit better that the DVD just because of the resolution (it WILL look better than the DVD on your HDTV) but also subpar to most blurays (even MUCH older films). Just look at what was done with Jaws.

Don't buy this garbage release. Five stars for the film though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Well Done.","review":"This movie was very well done. Tommy Lee Jones was at his best as usual.

Generally, to earn five stars from me, it has to be a movie that I could see many times, even in one week. This movie does not qualify for that. Although it is very good, I can only watch it once every six months or so. However, since it really is good, it should qualify as five stars, especially compared to other four star movies.The acting is good, the cinematography is great, the transfer is very good (especially considering it was one of the early DVDs to hit the market) and the special effects are good enough that you hardly notice them (which is what I consider good -- you don't notice that they are there).The suspense is high in that you don't know if he will get caught (no, I won't tell you).

When Girard and his team arrive at the accident scene and he delivers the line, \\"My, my, my, my, my. What a mess,\\" you know immediately that Jones is going to steal the show. I also liked Kimble's level-headed intelligence. Instead of simply evading the law, he's trying to clear his name. As he learns the truth about the crime, so do we - the script is not overt in revealing plot threads. Together, Jones and Ford form an intriguing cat-and-mouse game that will keep you engrossed. All in all, the movie is loads of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A DVD review","review":"This seems like a movie that is ripe for a special edition DVD. This DVD has no extras, not even a trailer, other than some notes on the insert. DVD collectors may want to wait for a special edition unless you absolutely have to have this in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a much higher rating, but this one's on the Blu...","review":"warner continues to issue all of their products with the Nasty, NASTY VC-1 codec because it was easy for them to do it both in Blu-ray and hd-dud. And I can see the differences in their releases and other companies who use the FAR more superior AVC. They even stick only to the antiqued douby-digital! Never have I seen a release with a DTS track in any of warners stuff, and it rubs me raw because I usual see the DTS mark at the end of the credits in most of the movies!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie now in beautiful HD","review":"Although this movie is fantastic, sadly it is one of Harrison Ford's last good performances (other than perhaps \\"Clear and Present Danger\\" in 1994). Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble, a man wrongly accused of killing his wife. He escapes prison and then sets out to not only avoid recapture, but also prove his innocence. As good as Ford's performance is, this movie is really carried by Tommy Lee Jones who plays Marshall Samual Gerard. His humor and intensity are outstanding. The plot is intriguing with lots of action. This is the first movie I've had the pleasure to see in the theater, on laserdisc, on DVD, and now on HD DVD. The HD DVD transfer is quite good and the sound is improved over the DVD version as well. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A top notch mystery and amazing picture and sound quality.","review":"One of the greatest mystery films of the last decade. Chock full of so much suspense, it can be easily mistaken for a thriller.As far as the Blu-ray edition goes, 5 out 5 stars for picture and sound. The skin tones are well rendered and the blacks almost never clip. The sound is house shaking without an ounce of distortion. The picture is sharper then I remember even from the theatrical presentation.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked only 6 months.","review":"Bought this for our modem.

When this book was written, the oil industry didn't simply 'influence' Texas, it OWNED Texas, lock, stock and government barrel. The US was in it's peak and decline of oil production, so these companies set up laws and institutions to determine how they would rule the energy industries, how they would pay landowners and countries, and thus, control many aspects of the world's future. We are now seeing the results of their influences on OPEC and US military intervention, 50 years later. Follow up reading this book with Greg Palast's \\"Armed Madhouse\\", and you will not look at a gas station the same way ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A picture book","review":"This book is great for looking at great designs but hardly one to use to create a t-shirt. There is no in depth directions to make any of these t-shirts. I was interested in making new designs for my t-shirts (tie dye) and this book is totally useless. You really have to guess at what they are doing since there are not many directions to follow. For example: They tell you to use c-clamps to secure it between wood- well how is it positioned, what size wood ? Everything is very vague in the directions. They show only one picture of folding a t-shirt and that doesn't show you anything of how to position it. I have been tie dying for 10 years and hoped for more in depth directions to create new designs. I guess it is back to the drawing board for me. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this book. I can go to many web sites to look at great designs if I just wanted a collection of pictures. Very disapointed in this one......"},{"rating":"2","title":"South of Sanity is quirky fun","review":"This was my favorite of the 4 in the series by Suzann Ledbetter.If you need a laugh but want a bit of romance and some bizarre sleuthing thrown in, this is a great read.

The art in Uncanny is the epitomy of timelessness.

This book is as unengaging as they come and by the first chapter will have you questioning whether you want to be a doctor (if the profession is really that dull). The content of this book would not fill a mildly interest brochure. Moreover this uninventive book disproves the old saying that everyone has a good book in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Both my girlfriend and I have read this book and both of us were sadly disappointed. If you are looking for information on what medical school entails in terms of what rotations you come upon, then this is a great read, but usually that information is available simpler on most medical schools websites. Melvin Konner, arrogant and brash, should rename his book \\"I am right and everyone else is wrong\\". If you are looking for a poorly written dialogue on the criticism of Doctors and criticism of the way medical school is run THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU! A great but semi-dated book on medical training is \\"The Intern Blues\\" check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you want to become a doctor?","review":"Konner does a good job balancing the intricate details of his third year in medical school with the broader meaning of medicine from his well-learned sociological and anthropological perspective in \\"Becoming a Doctor\\". He lets you in on the medical \\"culture\\" that arises from the intensive year of training--the language used by doctors and students (see the Glossary of House Officer Slang), the sleepless nights in the hospitals, the life and death decisions/actions that take place. I highly recommend this book to someone who is looking into a career in medicine. It provides insight into the different areas of medicine, including Emergency, Obstetrics, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Neurology, Surgery. But more importantly it probably provides a realistic peek into western medicine so that prospective students do not necessarily enter medical school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An autobiographical account of medical school","review":"This book was an excellent read. I am a pre-medical student, and Dr. Konner gave me a realistic view of the medical field and medical school.

I would recommend this book to any considering a career in medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Irritating","review":"I hate to say it, but this book just annoyed the heck out of me. I found Dr. Konner to be smug and arrogant, and was irritated by his repeated observations that it was his \\"mission\\" to write this book and let the world know what the medical profession was really like.I'll be the first to admit that medicine isn't perfect, but I don't consider it necessary to subject a reader to every detail of my medical training. This book was much too long, and in my opinion rather boring. If you want a book about the emotions and experiences of medical training, I have two recommendations. The first is Rotations, by Robert Marion. The second is the timeless classic House of God by Sam Shem."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable book on med school clerkships","review":"This is an especially good book for any non-traditional medical school prospects.

But unless you are familiar with the detail of 19th century geography for Austria, Prussia, France, and Denmark then much of the description is far from helpful.

Another winderful feature is this bag is right underneath you because it fits over your throne and makes all of your sticks and brushes immediately available.

The power switch does not have temperature control. The unit heating time is dependent on the amount of lather in the can. The positives? It still works after a year.

The book is written in a very emotional way. When I was reading it, I could feel all what the narrator was feeling. All the hate and the love and the jealousy and the despair are so human, and everyone can quickly identify with those emotions. The discussions about God and about time have generated a lot of thoughts in me. Besides the content, it is a very well-written book. It feels so true. I wonder if it is based on a true story.

This religious tract masquerading as a novel is one of the most implausibly plotted novels one is likely to find from this distinguished author.

Jordan's movie version makes some rather key changes (not for the better), while sticking eerily close at other times. The bottom line is the familiar one: the book is much better than the movie, especially in delivering the message Greene intended to convey. Faulkner described \\"End\\" once as the best novel in any language he'd ever read. (No doubt providing the impetus for innumerable doctoral theses in the meantime.) While I think \\"The Power & the Glory\\" is better, this is still a wonderful work, wrestling with the themes of love, faith, and religion as one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lament on god","review":"There is a phrase I very much like in The Razor's Edge, A character says: You are a religious man who does not believe in god. I think the character Bendix is such a figure. Crying out to believe, wanting to believe, but unable to believe. I suspect we have the closest vision of Graham Greene himself in this work. It is a lament on the inability to believe in god. It is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greene's Greatest?","review":"To start with, I am a Greene fanatic, so you might take my opinion with a grain of salt. I didn't read The End of the Affair for many years after I'd read virtually all of Greene's other novels. I love his thrillers, his adventures, his \\"serious\\" works. But I didn't think I'd love a book about an adulterous affair, particularly one with God and Catholicism at its center. I finally got around to it. How wrong, wrong, wrong I was.Having read it twice, I now have to ask whether it's Greene's best book. Every aspect of the book is unexpected: the reason their affair ends, why she leaves, who the man she's seeing is, Bendrix's response, all the way to the end where Bendrix befriends her husband.What in other hands would have been a simple morality play, is so much more thrilling. An absolute masterpiece, unlike anything else written by GG (or anyone else)."},{"rating":"1","title":"WELL WRITTEN...AND DEADLY DULL","review":"As well-written as The End of the Affair may be, to me it was a tedious, slow-moving slog.

The best part is that since the controllers run on RF, I can keep my Gamecube & the games behind locked doors on the entertainment center and my little boy can't mess with the console or scratch the discs. Also, the cord on the controller that came with my Gamecube is way too short to reach my favorite armchair. Being cordless, this is no longer a problem. Battery life has been great. I always have the rumble feature on and I think I am getting better mileage than the manufacturer even claims. My only complaint is that after a lot of use, one of the controllers seems to becoming very worn out. This is probably the case with any controller but I haven't used any other controller with my system so I can't make an objective comparison.Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend this controller to everyone that has a Gamecube."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for....","review":"I bought two of these and two Wavebirds at the same time.

We bought two at once so I could play with my son. Both of them are on the blink. The biggest issues is the joy stick controller. When new, the joy stick will produce movement in eight positions. One of them is down to producing movement in only 6 directions. No fun! They eat batteries. Maybe every 12 hrs of play. Somestimes, without warning, your character will start moving with the joystick in the neutral position. The only way to fix it is to take the batteries out. We have two units. Sometimes, one controler will move two characters. We are going to give wavebird a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The accuracy on this thing is horrible. I only use it when I really need to because its so bad. You can click one direction with the joystick and when you let off it will send your character back in the other direction.

After a little more use, you can't turn left at all, it just quits working. Keep in mind I bought two different controllers at different times, and they both had the same problem, and they lasted about the same amount of time. My recommendation, find a wired official controller, I've never had any problems with those kind of controllers.

I ended up disappointed.First off, the model you receive may or may not be the model that has rumble support, but probably will not be. Secondly, this particular controller has a serious problem staying calibrated. The control stick is defaulting slightly right, which causes massive problems with gameplay.

They feel pretty rugged though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Awful Product","review":"I bought three of these for my son a year ago for Christmas and now we are down to one. As others have indicated, the accuracy is horrible compared to other wireless controllers and two of my three didn't even last a week before the battery compartment doors started falling off. In the end, two of the three died because the plug came out of the back of the transmitter taking one of the wires with it. These controllers even feel cheap to the touch and are the least substantial of any controllers I have used. On the plus side, I have found the batteries last forever in these things.

The series just begins. There is no back- grounding. Who are these people and how did they wind up collectively bashing in doors? What is their organization (CSA doesn't tell us much) and what is its or their mission? The photography stinks: Somebody is addicted to hand held shooting. Most the time the screen is a jumble of unrecognizable scenes and sounds. This old Yankee may just have bad hearing but I've been to the UK many times and thought I knew its accents. So much of the dialogue is wasted on things like throats and walls (as opposed to microphones) that even my pretty, young wife (with perfect hearing) can't recognize what the characters sre saying to one another.

As a current military man, I honestly feel it's too disgraceful to present on my wall. Antiquing is one thing, but this, as others have mentioned, is just too over the top.Quality-wise, I will say that it is well made and of quality materials.

I half expected leprechauns to pop up on a toadstool somewhere, offering to lead people to pots of gold.Considering the very believable and skillfully planned books that Anne McCaffrey is capable of (the early Pern books for example) this one looks like it was thrown together out at $0.0x per word.

She might care to try reading her books and noticing the number of things that change from page to page. This is particularly infuriating, as it should not be so difficult to avoid. Unfortunately, she appears not to have made this one small effort.

The narrator is an appealing 13-year old boy by the name of Jeremy Proctor. And we have Sir John, who, though blind, does not miss much when dealing with crime and those who have committed it.

Fielding \\"sees through\\" the con of Jeremy's accusers. Fielding sets him free and sets out to find an apprenticeship in the printing trade, a trade taught to Jeremy by his deceased father. A Lord is murdered and John presses Jeremy into service to be his eyes and help him solve the crime. This is a wonderful plot full of twists turns and wonderful characters.

It arrived in a box that was totally used and abused (I thought it was the fault of UPS) until I used it. It leaks water long after drained and was apparently returned to the store that I bought it from because of this. I read reviews on it before ordering but wish I had known how difficult it is after washing since you have to rinse and wring separately.

Filling the tub with water was difficult because my kitchen and bathtub faucets were not high enough. It doesn't list a rinse cycle, but of course you're going to rinse clothes after having soapy water in the wash, so it's a lot of lifting if you have a bad back. Returning it is expensive. You just get the item cost minus a 10% \\"restocking fee\\". You still aren't reimbursed for the postage to you and have to pay the postage to return it. In some situations, it might be a good thing.

The box was bent and beat up. The item is completely made out of plastic and it should of been cushioned. This item that I ordered was a gift. I am bed bound, now I have to get someone to find a box for the item that I ordered. Get Organized needs to know how to organize packages for shipment. I will never ordered from this company again!

This little machine performs much better than I ever expected it to when first I bought it.Contrary to what I've read you can wash a pair of jeans in this or several T's and skivvies and the motor is plenty powerful enough to do the job.I fill it above the max fill line when necessary and throw a towel over the top to avoid spills. This was money well spent in my opinion, and when this one gives up the ghost I'll be replacing it with the same machine. One tip, put the clothes in first, then detergent then fill enough to float the laundry for it to work correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for apartment dwellers!","review":"I've used similar devices where you had to hand churn the washer. Therefore I was glad to see this automatic washer available when my old hand washer busted. I am using it to avoid the laundromat. Times are tight here and the laundromat will easily eat $40 a month! I take the bus which makes it inconvenient as well! So far I have washed quite a few loads and it has performed well. One pair of pants or two shirts at a time is the limit (instructions say 800 grams). I like that the wash tub is removable for easy filling/rinsing in the sink/bathtub. My analysis so far? Clothes are clean. The price is right (it will pay for itself in 2 months!) but because of its size- it is time consuming. Overall this is a great deal. If it works for 6 months, I'll come back and give it 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DIDN'T LAST LONG","review":"I liked the Wonder Washer but it lasted only 7 months. Very disappointed in this product. I would not recommend it to anyone. I noticed something wrong when it quit agitating after 6 minutes. Shortly after that, there was water all over the floor.

Had no problem the first three times I used it. But when I went to use it the fourth time, the motor unexpectedly wouldn't work. I never dropped it, got the motor wet, and stored it as described in the instructions. So not really sure what went wrong. Unfortunately, this happened just outside the window for return. :( Of course. So if you do get this product, I'd recommend using it as much as possible while you still have the chance to return it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Woo Hooo","review":"I received my wonder washer today, and within 30 minutes, I had two loads of laundry done! Woo Hoo!!!I used cold water, reused the soapy water, which saves the soap, money and the processing time.I have yet to master rinsing and wringing, but I am already psyched out: I can wash whenever I want, I don't have to have annoying quarters for the communal washer and dryer at the apartment complex...Product is not great looking , true, but for the price and convenience - I give it my five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shake, rattle and roll","review":"I thought this would be a great machine to have for delicates and small items. But I wish I had saved my money. The Wonder Washer shakes A LOT. It spills water and has nearly toppled over several times. I have to monitor it until it's done to make sure that it A) doesn't tip and B) doesn't leak water to the base where the electronic part is located. It's way more work than it's worth. It's very loud and does NOT do a decent job of washing clothes. I have to wash things 2 and 3 times before they're clean! My advice is to save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful actually","review":"Pretty much the hand crank type of home washing does a much better job. It needs too much water for the amount of clothes you can actually wash in it. the unit I have gets hung up frequently while washing 6 pair of socks or 2 t-shirts. (I have even watched it hang up with the wash bucket removed from the base.) So I have to monitor it. Not very convenient if you ask me. Construction quality is not very good either. I have used it 12 times so far, read the instructions twice to make sure I did not miss something. I have an expensive bucket currently. The hand crank washer I have does a much better job. ONE NOTE: do not expect it to have a extraction cycle, this is a bucket with a agitator."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL !","review":"I was watching this item for some time and taking a look at the reviews. Most were positive. So I finally decided to purchase a Wonder Washer. it does have a small load capacity, but it is a Vicious little machine. It really gets a lot of turbulence and agitation going to clean the clothing items. I cleaned three dress shirts in 3 minutes. You have an option to extend the timer, but 3 minutes did it for me, and I was ready for another load. And the results are impressive. CLEAN. it put my hand washing technique to shame. Laundromats are a bore, so having this machine in house is a pleasant addition. It almost seems like I look forward to doing my next wash. I am impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I owned this machine before and it functioned very well, later I gave it to my friend.

No warning, nothing. I never used it for anything other than lingerie and light weight tops and skirts, usually once a week and for about nine minutes only. I just used it last week and it worked fine, the same loud motor, the agitation causing it to appear that it would tip over any minute, as usual. All that works now is the timer. It always did sound like it was not very well made and I would never recommend this thing to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will tear your clothes apart","review":"I purchased this a few years ago & threw it out just a couple of months after buying it. It worked as promised & I really thought I'd save on trips to the laundry room and money, but after a while I noticed that it's really tough on clothes.The mechanism works by spinning an agitator left & then right. The \\"gentle\\" cycle spins it for a briefer period of time in each direction, but with no less force.This constant forceful twisting back & forth twists your clothes up in knots. Sleeves get tangled up, any loose threads get pulled off & twisted around your garment. Even putting things in a delicates bag didn't help - the delicates bag got twisted up along with the clothes inside it.I wouldn't recommend this for anyone - my clothes came out far too damaged in this thing - any money savings that I may get from not visiting the laundry room would be canceled out from constantly having to buy clothes again.I really wanted to like this item, but it's just not usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse with time","review":"I have had this product for about 6 months and am writing a second review now. At first, I didn't understand the negative reviews, but now I do. My wonder washer has gotten significantly louder and less stable in the time I've owned it. It used to make a low hum and stay put while the wash cycle was going. Now, it makes an extremely loud sound (I can hear it clearly through a closed door, even with music blasting to cover the noise) and walks all over the floor. I'm concerned that continued use will be unsafe.This is not build to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a \\"wonder\\" why we bothered to buy it!!!","review":"I bought this machine to use for baby clothes when I gave birth 7 months ago.

I used to go to the Laudromat once a week, now, it's about every other week, for the bigger stuff, which has cut my laurdry bill in half. The machine is great for undergarments and socks, but, I have also found that you can put 2 light weight shirts or tank tops or 2 pair of shorts (no jeans) and it washes them GREAT!! I do one load with soapy water for the 15 min. cycle, then I empty the water and refill with just water (no soap) and run the machine for about 6 minutes, as a \\"rinse\\" cycle...it has seem to help with wringing out the clothes, not as much soap in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving us a bundle","review":"This product works as intended.

Frenchmen in bark canoes with skate blades on the keel racing down a frozen river.

The video production is wonderful - very crisp and colorful on screen. The audio is top notch as well, and it's great to see a live performance throughout the concert. This is an artist that truly describes the word. She captivates the audience (and the viewer if I may say so) to sing along with and dance with her every move.

The interface on the camera is so simple...I didn't even have to open the directions. The battery life could be longer but that's what you're sacrificing with the size.

I tried to use it to use it to take pictures of my nephew but I have to predict when he is going to do something cute a second before he does it or else I'll miss it. I know I can lock the focus by pushing in the button a little then depressing it all the way when I want the actual shot, but then that means I or my nephew can't move or else the picture will come out blurry.

Just something to throw in my pocket for \\"everyday events\\" that I want to capture.PROS:1) The size is the biggest - it will fit anywhere.2) Batteries - It takes two AAA (It came with rechargable ones) but in a bind you can get AAA's anywhere.3) All the features are there (red-eye reduction, index for taken pics, picture effects, etc....)CONS:1) There is no zoom - if this is going to be your \\"first\\" digital camera I would consider the somewhat larger but optically more advanced Sony's.2) 2 Megapixels - This is actually good and bad. 2 Megapixs is at the border of a \\"good\\" picture (IMHO). On a monitor, they look fine and they can be cropped slightly; but printing large pics or magging up too much gives a pixelly result.

I think I have learned more about Nordic Walking technique just from watching the various free videos on [...].I was hoping for something more thorough, that really delved into the finer points of technique. This video often just glosses over techniques that need more exposition.Also it's a bit silly that the first quarter of the video looks like an infomercial for Nordic Walking. There is really no reason to sell people on Nordic Walking if they were interested enough to buy the video.Bottom line, I don't think the video is worth the money. But if you can't find anything else, it's certainly a decent intro to the sport."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unresponsive seller","review":"I would not recommend ordering this DVD from nordicwalkingpro.

This DVD is just perfect for that. Nordic Walking Pros Bernd Zimmermann and Gottfried Kuermer give excellent instructions on proper technique, stretches and exercises as well as tips on equipment. There is lots of information for beginners like me, but also for advanced Nordic Walkers. I have been exercising regularly and am so impressed with the results. I haven't been that fit and in a better shape in a long time and i feel energized for the rest of the day after my workout! Well done, great job!

It worked perfectly for the first few weeks. It is so much quieter than the cymbals that come with the Ion controller, but after a few weeks the cymbal quit working. I took the trigger mechanism apart and found a wire had come off the sensor. I soldered the wire back on and it worked for two more days, then another solder point came off. After redoing ALL solder points I'm going to try using it some more. On the other hand I also bought the Ion Cymbal for IED01 and IED04. It is a little more expensive, but you get what you pay for. I also picked up the 14 inch pintech and it came to me warped. I know it is only a trigger cymbal, but the plastic is so warped it doesn't even come close to looking right. If you want a cheap trigger cymbal then pass this one up and go a little more expensive and get the Ion Cymbal."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book!!","review":"Lynn Abbey does a very remarkable job of bringing us behind the scenes of being a sorcer-king.

I also gotta admit I really like the names Lynn came up with such as Gallard Bane of Gnomes, Ogre-Naught, Myron Troll-Scorcher, etc. Unfortunately it seems WoTC has ended Dark Sun.

It's rare to read a book that looks so closely into the Southern female mind with such humor and achingly real bittersweetness.

I agree with the Connecticut writer who described the book as dreck. And I do think the errors are important; they make me wonder why the publisher was in such a hurry to get this book on the shelves that a little time and money could not have been spent for good copy editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sullivan's Island","review":"Recently, a friend presented me a copy of \\"Sullivan's\\" to read. It is not the genre I would normally choose to read, nevertheless, I decided to read the novel based on the positive reaction by the supplier. The book has a strong multidimensional character in the protagonist, Susan, who helps the reader remember that laughter and humor are the recipe to surving joyless times especially when dealing with family, love and despondency. The book is better than a mere beach book because of Frank's quality of writing. It is a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small","review":"Small would be the correct word to describe the reader who said the \\"small errors\\" in the book lessened her enjoyment.

The characters were not likable, there were too many cliches, the transitions between past and present were silly, the whole \\"geechee girl\\" thing was annoying rather than funny, there was not enough explanation of the Gullah language or culture, some characters were mentioned but not developed at all, etc. We had a fun book club meeting laughing at how bad the book was and wondering how it made it to a bestsellers list. Someone said \\"Plantation\\" was even worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"Sullivan's Island is a very well written and enjoyable story, which connects the main character's past family life with the woman she's become today. The characters are believable, and easy to identify with. I fell in love with Livvie, and her philosophies of life were endearing and rang true. I remember that Friday in November when President Kennedy was assasinated and I felt the same sense of hopelessness and sadness that was portrayed by everyone in the family.The description of Sullivan's Island was enchanting and makes me want to travel there to see it for myself. I highly recommend this book and enjoyed it immensly."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Anne Rivers Siddons","review":"I have had a whale of a time swallowing this book. I can't believe that the character, Susan, would be so nonchalant about her husband of 14 years leaving her for another woman, coming back to sleep with her one night, then going back to his girlfriend, and through it all she remains totally unemotional. Where are her deep feelings about a failed marriage even if she didn't REALLY love him? And puleeze! Enough novels where the character has a perfect, beautiful, loving, teen aged daughter who doesn't mind spending time with her mother and never gets acne or moodswings? Totally unrealistic.

I read it slowly because I hated to see it end. This book had a perfect mix between past and present. How things in our childhood affect our lives. Hard to catogorize in just one way. It's not so much a romance, as it is a story of survival. The heroine in the story has a wonderful sense of humor. You will fall in love with the locale as well. I have never read a story like it and would recommend it to anyone. You will laugh, cry and and feel better about life in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars are not enough!

I want more from this very talented author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing :(","review":"Having read and enjoyed one of Frank's books last summer (Shem Creek), I thought I'd give this one a try. I'm a classics and sci-fi sort of gal most of the time, but once in a blue moon I like to pick up some mindless eye-candy. You know: one of those fun novels that is terribly predictable, with a low-readability level but high-interest. Anyway, I liked the first novel I mentioned, but this one was a huge disappointment. The characters are not imaginative and the plot is just weird. There's really nothing about the heroine to like as she's a crappy mom, a needy sibling, and incredibly weak as an adult. I kept waiting for inner strength to crop up or kick in, but it never did. After the painful description of her hookup with a man she barely knew, I just abandoned the book and deleted it from my kindle. I decided to read F. Scott Fitzgerald instead; now there's a writer who knew how to put together a plot with tragic yet engaging characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a talented woman!","review":"What a joy to pick up a novel with such a wonderful story!

I read Isle of Palms (2 1/2-3 stars)so I was not expecting to love this work by Ms. Frank so much. The flow of her voice is gripping. There were times I wanted to take a break but found I could not put this book down. The tales of the Hamilton family in 1963 and 1999-2000 were enthralling. I feel Ms. Frank handled the good and bad times of the 1960s very well; with great respect and honor for all those involved. The intensity of family was a wonder to behold. I also found it interesting how Ms. Frank told the story of the entire Hamilton family but yet was able to decide which family's members to keep a mystery (yet fully a part of the story). I do not usually \\"jump ahead\\" in my readings but this story was so gripping I found myself inpatient to find out what becomes of the family at certain times of their lives. Thank you Ms. Frank for introducing to us and sharing the Hamilton family with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful moving story","review":"My neighbor gave this book to take along to the beach. She insisted that I would love it and that it was a great beach read. Well, she was right. Sullivan's Island was a wonderful, moving story. There were bits of humorous moments that kept the story on a lighter tone. Sometimes I couldn't help but laugh out loud and at times I wanted to cry. The characters were seemed real to me and they were people that I could relate to. This book was consistently interesting, and it was hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, not a cliche","review":"Sullivan's Island was my first Dorothea Benton Frank novel, but I'll be reading others. It's easy reading, humorous in parts, sad in others, filled with local color [set around Charleston and Sullivan's Island, South Carolina].Frank takes the somewhat cliched story of a woman done wrong by her lawyer husband and deftly turns it into a self-deprecating memoir. Susan Hayes is an interesting character. In the year after her marriage breaks up - she does the usual womanly things - losing weight, getting a new hairstyle, going on the funniest awful date of all time - but she also delves into her own past on Sullivan's Island - faces her own demons - and emerges strong and confident. Not a cliche at all, but an interesting journey.I liked Susan and I like what Frank has to say about the human spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Reading Experience","review":"Sullivan's Island is one of the best books I have ever read.

I also read \\"Plantation\\", her second book, and am anxiously awaiting her third, to be named \\"Isle of Palms\\", which I understand will be published in the Spring of 2003. --- PS: Where are the movies????

Many characters were introduced, but were so sketchy that they remained simply names. Even the main character is someone that we learn little about. While the changes in story plot from 1963 to 1999 is interesting, we never have a chance to examine what happened to Susan in the interim. And then, what happened to her to change her from an overweight, stupid [but possessing two master's degrees -in what we never knew], easily manipulated slob into a slim, organized, wise, rich beauty. At the end, I simply wondered what happened?

It would break up and look TERRIBLE and that was the Hi-Def! The standard def left motion trails and that was from a progressive scan dvd! Great on paper but doesn't deliver the goods. I returned (b.s.-ed that it was broke to avoid a \\"restocking fee\\") and got me the 61 inch samsung hl-s6187. Now that's a frickin performer. Not as much in the way of connectivity but the picture is amazing (as good as CRT but way smaller package). So buyer beware on this one. Oh and the contrast ratio on this Mits is atrocious!

I've tried the unplug overnight trick and the reset button trick. I called for service three days ago, talked to a machine, no return call. I called again today, Tuesday, talked to a machine. Four hours later, still waiting for a return call. I agree with the post suggesting a class action suit. Is there a lemon law for TVs? By the way, I also called Mitsubishi customer service.

I decided not to purchase the movie because if I watch anything I want it to be factual.

My best friend, sister and I adored this movie. The depiction of the women in Sleepless in Seattle was us. We could recite the dialog word for word (and still can) and we debated the pronunciation of Deborah Kerr's last name (is it car or is it ker). When we saw these scenes in the movie, we knew that Norah Efron knew exactly how we felt. My husband also enjoyed the film, because he saw that my fascination with An Affair To Remember was not all that unusal. My recommendation is a double bill for a Ladies Night At the Movies: 1st An Affair To Remember, followed by Sleepless In Seattle.

However I absolutely loved this movie and it touched me like no other! Meg Ryan was perfectly cast for the role and Tom and Meg are the best portrayed on screen couple ever! Romantic comedies have been my favourite film genre ever since and Meg Ryan has been my all time favourite actress ever since! I definitely recommend this movie to all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seattle looks GREAT here!","review":"I live in Seattle, and this movie was a great change from seeing all of the bad publicity that Seattle has gotten lately. I am a fan of all the Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan \\"pair\\" movies...\\"Joe Versus the Volcano,\\" \\"Sleepless In Seattle,\\" and \\"You've Got Mail.\\" This movie was witty, funny, and cute. Throughout the whole movie, when they showed Seattle, my dad was like \\"that's by my office\\" and \\"I went there!\\" Tom and Meg are a great team and I really hope that they make more movies together. They create a chemistry that cannot be matched! See this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Es una película muy hermosa","review":"Creo que esta es una de las muy buenas películas románticas que he podido ver.

Es una obra muy interesante y la música de la película es maravillosa. Gran actuación de Tom Hanks y Meg Ryan, realmente transmiten sus sentimientos al público."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant film","review":"This movie seems to be a chick flick classic, while pleasant and occasionally funny for guys Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan work nicely together and Hanks's son adds nicely to the mix. The scene in which a sentimental Hanks tells the radio host about his departed wife's virtues aim straight at the female heart and is no doubt effective with a lot of viewers. I found it just a little too schmaltzy for my tastes. Still, \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" is a pleasant film which seems to enjoy a large audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I loved this movie.

Unfortunately, I discovered that this edition is missing at least one significant (and in my opinion, very funny) scene: The part where Annie, having received a phone call from her friend Becky telling her that Sleepless in Seattle was on the radio again, ends up hiding in the broom closet so that she can listen without Walter finding out. I have no idea why it was cut from the DVD edition, and wish I had known before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better get the older version","review":"Comparing tyhis edition, to the older one, I see very little difference, other than a gift certificate: They pretty much just changed the box design. If you know you will be spending $10 at Starbucks within a few months of this DVD's release, then perhaps you might want to buy it; otherwise, it is far cheaper to get the \\"collector's edition\\", which has all of the same big features as this one. You can find it pretty cheaply on Amazon still, and it is pretty common to find it in the low-priced selections of a lot of other stores as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"Anyone who does not find this movie absoulutely wonderful should be ashamed of themselves.I think that this movie is the most romantic movie that I have ever seen.There is just something so romantic about people yearning for someone that they have never even met and they know that they are made for each other.I just can't say how much I love this movie! It's also really funny(Rosie O'Donell is hysterical)and it has the best ending to a movie I have ever seen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very superficial and unconvincing","review":"This heavy-handed, unfunny comedy-drama was meant as nothing more than a tailor-made star vehicle for Hanks and Ryan. It's uneven, predictable, and bland. O'Donnell has a few good moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bearable but that's it","review":"I rented it because I loved when Harry Met Sally, and I thought that the talent might spill over into this movie. Instead, this was a silly, predictable story. Really, is a child who lost his mother a year ago going to try to find his father a replacement? isn't the kid grieving too? He sure doesn't seem that way. What nonsense.This is a good movie to skip. Rent it only if you want soothing background noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Tom Hanks never disappoints. I love him paired with Meg Ryan as well. It's not as great as \\"You've got mail,\\" but it is still a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Harry & Sally were sleepless","review":"This movie disappointed me a lot. It's like Ephron tried to make something as good as her earlier 'When Harry met Sally', but unfortunately this movie never reaches it to that level. Partly I believe, this is due to weak acting of Meg Ryan who just can't seem to build up the chemistry as there were between her and Billy Crystal in the above mentioned film. What I did like, was the character of Jonah. Tom Hanks is a great actor, and in this movie the interaction between him and the but small Ross Malinger (Jonah) is great. This definitely carries this movie to an acceptable standard. Maybe if I hadn't seen Ephron's When Harry met Sally, which was, I emphasize, much better, I would've given it some higher, but alas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora Ephron Didn't Write This Movie","review":"One of the reasons this film towers above Nora Ephron's other efforts is that the story and original screenplay were written by Jeff Arch. Ms. Ephron's contribution to the script consisted of tinkering around the edges, and a few food and sex jokes. I only point this out because Nora Ephron has a habit of taking credit for things she did not do. If you want pure Ephron, see the abominable \\"Hanging Up.\\" As for this film, thank Jeff Arch with an assist from David S.

Don't get me wrong even though I'm a guy I like romantic movies but this is to romantic movies what Kenny G is to good jazz. They roll out every cliche in the book and then some. But then of course we at least have the subtle nuanced acting of Tom Hanks, unfortunately he doesn't come up to the high standard he set in Bosom Buddies. Oh for the days when TV actors couldn't make it in Hollywood and when scripts were written by writers rather than focus groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S ALL A WELL TRAMPLED CLICHE NOW.","review":"I know everyone else in the world loves this movie. It is sacred to some people, and they would really rather that people leave it alone and never criticize it. I know that it is world-famous because everytime I tell someone I am originally from Seattle, no matter where in the world they are from... from New Zealand to Bulgaria to South Africa to Chile, they always make a comment (which they think is exceedingly cute) about \\"Are you sleepless?\\" Is it any wonder I moved to Iceland. (Now I just get asked, \\"Is it cold?\\") Meg Ryan is too cutesy. Tom Hanks is just too... Tom Hanks like. Clever idea, and it would be better if they had left this film to stand alone, but reteaming Ryan and Hanks for You've Got Mail actually kind of cheapens this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Romantic love is a wonderful gift of God, but without a solid moral foundation that includes chastity, honesty, respect for parents, etc. it becomes misleading and dangerous. There are some fine tunes and entertaining moments in this film, and it is well made. But if I had known what was in it I would not have bought the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, witty and full of surprises!","review":"This film hails as one of the best I've seen in years. The acting between Hanks and Ryan is rated a 10. Even though its just a movie, I came away thinking what if... Watching this film always puts a smile on my face. I guess in my heart of hearts, I'll always be a hopeful romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanks and Ryan together again","review":"Sleepless in Seattle is a great movie on many levels. It is basically parody on \\"Love Story\\" with a few changes. Naturally if you notice the cast you already have half of the formula figured out. But the beauty in this movie is in the details.A recent widower Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks) and his son (Ross Malinger) moves across the country to Seattle to get away from old memories. His kid tells the father's story on a Christmas talk radio show and says that his dad needs a new wife. You hear heartstrings of women listeners twanging and more than a few closes in for the kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Soundtrack--They Don't Make 'Em Like They Used To","review":"This is a great movie; the reviewer from the New York Times above obviously watched a different movie than most of America. Anyway, one of the absolute best things about this movie is the soundtrack. You have Harry Connick, Jr. and Jimmy Durante, among several others, singing those timeless songs they just don't sing anymore.I'm a romantic big time, and there's just something about a love story with Nat King Cole singing \\"Stardust\\" at just the right moment to make a big marshmallow out of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimentality gone wild","review":"Calling this film a \\"Chick flick\\" is an insult to chicks everywhere. I hated its cheap sentimentality, shallow plot and characters, and the very offensive idea that because Tom Hanks' first wife died, it made him available for his \\"true love,\\" Meg Ryan's character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey it is in my backyard","review":"I got the movie because I live right above \\"The\\" house boat.

I think this movie really lacks excitement there are so many slow points in the movie it makes me dopey and very sleepy. I really don't get the main picture here of a must see I mean you have to give it credit though of making sense its not the story that is pointless its the way it's told the movie lacks excitement and thats very important in movies it was o.k but it sure is not one of the best movies that I have ever seen.

And that there are forces at work trying to get us together with the right person? Well, that's exactly what I believe, and I'm so glad Nora Ephron makes films that help our faith along, just like the books by Johanna Spyri (\\"Heidi\\") or Lucy M. Montgomery (\\"Anne of Green Gables\\"). Why don't we finally begin listening to the voices in our hearts instead of smothering them in all the turbulence the world offers us today?This film is refreshing, heart-warming and wonderful. I can recommend it to anyone that needs rejuvenation. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are both wonderful actors, and I have immensely enjoyed the films I have seen with them. This one is no exception. Applause also for Ross Malinger and Gaby Hoffmann for their roles as Jonah and Jessica. If you enjoy romantic comedies, this one shouldn't be missing from your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"good film","review":"i really enjoyed this film.i felt the Chemistry of Meg Ryan&Tom Hanks.i didn't know if Meg Ryan could be in a romantic movie and pull off the Chemistry that she did with Billy Crystal in when Harry met Sally.but she did with Tom Hanks.it's a cool Laid-back film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I love it I love it I love it!

The son (Jonah) phones in a radio psychiatrist and then puts his father on the line. Women all over the country fall in love with him. The movie is particularly about one of these women named Annie, played by Meg Ryan.After Annie's friend sends a letter for her (unknowingly), she receives a reply and believes that Sam is the man for her. Following a failed trip to Seattle, Annie soon decides her and Sam were never meant to be. Jonah, Sam's son, then sends a letter to Annie to arrange a meeting time and place.I found this movie to be an excellent romantic comedy. The acting is great and I have no major complaints with the movie. My minor complaint is that it seems to be a little slow moving at times. Although the story is incredibly coincidental, it is still a great movie.

It's a perfect romantic drama/comedy that is charmingly old-fashioned.The movie An Affair to Remember (by Cary Grant) was an important reference to the movie that helped staged for the grand finale. Tom Hanks and especially Meg Ryan were great and both of them captured the loneliness of their characters.I like that two leads spent the entire movie (except a short one on the street) separated. Because I think the big finale wouldn't be as effective if they were actually been together more than the film did. I love the ending! It's romantic, it's quiet, it's cute, it's effortless, it's elegant, and it's magical.

I liked \\"1000 places to see before you die\\" as it did decent job in describing places worth visiting in all countries and continents. This book is a very weak copycat.It seems that the criteria for choosing \\"natural wonders\\" was their proximity to US and south US in particularly and/or availability of the pictures. For instance, the book has tons of places in Texas, Arizona, etc. Not that these places are not nice, but the book completely ignores Moorea in Pacific, New Zealand has only marginal coverage and there are only couple of places in the whole India worth mentioning.The book does have nice pictures, so it would qualify as a coffee table book for people who do not travel further than nearest McDonald yet like to dream or talk about faraway places. But do not take it as a guide for places you must see before you die: you will miss much of the world then!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1001 Natural Wonders : You must see before you die","review":"We found the facinating, with places we never knew existed.
