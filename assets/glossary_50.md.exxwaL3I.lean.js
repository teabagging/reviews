I have practiced yoga off and on for 30 years and thought I would start my daughter off with a well reviewed program. I have practiced Hatha, Iyengar, power and hot yoga.......this Kundalini is a total yawn. It is basically a breathing yoga and not physical at all. I would not recommend this for someone who is anything more than sedentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading!","review":"I'd only taken a few yoga classes and wanted a DVD that would provide the basics for me to do at home. This DVD is comprised of a very specific type of yoga that includes none of the basics I've ever seen. It's very strange and includes panting and some really odd movements. Did not like at all! A friend tried it with me and we couldn't get all the way through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"kundalini yoga","review":"the cd needs to be slower if it is meant for beginners . demonstrations should be slow enough the viewer can truly follow"},{"rating":"2","title":"I give it 10 stars and Beyond!","review":"Everyone making a beginner yoga DVD should take a look at this one. The big mistake most producers make is dumbing things down too much. Making the workout so frigging slow! It is hard enough to try something new without having to battle boredom (they should market them as PM workouts since the put you right to sleep!)Thank God for Ravi & Anas productions. After a short brilliant breath primer, they get right into the workout. The music is great, the moves are fun. Bam! Before you know it you have had your yoga workout and can now officially call yourself a yogi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this","review":"The DVD was great.

I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Boring Video I've Ever Done","review":"After reading the reviews for this DVD, I was so excited when I got it. I popped it in the DVD player and prepared myself for a good yoga session. I have never been more disappointed. This has to be the most boring yoga video on the face of the planet. If you want to practice breathing and just moving your spine then this video is perfect for you. But if you want to actually do yoga, I'd suggest buying a different video."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I had high expectations of this dvd but was utterly disapointed.

Great for beginners, also for intermediate practitioners."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Easiest Yoga Workout Ever!","review":"Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond is of all the yoga DVDs I've seen the easiest to do. Most of the entire hour is done sitting or laying down and the moves are very easy and beginner friendly. The first time I used the DVD I went almost the full hour before tiring and afterwards felt amazingly better! You'd be surprised how much even the simplest yoga movements help you a lot.

I enjoy every second of it! I practice with this tape 4-5 times a week.I mostly do Ravi & Ana workouts. They are kind of pilates-like with some aerobic aspects as well. This is a very interesting type of yoga which I find very powerful.This yoga has benefited me in so many ways - my body feels more flexible and \\"lighter.\\" My moods have improved and I am definitely calmer.Yoga has been the best thing that's happened to me recently. I have read a lot about yoga philosophy. I have experimented with many different schools of yoga. I seem to have a special affinity towards this approach. Practicing Beginners and Beyond on a daily basis keeps me feeling vital in ways nothing else comes near. Definitely adding Ravi & Ana workouts have made a huge difference in my life. Awesome stuff!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More meditative than expected...","review":"I take the blame here for not spending hours of research on my next exercise DVD, but I wanted to share my experience anyhow, in case someone else is doing their research. This DVD is highly meditative in nature, and while I don't discount it's benefits, i was looking for something different. One of my favorite DVDs is Ellen Barrett's Superslim down Yoga/Pilates blend, and I was hoping for something similar. I wanted something less \\"Denise Austin\\", and I saw these rave reviews, so I went with it. But it is the other end of the spectrum- too slow and quiet for me. Ellen is the perfect blend- in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure didn't rock my Kundalini","review":"My review has been erased from this site numerous times. But after reading some other negative reviews, I am posting this again (now for the fifth time - Amazon fails to catch the perpetrator) to share my experience.I did not like this yoga video from Ana and Ravi in the slightest. The tape shows a sequence of back bending poses which are repeated in rapid succession. Yes, there are pauses in between the exercises, but the movements shown are so rapid and jerky that my back hurt after doing these moves. I had not done Kundalini yoga before, so perhaps that was the cause, but I would warn beginners to be careful while doing these poses. I do not think this is a beginner tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"I had wanted to try yoga for a while but feared it was too jazzed and hippied out for me to try... this DVD only furthers that belief. I thought it was a bad joke, with the horrible \\"Indian\\" music and cheesy voiceovers- and then the girl on the DVD starts gyrating in itty bitty bikini shorts and I realized that this DVD probably should be sold in the adult section.I'll try a class instead, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your typical yoga video","review":"I felt compelled to write a review because I wish so much I'd read the one-star reviews. This is simply in no way what I wanted in a yoga video. I was picturing some core work, some downward-dog, etc. This is a strange, new-agey video of breathing exercises and odd body movements. This is not a workout.It may be good for stress relief, meditation, etc, but is clearly intended for \\"Kundalini\\" followers, not your average gal who just wants to tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The world has changed","review":"Back in 2004 I attended a workshop in Portland with Ravi Singh and Ana Brett. I had three of his DVD's, one was called \\"The Best Kundalini practices\\" and had his previous wife on the DVD, since then Ravi has published a handful of DVD's with his current wife Ana Brett. It was a fabulous workshop with lots of people and energy. I think he was just starting his career in the limelight and now he's hit it big! I will look forward to trying his DVD. My sister and I have done a bit of Bikram yoga and always laugh about practicing in bra & panties. Ana is a beautiful woman and she used to practice in skimpy clothes to help with marketing their product, it looks like it has worked ;O) congrads to them for bring their DVD's and yoga instruction to hundreds of people! Namaste' to all you yogis in the western world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not for me - used it once and didn't like it","review":"Too much quick breathing and focus on small stomach movements.

What's great is that you get to pick the components of your workout before you start. I'm still not brave enough to try the Five Tibetans, but I am doing great with all the other parts of the DVD. And the price can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend this DVD","review":"[...] I'll summarize this DVD a little more succinctly this time. This DVD makes outrageous and unsupportable claims about the benefits of the exercises, which appear borderline dangerous to me.[...]Secondly, the exercises involve a lot of violent head whipping and body twisting. The exercises made me feel more like I was going to injure myself than get in shape.In summary, this video is a weird (very weird) montage of violent and bizarre exercises.

I am not at all flexible and this dvd makes it easy for someone with no flexibility to follow along and do the moves.. you definitely feel it in your muscles! I also like how it is seperated by 2 parts, so you can do either one if you are pressed for time. I also own Dance the Chakras and Fat Free Yoga which are good but i think i like this one the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"This DVD is a must have for anyone interested in beginning Kundalini yoga. The moves flow into each other easily and you can go at your own pace.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Power-Up!","review":"Wonderful DVD. Loved the music (great beat... unlike sleepy Gaiam music), photography, narration, and meditation. Transformational. This my first experience with Kundalini and I'm very impressed with the engery I felt after my first session. I'm so glad to have found the 5 Tibetans workout here... I've heard that it has kept monks healthy and flexible into old age for centuries. This is the best Yoga DVD I own (and I have an extensive 15+ library). I feel good about my practice. You will not regret this purchase... you might just get hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"Great workout, great instruction, great music....I love it!PS: I wrote the same about Kundalini Yoga \\"Navel power\\" and it is true. I love them both and I would say that this one I like even more!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward and boring","review":"Given the enthusiasm of many of the positive reviews, I was initially very excited about this DVD. However, the product did not live up to my expectations. The production quality appears poor - lighting, sound, music, etc... The movements are awkward and so repetitious to the point of boredom. I tried this video solo and with some friends whom I work out with. I thought if I tried it in a group setting that I might find it more enjoyable. None of us liked it, and we didn't even complete the DVD. It was a big disappointment, and I haven't touched it since. Overall it seemed very strange, and I'm really perplexed that so many people think it's \\"great.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Beginners (and Beyond)!!!!!","review":"I have studied many traditions of yoga. I have taught mainly Kripalu for 12 years and am working on a certification in Kundalini Yoga. I like the way this yoga, especially taught by Ravi & Ana, is accesible to everyone. Anyone can begin. As they like to say...If you can breathe you can do it.This Beginners & Beyond DVD is a very intelligently thought out yoga DVD for beginners to advanced beginners.Their instructions are so insightful and explicit. I find it quite valuable in helping me plan out my beginner Kundalini classes. I have started teaching some of the things in this DVD to my regular classes and they are asking for more! Ana & Ravi have done an outstanding job. Their collaboration is very beautiful. I plan on recommending this one to all of my students.I also highly recommend their Fat Free Yoga which is also suitable for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended particularly for beginners","review":"This is a wonderful DVD for beginners to start with and progress at a comfortable pace. The most challenging on this DVD was a camel pose and beginners would have to do a modified version (which is briefly demonstrated). After practically each active exercise there is a few minute long meditation break, which allows even to beginner enough time to rest and continue at a comfortable pace until the end of DVD. I was delighted that this DVD contains Tibetan Rite exercises. I have started doing them some 10 - 15 years ago from a book, but have now found it's even more fun going over the Tibetan rites with the DVD. And I was also thrilled that the active exercises include the locks which further help to prevent the leakage of energy and to move the energy up the spine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not for beginners","review":"There is so much wrong with this video that it would take paragraphs to describe. Just know this: I heard not one word about proper breathing while doing the movements. For me, yoga is most beneficial when done in concert with proper breathing, and I don't think I'm alone in that.. And no beginner should attempt a number of these movements. There's nothing technically wrong with the instructions in this DVD --- they're just not for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"I was a bit skeptical when I first tried this DVD. However, after the first time through, I fell in love! I am a beginner in yoga and I just love everything about this DVD!

It's a simple game, where you feed the kitty, play a game with the kitty (move a toy mouse around and the kitty tries to catch it - if the kitty fails to catch it, you get money), buy things for your kitty like food, water, and accessories like collars. It's an easy game. You pick the breed of your kitty, the gender, and you type a name for your kitty. It's not attention-grabbing, like some other games. You'd have more fun with Dogz 5 for the computer, or Nintendogs for DS, if you're older than 7. They are attention-grabbing, and they have more activities for you to do. Or, even try Puppy Luv: A New Breed - I like that one better, and it has more activities for you.

I have tried this on three systems with no luck. On the HP 7955, it just locks up - no mouse to control it. On the other two systems, we could not change locations (as reported by others) and could only do two of the activities.

It checks for two specific families of video card - which mostly are for desktop computers.MORE COMPLEX RULE: If you know how to check your video card, you need to meet all the requirements listed on box (Windows, Memory, etc).

The book is helpful for those who need an introduction to changes in the industry. This book does not shed any new light on current issues facing the industry. One has to question the credibilitly of any market professional that tells you that this book is excellent or insightful; either they are being deceitful (not to surprising when you consider the source!!!) or they shouldn't be in the financial industry because they obviously haven't been paying attention. I suppose the glowing reviews were more disappointing to me than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My reason for purchasing this book was because a number of experienced and well-known markets participants gave great reviews for Stock Market Jungle.

Louise DeSalvo has pieced together this first manuscript to offer the public a glimpse into the early creative mind of Woolf. Following the same basic plot as \\"The Voyage Out\\" (a young woman's journey to sexual and emotional awakening), \\"Melymbrosia\\" is much more frank in its portrayal of politics and sexuality (including homosexuality). Another difference is the raw and unpolished feel that this early draft contains. DeSalvo chose to retain some of Woolf's errors in this version, and while this doesn't necessarily detract from the story, it does make the reader wonder about their inclusion. \\"Melymbrosia\\" is a fascinating and powerful look into Virginia Woolf's early writing and life that conveys the passions she felt for all aspects of life, which she felt she needed to mute to some degrees in order to gain acceptance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Addition","review":"This is an excellent addition to one's Woolf collection. I'm not certain if I would read it before reading her published works, but certainly afterwards, as it will add a lot of dimensions and insight to what you already know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REALLY GREAT CD!","review":"A LOT OF THIS CD DEALS WITH HARD TIMES IN LIFE, AND BY LISTENING TO THESE SONGS, YOU'LL SEE THAT YOU CAN RELATE TO MOST OF EM.

This is one of those few albums where I dont have to skip past songs. The numbers are well performed. Really, this highlight version is great if you dont want to sit through the concert version. The high points of this CD are \\"Your'e Gonna Love Tomorrow\\" \\"Ah, Paris\\" and \\"Broadway Baby\\" and \\"Who's that Woman\\". The lyrics have slang words such as \\"Chucklehead\\"or \\"Scanties\\" that fit the characters perfectly.The only thing I like better on the concert version is Carol Burnetts rendition of \\"I'm Still Here\\". Still, all in all this a very good investment of your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thrash the producer of this disc!","review":"I sat through this show three times in its original Broadway run, and I was never so amazed at what I was seeing and hearing. Pure genius. Then the single vinyl album was released and the true record of this show was lost forever. I listen to the chopped up Sondheim score, with hardly any dance orchestrations and missing choruses, and I'm truely saddened. (That same year a two disc album was released of \\"Two Gentlemen of Verona,\\" so two disc albums were not unheard of.) What remains is just a reminder of what could have been, a cast album for the ages. The show gets five stars, but whoever made the decision to cheapen this one disc, gets one star, and doesn't even deserve that."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORIGINAL ALWAYS BEST","review":"Waited years for this album to be put to disc. Who can beat Alexis Smith, Dorothy Collins, Gene Nelson, John McMartin, and the fantastic Yvonne DeCarlo, not to mention all the other girls and boys upstairs?

Gone, but not forgotten New revival filled with too many Broadway babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"War is a great title","review":"This book is a very eye opening piece. Nothing seems to be hidden or spared. It's written from a factual point of view, and although I have not completely finished it yet (about 3/4 through it) I have been surprised and amazed at the information presented. This book does not take the \\"let's jump on the pro-Disney bandwagon\\", nor does it take the stance of a \\"Disney is so awful\\" book, instead I feel that this book presents both sides of the tale (pardon the mouse tail pun), and discusses the backstabbing, deals and underhandedness whiloe also presenting things that were also positive during the Eisner years. It (so far as I have seen) is balanced in what it presents. I look forward to finishing this book to see what other surprises surface in the court battles and the conclusion. War was an appropriate title!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read, period.","review":"I puchased this book because I am a huge fan of anything Disney. Planning to read it for some inside information I was really happy to not only get that, but a really entertaining and readable story. It deals with inside corporate stuff but not in a boring sense and it reads more like you are enjoying a fictional story. Pure entertainment and something that any fan of Disney or a great story should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"The book is a must-read for anyone who has a job in corporate America, without respect to the industry you're in. Eisner and the other characters bring real corporate intrigue to life, to which we can all relate. The games, the titles, the hirings and firings, the information sharing and hiding -- we can all relate to how this works in large brand corporations, and when it's exposed in the largest and most widely known brand, it's a riveting. Really a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read this if you're looking for Disney magic","review":"I was concerned when I purchased this book that it was a very long, corporate novel. I typically find non-fiction about big companies difficult to read and often give up before I've gotten halfway through the book. James Stewart, however, found a way to make this book easy to read - I even found myself wanting to stay up to see what happened next. The book doesn't paint a \\"magical\\" picture of the Disney Company during Eisner's reign, but I thoroughly enjoyed the inside look at the corporation and the behavior of its upper management. I even found myself looking at the corporation I work for in a different way after reading this book. One note, though: if you plan to visit any of the Disney theme parks after finishing Stewart's look into the company, I would recommend trying not to think about the book while you're there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for those Interestedin Good Corporate Governance","review":"Disney War is an incredibly compelling, and most interesting, history of the Disney Corporation since 1984, during the \\"reign\\" of Michael Eisner as Chairman and CEO. Although Disney was not in limelight like Enron and Tyco, all the same dysfunctional elements of corporate governance existed at Disney -- but fortunately, the story had a better end. In spite of a board of directors that consisted mostly of Michael Eisner's patsies, the shareholders prevailed, and Eisner was ousted as Chairman. THis book is a must read for anyone who is concerned about leadership and proper corporate governance. It is a case study of how NOT to lead a corporation, and how NOT to run a board of directors. Those with eyes to see will learn many lessons from this book of how to do it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"The rare nonfiction book that reads like a thriller","review":"Stewart does a terrific job of reporting and writing here -- the book kept me up past bedtime more than once, wanting desperately to find out what happened next. (Which is pretty remarkable, given that, from reading the business pages, I already kind of knew.) He gets a bit bogged down toward the end, when he reaches the present day, perhaps because that's the time period when he was doing first-hand, on-the-scene reporting. But it's still a great read, and a potent reminder that Hollywood (or any business) really is just high school with money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illuminating Read","review":"It was good to learn of what goes on behind the scenes before great hits like Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Pirates of the Caribbean surface in movie theaters. I have always taken these movies for granted, not appreciating before reading this book how many fights and battles often go on before such great movies are out.Despite the negative tone, the book is a great inspirational read. A lot of lessons can be learned from the mistakes of Disney executives. The book also demonstrates how corporate politics are inescapable at huge corporations like Disney and they can be quite an invigorating challenge to deal with.The book felt too long and could have been made much shorter while still retaining the great stories and lessons.Still, Disney War is definitely a recommended read, especially for those who have entrepreneurial aspirations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revelations Galore","review":"I have no idea how James B. Stewart accessed the documents and people important to this book, but he certainly nailed both aspects. How Michael Eisner has survived in the wake of failure after failure, after horrendous departures, betrayals and a multitude of misjudgements is a tribute to the guy's duplicity, treachery and manipulation of both management and board.Stewart once again establishes himself as an able and expert chronicler of our times. Hats off to Mr. Stewart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A have-to-finish book","review":"This was a very readable book. Well written with a good flow for the narative. Given the amount of negative information on Eisner, I kept thinking that there must be another side to the story, but with multiple sources cited for the claims, and the author including counter claims, this book is not just readable, it is believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor customer service","review":"I ordered this book on audio CD from alibris. The audio book is on 20 cd's. I received cd's 11 thru 20 but NOT 1-10. When I contacted Alibris, they said they could not look for the missing cd's and they issued refund. I didn't want refund...I wanted the first half of the book...they couldn't be bothered...they just wanted to be done with me. Very Poor Customer Service...hence the 2 star rating...it would be a one star rating but they did issue credit for my purchase. I would look elsewhere for purchasing your used books and audio cd's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intersting Peak Behind the Scenes","review":"This overview of the Eisner years at Disney is an enjoyable look at the reality that even big corporations like Disney are still run by and greatly effected by very human people. Stewart does a nice job of showing both the positive and negative aspects of Eisner's personality and the way that his outsized personality, along with those of Jeffrey Katzenber, Michael Ovitz and a score of others create a tempest that ultimately finds its way to the many products and projects of the Disney empire. While not the focus of the book at all, there is also a very nice sequence at the beginning where the author describes his opportunity to portray Goofy at the Animal Kingdom theme park. Very poignant and nicely rendered. In general if you enjoy the intricacies of the machinations of business as well as personality and to spare this is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY INFORMATIVE","review":"Love the book. I've learned so much! Love the book and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about what the Disney Corporation has gone through over the years under Eisner."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I should care because?","review":"I'm not that far into this, but I'm quickly losing patience. In view of the very serious challenges faced by America (and American business), the backroom machinations of a bunch of overprivileged, petulant, egomaniacal one percenters are less than enthralling.I suspect the prime audience for this book is Hollywood executives, who will pick it up, flip to the index to see if they're mentioned, and if not, put it back down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop reading this!!","review":"Quit reading this and go buy the book. It is a great read and will give you all kinds of insight on the inter-management of Disney. I like the way the author ties decisions to the movies we watch. His last chapter, where he indicts Eisner is terriffic.You are wasting time, buy the book. You will be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this book have a logical thesis?","review":"Beginning this book with the knowledge that it is a bitter account of a bitter affair, I was stunned by the lack of fairness or logic to the book's treatment of Disney's Michael Eisner.The only points I have come away with are that an aggressive CEO micromanaged his (successful) operation, and that in his position of power, Eisner grew increasingly distrustful of those around him. Who wouldn't, I wonder.Michael Ovitz, portrayed as both an innocent victim of Eisner's plotting and an ineffectual weakling unable adapt to Disney or to read the handwriting on the wall, is way too flat in this account to resemble a real or sympathetic person.The successes of Eisner, by and large, are attributed to his heads-up inner circle, while his failures are his alone; more often than not, his failures are attributed to a psychic malaise upon which never Stewart never sharpens his focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overkill","review":"From its jacket blurb, Disneywar promises to be a lively telling of the rise and fall of the Eisner-years of Disney.Someone got their adjectives confused. \\"Deadly\\" is more apropos a description than \\"Lively.\\" Page after page of he said/he said/he said/memo said/letter said/email said...It wore me out. As page 200 neared I looked in the index and saw that Pirates of the Carribean was discussed at page 399. I skipped ahead and rest the rest of the book. I will never go back and bore myself again with reports from Mike Eisner about Mike Eisner and how Mike Eisner is great.I don't recommend this book for anyone who wants to stay awake when they are reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's corporate politics","review":"I was initially told to not read this book if I at all valued the \\"magical, pixy dust\\" side of Disney. However, I think reading this book did not change my opinion of Disney simply because I am aware that Disney is what it is, a corporation.Eisner, in my opinion, for the most part, had a great rein in Disney and really helped it make it what it is today. However, as time went on he became increasingly power hungry and greedy. One may also be shocked by the amount of good ideas and movies Disney turned down but you know what they say, \\"Hinde sight is 20/20\\". (Them turning down of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" particularly struck me personally, since I am a huge fan. I couldn't help but think. \\"You fools! Why?!\\")All in all, the book showed me nothing worse then what I expected from any multi-billion company. The drama, the betrayal, the lies, THE POLITICS."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! A thorough tale of hate-able man!","review":"What an awesome book!From an 'overall' perspective, let me assure you that you get your money's worth. This is a B-i-i-i-g book! Small print, not a lot of pictures, just a LOT of information...some of which might make you say 'Holy Cow! He did THAT?!?!'.Despite it's size, it's a good, easy read. Lot's of dialouge to help move it along. And everytime you think Eisner has hit a new low in how to treat people, he steps down even 1 rung further.I wouldn't want to be Eisner now! This book spells out in great detail his paranoid, two-facecd, micro-managment techniques that made him look great when the product was ALREADY great...and made him look crappy when a 'real' turnaround expert was needed.I've read about Ovitz and I've read about Eisner. I can't decide which of the 2 is a bigger narcicist...but I sure as hell have enjoyed the read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're into Disney, then you MUST read this one!","review":"Superbly written - you can notice the enormous efforts of the author researching the subject.This books takes an inner look at the corporative-world behind Disney, and helps us understand the decision-taking process: for goog and bad. Specifically, I ended up loving and hating Michael Eisner: Surely he was an egocentric maniac, but without him, Disney might not have endured the 80's and 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I enjoyed the details given in this public corporation known around the world.

Amazon.com told us there was not need to send another one out since the thought that it would also have a missing part. Will not purchase this brand again, having a difficult time finding somewhere to purchase the missing part."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting and suspenseful thriller","review":"I don't want to spoil the plot of this book by giving away too many details. Basically, \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\" tells the story of a very ambitious man who is faced with a problem: he's managed to get his girlfriend Dorothy pregnant, and he'll stop at nothing in order to make his problem disappear...even if it means murder.This novel is a quick read, and it's very suspenseful. Just when you think you have the whole thing figured out, Ira Levin throws another shocking curveball your way, which keeps you wondering until the very end. If you're a fan of mystery/suspense novels, this is one of the best in its class.(Note: this is the second Levin book that I've read, \\"The Stepford Wives\\" being the first. Even though I think \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\" is a great book, I just couldn't get into it as much as \\"Stepford Wives.\\" That's probably just because of my personal preference, though...and I still highly recommend this book.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Content... extremely Poor Typeface","review":"I found this book to be very interesting and a good overall vibes of the piecing together of the cosmic ladder. It is well suited for undergraduate reference.

I checked Perricone's peer-reviewed publications in PUBMED. There were only four, the most recent in 1996 which showed a miniscule sun-protection factor of 2.4 for topical glycolic acid. This is a far cry from his exaggerated claims, partial truths, and out-right lies in this book. The five-star reviews titled \\"Fringe Benefits!\\" and \\"The Perricone Prescription\\" read like shills for Perricone's incredibly high-priced products. Go to his website's store (http://www.nvperriconemd.com/), where he has a 2 ounce bottle of topical Lipoic Acid for $95!! This is typical for his products. Better yet, eat a \\"Mediterranean diet\\", skip this book, and ignore his advice on supplements.

Unfortunately there is also some good useful information in the book so the uninformed reader will have a difficult time separating the wheat from the chafe.

That is good but much of it will not help either. Unfortunately this book appears to appeal to the desperate who are looking for the magic bullet any magic bullet other than good nutrition. Also, almost any book or doctor or health conscious person can tell you that drinking a large volume of water every day will do wonders for your complexion and skin. Eating a healthy diet on top of that will be even better.

The use of Alpha Lipoic acid, alpha hydroxy acids, Coenzyme Q10, flaxseed oil, and vitamins A, C, and E ARE essential for good skin health, and good health overall. His diet suggestions are great and straight forward too. But if you go to his website, his lotions and supplements are WAY overpriced. There is a great alternative in Arbonne.

Although you can hear coughing and moving and other distracting noises at the begining of the first movement it is quite good. The only reason I gave this a four and not a five is because you can hear alot of coughing throughout the pieces. The music in itself is worth five stars or if possible even more.

You can enjoy these bossa nova covers on several different levels, but I also agree with another reviewer who called Todd's treatment of \\"Hello Its Me\\" as \\"weird\\". I did like several songs that I was not familiar with a lot (Mated, Influenza). Never Neverland works very well in this style, but perhaps the biggest surprise is the uptempo treatment of \\"It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference\\". I found the album to have an overall fresh feel to it, and I did think that the production was very good with nice vocals. \\"A Dream Goes on Forever\\" was also very nicely done.

Rather than attempt a true blend of American pop and South American rhythm, he does neither justice. Worst of all is his dry, passionless, offbeat vocal delivery. Either he doesn't understand the concept of Bossa Nova or he's trying to make a joke at our expense. It isn't funny!

How else can I describe it: His vocals are early on some passages and late on others. I know he is a talented guy and musician so it just HAS to be a part of his interpretation of this (unique) style. But it does throw me off a bit.Rushing is especially noticable on \\"Can We Still Be Friends\\"Are you sure Todd didn't have a double shot from Starbucks before this take?\\"Influenza\\" also had lots of rushing, but it fits the song. He is sick with \\"facination\\", as his \\"heart, mind and will slips away\\", after all. Unique style. Yes, and Artistic to the max.

As a work of fiction, this book doesn't measure up.However, there may be more to a \\"prophetic\\" novel than just the story. Still, the plot deviates from biblical prophecy in various ways, thus indicating that the book ought to be labeled just \\"science fiction\\" - not \\"prophetic fiction\\".

I had to remind myself it wasn't his fault. He was only acting under orders. Actually, the film was so dumb it was funny. I found myself almost laughing at the scary parts, and that's why it's destined to join the ranks of other rank films like Ed Woods' PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE. If it were an animal, however, I'd have to give it a mercy killing. And the book, as I understand, runs pretty close to the film.Besides providing proof that Christian filmmaking has arrived nowhere after more than twenty years, it also revealed the silliness of Hal Lindsey's ideas for the end of the world. Once you see them \\"fleshed out\\" on the big screen, the one thing that becomes clear is what a trite end for the world is envisioned by this whole concept. I suggest reading End-Time Prophecies of the Bible, if you want a dramatic look at biblical prophecies for the end of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather boring","review":"This book is not something I would recommend.

Marvin's incredibly raw and unrefined vocals coupled with an unashamedly street-oriented improvisational approach put him in a class by himself. Despite some tracks' relatively poor sound quality I strongly recommend this 2-CD set to all Salsa fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Increible","review":"This guy is a chanting genius.

Her positive reflections, regardless of race or religion of the reader, is easy to understand. One can only set down the book(s)and/or poetry feeling empowered and enlightened. I applaude her strenghth, courage and wisdom that is derived of her many life experiences,her belief in GOD and human spirit and the ability to never give up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Inspiration for women","review":"This book is a wonderful inspiration for women.

We need more like her in this world"},{"rating":"2","title":"So many differences, yet so similar","review":"The first time I heard Maya A. speak, I had the little hairs at the back of my neck stand upright! I was moved and in awe.I have read several of her works, all of which were cherished. However, after reading \\"Heart\\" I felt a deeper awareness. I am a middle class, white woman. I will NEVER understand the hate, fear, and anger experienced by anyone of color- no matter how much I learn, no matter how much I empathize. What I will share with all races is that emotions are emotions, no matter the color. Raising a child, falling in love and then realizing, \\"Oops, wrong one\\"...parental love, fear, anger...all make us human. I feel closer to this world for having forced myself to think about past misery and hatred. I wish my children the grace and dignity displayed by a remarkable woman. Thank You for reaching my soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Maya","review":"I have read all of Ms.Angelou's books and have gained a knowledge of the strength of women.She speaks to all that is revelant in life,then and now.Heart Of A Woman is yet another step closer to total litterary bliss.She decribes with such elegant and understated prose the emotion of motherhood with honesty,and grace.We are all better for having read her work.Thank You Maya"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.....","review":"When I first picked up this book, I thought to myself 'Ah yes another \\"Go Women\\" book. I started to read it. The extensive aray of emotions and thoughts this book provoked was amazing. I never thought a book could touch me so deeply. Sometimes, I laughed so hard I needed to put the book down, sometimes cried a river, sometimes threw the book across the room in disgust and anger for all the racial comments of both black and white races. One amazingly breathtaking story. I recently went to see Maya Angelou speak, the topic \\" Composing oneslef\\". The moment she was introduced and came on stage, I burst into tears. It was the most wonderful thing I have seen to date. I highly, highly recommend this book to all who want an amazing story and want to come away from a book with self-confidance, reasurance and re-newed self worth: I am Woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't help being disappointed in this book.","review":"I had just finished reading Maya's other book \\"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\\" when I started \\"The Heart of a Woman\\". I really enjoyed the first book in the series, so I was very excited to get started on this one. The moment I began reading it, I felt something had gone terribly wrong. Self pity seems to be the underlying theme of this story. I don't want to be forced to feel sorry for this woman who has lived a very incredible life. This story also lacks the small bits of sweet humor that I found so endearing in the first one. If you are looking for the same enchanting storytelling you have found in other Angelou works, you won't find it here. Sorry...."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read, wonderful insights","review":"In addition to being a moving tale of a life filled with challenge, adversity, accomplishment and excitement, \\"Heart of a Woman\\" gives important insights to non-African Americans about their life situation. As a white woman, I am so grateful for the light Ms. Angelou sheds on the thinking and psyche of an African American woman. Until we, as whites, come to better understand this group's challenges and see the privilege we take for granted, we (whites) will continue to oppress.

I have always said that give me ten random paragraphs from different authors and I will always tell you which one is by Angelou. It's a very interesting story. It's a good read. However, I have read works by her that are better, which is why I give it 4 stars. She narrates about her life in Egypt, Ghana, and America. We are also given a closer look at her relationship with her son, her trials and difficulties. Go get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maya","review":"Love this book.

Hertsgaard is certainly unqualified to judge the press because he is so committed to his agenda it clouds his mind.Even though he's short on facts and lacks a basic knowledge of how things work at the networks and big newspapers, Hertsgaard obviously spent a lot of time interviewing people and there are some interesting quotes from people in the press and in the reagan administration. If you don't mind reading every few paragraphs how evil and stupid Ronald Reagan was you can get some interesting quotes from people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grounded Comments From Someone Actually Listening","review":"I agree with what some of the others have said. This CD is a pretty huge disappointment. I have waited ever so patiently for 15 years. I bought Against the Law on the day it was released and have been listening to them since 1989.I give one star for I.G.W.T., and one star for Open Your Eyes. Every other song on this record sounds either A) bland, mid-tempo rock music that could've been written and performed by any number of faceless studio musicians. or B) Michael Sweet solo ballads. Where is Stryper? Oz? Robert? where did you go? Where is the band that wrote \\"Surrender\\", \\"More Than a Man\\" or \\"Caught in the Middle\\"? Where is the drumming that taught me how to drum when I was 12? Not on this CD. All you'll find is bland bland songs with horrible production and a good Stryper cover-song at the very end. I like the photo on the CD cover, and I would still love to catch them live soon, but this album sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't transition well.","review":"Basically this album Stryper tries to be Christian/Modern Rockers which if you know their previous material seems kind of ironic cuz Stryper was all about being upbeat about Christianity, God and the Bible. Here Sryper is trying to do a combo of acid-rock/goth-rock with Christian overtones.There's a reason that there's a classic VH-1 channel and that hip-hop is dominant right now as much as it sickens me to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 2 cents .

We have been waited so many years for them to return but this is what we getting, a different sound of STRYPER. A lot of bands tried to change their style of music to capture the current listeners whom prefer the Alternative Music but I tell you what, it won't work. I don't mean that you can't change, yes you can but don't use your old band name. Form a new band or solo (side project). We are the listeners of the 80's sound and we prefer to listen to the old style. Look what WARRANT, SKID ROW, POISON and other band who changed their music did, we will never buy their album again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reborn?","review":"In the 80's and early 90's I was a die hard Styrper fan. But as the band broke up and music evolved over the years, I may have changed somewhat too. However, when I heard that Stryper reunited, and came out with a brand new album, I was very anxious to hear it. Boy was I dissappointed. This album has absolutely no punch. \\"It's not their best stuff\\" is putting it nicely. Those who say they have a more \\"edgier\\" sound, makes me curious to know if we are listening to the same album. In fact I still believe that \\"Against The Law\\" was their best album, which I still listen to today from time to time. \\"Reborn\\" is a good album lyrically, and typical Stryper style, but musically I rank it right next to \\"In God We Trust\\", thus my rankings of the best Styrper albums are as follows:1. Against The Law 2. Soldiers Under Command, 3. To Hell With The Devil, 4.The Yellow And Black Attack, 5.In God We Trust & Reborn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing return for a once-great band...","review":"One of my favorite bands throughout the 80's, I was psyched to hear that Stryper was doing a new record after 15 or so years. But once again, these old bands (Ratt, Dokken, Def Leppard, etc.) don't get it! Why try and incorporate today's music trends into the style of music that made you popular? I don't want to hear drop D tuning, no guitar solos, monotone vocals, and that's pretty much all you get on this record from start to finish. My wife (who was a huge Stryper fan as well) just turned to me and said \\"every song sounds the same\\", and they do. Very Disappointing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reborn at all","review":"I loved Stryper for all the things that were and are not on this album. I think Reborn is a weak, uninspired album stuffed with clichés. Really, I am a big Stryper fan, but I could not listen to this album more than three times. I turned it off halfaway the album when playing it for the third time. Worst thing? They killed a great song 'In God We Trust'. I don't understand this album. If you want to know what a flat tire sounds like...listen to Reborn. One star for the effort and out of respect for a band who can do a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened","review":"Stryper used to rock........now they sound like they just rushed this album to obtain some much needed money. Talk about selling your soul!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please put this away","review":"Why does a band like this have to come out with this release in 2005. First off, the sound is poor to say the least. In the 80's this had bad songs but still had good sound. That is all gone at this point. Maybe if they realize that God is just pretend, they might be able to make a better CD. That will never happen. Most of the fans think the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, not great","review":"I was one of the lucky ones to have access to the demo of Michael's new solo album from a friend of a friend. Although I was never a huge Stryper fan, I did like some of their songs back in the day.Because of that, I bought this CD when it came out, and what astonishes me is there really isn't a whole lot of difference between this and the demo. I really don't think there's a lot of Oz on there (since he was never on the demo to begin with), there are some extra guitar fills but that's about it, and for that matter, there's no real difference in the drums. I wouldn't be surprised if Robert isn't even on it at all.As for the mix, some people have complained, but I like it a lot. I thought Stryper had too much of that polished 80's sound, this has a lot more of a raw edge to it. I don't think it would have been wise for them to try to sound like they did in 1988. They would have pleased their hardcore fans, but the name of the game is to sell records."},{"rating":"2","title":"COMPARE THE COVER OF THIS ALBUM TO SLAYER'S G.H.U.A.","review":"GREAT STRYPER ALBUM!

The tone of the film shifts dramatically in a way that jerks the audience around more than it tells a good story. First you are laughing, then you are elated, then you are horrified and sad. It's more manipulative than it is creative and to me it felt a bit condescending.On the upside the premise is solid and the performances are strong. If it wasn't for the final quarter of the movie I'd have given it 3 1/2 stars.I expect many people will enjoy this movie more than I. However to me there is little more here than a generic thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Film","review":"I'm not a huge fan of serial killer movies, reality based or otherwise, and if a film is going force violence on me than it better be worth it. Chugyeogja's grit is manageable and completely worth it. It's plot is different where it counts, and the characters are perfectly written and acted, while at the same superbly cliché. Unlike many procedurals the director never insults his audience, and even takes care to construct the most believable foot chase ever caught on celluloid/RED-RAM. If you loved Oldboy, High and Low, or Infernal Affairs you should be good to go.

The scanner's drivers will not work with Windows 7. I have tried to download new drivers but, for some reason, Fujitsu does not provide the full set of drivers on its websites, only a hodgepodge of updates. I have been trying, for 3 weeks now to contact someone at Fujitsi about this issue without any response. This is a long time to be without use of the scanner and will probably need to retire the unit (only two years old) and look for another brand with more reliable and accessible tech support."},{"rating":"1","title":"The scanner periodically makes a REALLY LOUD obnoxious noise","review":"I was just browsing through the reviews and I am rather shocked to see that no one else has complained about the incredibly loud and annoying grinding noise this scanner periodically makes while grappling for the next sheet of paper. My scanner has been making the noise since it was purchased, so it has nothing to do with wear-and-tear. FWIW, I use this scanner on a daily basis in an office environment, in order to reduce the need to physically store inactive files, and about once an hour, and sometimes more frequently than that, the scanner makes a horrendous crunching, grinding sound. It's very unprofessional and I have long wondered how the scanner passed through Fujitsu's initial testing. Clearly, I would not recommend this scanner to anyone who isn't working in, say, construction because otherwise the sound it regularly produces is unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Dissatisfaction","review":"I purchased the ScanSnap from Fujitsu. After 2 weeks of frustration getting the software loaded and with two calls to customer service I called on the expertise of a professional in IT. He could not get suitable answers from Fujitsu customer service and I finally threw in the towel after a promised call was never received from customer service. After returning the product to Amazon (very easy by the way) I have finally gotten the promised call 14 days after the initial day! Needless to say, I am staying away from Fujitsu products as their customer service is woefully inadequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy any ScanSnap if you have Windows 7","review":"Please note that until sometime in 2010 (according to Fujitsu) there will be NO driver support for Windows 7.

It doesn't matter if the paper being inserted and scanned is old or new, previously stapled or whatever. There are times when the scanner works really well and I do not have issues with the feeder. But more often than not I have to feed even a 3 page document because it continually jams. I did not purchase this product anticipating I would have to constantly feed documents 2 pages at a time.

We scan every invoice, every POD, and every anything that relates to running the business. Me best guess is 60-180 pages per day. I have found only two problems with the scanner. 1.) Unless you are scanning crisp fresh paper, the autofeed will only work with 5-9 pages at a time. Anything that has been tri-folded for mailing, don't expect 25-50 page autofeed. 2.) Non-standard size paper. We have a couple companies we work with that send dot-matrix invoices. These are 6\\" x 9\\" pieces of paper. I have not found a way to scan multiple pages at once. I need to scan them one page at a time. Due to these two issues, it makes the process a little slow.

Generally, the various battlefield locations (East Woods, Middle Bridge, etc.) are described in a well organized manner, geographically and in time line. It is an excellent example of war history from the individual point of view. One small detraction is the maps.

My brother joked that it was \\"designed by a woman\\" (as it is a gender game and the details in this game are bizarre). I also thought that the \\"bicker\\" cards in the game were extremely sexist and I was embarrassed to have our 14 year old niece playing with us.

It has been a while since I read this book, but even after all that time, I still felt as if I had to write something. I did not like him and could not watch poor Judith fall in love with him.

To me, Egan did not make a distinction between pulp reporting - in a medium that is read and immediately tossed, recycled or used to wrap garbage or line a litter box - and writing an enduring full-length, non-fiction book.Like a news reporter, he protected his sources to the extreme. His citations are scanty, and he omitted footnotes and bibliography. His descriptions of some historical figures are glib [Isaac Stevens, Chief Seathl]. Some of his data derive from popular myth - not from scholarly research - so the myths are perpetuated. He also comes across as an Anglophobe.Shame on his editors and advisors. Shame on him. If his sources were cited, his work might be a convincing treatise for ecologists and historians. His shortcomings are maddening."},{"rating":"1","title":"This city boy does not know what he is talking about!","review":"His love the trees - hate the people who raise them as a business attitude is so distorted that it taints the book.

For me it is important that I see the reproductions in as close to the original form as possible and I feel this book is achieving that.

I loved seeing men run for their lives and get hacked up all in fun. I wasn't aware that this was gonna be a comedy at first but the comedic spin is what made me continue watching.It's certainly no masterpiece. It's not scary and it's not meant to be. It's just an hour and a half of interesting silliness to provide entertainment. Nothing more and nothing less.I admit I hate zombie movies and the only reason I watched this was for the different spin on the concept. I wished we could've seen the women before they turned into men-hating maniacs but the action begins quickly and it's nonstop which I appreciated.My only complaint was that it's hard to understand the men at times. They have very strong British accents and in some scenes they tend to talk over one another and it makes it almost impossible to figure out what they are saying.Then again who watches movies like this for the dialogue huh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"DogHouse Bloody BRILLIANT!!","review":"This movie is a perfect example of how a zombish film should be done.

Lashner's writing keeps getting better and better, especially his pacing through the book. We meet a character named Bob in the opening stages, and when Lashner brings him into the book later on it is such a great setup that I laughed out loud. It is wonderful to read a book that is so well written. Even a mediocre story can be palatable if well written, but this has everything. If you have read his earlier books you will want this. If you are new to his work you might want to go back to the start and watch the progression of not only the characters but his writing.

Victor does not like this case or his client, but once he gets his teeth into something...And, talking of teeth, don't read this if you need a dentist as Bob the dentist plays an interesting part in this story which blends a lot of themes including one of redemption and the idea of \\"pay it forward\\".

The directing is similar but the storyline and the style really rips of the salton sea. Many of the charecters are the same and the over style of the charecters. I was very disapointed.

It's just a sick movie about people staying up for days drugged up on Meth! Brittney Murphey and Mena Suvari should not have done this to themselves!

This \\"stylish\\" way of filming utilizes close-ups and too many different angles and special effects. Many times i had to look away from the screen because certain scenes are very intense and confusing. Many single shot images all thrown together. I see no talent or art in this movie. They really don't show the reality of meth abuse. I know because i lived it."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 out of 5 stars","review":"A few words to describe this movie are: completely sick, demented, distrubing, nauseating, inhumane. We all know drugs exist and that people who are addicted to them live in messed up dark worlds of their own. But to make a movie about that, with no real point is completely stupid. This movie consists of no plot and no conclusion. A bunch of people stay awake for days while on Meth and the movie ends with them all asleep. If you like watching people crapping into tiolets, or getting strapped onto beds and left there for days to suffer, than this is your movie. About half way through this movie I felt completely sick to my stomach and couldn't even look at the cover afterwards. In my opinion, anyone who likes this movie is seriously messed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst movies of all time","review":"Jason Schwartzman (rushmore), John Lequizamo (collateral damage), Mena Suvari (American Pie), Brittany Murphy(Just Married), Eric Roberts(National Security), Mickey Rourke (Once Upon A Time In Mexico), Patrick Fugit(Almost Famous), Deoborah Harry (lead singer of Blondie) and Peter Stomare (Happy Campers) are among the cast wasted in this pointless and ridiculously stupid drama about scuzzy white folk with drug problems. None of these characters are worth it and the everlasting cocaine snorting, animated cartoon footage and gross out scenes, is just not worth it. Man what the hell was everyone thinking about when they signed up for this crud, \\"uh I think I should destroy my carreer\\" Requiem For A Dream was better then this and I liked that better then this.

Why someone had to waste money, time, and film that could've been used to make a good movie, to make a flick about them is beyond me.

The other is that Jonas Akerlund directed the movie (Jonas' past experience with directing is with music videos.) If that isn't warning enough that you that this is a horrible movie the terrible story and the cartoonish characters (John Leguizamo apparently lives in a meth den, yet he manages to wear stylish gucci leather pants through out most of the flick) should be enough. There is also have the camera effects that Akerlund uses in this film in a similar fashion to those used by Aronofosky in Requiem For A Dream but only half as effective while being superficially glossed over.To sum it up it is just dumb, in the same fashion as most music videos are. There is little here to satisfy your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speeding to hell","review":"The story here dosen't matter. The main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending. Scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction, meth. Quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless. Roberts is so gay you want to smack his face. he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity.

There are maybe 1 or 2 entertaining moments provided by Mickey Rourke (the only entertaining character and the reason for the star) but when it ended, I was left feeling numb.There's no plot and it's a hugely derivitive movie that rips off everything from Requiem for a Dream (and other drug movies) to Beastie Boys videos.I'm not sure what it was really trying to say about drug addiction, apart from the fact that you can pick up strippers if you take speed. Watch Trainspotting or Requiem for a more mature and informed attitude to drug addiction.The only thing the film had going for it was that there's alot of energy so the time did pass pretty quickly. If you spend your time in front of eMpTV then this is the film for you whilst you wait for the next masterpiece from Eamon.Jonas kerlund, don't give up the day job mate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Don't let the intriguing cast and plot fool you- this movie is not worth your time. I found myself more interested by the music than the actual film, thanks to Billy Corgan, who did an excellent job(as always)and even makes a cameo appearance. If you're into the likes of movies such as Requiem for A Dream, definitely don't waste your time on this. It's not funny or realistic, nor does it keep one's attention. It tries too hard to disgust the audience and make them think it's fast-paced by using cheap camera tricks. Not to mention the characters and script are horribly underdeveloed. I still can't figure out why so many successful and talented actors and musicians actually opted to be a part of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Movie","review":"This movie is about speed freaks and what they do in 3 (or 4) days. That's the plot. But the plot is not what is important in this film, it's the crazed speed filming that makes it shine.Not for everybody because it has disgusting characters, a unforgiving grimy setting, which includes probably the most casual nudity I've ever seen outside a porno (pink flamingos comes close) Oh, and on the note of Pink Flamingos, there is a homage to it in this movie, which has a fat lady in a trailer eating T.V. dinners (notice the pink flamingo by the door) It's no surprise that John Water's film was a huge influence on this film, I think Natural Born Killers also.

Unfortunately, this film lost all credibility with me because it was trying way too hard to be \\"Requiem for a Dream\\".I was irritated from the beginning with the obnoxious noises and constant close-ups. It had many well-known actors and actresses in it-but this did not make the film any more interesting. The storyline dragged on- and became incredibly uninteresting after about 25 minutes. My boyfriend asked me why I was still watching it. He had to leave the room b/c it was driving him nuts. As far as the director, he needs to find his own style.Don't waste your time with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strange, and stylish drug film.","review":"Ross is a college dropout with a drug problem...a big drug problem. Ross gets the opportunity to get free drugs if he will become the driver of the local Crystal Meth dealer.Over the next few days, Ross will come into contact with a kooky stripper, crazy cops, crazier junkies, and a wacko named Spider Mike (brilliantly played by John Leguizamo.)Dark, dirty, repulsive, and sometimes funny, \`Spun' is a tale told through the eyes of speed freaks. Shot with quick camera motion, and trendy styling, video director Jonas Akerlund does a superb job of setting a grimy atmosphere (you almost feel like taking a shower after watching the film.) The film is peopled with great performances from Brittany Murphy, Jason Schwartzman, John Leguizamo, and Mena Suvari, as well as terrific cameo appearances from Debbie Harry, Alexis Arquette, and Mickey Rourke in a stand out role.Those looking for something different will enjoy \`Spun', as well as fans of anyone in the cast.Nick Gonnella"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch the dysfunction, presented in a lighter tone","review":"I'm always surprised that this movie is cross-marketed with Requiem for a Dream. Requiem is a much darker hellish downward spiral. Spun is a lighter, irrervant, and funny (at times and if you have a dark sense of humor) look at a completely different drug and lifestyle--crystal meth tweakers. This movie is rich with absoslute zany, off-the-wall characters, from John Leguizamo's paranoid, self-obsessed dealer character, to Mena Suvari's unwashed, unkept addict, to Mickey Rourke as the completely unbalanced and very vivid The Cook. The plot is a little flimsy, but aren't the lives of drug users kind of dream-like, trance-like, and without a clear linear plot? This can be viewed as a series of manic music video scenes, but put together, this is a compelling film about drug abuse that avoids preaching to the audience, chosing instead just to demonstrate.Fans of this movie should also check out dark comedies such as SLC Punk! and The Opposite of Sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really how the addiction is","review":"So yes, like everyone else complains, this movie does kind of have a Requiem rip off to it. It does have some really good actors that do good acting and the filming is very decent. Kind of one of those movies worth seeing once. Basically it's about the lives of people addicted to Crystal Meth. HOWEVER, the movie fails to mention that the way these meth addicts act are the way that someone would act after using for long long time consistently AND they would have been sniffing a MUCH larger amount, not little bumps here and there. Spun does capture some of the aspects of what it's like to be addicted, but, in my opinion, it's obvious the writer/producer/whoever has never been on meth or addicted to the drug. SO IN A NUT SHELL, if you like movies, check this out, for the sake of it, but if you want to see a better movie about meth addiction and the way it effects people, check out Salton Sea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched badly","review":"Didn't know it was gonna be so scratched it barely plays..

I picked up \\"Career Of Evil\\" along with this disc & it made a nice 2 disc set. None of the songs are the same versions, \\"Career Of Evil\\" is mostly live, while this disc is mostly studio.

Still, this one struck me as having potential. The trance gods were kind to me that day.This album is a balancing act that works quite well. This is \\"classic\\" trance, and it does sound a little older. However, the mix also sounds quite fresh. The track selection is almost all... well if not gold, at least silver. It is mostly uplifting, sunny melodic trance. Some of it is vocal, but there's just enough vocal element to make it enjoyable. There is also a little bit of darker stuff (on disc 1 primarily), to help round out the prolific happiness.This album does not reach to the most devestating heights of euphoric trance (but then again, not much does...), and instead remains strong, uplifting, and cool. If you are a trance-thirsty listener looking for a fresh bottle of Spring water, bottoms up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for spices","review":"I've owned this for about 6 months and use it mostly for making spice or herb rubs.

The final chapter of this book was more along the lines of what I was looking for...a history of modern Florida (1920-2000). While I did enjoy the book and it was very informative, I was hoping to hear more about recent events. Development and change in the State of Florida has happened at such a rapid rate since 1950 that about three quarters of this book seemed to be about another place!

If the answers don't include values, she recommends making up values off the top of one's head, and (you guessed it), plugging them in, THEN checking the result against the five multiple choice answers.On an actual SAT, the student does not have the luxury of wasting so much time!

However, I've played this CD no less than 8 times and it's just too painful. I yearn to hear the same kind of energy and artistry these guys gave us with Fully Completely, yet with each release they seem to vear further, and further away. Granted, no Hip collection is complete without every album, but if you were ever to skip one let this be the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Voice That Never Changes","review":"This is Canada's worst and most overrated band. They are a disgrace to the country. I am sad to know they are from here and wish they weren't. The singer's voice sounds exactly like the singer from REM which is another horrid band. It is such an annoying and bland voice. It never changes and sounds exactly the same on every song. I especially can't stand My Music At Work which got so sickening I wanted to literally shoot the song. I wanted to kill a song. I don't know how that's possible but after hearing that song I realized it was. What a completely horrible poopy band. And to think they're the band that is generally mentioned first when Canadian rock music is talked about. Pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strange step to the side","review":"Each record by these guys sees them go in a different direction, but none has been such a wide leap as from the rocking Phantom Power to the laid back Music@Work. The end result is a laid back more rthymic record with much more of an acoustic feel to it then any previous Hip record. Take Lake Fever, one of the bands most unique treasures. The song starts out with an upbeat dance drum sound but then seamlessly enters into an acoustic melody without skipping a beat. Throughout Music@Work the Hip experiment with different sounds and textures creating not their best but perhaps their most interesting listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Lured Me.....with another cool album","review":"the latest from the hip is a solid venture. I have been listening to this album since april (thanks to the wonders of the internet) and it still is in my cd player at work or on the road. lot's of great tracks to choose from such as M@W, Lake Fever, The Bear (which they are probably going to have to juice it up a little bit for the road which is a bummer...lots of subtle interplay going on which would get lost live.) Putting Down, the Completists and Wild Mountain Honey. I still consider Day for Night to be the greatest Hip album, but you can't go wrong with any of their recordings. These guys are truly an underappreciated treasure. Cant wait to see them live this summer. Oh and you get a groovey sticker when you buy the CD. I already slapped it on my bumper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why do I like this album?","review":"I can't figure it out. Deconstructing it reveals a basic rock band, with interesting vocals and lyrics. The production quality is excellent. It sounds great at any volume, at home, in the car. The tunes get stuck in my head. I don't see why I don't hear this on American radio stations. I revisited \\"Trouble in the Henhouse\\" when I dusted off an old CD case, so that prompted me to buy this, their latest offering (at this time). These guys are cool, and this album shows their contiuous improvement. I bought their entire collection, to see how they did it. I still don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows into an amazing disk!","review":"Yes, I would have to agree with some of the negative comments on this cd, it doesn't reach out and grab you the way some of the others did. There is no obvious radio \\"hit\\".That said, after a couple of listens, you can truly appreciate that yet again, The Hip have presented us with yet another masterpiece. Much the same way that U2 has changed their sound over the years, The Hip have made a slighty different sounding record. Fans will find it very familiar with enough different to intrigue and make you listen on.I am highly disappointed that in Miami, you couldn't hear The Hip on the radio even if you bribed a DJ. I was fortunate to get caught up in the release hype in Toronto and have seen them live. If you're looking for one of the best cd's that I've purchased this year, buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Hip, it almost hurts","review":"In a week, when I have all the songs memorized, I will bump my rating up to a five, but on the first few listens, a solid four. A Hip album for Hip fans. As someone said, if you don't like the Hip, you're not going to like them any better after this album -- this is not entry level Hip (for that, might I suggest Fully Completely). But for a Hip fan, these 14 songs are incredible -- even the denser songs like Tiger The Lion and Wild Mountain Honey tempt you with the promise that, eventually, you'll get them, and you'll be humming along. Stay and The Completists are fantastic songs. Treat yourself. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and suspensful","review":"A great mystery. It was hard put the book down and I read it in two sittings. When is the next book going to be published? The characters were interesting and if I ever meet Jacob, I'd punch him in the nose myself. The book reads fast and kept me in suspense the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENTERTAINING","review":"THE STORY SEEMED TO COME TO LIFE WITH THE DESCRIPTIONS OF CHARACTERS.

In fact a book I have read now 3 times. Wish it gave more detail in other words could have many more pages. Hated to lay it down but sorry when I had finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"A very fine book from a new author. The Cabin kept my interest from beginning to end.Most books from 1st time authors are easy to guess what comes next; but this is not the case for CJ Henderson.I was never quite sure what was going to happen when I turned the page.My only complaint is that Cabin II is not published yet!I'm waitng, CJ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Jayne Anne Phillips Instead!","review":"As a proud native of the great state of West Virginia and a professional writer myself, I wholeheartedly agree with Ms. Shook from Morgantown that Ms. Henderson has only magnified the worst stereotypes of Appalachian life. Her subject matter is unsavory and her writing style very poor. To anyone who wants to read fine writing by a skilled West Virginian with fascinating stories to tell, I recommend the novels of Jayne Anne Phillips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story line, amateur writing","review":"I felt the author had a very unique storyline but felt her method of writing left a lot to be desired. The circumstances surrounding the occupants of the cabin was a bit less than believable. CJ Henderson was not successful at creating an environment that the reader was able to step into easily. Transitions between scenes was instantaneous and often left me confused as to where I was, or what a character would be doing. This novel has potential, this author has potential. However I feel that CJ should focus more on creating believable circumstances and an atmosphere in which the reader's imagination is not taxed towards participation. I want to be placed in that cabin, feel the heat from the stove, smell the dirty matress, and really feel the fear when the man comes home! Maybe Miss Henderson should get out of the city a little more? I'm looking forward to the sequel........."},{"rating":"1","title":"West Virginia stereotypes","review":"As a resident of the lovely and badly maligned state of West Virginia, I always look forward to reading a new West Virginia author. C.J. Henderson, a native West Virginia, took what could have been an opportunity to dispell the myths of the mountain people, and reaped profit from it. It was laughable, the prejudice and stereotypes this woman created with her charcters. I was extremely offended. The book should come with a label, \\"Stereotypes galore! Come laugh at my state!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Who edited this?","review":"The subject matter of this book is appalling, but it was so poorly written I kept reading it to see if it would get better. It didn't. It sometimes seemed as if the author sat at her keyboard each day and just started out without checking whether she had written this part already or not. In a way, it is inspiring--if she can make a living writing this stuff, I can too, though I don't want to turn my own stomach.Yuk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Handy!","review":"This is a hard item to find item, you will not be able to find it at your local stores ... I have tried :) The item is as described, meant for light duty accessories not to be used with towing. The photo is a good photo of what is received which is very helpful for those of you who are thinking of purchasing it, rest assured you will receive the exact item pictured in this listing.I do see some comments in regards to quality, I would remind them that this is a light duty extension for accessories only ... so it is not heavy gauge metal but serves the purpose.Happy Shopping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR TOWING","review":"very misleading for us speed readers,,,,looks like a 6000lb extension....NOT...for bike racks only. You can see that in the product discription...NAME IT SOMETHING ELSE AND DROP THE 6000 from the product name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"Note: This is NOT for towing--this is ONLY for use with a bicycle rack!!! No where in the item description does it mention that this is NOT FOR TOWING, and yet when I opened the box from Amazon, it's printed right on the Heininger box--\\"Not to be used for towing.\\" I bought this because I needed a hitch extension--NOT a bike rack mounting extension!! What a waste of time and money............"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like I needed it to.","review":"I wish it came with a locking pin instead of the bolt, but other than that, this is a good solution for mounting my bike on the back of my Jeep with an oversized spare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"Honestly, it's worthless to me. It is made of flimsy square tube and the locking bolt is barely long enough for three cranks. It's not a good product for the price. I ended up going to U-Haul and getting a heavier, cheaper, better version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Extender provides enough clearance to accommodate the Rav4 spare tire and open the rear gate. The drawback to this item is that 1.) absolutely \\"zero\\" instructions included. I was confused as to whether the plastic anti sway insert was to be removed or not. Also, it leaves you to your imagination as to how the main mounting bolt the to be secured. I finally figured that one out. So overall it worked as it should but please, include some sort of instructions..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did what I needed it to","review":"I purchased the Heininger 6000 extension and 6001 threaded hitch lock at the same time. I have not test drove it yet, but it seems to accomplish what I wanted. My bike rack now fits on my Wrangler with room to spare clearing the 12.5in wide spare on the back. I really like having more than one pin location.I was not sure if the lock thread would fit with the extension, but it does. Despite the very little clearance available around my hitch, I did get it to fit and lock. I had to insert it from the left as the hitch wire harness connection interfered with the lock when inserted from the right. I also discovered that the hitch lock on my 2in receiver Yakima rack fits the same threads as well. I may have purchased another one of these instead had I known. It would be nice to just have one key for everything.The only downside I encountered was that 6001 and 6000 were not in stock together, meaning I had to pay for shipping on both from two different Amazon affiliates."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really helpful","review":"I thought I had hit a goldmine but not so.It's too abstract, too boring, I miss examples.Models should be helpful, not a goal into itself. Maybe this has some illusionary appeal to managerial types.I gladly refer to Dilbert's comics, if you want something helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect fit","review":"These flares were the perfect fit for my f250 superduty. They came quickly and were easy to install. They look like they came on the truck by factory. You have the choice of painting them or not. They come with a flat finish. I chose to leave them as they were. They make the truck look a little more finished and tougher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem in the table of contents","review":"Hey Guys,I'm enjoying using kindle so far. It has been great. Although this is the first book that gives me a headache.The table of contents has problems, you can not jump from one work to another.I already wrote to Amazon, they said that it has been fixed it, but so far the problem remains. I deleted the file, reseted my kindle and the file is still with problems. I even checked on kindle for PC and the problem is there as well.I hope this opinion might help to solve the problem, otherwise I will have to buy another version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Total P.O.S...","review":"The only reason I gave this thing 1 star and don't consider it a TOTAL P.O.S. is because the alarm clock still works. The radio picks up more static than radio stations. The CD player stopped working after about 2 months and the warranty is insulting. I paid about $30 for this alarm clock and they want $20 to fix it, plus s&h. Why is it so freaking hard to make a CD player alarm clock that isn't garbage?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bargain","review":"I got this clock im January and I am quite impressed by its performance.I did see the bad reviews and entirely agree with the previous reviewer that others might have received defective products but mine is going on strong after 8 months.Alarms are excellent and the radio reception is good.However,the CD quality is acceptable and for the price I paid this could be considered a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"What time is it?","review":"This clock does not keep time. It frequently jumps back to 12:00. At 4:45 one morning, it read 3:00. I'm certainly glad I had a back up alarm set. I am now having one heck of a time trying to contact Amazon about what to do with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Radio","review":"This is a horrible clock radio. When the radio or CD player is turned on, the device has a terrible buzz. It is so loud we can hear it through our baby monitor (this radio is in the baby's room). In addition, the clock does not accurately keep time. It runs fast. Within 2-3 weeks it is 2-5 minutes ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"This shoe rack is made of heavy particle board, not solid wood. I got something similar, but larger and made of solid wood for about the same money. This rack was harder to put together than the solid wood rack and isn't as attractive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of Hutton's music","review":"There's precious little Betty Hutton on CD. Fortunately, this collection offers a generous sampling of Hutton's music, cramming 27 tracks onto a single disc. Seven songs from the soundtrack of \\"Somebody Loves Me\\" make up the core of the album; the remaining 20 tracks intermix some lovely straightforward ballads (\\"The More I Go Out With Somebody Else,\\" \\"It Had to Be You\\") with plenty of the delightfully over-the-top vocals for which she is best remembered (\\"Murder He Says,\\" \\"He's a Demon, He's a Devil, He's a Doll,\\" \\"It's Oh So Quiet!\\"). The sound quality of this disc varies but is never less than very good and is usually much, much better. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skokie, IL The Best Place To Grow Up","review":"I was thrilled when I found out about this book.Not only was it about my hometown but it was also about being a Jew. Having been a Jew in Skokie during the 60's, 70, & 80'sI was sheltered from the world around me until the Nazi's decided to march in 1977. This book covers not only the nazi's, but the community of Holocaust survivors as well as a mini history of the suburb.I thought I was the only one who thought Aunt Jemima was the real deal. An excellent read all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaker Tool","review":"If you speak, train or motivate people.

If you want a recording that you can enjoy listening to, buy a more recent one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"My 3 year old little girl loves all these Dora toys, I have been looking for the baby twins for a long time, they are fun for make beleive."},{"rating":"2","title":"An informative, eminently readable book","review":"As one largely unacquainted with Japanese history and culture who had a need to learn more about the country, I found \\"Giants of Japan\\" a helpful, accessible, and even fun-to-read overview. Weston's format of \\"bite-sized\\" profiles makes the book easy to put down and pick up repeatedly without losing continuity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor navigation , buggy software with expensive updates.","review":"I have owned this for about 2 years, and paid far more. Even at these lower prices, I strongly recommend against this product. Although the screen is beutiful, the interface is clunky and slow. The navigation does not direct you to the destination with great acuracy, often times saying that you have arrived when you still have 1/4 mile to go. The GPS location itself is not as good as even the cheap protable units you can get for half this price. The NAV-Traffic option displays the traffic information correctly, but does not route around traffic jams. The software is buggy, and the database is old. Updates have been non-existent despite numerous bugs, and when they are available, they cost hundreds of dollars. I've switched to a cheap Garmin portable GPS and it navigates much better. I suggest you look at one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will get you there if you have a lot of Gas","review":"Routing on the Pioneer units really needs some work. I have a $400 Garmin that works way better. Mine will have me pass the road i should have turn on only to have me make a u turn and back track on the same road i was on and for a few miles only to turn on the road i passed 10 minutes before. This happens about 40% of the time. If you don't care about Navigation i would give it a 5 star rating for all the other feature. The only way you will be impressed with the pioneers is if you never owned a Garmin or just don't care about the navigation part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avic D2, a total waste of Money!!!","review":"I purchased my Avic D2 in 2006 and by 2007 I started noticing the touchscreen would not respond when inputing certain letters on the right side of the screen (R,T,Q). Then the space bar would not respond either. In time I could not use most of the characters or letters on the entire right side of the LCD. Now the \\"OK\\" is completely nonresponsive on the touchscreen making the unit completely useless. I regret purchasing this unit and having it installed in place of the stock unit that would have come with my YukonXL. I thought I was purchasing a better nav.system by choosing Pioneer's Avic D2 but instead it was a complete waste of my money!

Truly awe inspiring. I'm pretty sure you could fry 25lbs of fries at once if you desired. Secondly, after close inspection of construction, the owner will notice it was designed or ease of frying and cleaning. This artery clogging fryer has its own spigot to drain, and is easily disassemble for cleaning. Wow, I can clog my arteries, and have a clean fryer all at once. What more could a person want? How bout temperature control. Unlike propane fryers that requires constant adjustment, this fryer comes with its own thermostat that regulates the temperature of the oil. What does this mean? No burnt or under down turkey. Get the oil up to temp, set turkey in its basket, and 38 minutes later you have a 11 pound turkey that is moist, juicy, and lip smacking good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"I don't know why everyone is giving this product such a high rating. I guess they all work for Cendyne or something. This burner didn't work in my computer. I tried really hard to make it work by messing with the jumpers and IDE cables but it didn't work. i spent hours trying to make it work before i realized that this is just a cheaply made product. my friend suggested to me that i should have spent $50 more in order to get a decent burner. i realize now that if you spend at least $150, you'll get a burner that's easy to use and you won't have to go through the trouble of returning an inferior product. In short, i learned that you get what you paid for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good drive....","review":"This drive installed easily: just set the jumper to master, plug it in like the instructions say and boot up the computer. It worked 1st time out of the box, no drivers to install. Mine is reported as a TEAC CD-W58E drive in the device manager. Cendyne obviously gets these from a variety of makers. The included software with mine is NTI CD Maker 2000, similar in function to the Nero software. Cendyne has a forum for Tech Support on their website and also has helpful FAQs. My first test was to copy a CD I made on another burner, and it took about 15 minutes using the harddrive to image the CD. If you have another CDROM it would speed up the process to about 9 minutes. I recommend the Cendyne highly as a budget burner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I was disappointed. It looks like it was created by an amateur on a desktop PC. It was hard to sing with.

Look, I know how pompous that sounds, but if Madonna gets to be a pomo progenitor of McLuhan-esque re-contextualization, then Kylie can re-imagine the post ironic disco dolly through an 80's prism of new wave hedonism. Minogue doesn't have Madonna's genius for the lyrical flourish - most of these tunes meaning's live and die in their titles: \\"Slow\\", \\"Sweet Music\\", \\"I Feel for You\\" - but the music, and her breathy multi-tracked delivery, not to mention the model perfection of the woman putting it over, add up to a joy Madonna hasn't touched since, well, Madonna. And she does it - in my case, anyway - without the aid of one single video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mainstream Pop, YES. Commercial Sell-out, NO","review":"Contrary to popular belief, Kylie Minogue HAS experimented with various forms of music, hence a move toward more contemporary pop/dance with Body Language. Just because this GREAT album is not a Fever (her last album) clone, does not mean it is not one of her best compilations. Body Language sees Minogue move back to her more traditional pop-electronica roots with catchy hooks and a more mainstream pop sound. First single 'Slow' is therefore NOT representative of this CD. Stand-outs on this brilliant album include 'Secret', 'Chocolate' and upcoming 2nd single 'Red Blooded Woman.' This CD only reinforces Minogue's status as Pop's real royalty."},{"rating":"2","title":"her best album","review":"I'm a fan of r&b music and occasionally dance music, so naturally I enjoyed this groovy album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible CD!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This CD is soooooo bad.

Slow is officially the lowest-ever selling No.1 single in the UK. I thought Obsession kicks off with a good saucy start but it is then trash into another boring region of album-fillers. How can everyone keep comparing her to another Aussie popstar Natalie Imbruglia? She is a talented songwriter with deep thoughts and nice voice, and Miss Minogue is just a singer with no creativity. It shocks me real deep when I hear that she is releasing Chocolate as her third single. AND Gosh, how can she even get a Grammy for Come Into My World?No wonder Slow is the only single charted in Top 40 and stayed for 2 weeks before it dropped off the chart.

It was a shameless attempt to crack the U.S. market but it has failed because she looks too old, and she definetly is out of touch. Kylie's better off sticking with the pink pound, she sells more records when she puts a glittery pair of hotpants on and hangs out at Mardi Gras but her attempts to be taken seriously have been ultimately laughable.This is the same old same old, nothing new or different and it will soon be forgotten.

Without Cathy Dennis Kylie's a sinking ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"100% of Kylie is just about good looks, and you can really see why she's lasted it, not because of the music, but because of looks alone, however looks don't always count, she looks like a hooker on the cover for Body Language anyway, and that isnt good....Maybe that's why it didn't sell???? she frightened everybody off?? what about the music??? the music is just dire. No personality, no emotion. There's no hint of integrity in Body Language at all. It's cheesy on every level imaginable....Musically its an album Britney would have outgrown years ago, imagewise she's trying to look like Barbie! (she should have stuffed her bra with some more tissues)....And the lyrics are soo bad its like it's written by a teen. She is 36 and has lasted 15 years, this is what she comes up with???? she's so obviously got a lack on interest in the music, its time she gave up and went into TV or something.

I expected so much after her \\"Fever\\" album which was so pop-induced,with so many dance tracks. Kylie is trying to broaden her musical horizons a little bit too far to where this sound on the new album does not fit her at all. Don't worry though, her sex-driven image is still present but her good looks don't make up for the music here. When i heard the first single i was just heartbroken at how awful it sounded.

James Mason OMG u should be a comedian dude....God I CRACKED UP when I read his review.....his description of Kylie's poses in the booklet's foldout are CLASSIC.....hysterical....and yet very true (read his review, it will make u LAAAUUUGH.....XD).

I was surprised by a few of them, and I must say it's not a one listen album. You must play it a few times to really get into the groove of it, and then you're hooked. I especially love Promises because of it's uplifting beat. You have to give her credit for constantly changing and trying new sounds. Personally I would be dissapointed if she kept making the same kind of music- but true fans know that's not her style. She keeps the music fresh on this release. Her voice is very enticing, as heard on Loving Days. Some have said that the music on this album is too 'European' to reach into the North American market. All I have to say to that is, a whole lot of people may miss out on new sounds and great music that is found on Body Language. One side note- please Kylie don't remix all the songs on this album so we have to go buy another one. It's very frustrating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sign Language needed as well as Body Language","review":"\\"Body Language\\" was always going to be a difficult album to listen to following the previous success of Kylie Minougue's No.1 U.K. and No. 3 U.S. album, \\"Fever\\". For die hard Kylie fans, the album was fine and included the \\"Breaking the mould\\" U.K. No.1 \\"Slow\\", but interest soon dissipated after that. I thoroughly enjoyed the album, but I would be considered one of the \\"die hards\\". In the U.S. the album didn't live up the expectations of it's predecessor, which is a shame because that means it has become over-looked, sandwiched between the \\"Fever\\" album and the \\"Ultimate Kylie\\" double album. A new re-listening of the album will guarantee that you will find it more of a surprise than you thought of it before!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fever is much better !","review":"I was turned on to Kylie with the Fever album. Fever is glossy pop, danceable and slick with great melodies - addictive! When Body Language was released, I immediately bought it - what a disappointment! It sounds overly simple and filler-ridden. The single 'Slow' is a sweet minimalist grind, but that's pretty much it. If you're looking for a great intro to Kylie, definitely check out Fever."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Kylie's best album-I Feel For You the best song","review":"This is not Kylie's best album.I would say probably the best song on there is\\"I FEEL FOR YOU\\"There are others that I like on there.I will still purchase the album because I am a Kylie fan and as a Kylie fan you can't seem not to buy the album and keep it for you other collections.I will still support Kylie with this album even though it is not her best album."},{"rating":"1","title":"r-u-b-b-i-s-h","review":"pllleeaaazzzz aaavvvooiiidd thiiissss bbbimmmbboooz albummm ass tthizzz grrraaannddmaaa isss nooott rreettirrinnng aaattt alll.thhiss allbbumm izzz reeeally fffuuull offf shhhiittt avvvvooiiid thiiis gggarrrbagggeee.pppuutt iiit innn thheee trraaasshh caaan nnoooowwww."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every Song Sounds the Same","review":"I like Kylie and I believe she is a talented singer, but this album is not very original or good.

I wish she would return to her \\"Light Years\\" and \\"Fever\\" stuff and abandon the R&B- a white Australian woman really shouldn't sing that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God.....Stop the Madnesss","review":"Okay I just have to say I didn't buy it for one reason. Check out the samples given. They were worse than poor. Every song sounds the exact same, either sped up or slowed down. Quality? Far from it. Not that any of her music has been. But at least on the other album some songs were stomachable.

Teriffic senual \\"chill out\\" styled songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Body Language... with emphasis on 'body'","review":"Kylie steps away from her traditional dance-pop/disco sound for a more varied and warmer pop/r&b sound. Body Language is Kylie's sultriest and funkiest record, in it she makes you dance with electropop (Slow) and a dash of rap (Secret) or seduces you with lots and lots of whispers (Chocolate, Loving Days). Kylie knows how to make good music and she shows those skills in the fine production of Body Language..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked!","review":"I'm not gonna lie I tried to give this a chance, but didn't think it was that great. I thought they picked some decent beats but other then that there was nothin there. I thought most of the songs were boring, too girly, and not that great. Compared to Fever, i thought this album was awful! And can see why it tanked in America. She really should have had some really uptempo tracks on this cd that would have made it alot better. Chocolate, boring. Red blooded Woman, ok. I mean seriously? when you have britney spears, gwen stefani, and countless other carbon copies in America that actually sound decent this stuff doesn't really stand well in the us. If there was a dictionary word for bad pop music this album cover would be on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kylie is like no one else.","review":"Kylie is truly Pop's Princess. Her most recent two albums, Fever and Body Language, show the world of pop music what it should sound like. The best thing about Kylie is that she is not afraid to let a little electronica slide into her music. She is also different from most pop singers in how strong her voice is, and how well she sings live. The video for \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" is probably the most perfect video ever made. Body Language is very listenable. The standouts on the album are Slow, Still Standing, Secrets (I Take You Home), Sweet Music, Red Blooded Woman, and Chocolate. \\"I Feel For You\\" is a very fun song to sing along with, and \\"Slo Motion\\" has a very sad tinge to it. One of the Slow CD singles features the great, sexy video, and the Radio Slave remix on one of the singles is great. Kylie's experience, maturity, sexuality, and talent show in every performance she gives. She will always be remembered as a global pop sensation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red blooded woman, indeed.","review":"The latest Kylie CD offers us a new look at a familiar pop diva. Like Madonna she changes her sound from album to album. This time she takes big risks with very R&B sounding singles like \\"Red blooded woman\\", \\"Chocolate\\" and \\"Secret(take you home)\\". The first single \\"Slow\\" may be the only track on the disc to hit #1, but it does solidify Kylie's reign as the top performer of the last 15 years. After all, this is album #9, and she has had over 30 worldwide hits. Where will today's recent wave of pop singers be 15 years from now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"America's New Sensation","review":"Here's the thing...Body Language is phenominal! This album marries the hip hop and electronic sounds in such a subtle way that it takes a trained ear to notice. Kylie is expressive and experimental with her vocals and is clearly having fun with this music. The production is impeccable, incorporating the retro sound (that is SO hot right now) into a warm, well-balanced mix of sonic ingenuity. If you really want to appreciate what went into this album, PUT SOME HEADPHONES ON and THEN have a listen. It is no wonder 'SLOW' is the number one dance song in the US right now. It is undoubtedly refreshing and fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Shocked by How Good This Disc Is","review":"I have never really been a fan of Kylie Minogue because she always seemed like another disposable pop tart. However, after hearing \\"Body Language's\\" groovin' \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" I became intrigued and wanted to see what else the album had to offer. Man, was I shocked. This album is terrific. Minogue has produced some of the best dance music I've heard in a while. It's not just the same formulaic stuff you normally hear, these songs teem with soul, funk and purpose. The atmospheric beats are irresistible and Kylie's sexy coo works well on all the tracks. If you're having a party and need a disc to throw on that is consistently jammin' from beginning to end--look no further--this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different From Last 2 Albums But Still Good","review":"It is different from her last 2 albums but still good. This album has more of a dark feeling. Reminds me of her DeConstruction album \\"Impossible Princess\\". Of course any Kylie album is great. Stand-Outs: Slow / Promises / Red Blooded Woman / Chocolate / Loving Days"},{"rating":"2","title":"the afterparty","review":"Ever wonder what happens after the party? Well Kylie's BODY LANGUAGE tells all. If her previous album FEVER was the party then this is certainly the afterparty. That being said, this CD has a more relaxed feel to it. It's still sexy but in a more sensual way. Like the title says... it's about giving signals without saying much. BODY LANGUAGE is filled with 80s synth funktronica and Kylie's sexy purrs. Highlights include \\"slow\\", \\"secret (take you home)\\", \\"chocolate\\", \\"obession\\", and \\"after dark\\" to name a few. All of the songs are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd will make u want to dance@use yuor 'Body Languange'","review":"The Best CD so far of Kylie and I think she'll just keep on getting better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Minogue Does It Again!","review":"For those of you who were anxiously waiting for Kylie's followup to 2002's \\"Fever\\" album, the wait is finally over! In a drastic departure from her Europop/Dance roots, Kylie takes us in a totally new and surprising direction with her newest album \\"Body Language.\\" Each song on the album is unique and different from the dance hits on \\"Fever.\\" From the digital minimalism of \\"Slow\\" to the soulful \\"Promises\\" to the wildly infectious \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" to the upbeat \\"I Feel For You,\\" each song is a masterpiece in and of itself. Like a true musical diva, Kylie reinvents herself yet again...you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE HOTTEST POP RELEASE OF THE YEAR!!","review":"Kylie Minogue has done it again. There's NO doubt in my mind that the Aussie Icon has finally taken hold of the American public! This cd gets better with each listen. \\"Secret\\" is so damn good.. I'm wearing my cd out already! KYLIE.. CONGRATS ON YOUR GRAMMY WIN!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Mediocre Follow - up","review":"I was so disappointed with this CD. I really like \\"Slow\\" but other than that the songs have no hooks, bad lyrics and sound dated. I know the \\"80's sound\\" is big right now but a lot of these songs are too 80's. They sound like b-sides from Lisa Lisa and Cult-Jam, or worse, Samantha Fox!Kylie, you can better - I'll keep my fingers crossed for your next release...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like old school Madonna over 80's rap drum beats","review":"Well I ignored the reviewer that said this album had a hip hop sound and was bad. I decided to buy the CD anyway and decide for myself. No I wish I had listened to that person, because they were right! Kylie's Fever album was incredible and I have listen to it many times. So I expected at least something similar, if not better here. Sadly, this album has Kylie sounding like a hip hop wanna be and completely out of her element. It sounds like old school Madonna over 80's rap drum beats or something. She completely abondoned her techno pop future sound of the last album. I put the album in the trash and I hope Kylie gives us a better product next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure trash","review":"trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trashtrash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trashtrash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash please avoid this old woman and her album.ciao"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible CD","review":"Anyone who says they love this CD is just one of these diehard loser fanatics that would like anything she releases, even if it was Kylie recorded reading the phonebook!

I thought I'd never say this about Kylie ever! but this album is not good. She's just got so lazy that after Fever she thought she could put anything out and it would sell! sorry, it's a bad album and needs to get her arse into gear if she wants some respect for her music. There is only ONE song on the whole of the album that is OK, and thats SLOW. The rest is boring, bland and sorry to say, COMPLETELY rubbish!.

Critics are trashing this heap and it's not selling as well as her previous album which was a fluke comeback and I do mean fluke! She is like J-HO, Samantha Vixen, Skankney and Xteenuh, A FAKE! I despise those songs Red Blooded Woman and Slow. All of the tracks have annoying computer beats and rhythm and is dull and boring unlike Norah Jones who can write her own songs and posseses something none of these manufactured divas have, TALENT. Kilee, Skankney, J-Ho, and Xteenuh are poised to ruin the music world with their garbage. Avoid Kilee and buy anything from real Australian acts like Men at Work and AC/DC instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What language is this?","review":"Geez, body language must be the one and only language that this opportunistic floozy understands, as she doesn't seem to comprehend the term 'past one's best'--or in Kylie's case 'past-it', as come on now, she was never really good in the first place. Her music is opportunistic, predictable, superficial and just plain BORING, and she doesn't even write it herself...and this 'I discovered sex' image has got to go already. You look stupid sweetie...(!)Her time is up and she should've never even had the time of day in the first place! What is wrong with people? Are they drunk?P.S. I have given this album a one star rating as Amazon wouldn't grant me the dignity of letting me refrain. If enough people complain about this, perhaps they will do so in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Language","review":"She can't really sing, but when she gets good songs to sing that is only when she shines. She's got some really dud ones here however, sounds like its a game of trying to keep up and stay relevant instead but there's no substance to this album, it sounds like she's trying her damned hardest to relive past glories but her thin whiney voice really spoils it. If kylie could actually sing I think I would change my mind.No matter how many of her fans try to turn me on to her they won't ever succeed in making me her biggest fan. She's had a few ok songs but she hasn't got anything special that makes her stand out. The CD cover also put me off, because at first I thought she was a drag queen. Gasp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fabolous","review":"Having gotten reaquainted with Ms. Minogue a couple of years ago when Love at first sight was all over US radio, I started getting her albums that were not released here in the States, in anticipation of the Fever follow up. Yeah, Body Language is not as poppy sounding as Fever, but it works. Best of all is Slow which sold me on the album even before it was released here in the US. While you are about getting this, also pick up the Hits Plus compilation.Peace out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diffrent album","review":"Good songs - Slow, Red Blooded Woman, ChocolateThe rest is bad very bad.

'slow' is a great electro opener and then it is downhill fast to filler after filler. 'red blooded woman' comes from the sub destinys child template, and the last 2/3 of the cd should never have been recorded, rapping on one song (dire) and the hyper helium breathy vocals on 'chocolate' are overwhelming, and not in a good way. if the usa needed new music from kylie, why not release Light Years in the US and save us from this A&R driven soulless filler. cant wait for the NEXT kylie album when she goes back to doing what we love her for, which isnt this. buy 'light years', buy 'fever', take a trip on the new greatest hits dvd, but dont bother with this release"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Kylie","review":"This album has harder, sharper beats than Fever, which I feel gives it a more dancefloor sound. I've been hooked on kylie since I heard \\"Love at first sight\\" and this album doesen't change a thing. A personal favorite is \\"Sweet Music\\" but really all of these tracks are great. If you love kylie's singing you'll definately love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Queen Euro-Dance-Pop","review":"People don't seem to appreciate someone doing something different. Kylie can sing well (listen to \\"Confide in Me\\" & \\"Did It Again\\" for further proof) but she chooses to sing in hush tones because she wants to. Kylie is most respected by the her millions of danceclub music fans here in the U.S. So, unless you love club/dance music and/or are open minded, do not buy this CD. Kylie should direct her music club/dance music lovers who appreciate her music. For dance music fans, this is a treat. It has deeper grooves that are sometimes dreamy. It includes the hits \\"Slow\\", \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" & \\"Chocolate\\" which are all significant club play chart hits. In conclusion, this album is initially for club/dance lovers not pop fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"HER FEVER HAS MOVED INTO A BORING BODY LANGUAGE.","review":"Minogue is back with \\"Body Language\\". Too funky, and no beat.The songs just muddle into each other from song to song. With the first single \\"Slow\\" which barely peaked into Billboards Hot 100 Singles at No.93 and fell fast, was slooooooow and boring.Her next single \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" is a little more upbeat, but this funky sound that Minogue is trying to do doesn't make sense.An Australian white woman trying to be Superfly doesn't bode well.She should of stuck with her \\"Fever\\" roots doing more dance songs like \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\", she would of had more American pop success. She had her chance coming of a Top 10 smash, but ruined it trying yet again to change her style and become Sly and the Family Stone.Not very good at all. I give her 2 instead of 1 stars because she is Kylie Minogue, and has lasted many years in this business, however listen to this album first before you buy it, it is not at all like the Kylie we know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Body Language - Kylie Minogue","review":"I was surprised at how much I liked listening to Kylie Minogue's latest CD. Although it may not win any song writing awards (tongue planted firmly in cheek!), it IS great background music, as one of my friend's noted.The music is great for when you want something with a fast beat, to keep you awake.This is pure, saccharine fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Slo Motion worth double the price??","review":"This import version is double the regular US issue CD and has only one bonus track instead of the two the US version has. However, the track Slo Motion is excellent and probably twice as good as either of the two US bonus tracks. Out of the slower songs on the CD, this is definitely the best one.You can't fault Kylie or this CD, as it's got your hits, near hits, and misses. You like an album to be at least half good, and this one is exactly that. Slow, Secret/Take you Home, Sweet Music, Red Blooded Woman, Obsession, and Slo Motion are the best of the CD, with the rest being decent, but average at best. No real turkeys on here, as with her last CD Fever. In my opinion, Red Blooded Woman is the best track on here, with Slow being 2nd."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?\`","review":"As a longtime fan of Kylie's, i'm very saddened by this release.

I really want to like KYLIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mega Disappointment ...what happened?","review":"BIG Kylie fan here, Light Years is by far the most fun of her albums and Fever runs a close second. This, however, is so DULL that I thought I was listening to Danni Minogue. Are the same producers responsible for this mess that worked with Danni on her latest flop? Where is the sense of fun, playfullness and more importantly CATCHY songs?SLOW starts off the album and right off the bat, I knew we were in trouble. The first song in a CD should grab you and pull you in, I was left cold. As with Britney Spears' duet with Madonna, a stupid song that is just plain bland. Kylie just went too far in the direction of way too many female vocalists today..so called \\"fluffy\\" pop that someone let the air out of. And by the way, anyone that actually thinks \\"Chocolate\\" is good has brain damage. That song is as sexy as a bowel movement.Major Let Down...and I will bet this gets NO U.S. Airplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a huge disappointment","review":"Words cannot describe how dull and boring this CD is. I expected another great dance CD from Kylie, instead she decided to do more of a bubble gum pop CD. \\"Slow\\" is the only good track on the CD. Other than that, all other tracks are just awful with the exception of one ballad. Just like the name of the song, this CD is just that....SLOW!

Although tracks such as \\"Slow\\" and \\"Chocolate\\" offer solid beats and grooves, there is very little lyrical or melodic substance.

I can see an excellent action/thriller movie out of this story the plot is twisting and turning and you wonder why the author is introducing new characters (or old)and how is all comes together (brilliantly) at the end. We could fell Hatch's pain with Daphne but I won't give the story away. All I can say is read the book. I am looking forward to reading more of William Diehl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will step on your toes...","review":"I have read this book multiple times, in fact this is a replacement book since I loaned mine out and didn't get it back. You will feel like every scenario was recorded from your own home. I've laughed, cried, and then really prayed for a turning point. I also realized I had to do my part. Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Time","review":"This honestly might be the worst book I've ever read. I'm a senior in college and was forced to read it for a Sustainable Urban Engineering elective class, and wow what a waste of time. I've never seen an author repeat himself more than Florida did here. He was saying the same things (really, check it out) on, say, page 140 as he was on page 35...that basically cities need to invest not in tax abatements to attract high-quality and talented businesses and people, but need to focus on increasing diversity and quality of life through developing amenities like good social scenes. The book is filled with a bunch of charts, tables, and graphs, backing up his claims that talent and the creative class flock to diverse regions with lots of stuff to do (which, really in my mind isn't groundbreaking information), but they again are extraordinarily repetitive. The book could have easily been condensed into a short article in and I would have gotten just as much out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is lousy","review":"My hunch is this is a cheap sequel. Not a lot of discussion, just a lot of (regression) results reporting. Extremely repetitive. Moreover, given that this often verves into being fairly social science (as opposed to pop), the causal linkages seem pretty poorly established. If you want to read this for professional reasons (social science or urban planning), most of this could be ignored; if you want to read this for personal (i.e., recreational) reasons, it's really boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Voice - Weak Material - Bad Production","review":"As www.cdbaby.com only publishes ratings with at least three stars, here's the chance to tell the world that this is really a bad album! OK, Kelli has potential and she's really good on albums by Incognito, Philippe Saisse and on the early Count Basic albums - but her solo efforts are a real pain in the ears. Who the hell is responsible for the production? Poor girl got screwed if she paid a dime for that! The songwriting isn't much better. And the arrangement... horrifying!!Save your money on this one. Neo Soul at it's worst..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Although I've been a big fan of the Acid Jazz/Neo-Soul, I just recently had the pleasure of recognizing Kelli Sae as a great voice within the genre while listening to Incognito's Who Needs Love CD. I quickly became enamored with Kelli's vocals on Stone Cold Heart, so naturally I did an online search of Kelli's work, and found out about this cd. I purchased it the next day and even though I'm not a musician I could tell that this body of work was an overall poor production for such a great talent. There were only two songs that captured the quintessential elements of Kelli's talent (the very danceable \\"Can't Wait\\" and the very reflective \\"Heaven\\"). Other than that the arrangements were amature when compared to Kelli's efforts on the Incognito CD I previously mentioned. As I said Ms. Sae has a tremendous voice and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one of her CDs, but do yourself a favor and save your money on this compact disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Herald/Ember house of hits","review":"Quite a suprise on the songs on this album. Couple of not so great ones. Otherwise, if you are interested in this kind of music, it is a good album. Bought this album from one of Amazon's sellers. Quick service and fast delivery at a very reasonable price. The CD came factory sealed which I did not expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"13th Floor","review":"A movie that will challenge your perception of what you think is your reality. Is anything real or are you just a holographic program...as hinted in \\"The Matrix\\" trilogy. I found this movie on video several years ago, and in watching it again, decided the DVD was a must. Definitely a movie for my library. I am very selective about what I buy. I so enjoy movies that challenge your mind to question what has been taken for granted. If you liked \\"The Matrix\\", here is another mind bender for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Much Underrated Sci-Fi Film","review":"This visual pleasure was seriously overshadowed by the Matrix that came out the same year. Unlike the other masterpiece, which was armed with an ambition of an epic in cinema, The Thirteen Floor is more creative in that there is no self-righteous mission of an entire population to fight against the Internet. There is no immediate indication that leads the audience to the division between physical reality and the virtual one--at least not until the latter half of the film. Instead, what it presents to us is layers of virtual reality, or illusion, if you may. But it also can be understood as infinite layers of reality, depending on precisely how you interpret it. Besides all these philosophical headaches and debates on metaphysics, what is most important is it is an intriguing story--with amazingly hot actors and actresses. It would be a shame to miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cult film fave","review":"This is a stunning movie, simply overshadowed by the realease of \\"Matrix\\" about the same time. Not that \\"Matrix\\" wasn't great, but \\"Thirteenth Floor\\" deserved a lot more attention. Maybe just too cerebral for some--this is thought provoking and requires astute attention. While others have mentioned \\"Dark City\\" and \\"eXistenz,\\" this is my favorite of the three. The photography is stunning, the production values make \\"eXistenz\\" look like a student film, and 1930's Los Angeles is beautifully realized. The use of color palette to distinguish the different realities is more effective on DVD than VHS tape. Craig Bierko, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Vincent D'Onofrio (who is unrecognizable from his stint in \\"Men in Black\\")are all riveting. I found the ending to be clever, staying true to the theme of the movie while playing out the love affair. This warranted a satisfying second viewing to assure that all the pieces of the puzzle fit together. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up!","review":"I have to admit that after seeing the trailers in the cinema for this, I had no wish to see it, but I rented it today on DVD and was very impressed. Another review mentions the Dark City reference, which is one that I'd agree with. Visually, it is stunning. Those who will enjoy the film in 5.1 will be pleased. Overall a very thoughtful and well-made film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually a widescreen disc","review":"Unlike what other reviewers received, and contrary to Amazon's product description, I actually got a \\"flip disc\\" with the full screen version on one side and the 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen version on the other.The video/audio quality is very good, the scan has good contrasts and the print shows no scratches or dust. The extras are OK, but there is not much.Compared to the previous movie modeled after \\"Simulacron-3\\" (which I have not read), \\"Welt am Draht\\" by Fassbinder, this version has few hollywood style \\"feel-good\\" changes to the story. It's a decent movie on it's own, but I missed some of the elements that made \\"World on a Wire\\" stick out, and there are a few plot holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No chemistry","review":"Slow, dull, and dark with a poor sound track. No chemistry betweem the leads. Special effects are rudimentary: at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"This movie was a huge disappointment. It takes a wonderful concept(the idea that what we perceive as reality is actually an illusion created by scientists), and ruins it. The acting is mediocre (especially the detective, who is thoroughly unconvincing--at first I thought the character was bad, but then I realized that the actor just didn't suit the part), the representation of the technology is stupid (come on, didn't we get over talking computers years ago?), and the vision of the future with huge golden spires and whatnot is ridiculous. When the main character discovers that his world is an illusion, it should be horrifying, but it simply isn't, because it's badly directed.

Some guy realizes that the computer world he \\"visits\\" is actually the real world and the one he's in currently is fake. Sound familiar? The special effects are sorry and the ending stinks too. Don't even rent it. The Matrix is much better. 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY OFF THIS FLOOR!","review":"This movie was the biggest piece of uh..ah..cake I have ever seen. I went to see this movie with a couple of my friends and not one of us could understand why we just paid to get in to this movie. It's like they took every thing that was cool about The Matrix and removed it,leaving a steaming pile on the cutting room floor. However if you are a big fan of this type of movie...you still won't enjoy it, STAY OFF THIS FLOOR, as a matter of fact DON'T EVEN GO IN THE BUILDING. HEADS WILL ROLL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"First of all, no computer programme can create REAL people. You need a nervous system to feel anything. In a virtual world, there are no nervous systems. Characters in a controlled universe may act like they feel or know, because that's how they may be programmed. But they will never actually feel or know anything.That's the obvious reason this movie is a pile of self-important but impossible-to-even-consider-taking-seriously crap.Add to that the mindboggling extreme silliness about a character from the virtual world taking the place of someone in the real world, and you really must question: How the hell did this Matrix craze catch on outside of mental hospitals?3 out of 10 just for the crime mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly predictable","review":"This was without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. Incredibly predictable from start to finish, poorly written and acted, I found this to be a real waste of my time. I saw \\"Comparable to the Matrix\\" and \\"Better than the Matrix\\" reviews, so I had to see it... don't bother. \\"The Matrix\\" was a very good movie prevented from being great by Keanu Reeves' complete lack of any acting talent. \\"The Thirteenth Floor\\" was a poorly written movie bogged down by bad acting and poor characterization (although I'll admit there is NO ONE as bad as Keanu). Even cute-as-a-button Gretchen Mol couldn't bring this one higher than one star.I'll trade you my DVD of \\"Thirteenth Floor\\" for a used rental VHS copy of the \\"Pokemon\\" movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice happy ending, but it's an awful movie","review":"It's just another american \\"who done it\\" murder mystery. A software specialist jumps between the past and present, trying to find who commited murders. It doesn't occur to him that he commited the murders himself. There are some special effects in the form of green laser lights. And the ending shows nice scenery, supposedly from the year 2024. The movie makes time travel back to 1937. I wish it travelled into the future more, instead of travelling to the past. All in all, it was a horrifying movie filled with killings and not much else.I give it an extra star for the pleasant happy end."},{"rating":"1","title":"incredibly boring","review":"I'm all about action movies, and this is nothing like what I thought it would be judging by the preview. I thought there was gonna be action like the matrix. I don't know why people compare it to the matrix, it was about as exciting as watching one of those \\"mattress giant\\" commercials. So if you're gonna get this movie, I would also recommend Battlefield Earth and Galaxy Quest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for husband","review":"My husband enjoyed this DVD, and in fact plans to watch it again after he gets it back from the person he loaned it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonder why 13 is so scary?","review":"I loved this movie when I first saw it and decided to have a copy.

They should have thrown it out instead of offering it up for sale.Yes, they gave us a refund but it did not remove the disapointment after waiting 2 weeks for it to arrive and the additional upset of screwing around with the DVD as we tried to find a way to watch it.I would have paid much more to just have a copy of the movie that worked. Period.So I will never use this seller again as they probably have other cheap DVD's for sale that are trash. I do not want to go through the whole emotional roller coaster again.

It reminds me of a Kubrik-style theme: dehumanization by technology. What the script lacks is made up for by the direction. The director's style fit the noir-theme of the film perfectly, but left a little to be desired on the other parts. It might have been a bigger success if not for The Phantom Menace. In fact I think they were released the same week, because I remember thinking they were crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet cyber-mystery in the land of the Matrix.","review":"Not an action movie as the trailers might suggest. More a cyber-mystery with a surpprise turn and an upbeat ending. A quiet Matrix-like movie combined with Murder, She Wrote. If you think there are internal inconsistencies it probably means you were not paying close attention to details and the theoretical construct, which you just have to accept. A new movie genre really. Seemingly predictable but not. Don't watch the trailers before the movie. DVD extras are weak compared to others, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of its kind!","review":"If you're into movies about alternate realties, this one's a definite must see.

The story is slow and predictable. The film seems to rely on special effects which it has very little of. Character development is kept to a minumum.

It has all the great composers like Handel, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Mozart, Bach, and Pachelbel. Some great songs include: Canon In D(Pachelbel), Morning: Peergynt(Grieg), Adagio For Strings(Barber), Cavatina(Myers), and much, much more.

As is, it will encourage children predisposed to violence while sickening the others. Children who enjoy this type of book bear close scrutiny. Recommended only for bondage clubs in San Francisco and prison death rows."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Scrumptious Tale","review":"What a FANTASTIC book. Adults and children alike will love it for it's wonderful rhymes, offbeat humour and bold illustrations with an anatomy lesson thrown in for good measure.

Especially in these times of so called 'political correctness' and blanding down. Kids are more durable than we give them credit for and, on the whole, will find this wickedly funny gross out tale endlessly fascinating and enjoyable.It is a sad state of affairs that this book was not to be found on the shelves of my local big brand book shop but had to be escorted from the safety of the rear stockroom so I could have a look at it.

However, that hope quickly turns into disgust the minute I opened it. The book is poorly designed. The pop-up buildings are designed with some cheap software that fills trees with cheesy moire patterns, buildings with tastelss line arts and washed out colors. The binding of the book is so poor that it began to fall apart before I opened it. The paper engineering part is also mediocre. Most buildings don't actually pop-up. Instead it's just got some poorly die-cut panels that \\"float\\" in front of flatly printed images. With the recent dramatic improvement to pop-up books such as Harry Potter's Howart Carassel and the pop-up book of phobia, this book is mundane and boring. Publishing such a ill-conceived and executed book on Frank Lloyd Wright is an insult to our country's architectural history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I had high hopes for this books based on the high customer reviews and the publication date (2002)--which is in the date range of the modern high-tech paper engineered pop up books.

It's okay if you've never seen other pop up books before, and it's probably interesting to children, but I felt like it could have been so much better.

When it does fail, you have to throw it out.Used this, maybe, 40 times. The mechanic that tried to fix it laughed when he saw the problem: the bolts that hold the engine to the mount all broke! The materials used are so cheap that Weed Eater products can't be considered anything but disposable items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I bought a Weed Eater Featherlite blower just like this at Lowe's. Lasted less than 2 years after moderate use. The handle attachment came loose. It was connected to the body of the blower by a very insubstantial rubber piece, so of course it failed. It was meant to fail, and to be sent to the landfill with the billions of other discarded pieces of junk that these cynical, greedy companies produce/import to foist off on us. I am old enough to remember when American companies took pride in the workmanship and durability of their products. Not any more. Now they take pride in how efficiently they can rip us off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one star","review":"Although I was initially happy with this product, after a few weeks, the handle broke, first in front causing me to burn my hand to prevent a drop, then today, the back two holders broke...piece of poor craftsmanship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reprint of a classic text from 1930s, still very applicable","review":"This book is a reprint of a classic text, used at Harvardfor many years. The reprint has lots of problems solved in the text and plenty of good problems for the reader to solve. Very application oriented problems covering rotating, and vibrating real world machinery. You can lear n a lot from this text by reading and doing the problems, none of which require a much math beyond algebra and first year calculus. I do practical vibration analysis daily in my work and this and Schaum's outlines are what I would recommend if you have to teach others the basics of vibration for solving typical practical problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great engineering text on mechanical vibrations","review":"I've seen several books on mechanical vibrations over the years, and this is the best by far - and the cheapest. Hartog covers the spectrum of mechanical vibrations as they are used in engineering with great in-depth explanations, detailed illustrations that help you visualize what is being discussed, and solved problems throughout the book. He just doesn't jump into what can sometimes be involved mathematics either. He always takes the time to show the details of any mathematics used in solving problems, although I recommend you understand calculus before starting out."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic in the field","review":"This is a good book for understanding the mathematics behind vibrations. The book initially contained basically everything known about the subject at the time it was written (1930s). Its only deficiency is its age. It does not cover modern developments such as the use of computers, numerical methods or FEM/FEA in vibration analysis. It also relates how the equations derived can be used for electromagnetic vibrations, providing nice insight into the power of the mathematics it discusses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad undertones","review":"So, the song is supposed to be bragging about how glamorous she and her lifestyle are, but it strikes me as terribly sad.

At least Madonna's \\"Material Girl\\" is a fun song,parodying pretentiousness.In this song, Fergie praises all her favorite things. And being marvelously rich. It's snottiness in song. To top it all off,she spells the word \\"glamorous\\" to help kids who haven't been hooked on phonics. There's a guest rap that REALLY DOESN'T HELP THE SONG ONE BIT.

I probably read it 20 times over a few year span, constantly checking it out of the public library every time I went. The story gets under your skin and stays there. For years I jumped at shadows and nervously walked alone in the dark as images of Anubis stalking through the empty foyer searching for his \\"eyes\\" crept through my mind. Despite the level of fear the story bestowed on me, I kept coming back for more, reading and re-reading the story. The House on Hackman's Hill instilled a deep and abiding love of terror, fear, and the adrenaline rush of a good scare in me that abides to this day. I highly recommend this book to young adults looking for something beyond the superficial horror books that are popular today.

Yes, there are stand up routines shown and they are quite hilarious BUT this movie also delves into the hard work and the long road to success of these imaginative artists.

It was especially interesting because it dealt with the Irish princess Fiona, becoming a thrawl (slave) to Dag the Viking.This was a sensual book, but also dealt with a deep love that developed between the two characters.My only objection to this book was the formatting.

Its rough, uncouth, downright graphic, and is undeniably one of the best, most influential movies ever made. Pacino's superb acting as the manic Tony Montana is the engine that drives it all. I'm not sure if any leading man has personified the movie he played in as much as Al did in this one. Its still as fresh now as it was back in '83.Not to stereotype, but if you're a guy and this isn't part of your DVD collection then something is wrong with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gangsta Film Ever","review":"What can I say about this movie that ain't been said already? It's excellent. I was turned on to this movie (like so many other gangsta movies) by my father. I didn't want to watch some old movie that I felt that was boring. Man, was I wrong. From the moment I saw Al Pacino's face in the beginning til saw his body floating in the water at the end, I was hooked. This movie was just so amazing to me. It has some of the most quotable lines ever in it to. Everytime me or my boyz have trouble with a female we always go: \\"THAT'S OK!

A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American Dream. Montana then becomes the \\"king\\" in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crime in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This movie has around 180+ F-words and is almost three hours long. This movie is entertaining and you will never get bored. You cheer for the Drug-lord, and in some scenes you find out that Montana isn't as evil as some other Crime Lords.

I knew that it needed remastering bad. I did not know how bad until I watched on a HDTV! Like \\"Strange Days,\\" the original \\"Scarface\\" was encoded in the wrong way. On an HDTV, you have to resize it to fill the screen. That is the reason I decided to purchase this newer version.Without telling the story, this version has encoded the disc correctly. Qulaity wise, there does not seem to be much difference between this and the old one. This one has taken the very strong film grain of the original out.

My only complaint is it's length. It could have been easily cut down, but that aside, it's a work fans of the genre need to see.Though I have seen movies that are much more violent, Scarface strikes a very deep nerve. The violence on the screen seems much more worse than it really is, and it isn't just the violence that will make you uneasy.The film had to be this way.

In the end it all goes up in a hell of bullets and hallfire: Tony Montana was a man so obsessed with the American dream, that he did not realize it had consumed him in every way possible.The film \\"Scarface \\" was very interesting but on the other hand it was scary to watch because there were a lot of actions that involved killing,robbing and a lot of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the most overrated film of all time.","review":"You may or may not want to admit it, but if you've seen your share of movies, you'd know that \\"Scarface\\" really isn't that good.

Not only is it absolutely disgusting, but it's actually interesting to watch. \\"Scarface\\", on the other hand, is boring and contrived.Watching and acting like you love \\"Scarface\\" will not make you any cooler, it won't make you any tougher and it certainly won't make you more \\"gangsta\\".

While some believe that this movie glorifies the \\"gangster\\" lifestyle, I for one believe this is simply a wonderful insight into the rise and fall of a man hungry for power and wealth. Although Montana sold and used drugs and was a very ruthless killer, he was also a victim in a way. He simply wanted the \\"better\\" things in life and given his background he saw only one way for him to do it and this thirst for power and money engulfed his very being and eventually led to his downfall.I recommend the anniversary edition to everyone but it isn't a must have. Only the movie itself is. The rappers giving their take on the movie was a very nice touch but i thought that there could have been other individuals featured who could have had just as good insight into the movie just from a differnt perspective.

The constant use of the 'F' word, the disgusting personal habits, the constant betrayals by the underworld members of each other make this movie as close to realistsic as one would want. In reality criminals are scum and Scorcese is one of the few directors willing to portray criminals as individuals with no redeeming value. For this I would give the movie 5 stars.

I would love for someone to let me know how many times the actor uttered a certain four-letter expletive that begins with an \\"F\\" in this film.

At the end it said the move was dedicated to Ben Hecht and Howard Hawks. It should have been dedicated to Quentin Tarantino. Hawks and Hecht would turn over in their graves if they saw what passed as a \\"slight\\" remake of their classic. This movie is like the original in only the title. Al Pacino is a great actor, but compared to his classic jobs in the Godfather and Serpico, he should be ashamed, and this was almost 30 years ago this bloody joke was made. The gore was way over the top(the blood fests by Tarantino were Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by comparison). If you want to see a classic, don't rent or buy this movie. It isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dvd review","review":"I'm not going to talk about the movie since I asume all who are reading this know how good this movie already is. This is going to be a review about the quality of the Anniversary Edition dvd. To start off the video quality as compared to the original dvd has been much improved but there are some scenes where the image looks very dusty and dark. The sound??? Well that's my bigget letdown about this dvd. They advertise 5.1 surround with DTS but I just don't hear it. Most of the shootouts and explosions come from the center channel. Where is the surround sound?? As for the extras, besides the Def Jam segment, they are the same as the original dvd. The only impressive change to this disk are the animated menues. I LOVE SCARFACE but I expected so much more from this dvd. I would hope for future posts about dvd reviews focus on the quality of the disks and extras that are contained in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Scarface\\" an overlong mess","review":"Brian De Palma's Scarface looked like the new Godfather when it came out. It had the guns, gangsters, and underground business themes that The Godfather dealt with. But it really turns out to be an overlong, somewhat boring, mess. We get to know none of the charachters, they've all split or gotten killed after just ten minutes of screentime, yet they are a big deal to the story. We can feel no sympathy whatsoever for Pacino like we are supposed to, and as for the music? It makes you feel just like you are watching a dragging episode of Miami Vice, with the theme song playing throughout the show. It could have been so much more, but it's just an overlong mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie, 5 stars DVD 1 star","review":"First of all, to clear up a misconception that has been that copies of this DVD have the cover on it but have a bootleg DVD inside are incorrect. This is the DVD, but it is out of print for a reason. It is out of print because it is the absolute ugliest, most disgusting defacement of a film DVD has ever done to a movie. The transfer was ported from the collector's edition laserdisc quickly and hastily, without anamorphic enhancement or anything. The end result, the picture LOOKS like a bootleg, a crummy DIVX file someone ripped on their own. This went down in history as an all time low for DVD, so this is why the DVD is no longer available, and why the new version of the DVD is currently in the works of being made.Anyhow, I've reviewed the film before, but needed to say this again about the DVD for anyone that thinks they're getting a bootleg. Believe me, there's a reason you can't get this DVD anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"No guts no glory!","review":"Anyway... couldn't wait for it so I got one from a local book store! man its a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarface","review":"Epic movie of its time.

Al Pacino at his best, no other actor could have pulled this part. Casting for the movie was great... from Tony to Manolo you cant get any better. If you dont own this movie...

It took me a long time to see it, especially being told that it was about 3 hours long. I bought the DVD and re-discovered why I love Pacino. He paints a beautiful picture of Tony Montana, drug kingpin who gets in over his head. With a beautiful wife, Elvira, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, this movie is perfect all the way to the bloody end. And even gave birth to the classic phrase,\\" Say 'ello to my lil friend.\\" This movie is phenomenal!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MASTERPIECE! NEVER CAN SEE THIS MOVIE TOO MANY TIMES!","review":"To say Scarface is a masterpiece is an understatement! The brilliance of Al Pacino's (Tony Montana) acting is breath taking. The movies storyline is great, but I think the greatest part is the directing. Brian De Palma has great vision, and if you havent seen Scarface, watch it, I guarantee you will understand how to appreciate great acting, superb casting, and even better directing! Scarface is an owner for any Pacino fan!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still looks good after 15 years","review":"How I remember watching this film in a Chicago movie theater in 1984. The audience actually cheered when Tony Montana turned the tables on the chainsaw-wielding Colombians to such grisly effect early in the action. For those days it was an exceptionally brutal movie, but the reason why it still looks good after 15 years is not because of the violence but because it is a genuine morality tale about immigration, the American dream, nothing succeeding and failing like excess, and too many guns chasing too much coke. Whoever described it as an allegory of impotence also had a point (so to speak). It doesn't quite deserve a five-star rating because 1) it's too long and 2) the attempt to portray Montana as motivated partly by a deranged possessiveness toward his sister is never very convincing. But Al Pacino carries the day - a wonderful performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a horrible movie","review":"I have to admit, I haven't seen such a bad movie since \\"You've Got Mail.\\" This so called \\"epic\\" is a disgrace to all ganster movies. It dragged on for way to long. The entire time I was watching it, I kept wondering, \\"So when is this going to be over?\\" The only part of this movie that actually earned that star is the performance put on by Al Pacino. He, of corse, did an amazing job in protraying a cuban druglord...The plot was going nowhere in the first 5 minutes. This movie got way to much credit for a horrible performance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Do People LIke This Movie??","review":"I started to watch this movie & thought it might be going somewhere.

Not only is it based on crude stereotypes of the Latin American underworld, but it is ridiculously unrealistic. I mean, when all the shooting starts - let alone whether Pacino and his minions could operate with such blatant impunity - where were the cops?So what the story boils down to is: bad guys rise and then fall. Or is it: don't get high off your own supply? Or: don't wish for what you want because you might get it?THere is nothing in this but brutality and violence.

I have a complaint in with Universal customer support. If they don't make it right I will request a return to Amazon. I have read other people having skips and stalls, so I have to wonder if this is a bigger problem, but obviously some people are able to watch it, given the other reviews.I will say, if you review this as a \\"Terrible movie\\"...well, it's kind of like being someone who hates hot sauce and complaining about the \\"Burn you twice\\" Buffalo Wings you ordered.

That combo is the formula for an entertaining movie, but when an ending is as overdone as it is in Scarface, I have to be critical. I don't want to reveal much, but let me tell you now, if you watch it all the way through, be prepared for a wild ride of excessive violence and mayhem. Pacino's shootout could have been a little shorter and more realistic. He had over 50 guys shooting at him at the same time, and the only time he got hit was when the arch rival shot him in the back! The chainsaw scene was a little extreme for sensitive viewers, but I feel that it was neccisary. All-in-all, it is a good film that shows the harmful truth about the life that crime and murder will provide in shockingly grotesque and extreme detail. Good to rent, or if you are a big Al Pacino fan, buy. PS, if I could, I would give it 4 and a half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor dvd quality","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time.

Thismovie is packed with some of the coolest scenes out of any movie. There's also a lot of dark humor tucked in some scenes. There is no other way to describe this movie, except incredible. It's a little on the gory side, but, all women i've known who have seen it have loved it. Michelle Pfiefer is incredible in this movie, but, she's always pretty good. WOW...

The attitudes expressed by Tony Montana in this fictional account of a Cuban exile becoming a Miami cocaine kingpin have branded themselves onto hip-hop and the drug game. This is drug dealer 101, learn the rules of the game and what not to do by watching this film. The by \\"any means necessary\\" mindset embodied by Tony Montana is a must for any drug dealer interested in rising above street level. This movie is an all-time classic. Its formula has been repeated but never replicated. Tony Montana aka Scarface has become a national icon in pop culture and is up there with John Gotti, Pablo Escobar, Frank Lucas and Supreme McGriff in the chronicles of gangster lore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarface Books n DVD","review":"I had no problems with this.

This reputation is not entirely undeserved. Still, those who see only the mahyem are missing a sad, gripping, and dead-on-the-money tale of ambition and hubris. Pacino is at his absolute best, and is supported by a phenomenal cast. You probably won't find parts of this movie easy to watch (the chainsaw-in-the-shower scene is as much a part of movie folklore as \\"Here's lookin' at you, Kid), but it's a work of genius for both director DePalma and much of the cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capticating, Compulsive, a Classic","review":"This is a movie which you either love or you hate.

It all comes from this critically maligned (at the time) cult classic 'reimagining' of the 1932 original.All these gangster rappers want to be the embodiment of Tony Montana. Their aspirations (get the money, get the [women], get paid) are all tied into this fictional character who just happens to meet a violent end.And this is an awful shame. ...It's just a stupid movie. Not worth getting 'capped' over this. And no matter how many negative reviews I get, I AM NOT CHANGING MY MIND! This is a darn fine movie by the way. The chainsaw scene is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst mob movie ever.","review":"Scarface, no matter what anybody tells you, is a god-awful piece of garbage. From the ridiculous synth score, to the totally unwatchable and unbelievable violence, to the final stupid sequence of the film with the infamous \\"say hello to my little friend\\" line, this movie is just wretched. Brian DePalma is quite possibly the worst director ever about putting style over substance, and this is his bloated disasterpiece. Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors and even he couldn't save this junk heap. Not to totally throw all the blame on DePalma though, Oliver Stones' awful script is a lot of the reason the film is as bad as it is. When Stone is good he's really good but when he's bad, he's terrible. All of these other reviewers on here must have seen a different movie, or maybe I just missed something about this three hour pile of crap.

I think this film was a breakthrough and led Hollywood to think cussing is essential. It is not! I don't go to theatres any more and I avoid modern movies so as to miss this assault on my ears.

The beautifully underplayed and nuanced performances like his Micael Corleone were regrettably never to be seen again from here on out. De Palma does what he can with the material. What totally sinks this movie is Oliver Stone's piece-of-junk script. It is just an awful screenplay. Oliver Stone is a lousy writer anyway, but he's even lousier than usual with this movie. I so wanted to enjoy this film, and I couldn't believe how bad it was, and couldn't believe that it was ever funded to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pacino movie ever!","review":"The is absoulutely the best Pacino movie i've seen in my opinion. I give De Palma most of the credit to this movie's success and other actors. This gritty drama focuses around a Cuban immigrant's rise to the top of the cocaine/crime business. He becomes rich and powerful, what most people want to be in this world and successful. But at the beginning of the movie he goes through hardships and problems that distract him from achieving his goal. So in a way most people can relate to this b/c life for most people is an everyday struggle. And this movie shows that even when you're at the top all things won't go your way. The end of this movie proves that. SCARFACE, a classic for all times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted, Dark, Roller Coaster Ride","review":"This movie is certainly not for everyone. If you can get past the excessive violence and strong drug use, you'll find a compelling movie with sturdy characters,truthful plot, dark themes, and one hell of an ending. Al Pacino and a very young Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio both give amazing performances. Although Tony Montana is a drug kingpin and he kills many people throughout the movie (including his best friend in one powerful moment), when the end comes, and all of those Cubian assassins come into his mansion, you almost hope that Tony will be able to fend them off. It is definetely saying something as a writer and director for Brian De Palma when he can make you feel sorry for a drug dealer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful excess","review":"Any movie that uses the F-word more than any other *must* rate five stars.

Personally, I feel that the artwork of 'Archie' comics was at it's apex in the 1950's thanks to its great attention to detail and for the fact that character design seemed to have been etched in stone from this point on.

He's little known outside a narrow field these days, but he knew how to drive a plot.Our protagonist is \\"sucked\\" into a sculpure of a boat, finding himself part of the crew and forced to man the oars in a fantasy \\"Arabian Nights\\" setting.That's just the start of a swashbuckling adventure worthy of a Douglas Fairbanks movie. There are sultry maidens, heroic rescues, and black magic, all you'd expect in a fantasy novel of the period.The writing style seems pulpy and dated these days, but it's a great fast read, and should be on every fantasy reader's bookshelf, just so they can understand the history of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy, intelligent, and fun","review":"After The Moon Pool, this is probably Merritt's most famous work. Fortunately for us, Paizo has seen to reprint Merritt's definitive edition here for us. All of Merritt's trademarks are here--the achingly beautiful woman, the lush prose, the dreamlike atmosphere, the diabolical villain, the darkness somewhat uncharacteristic of a pulp writer--and all are used to great effect. Strikingly for a pulp novel, Kenton and Sharane come across as somewhat more than just types. Although adhering somewhat to pulp archetypes, their romance is fairly fresh and well developed (predating as it does any number of imitations). In addition, Merritt provides us with a wealth of wonders in the alternate, sea-bound world the Ship exists in.

This book offers simple grammar and words that are easy to remember. I would also recommend this for children, as it IS a children's book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction!","review":"This is one of my favorite books on the Revolutionary war. Its long, again one of those books you might read every night for a while (or if you're lucky on vacation). But it gives you a great view into the decisions our nation's made and a view of events before things seemed inevitable. It's priced well enough that it's definitely worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written and insightful","review":"I have yet to finish the book - I'm almost to its midpoint. In addition, I'm not particularly well-read in history, especially of the narrative sort. Notwithstanding, I must say that this book is well-written as far as style and clarity are concerned. It flows very well and the author injects several subjective insights that enhance and enliven the purely historical info. Overall, I highly recommend this work to those who are new to narrative history, and to those who are seeking to reinforce their historical understanding of this country's past. Also, the reviewer below who lamented the preponderant attention to military topics is quite wrong in his observation - There is a significant amount of attention paid to political history and theory in the chapters leading up to the actual outbreak of the war, so don't let the review deter you. Rewarding to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best overall book about the Revolutionary War","review":"This is an excellent book if you want a good picture of the events involved in America's war for independence. It does not dwell on flowery subjects nor go astray. It tells in practical terms how the war started and how it was one and won. It is the book that most people need."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mercifully non-PC book","review":"Middlekauf does a masterful job of laying out the grand events and issues of the American Revolution. His book reads as though it were written in a time when historians were interested in writing about real decision makers and significant figures that actually shaped events, rather than about \\"women's\\" and other dubious \\"studies\\" of subjects that hardly impacted the course of events and explain nothing about the American Revolution. This book is therefore a wonderfully refreshing break from banal political correctness that won't waste one's time talking about side issues that have more to do with modern-day fashionable hang-ups than the actual events that dictated the course of the American Revolution. The fact that Middlekauf doesn't snear at \\"dead white men,\\" but rather actually acknowledges the debt all of us owe to the genius of the Founding Fathers, is just added icing on the cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough, A Very Complete Book","review":"Middlekauf writes a very thorough book on the causes, fighting and management of our Revolutionary War. The exhaustive account of British debate about and guidance of the colonial issue in North America gives background not always found in other treatments of this subject. Although at times it tended toward an academic tone, \\"The Glorious Cause\\" is well researched, presented and argued. For the serious student of the War of Independence."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"There are many things I enjoyed about this book. However, I did not find the synthesis of material original or the narrative style compelling. He opens arguments which are quite debateable, such as implying that the Revolution's impetus was spurred by the energy of the Great Awakening, and then provides no further elaboration or evidence to support his assertion. In one paragraph he refers to European soldiers as scum and dregs and then bemoans the fate of the aristocratic officer corp who have to rely on beatings and hangings to keep the kidnapped soldiery in line. This makes Middlekauff sound incredibly dated, prejudiced and unsophisticated. For a military history read Christopher Ward instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better ones than this","review":"I found this book to be painfully slow and uninteresting. If you're looking for your first book on the rev war, please choose another. If you try this one, I doubt if you'll finish it and maybe decide the topic isn't for you. That would be too bad because there are so many good books on this fascinating time in history.The book could be improved with some good maps and photos, but the slow pace would still make it below average. If you'd like a good, scholarly overview of the Revolution, I suggest \\"The Revolutionary War\\" by Alden. It's an older book, but still excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, but","review":"Middlekauff's \\"The Glorious Cause\\" is a great book on the Revolutionary War period. However, to avoid frustration and failure due to the book's depth, one must first have studied pre-Revolutionary America and a summary of the Revolutionary period. The best example of the former is Taylor's \\"American Colonies.\\" There are many short summaries out there of the latter. Do the primer-work and you'll love \\"The Glorious Cause.\\" Don't do the primer-work and you'll get lost in the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"This was a weak effort, esp. considering that the book is part of the Oxford History of the US. It offers no new insights, has very little arguement in it, and as such, there are far better single-volume works out there to be read. The book starts out very well in describing life in the 18th century on the eve of the war; it quickly goes down hill from there. Middlekauf does not seem to understand the British Army of the time either, as he frequently refers to British regiments by their Victorian-era names. I recommend John Alden's book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed on the sound quality","review":"That item has disappointed me at the sound quailty. Too much noise and unclear sound.

It is clear as a bell & as far as the echo goes, if you turn the volume down on the headset, wala, the echo goes bye bye. All in all, I'm very pleased with it. My only complaint is that I don't seem to be getting the talk & stanby time described by Motorola or the person I got it from on e-bay. For the money, you can't beat it!!

The interface is OK, but I still haven't gotten used to switching calls when I would already be on it and get a second call. I hung up on people often trying to do this.The worst features are seemingly the most important. This thing fits horribly on my ear, and had a tendency to fall off. The volume was so low that even at it's loudest I often had to press it to my ear to hear (hands-free, huh).

I didn't open the package but the repair guy confirmed that it was the inside filter. I opened the package and he installed it. Voila!

It was very easy to replace the filter. I just opened the box and got the filter ready. opened the fridge, removed the old filter and then put in the new one. I didn't need to shut off the water in my GE fridge since it has an automatic shut off when the filter is taken out. I ran a few cups(5-6) of water through the filter then let it sit for 3 hours then ran 3 more cups through before i drank from it. The water tasted much better than before.The only thing I do not like about this filter is the price. They seem to be marked up way above their production value. I do not like it when a company makes a product like the refrigerator and then makes it to use only their model of water filters, which they grossly over price.

This is concerning the ice maker itself and the multi-control board that runs the dispenser.I rip the filter out today only to find that it is totally blocking all water from getting through.

After receiving the new filter and replacing the original one, the water pressure was normal for about 3 weeks and then started to slow down a bit. It's at about 1/2 of normal pressure now.

With the Brita GERF-100, the water came out very slowwwwwly - consistent problem over 2-3 years, and I did replace filters regularly. I also tried one other non-GE filter (don't remember brand) and that didn't work well either. Flow with this GE-branded filter is about 60% faster.

The water flow is much slower and the water less filtered once the filter is due for replacement.Switching out the old filter is easy, the new one installs just as easily, and then it's just worth spending some boring minutes running water through the filter until it's ready for primetime coffeemaking, drinking, or whatever works for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product!","review":"It is reaaly a difference when you use this filter.

I purchased 2 of these replacement filters...and an HM water meter, to see how good the the filters work. To my extreme surprise, the water filters remove nothing from the water, the contaminent levels are equal with the tap water in each of my two houses!!! I ran gallons of water through the filters and the readings never went down. So I called GE, customer service informed me there was a small chance I could have received 2 defective filters, and I should try to return them to Amazon. I tested the HM water meter on bottled water that is supposed to be very pure, and it was. Arrowhead water is at a \\"marginally safe tap water\\" level. My neighbor's reverse osmosis worked well. (I highly recommend everyone get a water meter...especially if you are putting any kind of trust in these GE filters!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like many others....","review":"I ordered the MWF filter only to receive the International model. My main thought is internationally, they dont have the same safety guidelines as we do in the US. When I received the order, it was nothing more than the product box with a mail sticker on it. The box was covered in typical shipping tape. I also noticed there were no instructions or product details inside the box either. I know this feedback form is for products only but others thinking of ordering this should be hesitant since so many have had problems recently. I have emailed the company about receiving a full refund, as well as reporting them to Amazon. It is unlawful to advertise one thing and ship another... borderline on fraud. I would not use any product that's labeled \\"For International Use Only\\". I smell counterfeit here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Former Appl.

Make sure that you fill any filter with water BEFORE mounting it in the fridge. If you don't, the filter will still eventually work, but the lines in the fridge will be under stress as the filter fills and air gets pushed through the system.

And when I removed the filter I bought from A-1 Appliance Parts it had rusty liquid in it to boot! The original filter never had that! Lesson learned the hard way - there are just some things you don't buy from scumbags on Amazon. There is no doubt in my mind that something was wrong with that filter and the seller knew about it.

Plus, the green label international version is usually cheaper than the blue label US version, but the Amazon price was for the higher cost blue label. I returned my order.

Hard to do when your shipment is merely slapping a mailing sticker on the actual product box!

A dull Frenchman discovers one day the unexpected presence of a pigeon in front of the small roomm he inhabits. This minuscule and seemingly irrelevant event adopts terrifying proportions in the mind of the man, becoming a grotesque nightmare.As a master of allusion and obsession, Suskind reveals once more, in this parable of everyday life, his gift for building a metaphor of the existential background of humans. It shows that our life usually holds to rutines so fragile, that a simple disturbance may force us to rethink everything from the start. It is a short book, but an intriguing and absurd tale. The absurd, seems to say Suskind, is present in the most simple things that happen every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"an examination of the fine line between sanity and insanity","review":"The Pigeon is a novella describing the life of an extraordinarily dull Frenchman who wants nothing more out of life than to retire quietly without ever having to live really. He glorifies his reclusive behaviour, and is extremely set in his ways. However his life is completely turned upside-down by a chance encounter with a pigeon. A plain ol' pigeon! Sounds silly? Well, Suskind presents this story in a very careful, controlled fashion. He effectively, and tersely, describes how someone who is \\"living on the edge\\" psychologically can simply unravel. I thought the story was most compelling, not silly. Readers of Suskind's more famous work, Perfume, will enjoy The Pigeon.My only gripe with The Pigeon is its packaging. It's really a novella or short story, not a novel. And as such I hope the publishers might consider including other Suskind short stories, which are seemingly unknown in the English-speaking world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surreal","review":"Reminded me of Edgar Allen Poe's \\"The Raven\\", but this grim tale had a more optimistic resolution.

The life of this character is very banal, but the author make us feel this banal life and even appreciate it which is absolutely incredible.

I don't own a lot of surf or rockabilly cd's, and I don't give anything 5 stars unless I'm still playing it 5 years later, but I can see playing this one as much as my Dick Dale and Cramps albums -- which is all the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, nearly 10 years later...","review":"I'm listening to this album for the first time in years. Theoretically I should love this because (a) It's surf rock played by girls, (b)They dress like monsters and (c) They cover Cheap Trick, but sadly it's mostly cornball. Some nice little Man or Astroman style instrumentals are ruined by the \\"Woo-Hoos\\" and \\"Yeah Babys\\" they shout over top. Don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy Girls Kick A$$","review":"The Famous Monsters are a great combination of surf music, horror movies, and 80's retro outfits.

Well, I got more than I bargained for, in a good way! 'Not My Bowl of Rice' not only is a wonderful Filipino/Asian recipe book, it is also a page-turner of a tale of Ligaya- the main character- who took me on a beautiful and hilarious odyssey from her Filipino homeland to New Jersey to New York and to the San Francisco Bay Area. Along the way, I met her wacky relatives and friends and felt the joy and pain with Ligaya of each situation she faces as her life unfolds on becoming an American citizen. A very good read indeed!

It's the rare type of book that you pick up to thumb through and soon find yourself many laughs and tears later reading the last page. The main character, Ligaya, is a Filipina who travels to America to join her mother and to pursue a new life in the \\"land of milk and honey\\". The encounters she has along the way and during her journey through America's landscape of corporations, relations, and life in general are told so engagingly, so hilariously that you can't put the book down even though you should really be putting on the pot roast for dinner. And as an added bonus, there are succulent Filipino recipes at the end of every chapter! Though I was never introduced to Filipino cuisine prior to this book, I was motivated to try a couple and they were true \\"people-pleasers\\" in my circle of friends. I can't wait for this author's next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Halo-Halo Treat","review":"The author throws together a strangely tasty mixture (halo-halo) of ingredients and comes up with a book unlike any I've ever read. Escober combines melodrama and recipes, culture shock and eccentric characters, to create this strangely likable read. Although at times I was disappointed by the lack of real emotion (where is the true sense of grief when tragedy occurs?), I also appreciated the interesting characters and plot. This book taught me a lot about my parents' culture and gave me some delicious looking recipes to try.

My tri-lingual children have a hard enough time differentiating and isolating Standard English words, so I generally avoid Suess.The volume is a rare welcome exception (there are a few Suessisms) and is an excellent book for first readers.The story is plain, with the major intention of teaching your child to *read* his or her first words in English (in this case the word is \\"up\\").But Quentin Blake's illustrations are superb and worth the price of the volume alone.The conclusion is a bit silly, and has a rather lazy aspect to it that parents need to guide their children on (no, it isn't okay to sleep in bed all day like the boy in the story, this is just a silly book\\"), but mostly this is unobjectionable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childrens' Books","review":"I loved this book as a child so I purchased it for my God Son, it's in amazing condition.

You won't find any touchy-feely birth stories here. Simply put, it is a reference tool that you can use in case of an unforeseen complication during childbirth. It is laid out in an organized way and tells you what to do if you run into the most common birth complications - excessive bleeding, baby not breathing, cord prolapse, etc.If you are considering a home birth, get this book and take an infant CPR class. Even if you plan on doing a hospital birth, this book is worthwhile. Why? because it is nice having the peace of mind to know how to handle problems yourself. It is the responsible adult thing to do. Chances are, you will not need the information presented in this book because natural births have fewer complications. However, it is good material to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource...","review":"A must read for expecting parents and just people in general that may find themselves attending a birth they never intended on.

Far from it. It is a fictionalized biopic of Diana Oughton, an early member/leader of the Weather Underground. It is pretty well made for a 70s TV movie, and, with the exception of the end, is fairly accurate. Many of the events depicted in the film are taken directly from Diana's life. It is well worth seeing for anyone interested in the Weathermen or simply the radical student movements of the 60s and 70s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story Idea, An Average Script, Great Acting","review":"This is an example of a movie that has an average script but is saved by the acting. Not only Sissy Spacek, who can elevate any script, but also Art Carney and Jane Wyatt of TV's \\"Father Knows Best\\" fame make it a moving film experience. It could have been a self-pitying liberal mess but is actually a pretty good examination of what happened to make some American upper middle class white kids become America-hating anarchist bombers in the 1960s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made-For-TV movie about the Weather Underground, featuring The Fonz","review":"This should be interesting to anyone who has a decent understanding of what REALLY went down with the Weather Underground and revolutionary struggle in the late 1906s & early 1970s. This, apparently made-for-TV drama, clearly blends events revolving around a number of different individuals into a single character (some Weatherwomen in particular, which is being implied with the title of the movie). It surprisingly does a pretty thorough job at briefly explaining a number of the political concepts and evolutions that many experienced during those years of struggle. But don't be mistaken, this is a B-movie by any definition (although the Fonz honestly shows some acting ability in here, which was a highlight). While I personally enjoyed this, I would surely not substitute it for any real historical information.. especially the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & White","review":"I little different review. Katherine was a good TV movie back in the 70's. Showed the progression of a do-gooder truly trying to help the world turning into a radical who didn't mind blowing up the world. So many people went down that road. In the end, I felt more sorrow for Katherine's family than for Katherine. She chose her own path. Anyway, I bought the Katherine DVD and received a movie in black and white. Katherine was originally in color back in the 70's, and Katherine is supposed to be in color according to the DVD case. Anyone else have this problem? Amazon gave me a refund so money isn't the issue. I'm just afraid that if I buy the Katherine DVD again, the same thing will happen and I won't get a refund this time.

Not only reading it but fighting over whose turn it was to read.Mrs. Auch recreates the trials of the immigrants who built our country. It is difficult to imagine what it would be like to move to another country and start all over. But this book gives some insight into the difficulties of finding work. The ease with which young immigrants were taken advantage of; in many ways. The importance of finding friends who could guide the newcomers. The reader feels they are a part of life at the turn of the century with all its tribulations and triumphs. Although directed at juvenile readers it is a great adult read and one that would make for good discussions with children or grand children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powertful, moving and intelligent","review":"The novel \\"Ashes of Roses\\" is a powerful, moving and intelligent book. I highly recommend it for all ages. The story is based in the Nolan family who travels from the streets of Limrick, Ireland. They take a boat trip to \\"The Streets of Gold\\" in New York. Once the family of six (Michael Nolan, Father, Margaret Nolan-Mother, Margaret Rose Nolan- Oldest sister 16, Maureen Nolan- middle sister 12, Bridget Nolan- Youngest sister 4, and Joseph Nolan- young infant (brother) are about to enter America, Joseph gets sick with an eye disease which prevents his entry into America. Michael chose to return to Ireland with Joseph, while Margaret, Rose, Maureen and Bridget find their way through America. Throughout the story, the author Mary Jane Auch is very precise with the Irish and Yiddish accents. The book really helped me understand and connect with the characters learning about the hard life to live in America. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read. Definitely recommend it.","review":"This book is the story of the 16 year old girl; Margaret Rose, who goes by \\"Rose\\".

As the story progresses, Rose ends up working at a shirtwaist factory and living in an apartment with her younger sister Maureen. The girls struggle with school, work, and money but they make the best of it. A very important and large part of this book is the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire that occurred in 1911. Near the end of the story Rose is forced to deal with the fire and the loss of many of her friends. This book is a wonderful read and will have you hooked from the very first page. I definitely recommend this.

Lately, children's quilts have become something more than simple bed-coverings. Kristin Addison, living in her native Norway with twin daughters, was faced with their fears of polar bears when they moved to a new town. Not a normal fear for those of us in more southern climes, but it inspired Kristin to make a quilt embellished with toys and soft-sculptures that helped the girls act out and overcome their fears. Thus the first of her \\"play quilts\\" was born, and the rest is this book. Combining quilts with simple doll-making techniques, these projects are great fun to make and then continue to give joy through their playful interactive qualities.

I kept expecting that the rich people would turn out to be cannibals, or witches, or vampires; anything for a plot twist - 'cause I was wondering why one review said it was interesting that they would invite him & his mate over.Sadly, they were just a bunch of lame rich kids who wanted 'a bit of rough' to play with (that is; someone from the gutter to amuse them for a while).

I figured the good guys would end up winning out in the end and maybe the ending would be okay, but by the time I stopped the movie, I just didn't care and wanted to watch something else.Bottom line, if you love plotless movies, violence and nudity, go for it.

Wrong Genre.","review":"I rented this movie thinking it was going to be a horror flick. From the description, it doesn't sound too bad. It sounds pretty exciting. The real thing? Kind of a disaster. From the very beginning featuring a rape scene, I began thinking to myself, what am I watching? It definitely didn't get any better from there.It managed to be somewhat entertaining, but at the expense of unnecessary nudity and fake violence. The only reason I kept watching was to see the ending. They tried to salvage it with this big revelation, that really didn't make much sense at all either way. If interested in this movie, just keep in mind - it's not horror. I don't even know what it is, and I'm still asking myself what I just saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"A generous two stars....","review":"I felt the ending was totally implausible but then again, one has to look at the audience this film appeals to. Rather than dwell on the shortcomings or good points of the movie, if one likes this type of movie a better choice would be Blaise Moi which is equally or more so violent but pehaps more satisfying as to quality. A superior movie would be Butterfly Kiss along the lines of Thelma and Louise.For 'The House....' I really could not buy into the characters or their actions. For the special features, unless there is a change futher into the segment, the interview with the director is only in Italian, without subtitles. I found the DVD to be a disappointing movie.

Alex soon learns from the woman that there is a small party going on and he invites himself and Ricky. At the house, a group of people want to humiliate the two men who crashed the party. Alex catches on to this fact and that is where the film slowly turns into something worth watching. The movie is slow paced, predictable, and tame compared to what alot of reviewers said about the film. Alex is worth watching as Ricky is just a tag along and really doesnt add much to the film but a stupid laugh. I wouldn't really recommend this movie to many people. The only cool thing about the movie was the awesome cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lesser Stewart, But Still Quite Good","review":"While Mary Stewart doesn't think much of this book, it still is a fairly well-written and enjoyable one, I found it to be a quick read. Stewart rarely writes in the third person, so in this way the book was an interesting departure. She also describes not only suspense and romance but she has a clear love of landscape as well as flora and fauna. I could almost picture the French countryside and visualize the Pyrenees mountains. It's a romantic suspense novel, meant for entertainment and enjoyment, and that's exactly what it offers. Of course, if you're not used to very descriptive writers you may find her books hard to get into, but believe me, they are worth it. Jennifer Silver is a young, naive but not unappealing heroine and Stephen Masefield is an adequate hero. And the mystery of what happened to Jenny's cousin Gillian is quite intriguing.

No one figured out where the film was going or what it was about. They just filmed it. Sime nice colors, some fair (for HK movies) action sequences, nice camera angles. And talk like you're overhearing a bunch of random telephone conversations. A dish of Chinese noodles is far more coherent than the strands of this movie. And yet, we should encourage these Hong Kong types to make more movies in the US. They do bring a nice perspective. So far, it seems that the lavish Hollywood budgets have corrupted these movies. The high budget certainly seems to have corrupted THE CORRUPTOR. We have to get back to basics, i.e., a good screenplay. Once you have that, bring in the Hong Kong stars and directors. Bring in Chingmy Yau, while you're at it. Bottom line: (and I hate to say this on Amazon) you'd be better off renting this movie than buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good features Poor film!","review":"It's a shame that some other distributors dont take a leaf out of this book for features, better films than this could benifit from having such great features.

Chow Yun-Fat is the worst actor. Tell OJ Simpson to see this movie or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honestly, one of Chow Yun Fat's finest acting jobs.","review":"I was really surprised at how good this film was. Chow Yun Fat was absolutely mesmerizing. Both he and Mark Wahlbergh create an unexpected chemistry between their two characters. This is a lot more restrained in the action department than the usual John Woo directed gun fest, but it's actually a welcome respite from the cartoonish violence in most of Fat's films. Robert Foley, the director, struck a good balance: There is enough action and acrobatics to satisfy most HK action fans, while a strong plot and good performances round out the rest of the film.This is a good American crossover for Fat's cool charisma and tragic hero character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chow is the Man!","review":"Chow Yun Fat is awesome in 'The Corruptor'.

Instead, what I received was a very good story with average cinematography and hardly any Hong Kong killings!The key to this movie is the relationship between the two leads, and this comes across rather well, despite the aprehension of Marky Mark being in there. He does himself proud, but C-Y Fat drops a peg or two on the action ladder.The film is not your average shoot-em-up, nor is it your average thriller. It fails on both counts, think Internal Affairs meets Showdown in Little Tokyo, without the best bits of either.Though I'd like to give it more, it failed to capture the imagination, and countering that, it failed to provide enough bullets for a Terminator 2 type rating.Avoid it if you want Hong Kong action, buy it if you like the actors and want to relax with a passable plot, backed up by a weak cast."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"Another relatively bad American action movie assisted soley by the presence of Chow-Yun Fat. To its credit, it is better than the Replacement Killers; as uncondonable as Mark Wahlberg is, he is much easier to take than Mira Sorvino. Additionally, the story in this one is a touch more interesting, though the buddy-cop aesthetic, action sequences, and just about everything else, were all done ten times better in Chow's Hong Kong films. It's a pity to see his charisma and talent wasted in all of this b-grade American tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes wre shot down","review":"I had high hopes for The Corruptor as I thought a movie with Yun-Fat and Walhberg would be decent but I was wrong. The direction by James Foley is very slow paced and the action seqeunces are long and drawn out. I say if you're a die hard fan of Yun-Fat check this out other wise avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character development and continous action!","review":"The Corruptor is a film in which Mark Wahlberg and Chow Yun Fat try to keep the streets of Chinatown safe from Asian Gang Members that open fire on the streets and enforce prosititution. The plot does seem a little off, but the character devleopment in Wahlberg and Chow make this film wothwhile. The action scenes start off pretty good, but then fade off after hearing those gunshots atleast 700 times! Yet, this film has that special bit od something (devleopment) which makes this one of the best action flicks of the year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IMAGINATIVE AND DIFFERENT","review":"The special features on this dvd are great.

The most instersting points made were the indications that groups of people working and harmonizing for specific tasks ie; helping others, healing and cleansing others - mentally. physically and spiritually, can indeed succeed. This might seem odd to the readers unfamiliar with this series, while the readers and believers of the first book in this series, will see the revelation that groups have the ability to generate and observe more energy than a single individual.

When I heard of The Tenth Insight I felt it was a good time to read a second fiction book. However I was truly disillusioned. I tried twice to read the book. I eventually got half way through the book. I could not understand the book. I tried it twice. I got nothing out of it! I read an average of 45 minutes every morning at 5 to 6am.

I believe in reincarnation, but nothing like he describes it. Frequently in the book the characters remember their past lives and the relationships they each had with each other, and problems of the past being acted upon today.The one clincher that really got me was when one character suggests all suppliers reduce their prices 10%, and this would cure inflation.

Did something happen to Redfield between writing these 2 books? Most of the first book is very believable and enlightening, but the second is a complete whirlwind of nuttiness and mostly, in my opinion, totally over the top. I found myself skipping page upon page of rambling. Very weird, and a little disappointing really!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point?","review":"I read the Celestine Prophecy and enjoyed it and felt I had received some new insights that could help me. But this book, The Tenth Insight, left me totally bewildered. It is probably the most confusing book I have ever read. If you want to understand \`soul families', Ramon Stevens in his Alexander books, does a much better and clearer job.

The Tenth Insight takes the metamorphosis of humanity to a new level of idiocy--where people \\"centered\\" enough can actually cross over to the Afterlife, seeing what others are hoping to make of their lives before they are reincarnated, and how humanity will achieve this awakaning through love.Somewhere between page one and the end, this book starts weak, and then collapses upon itself in a rather agonizingly slow process.Save your money, stick to The Celestine Prophecey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me!","review":"I will admit-I bought in to the hype surrounding The Celestine Prophecy.

Thinking the second would be another quick and easy adventure read, I picked it up. Completely unreadable, full of badly written hallucinogenic passages that wouldn't pass muster in a standard trippy 1960's psychedelic film like The Trip or Psych-Out.

As well as delving into the complexities of the tenth insight: remembering the birth vision, overcoming the fear, taking responsibility to the future of humankind, environmental consciousness, promoting the eventual world vision. This time the adventure takes you to the Native American landscape in Southwestern U.S.The author does not exclusively promote one religion as previously introduced in the prior book, but instead considers them all: Muslim, Jewish, Christianity, Eastern beliefs. While ingeniously intermingling science. And just like the prior, this book also breaks down the barriers set up by society/religion/environmental/cultural factors imposed on us since birth, sheds light on the purpose of our true selves and opens the portal to the realization of our fullest potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk Yuk Yuk: A Parable for the Masses or Condecension?","review":"While \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" struck the imagination and ingnited the dormant spirits of millions, \\"The Tenth Insight\\" (also known by me as \\"The Cure For Insomnia\\") condecends its readers with its high school reading level prose and thoroughly untenable unfolding events. Redfield stretches the concept of \\"suspension of disbelief\\" beyond the acceptable level. He couldn't even \\"suspend the incredulous\\" in this one.

James Redfield has an amaing awakening that will enlighten the human race.I love the way my outlook has opened up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's a fun game for the folks who liked this book:","review":"Look through the entire book and see if you can find a metaphor. I only read the first 23 pages, but I figured that if I didn't see one by then, the metaphor would be as hard to find as a sober college student at the homecoming tailgate party. That a novel so devoid of LITERARY INSIGHT can live on the bestseller rack for months should tell us how much we missed in high school English class. -J. A. Kemp, Jr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello? you ...","review":"I think this is a very strong set from Robyn. I don't understand why anyone would complain about it - unless they simply don't like Robyn Hitchcock in which case I say, \\"Buzz off! go listen to something you do like and leave behind what you obviously don't get.\\" Of course, everyone's entitled to their 2 cents, but come on, this is a cool album that even includes classic off-the-wall Hitchcock banter. He shreds on \\"Glass Hotel\\" and the Hendrix cover (I've never heard a cover of \\"Wind Cries Mary\\" before) is very cool, too.What I think is a real shame is that Amazon.com is not selling my favorite album he did with the Egyptians: QUEEN ELVIS. Not the most popular one, but it oozes creativity with some very impressionistic, evocative and bizarre songs. I wonder about Hitchcock fans who don't like this one, or STOREFRONT HITCHCOCK for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"completists only - the DVD is way better","review":"Last week I downloaded 12 Robyn Hitchcock concerts. This album is better than some and not as good as others. I love the video, but without the visuals, it's just a middling Robyn concert.I needed this for the three (3) non-DVD cuts \\"Where Do You Go When You Die\\", \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" and \\"Beautiful Queen\\". None of them are great. If you're new to Hitchcock, rent the DVD or get (the reasonably priced, sonicly pleasing) Jewels For Sophia instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little known murder mystery","review":"After finding an old newspaper article with the Halls-Mills murder splashed across the front page, I took an interest in what actually occurred and who the players in the mystery were. Finding this book put a lot into perspective. The people involved, where they came from, who they were, and the links between each, are nicely brought together by the author (who has done his research thoroughly). This is not a new book, but the story will hold the readers interest, as if the events happened today. Kunstler probes the suspects as any good trial lawyer would, and he gets his answers through fine examination of each. The reader is made to be a member of the jury, from the individual's involved, to the crime scene and beyond -- you decide who's guilty and who's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muscles Testing and Function","review":"Good book with a lot of great info on testing. Great for therapist, pt or athletic trainers."},{"rating":"1","title":"My very least favorite Nora Roberts Book","review":"I waited a long time to review this book. I didn't really like this book.I can usually say that even Nora Roberts weakest books are better than some of the better books of other authors. However, I was very dissapointed with this book. I found it to be very depressing. I had a hard time reading it and almost put it down without finishing it.I am sure that there others who will disagree with me. I just found that this book was just a bit too much on the dark side for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Nora Roberts I did not like.","review":"This is the only Nora Roberts book that I have actively disliked. I hated the ending. For me if a book about good and evil ends without evil being defeated then it is a very lousy book. I read romance so I can feel good when I close the book. When I closed this one good was definitely not what I was feeling. Yes the smaller evil was defeated, but the greater evil survived and the book's heroes were left ignorant of that fact. Hated the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Normally I dont' like darker books like this, but I enjoyed reading this book overall. I definetely had to get through it so I knew what happened, but the end is a twist, it's strange but okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this re-released?","review":"In a word, bleech, terrible story. Gratuitous violence, sadistic scenes, beleaguered hero at every turn who is stuck with the most irritating heroine I've run across in a long time - snippy know-it-all who acts like a 12-year-old most of the time. By the time she was captured I thought good, glad to see her go. With all the fantastic stories Nora Roberts has written, why oh why was this foisted off on the public as a re-release?! Truly, IMO it's an embarrassment both to the author and the reader who is disgruntled at themselves for finishing the darn thing. It should have had its first and last printing in 1992. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora Roberts' Best","review":"I thought this was one of Nora Roberts' best novels so far. It had the perfect balance of romance and suspense, and all the details were so vivid that I felt I was right there with all the characters. The ending was a complete surprise; not what I expected at all. I was totally engrossed in this book from the time I opened it up until the time I finished the last page. If you only read one Nora Roberts book, make it this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Example of Robert's Skills","review":"I have read most of Nora Roberts books at this time. This book however is a very poor example of her skill. It is much deeply evil and uncomfortably graphic. It has a strange aura of the occult which does not fit into her usually great stories and personal relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this graphic portrayal of satanism","review":"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan and eagerly await each of her books. However, I was extremely disappointed in this book. The love story was secondary to the primary focus on death, graphic violence, senseless murders, and satanic ritual. The characters of Clare and Cam were never fully developed. The purpose of the Ernie character was predictable from the very beginning.I much prefer Nora's \\"lighter\\" treatments of witchcraft, as depicted in the Three Sisters Trilogoy. Even the sometimes too realistic Eve Dallas stories pale in comparison to this book. A true disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bloody","review":"This story went a little beyond the typical Nora Roberts crime/romance story. And though I loved it, it was quite bloody and grotesque at times.Kudos to N.R. for melding the genres of romance and thriller. It makes for such interesting plot lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most Intense Roberts Books","review":"If you like romantic suspense, you'll love this book. The romance is good -- two strong people who fight their commitment fears together.But the suspense in the book is even better -- and the villians are ones you don't expect. And while the romance wraps up just like you'd expect, the suspenseful part of the book will leaving you gaping as you read the last page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"well written and excellent balance","review":"Me, myself, and I loved this book. A lot of Nora's books are well written as this but this was an excellent find.... I am a sucker for the murder/suspense/ hero plot and this was one that got me from the get go. As in a previous review those who are quick readers may not want to read before bed time because it can and will make you shiver and make you dream. Nora's hand at suspense did well this time. You may be able to figure some of the details out but you won't be entirely sure until they are totally revealed. An excellent read for the reader of suspense and terror with a dash of hot loving and vivid emotions in the mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing book","review":"I honestly had to look twice to make sure this was a Nora Roberts book. I have been reading her books for years but this in one I cannot finish. It's way too graphic and not a romance at all. If I had wanted to read a cult book, I would have looked in that section in the bookstore. I'm very disappointed in this book but I will keep reading Nora Roberts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heads Up","review":"People, please. It's very simple to be able to tell a reissue from a new book. OPEN IT AND CHECK THE PUBLISHING DATE!! I'm so sick of people whining about books not being brand new, when they don't even bother to open the book and look. Also, all of Nora's new novels have her logo and the \\"First Time in Print\\" plastered on the cover. There you go. No more reason to complain and give a book one star because it's a reissue and you feel hosed."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I thought Nora Roberts' DIVINE EVIL was very well written. It was one of the best books I've read lately. Roberts' writing style is awesome and her characters are very complex and dark. Jean-Paul Le Beau is definitely one of my favorite characters as is his wife, Angie. The two are so sarcastic and I love that. Cam Rafferty is by far my favorite hero. The rebel turned sheriff of a sleepy little town who finally gets the girl he's loved for a long time. This book is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird","review":"I love all of Nora Roberts books but this book was really weird. I loved the suspense in the book and the ending was a surpriese but this is one of her books that I thought was just way to grotesque for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"More graphic violence than love scenes.","review":"This was a tremendous disappointment to a Nora Roberts fan since Irish Thoroughbred. There was no need at all for any of the dreadfully graphic brutality. Friends who are also Nora Roberts fans feel the same way. If it were possible, I'd want my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Interesting characters and dark plot with surprising twist ending. Roberts lives up to her well deserved reputation as an author."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A ROMANCE!!","review":"I would actually give this book two different ratings as a horror/suspense a 4. As a romance a 1.This book should NEVER be categorized as a romance. One problem with this book is that I wanted to read a character driven romance and ended up with a Stephen King horror. I also felt that this book ended abruptly, there was no closure. How did the town feel afterward, what happened to the cult worshipers, etc.This book was difficult and disturbing read. I don't recommend that you read it before bedtime. I generally am not that disturbed by what I read, but I definately did not sleep well the night I finished this book.Be warned not your typical Nora Roberts romance. If you are bothered by the occult and graphic violence pass this by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get This Book Out of My House!","review":"I have been reading Nora Roberts for years now, and I came across \\"Divine Evil\\" for the first time last week. The subject matter seemed to be just like many of Roberts' novels, with a tale of romance intertwined with a tale of trial, heartbreak and action. Only, once I got into this book, my opinion changed. All in all, this book creeped me out. I don't know if Roberts was going through some cult phase or whatever, but this book was certainly not like any of the others she has written. If you are a person who is not bothered when reading about sexual rites and animal sacrifices, then go ahead and read it. Otherwise, stick to Roberts softer stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Graphic!!!!","review":"Normally I love Nora Roberts, but this time the graphic violence and demonic worship went too far. I'm not into censorship and normally have a strong stomach but there were pages I had to skip over because it was just too much! I hate reading about this sort of thing in the paper let alone in something I am reading for entertainment. I would not reccomend this book to anyone. Normally I buy Nora's books and circulate them to my friends and family but this one I had to throw away. It just felt too evil. I didn't even want it around. I am not saying ban the book or anything, but be aware before you read it that it isn't Nora's typical style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This is the worst Nora Roberts book I have ever read. Pure trash. No real plot, satan worship, and what romance there is in the book is unrealistic. Real waste of my money, and a bigger waste of my time. I have read every book Nora Roberts has written and I own most of them, but this is just ... awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Evil","review":"If I could give this book a - rating I would do so. Why in heavens name would Nora Roberts decide to write a mystery/romance novel and include satanism. I found the book way too disturbing from the first page. This is something Steven King would write, not Nora Roberts. If you buy this book expecting a romance/mystery forget it. The whole story line was not only disturbing, but just farfetched for me to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Nora Roberts I have ever not finished","review":"This is the very first Nora Roberts book I could not be bothered to finish and I put it down after page 89. I have read aout 90% of her books even the JD Robb ones, but this one was terrible. I loved her books about he Concannons, the Quinn brothers and so many more but lately it seems that lots of her books are about women/children being raped and I must say it sickens me some, also I am getting a bit tired of all the demons, satanism etc scenarios. So no, all in all, not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bypass this one","review":"Nora Roberts is a great writer and I have loved every book of hers that I have ever read... EXCEPT THIS ONE! As has been noted, there was no counter-balance of good with evil by having the intervention or even the advice of a clergyman. The book was entirely too dark and some of the scenes were downright horrifying. Nora, was it really necessary to show the rape, murder, and human sacrifice of a 15 yr. old girl, at all, much less in all its gory detail??? Was it really necessary to explain in the end that good DIDN'T ultimately triumph over evil in this story??? I skipped through parts of this book because there was only so much of it I could take and I have never skipped through Nora's books before.If you've read this book, toss it into the trash. If you haven't read it yet, don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of other Nora Roberts' books to enjoy... bypass this one -- Nora's one failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made me stupider","review":"I love genre fiction, but I usually avoid the Romance genre because of its cliches. Maybe Nora Roberts fans will like this book. John Saul fans might also like it. Personally, I found everything about it to be simplistic and downright idiotic.The bad guys--Satan worshippers--fill every cliche and leave nothing original. They even call for Jesus when they die from stupidity. The main character, Clare, is a modest, rich, supermodel artist. Very realistic. The love interest, Cam, is a modest, rich, supermodel sheriff. Uh huh. Their chemistry together is a series of cliches taken from 80s movies. You know, I'm all for a dash of romance in a book, but please make it believable. I feel as if Nora Roberts is following a formula that made her successful long ago, in the 1970s or 80s, and no longer works for people who pay attention to modern TV, film, and books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gordon McRae and Jo Stafford","review":"Great recording artists and worth a listen.

It is 8.25\\" tall, 5.75\\" wide and over 1\\" thick. This is bigger than a paperback and too big and heavy to carry to a nice restaurant. So far, the lightest weight book that I can find is the Marling Menu-Master for France, 6\\" tall, 4 \\" wide and very lightweight paper.

It's not in the trash yet, but it's close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start","review":"That was exactly what our group was looking for in recent years. Pregenerated Adventures for us to play. We just lack the time to write up our own these days (and we know each other too well).AOM is a solid and good start for any new to RPGs. You will get familiar with the traits of the Old World and some of its factions.The Adventure divided in 7 Section is interesting. We had a lot of fun. Some RPG-Veterans might not like that the adventure is a bit too linear but then again they certainly have a GM who can spice up the whole thing (as did ours).A great start to WFRP V2 and may many adventures follow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Effects don't wear off","review":"This was quite a find for me. It is a nice \\"slice\\" of late 1970's independent film making from alot of George A. Romero's alumni. The other two reviews are very critical of this film and I am not quite sure why?! It is in no way a graphic film like \\"Last House On The Left\\", yet it does give off the same \\"snuff\\" feel with pretty good acting and direction. The soundtrack is great too. Kudos to Synapse for this release.John Harrison who stars in this film also did the music as well as the soundtracks for \\"Creepshow\\" and \\"Day Of The Dead\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze-fest....","review":"\\"Effects\\" is a better idea than it is a movie. The first hour is a group of people rambling about making a horror movie with a lot of drug-use, and nothing really happens except snippets of voyeurism that isn't scary or intersting.The final half hour picks up, but it's predictable. Not a gory movie, but instead a psychological one. If the pacing was better and more events happened in the movie before the final ten minutes, \\"Effects\\" would've been enjoyable, but it was too BORING for me to ever watch again.Curiousity killed me on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncompromising energy","review":"Silent Alarm proves to be just as entertaining as it is politically provocative. The stellar tracks Like Eating Glass & Helicopter are invigorating and clever, but the most memorable tracks for me are most definitely Positive Tension and the bonus track not available on their UK release, Little Thoughts, both of which are incredibly catchy and fun.Kele Okereke's uniquely intense vocal style at times makes one wonder if he's exhausted, out of breath, or just that genuinely enthused about his music. I'll go with the latter. The band's unparalleled energy is refreshing and sorely lacked in much of today's music scene. One heck of a debut. Hats off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not 80's","review":"All the reviews saying this band sounds like they are in the 80's are not true. Their sound definately has alternative roots. I grew up in the 80's and couldn't possibly listen to any more 80's music. But I can listen to Bloc Party."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent record","review":"I've listened to this album enough to say that it is excellent. Sure, there are hints of Gang of Four and Joy Division in their music, but it's all relative. I mean, you can hear My Bloody Valentine and Sonic Youth in Autolux. Great bands often yield great bands. That's how it works. Anyway, this album is a perfect example of balance. Everything is even danceable, haha. So if you love melodic indie rock with a spacey electronic twist, this is for you. Tracks like \\"Positive Tension\\" and \\"Price of Gas\\" are monumental achievements, and work of musical prowess for sure. Even the less intense, \\"So Here We Are\\" and \\"Blue Light\\" are brilliant. Such a cohesive album surely is a contestant for album of the year for many critics, and it also is for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"every track is awesome","review":"I feel Bloc Party was way ahead of it's time. And this is my favorite album of theirs, hands down. There is a somewhat strained energy that pervades all of the songs of here, in an awesome way. The vocals have a sense of urgency while holding back at the same time. There is nothing superficial about the sound, the music, the lyrics. I have no other words so I'll stop here. Well worth the purchase- you get the mp3 version as well as the CD itself. The songs are consistently awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy post-punk","review":"Despite it's mainstream push now in the U.S. This still remains an incredibly solid disc. Bloc Party writes funky, yet incredibly catchy, dancey post-punk. All the comparisons that have been made such as Gang of Four, The Fall, and Interpol are all partially true.I read a review where someone berated everyone for using Interpol as a reference. Bloc Party writes their hooks in the same manner, massive, but not too direct, they just kind of swell until they explode.Some of their lyrical material is lacking, with some teen angst and misguided political pretentiousness. What they lack in that area they make up for in delivery. Their hooks are hummable, but at the same time forgettable. The overall melancholy tone of it all is what makes the disc have this lovable yet pleasantly forgettable mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not the new best thing, but who cares?","review":"I've heard it on the radio, read it on magazines reviews and I don't know what all the fuss is about?It seems that we are always looking for the new \\"greatest band\\", playing a hit and miss kind of game.Bloc Party...good fast, simple, powerful songs. When they slow down the beat a little...still good, simple and catchy.I don't think they go to deep on any subject, but they don't have to; it's just rock music!I enjoyed this one a lot, because when I got it, I really wasn't expecting much from it.It's alright to compare bands, sounds and styles, as long as you get to the core and enjoy each one of them.Buy this one, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have listened harder before buying","review":"I don't like this cd at all.

Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Gonna Use My Teeth And My Clothes.","review":"Bloc Party is one of the more promising new nu wave bands to come out of Britain. Along with The Music, they forge a more original approach to the old genre. \\"Like Eating Glass\\", \\"Helicopter\\", \\"Positive Tension\\", \\"Banquet\\" and \\"Price Of Gas\\" all have great beats and could easily be alternative top hits. The only drawbacks to \\"Silent Alarm\\" are that it is 14 songs, just a touch too long, and also slightly too repetitive. However, had the band shaved it down to 10 tracks, I believe this would have garnered five stars. Less is more gentlemen, less is more. I didn't particularly enjoy \\"She's Hearing Voices\\", \\"Pioneers\\", \\"Luno\\" and \\"Plans\\". However, for a debut, this band knows what they're doing and have a strong sense of what musical direction they're taking. At such a low price, this cd is a steal, and I recommend anyone interested in punk/new wave to check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"another one","review":"I honestly don't think this album is anything special. It has some good musical elements and a fun, energetic overall sound, but that description can fit most bands. They sound alot like Franz-Ferdinand and a handful of other bands. I think they are pretty good myself; I just wish they had tried harder to distinguish themselves from everyone else.The brit critics overrated this album. Americans seem to really admire pretty much anything that comes out of Great Britain musically, so of course once the album was released here it became something you can find for sale at hollister. Don't get Silent Alarm unless you don't really have any idea what's been going on in the music scene in the last decade. Then you might actually like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most Overrated Band Ever","review":"When there's about 8 copies of a CD for sale at your local used CD shop, there's a reason.

No melody No rhythm No hook No idea No creativity. Or you guys are trying to apply some experimental spell just to make it more boring? If this kind of bands are the future of rock, I will exile myself to an tropical island with food and all the classic albums from the last century. They are even more useless than Maroon 5 or Nickelbank, which at least could write sth. to make you remember for about one week with the help of airwave. I really don't know why should we blame those poprock or rockpop talentless drones if our self-seeking rock savior-wannabes make few albums in this 5 years that could be remembered for another 5 years. However, it is not so unbelievable when Coldplay is the on-stage hero, Modest Mouse is the underground hero and U2 is the goddamnfather. What a shame. I give 2 stars for their efforts to make their music more complex and tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-rated","review":"Like a lot of bands this year, espesially UK indie bands, these guys are getting over-rated to an alarming degree.

With a bit of work they might develope into something half decent but their music is below average by my definition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third rate Gang of Four rip off band.","review":"Another band ripping off 80's art rock bands.

If you've ever drank milk, and had that phlegmy coating in the back of your throat that was slow to go away...well just imagine someone singing in that condition. Just a horrible voice; it really mars any possibility of the music itself - which isn't good either - carrying it over to redemption, but it cannot.

It felt like going along with someone who promises to take you to an interesting bar, only to discover that the bar is smelly and full of old drunks. Perhaps that is a requirement of making a story 'realistic' and thus literary, as opposed to a schmaltzy, feel-good Hollywood finish... but the the ending, in which the Jew goes for the beautiful, empty, vacuous girl and forgets all about the little dancer with nothing more than a slight shrug made me want to shrug off this story as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration At It's Best!

Waisting time was one of my favorite albums. It had a cool indy pop punk feal with some ska influence. this is just an emo piece of garbage. its nothing but a bad simple plan imitation and being that simple plan is horrible to begin with well that just makes this that much worse each song is nothing but crying and whining. Who wants to listen to that? If you want to hear a good mest cd i would recomend some of their earlier stuff. Mo' Money Mo' 40's waisting time and destination unknown wasnt bad either but their last 2 cd's have been almost offensivley bad. Unless you enjoy a good tissue fest i would stay away from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"punk bands continue to go down hill","review":"I've listen to Mest for years. They've never really let down on any of their albums.......... until now. This album is bad, but it does have a couple good songs on it. This album sounds alot like another punk band called goldfinger. SURPRISINGLY, the producer of this new Mest album (Photographs) is the lead singer of goldfinger. Wonder why they sound like them now. John Feldman is the singer of goldfinger and has produced all of Mest's albums. Their first two record label releases were great, but things started going down hill with there third and now the fourth is just bad. They need a new producer ASAP. I blame John Feldman for this disapointing goldfinger album, sorry I meant disapointing Mest album. There a talented band in need of a new fantastic producer. Please send your Resume's to Mest as soon as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mest","review":"This Cd is nothing like the last one but it still kicks ass.

I think they are a great band that has gone through a lot. Many of their songs on their previous albums were about partying and girls, but this album really seems to be deep and moving. The lyrics are thought provoking, and I can tell they put their heart, soul, sweat, and blood into this album...it paid off! I predict that Photographs, will make Mest a worldwide sensation, I actually saw a commercial for this album. I have NEVER before that seen a Mest anything on tv. They are great people and they deserve all the success they are sure to get from this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mest - Photographs Review","review":"i bought the cd yesterday, the day it came out, and i havent stopped listening to it. It's such a well put together cd, songs that really stick out for me are: Take Me Away, Kiss Me Kill Me, Graveyard, As His Black Heart Dies, and Nightmare. Those are the songs i consider my favorite on the cd and thats almost half the cd. The rest of the songs are really good too. The DVD is so hilarious, all i gotta say is Nick you are sick lol. But anyway, if you are a true MEST fan you will definately buy this CD/DVD, i promise you will not be disappointed. SO GO BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MEST*MERIZED","review":"Honestly, MEST is personally one of the greatest bands of my time. To see them live is more of a privledge then experience. \\"Photographs\\" is just another prime reason why these guys are still around and doing what we all love them to do with more heart then all of their fan base combined. This album rules, the DVD is sooo damn classic that it alone is even worth the 12.99. Awesome job to all in Mest for never letting me down. see you at the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"... photographs is more than amazing.","review":"what did any of us mest fans expect besides the best? the new album is so awesome, the musical sound is most definately a bit darker than previous albums -- but it's simply amazing. the boys from chicago are obiviously trying out different styles -- and they continue to impress their fans, every single last one of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Growing up and giving in","review":"Mest is one of my favorite bands, in fact, the more I think about it, they are my favorite band. They've been with me for years, so please believe me when I say that I'm cutting them as much slack as one can in this review.Why is it that when bands \\"grow up\\", they appeal to the younger audience of teenie boppers? It seems that the longer a band is around, the poppier their sound becomes. It happened with Green Day, it happened with Blink 182, and now it's happening to Mest.Photographs was a disappointment to me. If you're a real fan, pretend this CD never came out. It will upset you. This isn't the Mest we know and love. Sure, the CD would be wonderful if it was someone else, but when you have all the previous CDs, Photographs is nothing in comparison.However, if you're new to Mest, and if you're thirteen or fourteen, go ahead.

The catchy lyrics got me singing along to songs I had never heard before, while the alternative pop beats reminded me of bands like Blink 182 and the Deftones. Yet, the overplayed tortured and lonely theme, that of photographs from an ending relationship, grew tiresome. By the time I got to the title track, I just wanted the album to end.

Simple as that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity takes over","review":"If you are a fan of Mest's older cd's the I would suggest not getting this one. There are no fast songs.

The fact that all the phrases are positive, I see as a good thing because I feel it's important to have a positive attitude toward the associate you're reviewing. If there are challenges in the persons performance, the manager should have been working with the associate on that throughout the review period. I would recommend this book but only as a way to inspire the person writing a review to come up with their own way of phrasing... rather than use the phrases in the book.

You'll love this disc. This album is for everyone,it's the hottness."},{"rating":"2","title":"well....i don't know about this one","review":"This cd is great to dance to, but there is just so much of the same beat and themes. I wish that Britney could have talked about things other than sex. She is such a huge role model that when all she talks about is sex and breakups, it kind of sends out the wrong message... so, for some, the record is a good time, but for others, I would pick something else like india. arie, or eamon, or even missy elliot.

I would definatly recommend this cd!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disregard the Haters!","review":"This album is truly fantastic and it's filled to the brim with catchy, fun pop music! It's by far Britney's most consistent album and I can easily listen to it without skipping a single track. My favorites include Breathe on Me, Toxic, and Touch of My Hand. I never imagined Britney would ever make quality songs such as these, but I was definitely proven wrong! I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys pop music because it's simply the best of its genre, bar none! There's no comparing this album to any of Britney's previous work or any recent pop albums, it's just that good! Pick this up without any hesitation!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best cd of 2004","review":"here is my review1-me against the music -8/10 its a good dance to song2-i got that boom boom -4/10-its not her music3-showdown-10/104-breathe on me -10/105-early morning -9/106-toxic-10/107-outrageous-10/108-touch of my hand -8/109-the hook up 1/10-it sucked what is this10-shadow-100/10011-brave new girl-10/10 its a good song (pop song)12-everytime -10/10-this si the song she wrote for justin12-the remix to track one (7/10)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"\\"In the Zone\\" is undoubtedly the best pop album released in the past several years! I was never much of a fan of Britney in the past, but she definitely gained my respect with this release! Most pop albums that are released suffer from monotony and overproduction, but ITZ has neither of these problems. The quality of songs are excellent and, more importantly, they are each incredibly different from one another. I have listened to this CD countless times and it never gets boring for this reason. Every track has something different to offer the listener and every possible taste in music is satisfied. Britney's voice is extremely well-suited to every song and she sounds better than ever! I've gotta give her major props for this album and, to those who aren't, you clearly haven't listened to it!! I strongly suggest you pick up this album even if you're not a fan of Britney. You won't be dissapointed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just sad!","review":"Britney Spears is a horrendus attempt at a musician. She doesn't write her own music and she has a terrible voice. The only reason any guys would like her is because she has got a hot body. That is the point of all her videos. Her PLASTIC body. Anyway, this stuff stinks and if you want to stay sane, then don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just be honest... it's worth NOTHING!!!","review":"I realize that this kind of music can be catchy and misleading, especially when the production is quite good. It may sounds like something totally new but it's still \\"pop\\" - nothing really ambitious or interesting. What's this message all about? Is there any message at all? I don't think so...Before you buy this CD, just think how much you could kick yourselves. Maybe not now, but someday - when you discover something much more valuable than this \\"ooops\\" stuff... And then you will feel cheated and frustrated.You may buy a different CD instead - like U2 or R.E.M. (it sounds pleasantly but it's still ambitious)... or just give your money for charity... It will be much more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney's best album","review":"Britney's current album of \\"In the zone\\" is the best compilation of songs she has ever released. It has a variety of different styles of music that everybody would enjoy. It is definitely different from the music she had in the past and everybody should give this album a chance. I am sure that you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally","review":"This is the only Britney Spears album even worth buying. The songs are awesome to dance to and she seems to have found her place in the dance music and has thankfully gotten past the simple pop music. This style seems to suit her better and its not as much directed toward the teeny boppers as her other albums, so it seems to work better with her not so clean image. Toxic, Me Against the Music remix, the Hook Up, and Breathe on Me are my favorites from the cd. If you're ready to party and be moved to shake your *groove thang* then this is the cd for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was/is she thinking or is she?","review":"Her antics lately have ruined her music for me. I can't even listen to this album because I don't like the two songs that have been released on the radio. They sound like Minnesota music from the 80's. What was/is she thinking or is she?I received this CD as a Christmas gift but will be returning it unopened because she has just gone too far lately. Is this a good role model for our young girls? Haven't they got enough to deal with in every day life without having someone who is out of touch with reality being displayed as a role model? She's trying to be Madonna and certainly cannot fill those shoes because they haven't been vacated yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Horrid","review":"Gee, what can i say? this is probably the worst cd i've ever heard. it's even worse than any other britney spears (which is really horrible already). i don't know how you people can listen to this trash... i'd give it zero stars if possible... hell, i'd give it negetave 1 million if possible... well don't waste your money on this trash. all copies of this should be contained in nuclear safe landfills to avoid radiation poisoning... anyhow, britney spears is a sad, horrible excuse for a musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't even need to touch me, baby..","review":"Why people review albums without listening, I do not know. Anyway, In The Zone is definately my favourite Britney album to date, all the songs are good in their own ways and the album contains so much variety. You've got chilled out vocals and melodies with tracks such as Early Mornin, excellent and seductive vocals on Breathe on Me plus dance til you drop tunes like Outrageous, MATM and Toxic.There's something for everyone on this album, just go out and buy it, you're bound to find something you like :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's over for Britney","review":"Yes, this album has some catchy club singles, but it's too risque for radio. Britney seems to perform less and less with each CD. Besides 'Everytime', which is not her best vocal work, Britney is constantly drowned by background vocals. Some of these songs sound like the girl bands you hear on the Disney Channel, but with adult lyrics.And on the topic of lyrics, if this is Britney's \\"coming of age\\" disc, then she's coming into being a tramp. Even my 10 year daughter thinks Britney has become a cheap sell-out. Since when does coming of age have to mean using sex to get a man or attracting attention? Some women, and men, have more class than that.Britney has the body, but Christina has the voice, and there's nothing either of them can do to change that. Britney needed to focus on her vocal ability for this disc to prove that she's NOT just body, but instead chose to sell out and sell sex instead of talent.It's over for Britney."},{"rating":"2","title":"People are to cynical but Britney goes on strong","review":"Ok well a lot of you people seem to be posting reviews without hearing a note.

I used to be a big fan, but I don't believe her voice is much. She needs to become a professional dancer and give up on the singing, because it isn't working for her. She seems like a nice person, but it doesnt mean she can sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney puts out yet another mediocre pathetic album","review":"Let's make this short. This CD pretty much sucks. I was looking forward to the club style songs, and the kind of music that makes you want to get up and dance. But when i listened to it, i was disapointed, as all of the songs seem repetetive, with similar beats that dont really make you want to get up and dance. This CD is so much like her last one, it makes me wonder if she has any other talent then breathing hard with techno in the background. Although some songs have an ok beat overall, Britney has yet again put out a mediocre, pathetic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good but worst Britney album so far","review":"Whatever happened to the bubblegum pop? And why does everyone hate it so much? Why does everyone use this review column to write hate messages about britney? I bet most of them wouldn't have listened to a minute of her album. It's good but not the best. I'd stick to her old albums which are great. And why does everyone have to hate to admit they're britney fans?But it's a good CD overall, not britney style. If you're an old fan who's not 'growing up with her' you'll find it a disappointment like I did.But I suggest you to buy the CD because overall it is good and great dance CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALBUM, LIKE THE PREVIOUS ONES!!!!","review":"First of all, those people at the bottom critizing Britney and saying all bad things about her are just dumb and stupid people, who probably don't have a job and all they do is just critized the best celebrities. OK, now that I said that, I believe that this album is the one of the best, like all the other albums Britney has made. It has a very good toone, all the tracks are just perfect. They really show how Britney has grown since the last 5 years. All tracks are my favorite, specially TOXIC, which was #1 for many weeks, didn't want to leave that spot :). So all those people who all they do is say crap about Britney are crazy and should get a better job. Is not like Britney is gonna listen to them. Down with you, all you Britney haters. ************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************"},{"rating":"2","title":"DO YOU LIKE TO DANCE?","review":"This is a really wonderful album if you want to just get up and move. It just has some awesome tunes. By far the best album she has released so far. I think Britney has really found her groove and I hope she sticks with this one. My favorite songs include Outrageous and Toxic. Both are very nice tunes that you can't help but dance and sing to. I have not always been a Britney fan, but this album has me sold!

Her voice sounds like mickey mouse on helium ! Britney Spears as a singer has no talent.She has no credibility and I find her image very tired and boring. She isn't bright and her looks have gone down the proverbial drain. She is utterly useless and quite forgettable. In five years from now she will still be trying to find herself but she will no longer have a recording contract. I for one look forward to that day as do countless others.

It was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girl Can't Sing!","review":"Finally the world is waking up to that reality. All the syncho-techno effects can't cover up the fact that the only thing Spears does well is tart up a stage. I really liked her when she was a kid and could actually get away with having no vocal skills. The terrific funk music and her dancing was entertaining. But we all grew up while Britney didn't. She thinks she can still get away with it even though the lack of a voice is evident. Sad, really. Too bad we actually have to give this chick one star.

I apologized to my poor ears for putting them through the grief of listening to it. The only good song on the whole album is \\"Toxic\\" and that is due to it's catchy beat. Britney is not a bad artist at all. She has had some great songs in the past. She just doesn't do it for me at all with this album. She went too overboard on a lot of the songs, overdoing the remixing and focusing far less on her vocal abilities.

She couldn't sing to save her life. This album, just like the rest is overrated and horrible. Whats with the song \\"touch of my hand\\"? I hate the fact that she is desperately trying to be daring and controversial as Madonna. Madonna is great and britney is not!! There is no comparison between the two. Madonna is extremely talented. Britney just needs to be her own person. She cant sing. The only sing she has going for her is her looks, her dancing ability and the fact that she is marketed so well. Thats it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"pleas do not hate on her.sure her range is limited but she can get her point across and she can make a hit! i love the songs like breathe on me, touch of my hand outrageous and that remix to me against the music is banging i love her and this album. the reason why people knock on her is b/c she is britney if she was someone else, you would be jammin like the rest of us. oh and p.s. kylie is a great singer her voice is as beautiful and artistic as she is!!please sweety do yourself a favor...stop hatin!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an extreme turnaround for ms. spears","review":"I have previously never been a fan of Britney Spears- I personally don't like pop music, & from what I'd noticed, all of her old songs had no real edge or uniqueness. But I listened to a few of her new songs and was amazed at how much her music ability has changed. I still don't think she has the best vocal range, however she's experimented a lot on this album and it has had a great turnout I think. \\"BREATH ON ME\\" is a wonderfully haunting song that is easy to dance to and her vocals on this song are great. \\"EVERYTIME\\" can be compared to other pop-love ballads, however it has a chilling undertone to it. \\"TOXIC\\" is another great dance tune with good beats and different ranges throughout the song. I give this album a thumbs up and I hope she continues to get better each year, to prove the skeptics wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spears is Zoned Out with a ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Well, this CD makes for a nice coaster along will the trillion other AOL CDs that I regularly receive in the mail. The album is pure clap trap; can't really be justified as music. Memo to RIAA: Want to end file sharing on a permanent basis? Keep releasing more albums like this one. I'd try reselling it here or at eBay, but to be perfectly honest, I would feel guilty selling this rubbish to anyone else. Save your money and buy some generic sleeping pills instead. At least you won't slip into a coma like I did after listening to this noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this?","review":"I ues to like Britney's music, but after hearing this album maybe not.

It's a very upbeat CD with a lot of different sounds. Britney's not the best singer in the world, but she's an awesome performer & I give her credit for that. Track #9 (The Hook Up) is easily my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"i have never like britney spears and when i heard this cd at my friends house, i hate her singing even more. she has NO VOICE (liek always) and NO RHYTHME watsoever, and in addition to that, the music also sux. People who say some of the songs on this album are good dance songs with good beats are so wrong. Do you people even know wut a dance songs is?? it needs a good beat and good vocals too!! all these songs are are jumbled notes and her in the background moaning and singing a couple notes here and there!HORRIBLE voice, bad music, bad cd!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Role Model!","review":"My kids loved listening to her when she started out, however, since she has been \\"TRYING TO BE COOL\\"( as my 10 and 12yr old put it) they CAN't stand her. They are dissapointed in her! She USED to be a role model, well not now.The CD is not for kids under 14."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This is just another exuse to Spears to make money. Have you ever heard her live? Her voice actually singing? Her vocals are really bad. In fact, she dubs most of her concerts becuase no one would come other wise. So This is raelly lame. She's pretty, she could have been a model, or (as she shows) a talented stripper, she seems to enjoy it enough. But aside from her, she voice on this CD isn' even real."},{"rating":"1","title":"When is she ever going to go away?","review":"That's because the media keeps shoving this crap down everyone's throats. \\"Toxic\\" has got to be the worst song I heard in my life.

I think she looks good but I'm not going to buy her CDs or download her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic!!! that's it!","review":"Britney... uhmmm, I really don't like her, literally. I gave her 2 stars, one for her fabulous videos and one for the song \\"Toxic\\". The song is cheesy but you'll get hooked to it so that's a big plus! She can't sing obviously. The problem is that she is always on air 24/7 so you'll get bored and tired no matter how much she shifts her image. Britney Spears fans, no pun intended but Tina Arena can sing far better than her with cotton wools stuffed in her mouth... Don't buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this nonsense?","review":"Someone please tell me why this ungodly g@y music still exists. britney Spears is a no good low down dirty worthless little sl*t. She will bang anything that moves. She is a wh*re and needs to be put in a wh*re house and get r@ped everyday. Her music is absolutely worthless and my dog can make better farting sounds than she can \\"sing\\". What a waste of time and space britney is. I hope she gets r@ped and dies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor taste in lyrics","review":"Her lyrics are lacking in intelligence and will perforate your ears. There were some tracks that were ok musicwise but her voice obstructed this album.

Only extreme fanatics of Britney or people who like whatever is popular should pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really in the zone..........","review":"What happened to the old Brittany Spears? Well, i liked the old one better! The only good song on this CD is Me Against the music with Madonna. But the music video is a little bit over the top!! I reccomend to only buy it if you are STILL a big Brittany fan. If you're not, then burn it from a friend. If you enjoyed the CD Baby One More Time, also by Brittany, then believe me, DO NOT get this CD. This CD's music is so much different then that, in so many ways. That's why I had to give this CD two stars. It was a great attempt, but Brittany is no longer focused on sending her music to kids anymore. She has changed the was she looks,her music, how she dances, and her additude. Overall, this CD ISN'T worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this album..you'll regret it!!","review":"Once again Britney Spears has proved that she can neither sing or write good songs. She may be a good performer but she doesn't actually EVER really sing!! To be a good artist you must actually sing at a live show Britney!!This album totally sucks like the rest of them and I can honestly say that I am waiting for the day she poses in Playboy when the public realizes that all she is is a pretty face. Trust me, don't buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this music??","review":"Did anyone listen to this cd?? The sound is so over-produced and processed in order to hide Britney's weak voice.

In her new everything video she is talking about reincarnation while she sits there half naked walking around getting attacked by reporters. Maybe if she was dressed in descency I could have watched that without laughing. Although now when watching it I feel just sick.She can't be two things at once, and she needs to understand that. You can't go be a positive influence while your in skimpy clothing and kissing Madonna. It just doesn't work. She can't live alternate lives, and if she tries both eventually connect, and everything goes wrong like it is now. I don't think she deserves to or should make a video involving religion (reincarnation)I refuse to listen to a hipicrit."},{"rating":"1","title":"i KNOWS WHAt would make her cd's sell better","review":"Forget the kissing of madona.

That madonna publicity stunt made her and madonna's cds sales go up; don't ask me why people would think music in any way shape or form would evolve into images of them kissing; it might be that people think of the image of them kissing when they hear the music. But anyway sooner or later she is going to do more drastic \\"publicity stunts\\" do get her sales up.Shes a ok singer, bad lyricist, and knows that she is out with the old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of your money","review":"The songs from this Britney's album are annoying when mixing with Christina's songs. The lyrics of the Britney's songs are meaningless and immature. I'd say this album is a total waste of my time and really insults my 22-year-old inteligence.

Meanwhile, the rest of us will be maturing and growing with her. There's nothing I can't stand more than an artist that releases the same album over and over again and Britney is definitely NOT guilty of that on \\"In The Zone.\\" The entire set sparkles like the glam queen that Britney is. The production is off the hook and the songwriting is creative to say the least. Britney contributed more to the writing on this album than on any of her past releases and she definitely has something to be proud of. High points include the supercharged \\"Toxic\\", \\"Breathe On Me\\", and \\"Everytime\\", which in my opinion is the most beautiful ballad that she's ever done.Britney dared to push the envelope on this one and get a little edgy and the result is simply radiant! Way to go Brit!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best Cd but good","review":"The album, \\"In the Zone,\\" may not have been one of the best cd's but its better than some other cd's I have heard.

It doesn't matter what your voice sounds like, it matters how good of a performer you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney Spears is all my hate","review":"Music isnt money. There's not much more you can say. She treats her music like a buisness. She wrights a couple words in like 3 songs but for the most part she cant wright lyrics. She cant make the music.

Although I will say that don't let your first impressions get the best of you - like all good albums this one grows on you over time (unlike Sluttinas 'Stripped'). There aren't any obvious filler tracks like on her earlier albums; although I must say that the pacing in the middle of 'Boom Boom' is absolutely terrible as that is a good song that has been ruined by bad production.....Apart from that one song though, the rest of this album rocks and is by far the best pop album this year!!! buy it NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this music?","review":"Britney cannot sing. Well if she can she DOESN'T. All digitally enhanced and a bad job at that. Nothing good about this album except it is the end of her career. Nothing but a performer and she is getting worse at that.

The best tracks, in my opinion, are: Breathe on me, Toxic, (I Got That) Boom Boom, Touch of my Hand, The Hook Up, Outrageous, Everytime, & Me Against the Music. As you can see, that's just about all the songs on the album! You can truly listen to \\"In the Zone\\" all the way through and it's also great for repeated listens.

Me against the music is the best song and even that song isnt all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks..... EVERYTHING","review":"Oh come on people, you can't be serious. This CD does not stand against anything. The producing is terrible, the songwriting is terrible, the lyrics are terrible, has she actually been able to hypnotize the world of music with her beauty and now sell anything? This CD would not have been signed by any other artist other than Britney. No label would have cared to listen to it. And Britney, now that you are growing up.... actually do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney rocks!","review":"I listened to this CD in the car ride home last week. I love Toxic, I never seem to tire of it. I think it is the best song she's recorded since the Drive Me Crazy song. It was written by Cathy Dennis, who was popular in the 90's for her catchy danceable tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happened to Britney?","review":"I have all 3 of her previous albums and I have always enjoyed having a bit of a boogie to her songs but I'm sorry this new album is completely lacking! It actually began to really bug me! I didn't enjoy listening to it at all and all I could think was thank **** I didn't actually buy this!If you are looking for something similar to what you've heard from Britney before DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!Her sound has completely gone down hill!not good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If she only would come back to stockholm!","review":"If she only would come back to Stockholm and work with her creators again, there is still some time to save her.. Im sorry, but i couldnt even hear that it was Britney on the record. I thought it was someone else when I first heard this cd at a friends house. I didnt like what I was hearing. I think it is very bad when there is so much mixing and producing going on that the artist vanish in the backup vocals and all the instruments. What are they trying to hide? Her career is over and has been for a while now. I like Britney and I liked her Oops I did it again album. But that was in the golden days. It is over now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she singing at all?","review":"I used to be a Britney fan until I heard this C.D. For one, it sounds just like all of her other music except with better beats. But other than that...this C.D. is just not worth buying. I bought it and listened to it about 5 times and now its getting dusty on my C.D. rack. It seems as if she has something to prove on this C.D. by talking about sex and partying and drinking. That's fine and all but a whole album based on those 3 things....gets kind of old. We know you've grown up but do you have to talk about it on every single song? Her voice sounds very diluted with all the beats in the background which is pretty much all she has going for her. This album is a cry for acceptance as an artist when all it seems to be is another Britney Inc. album...showcasing her lack of talent and artistry. The only song that I think is worth listening to is Toxic...but once again, its the beat thats catchy not her voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really a very boring CD","review":"As a self professed fan of pop music, I was really excited about this CD. Unfortunately it's really a warm overed disappointment...just see the terrible \\"Me Against the Music\\" for proof. Apparently, the music lost big time as Britney moves further away from what she actually does very well...fun catchy pop...this album simpers and snears and comes off laughable and pathetic instead of sexy and mature...for a better listening experience try Britney's earlier efforts or the latest efforts by Kylie Minogue or Paulina Rubio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Over Yourselves!","review":"I think that Britney really put herself on the line with this album. I like it and think that everyone should quit hating on her for trying to make her money. Shes got more than all of you so why talk bad about her, because your jealous! Well I personally LOVE Christina Aguilera and would pick her any day over Britney but this album is really good for her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave it a chance...","review":"I tried. I really did. I borrowed my cousin's copy of this album and I tried to appreciate it, but word of warning. If you hate Britney, you'll hate this album. Musically, this album is a total rip-off of Madonna's Erotica, which is now 12 years old. State of the art technology and this is the best she can do. Sure, there's danceable stuff on here, and I'll admit \\"Toxic\\" isn't a bad song, but I don't see this album passing the test of time like Blondie's \\"Parallel Lines\\", which is a true genre crosser and a classic work to boot. I was disappointed in \\"Early Morning\\" because I love Moby, but this totally sounds like something he spit out in five minutes and handed over. The songwriting is such a joke, like in \\"Everytime\\" (\\"I'm offering you a sorry\\"?!?! Please hand this girl a grammer book) Musically, it works for the moment, but give it ten years and people will be wondering what Britney was thinking. Sorry, but like I said-- I tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much","review":"I use to be a big fan of Britney, but now shes all about being sexy. I really don't know much about this CD, some of the songs may be actually good.

She only sang in raspy low voice. No vocal, hit no high note, nothing impressive with her voice whatsoever. It gets pretty annoying. For those of you that are looking for a singer with talent, don't buy this cd. If your looking for a cd to dance to, buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, Something to have fun with","review":"I Actually Did Not like Britney at ALL, but My Friend got me the new CD. I listened to it And by the second time i heard it, I Just loved It. It's a very clubish and funish album. I Haven't heard any of her other cd's, But this is a very good album. It makes you want to dance. My personal Fav's are:Breath On Me(Ive Got That)Boom,Boom WIth The YING YANG TWINSToxicTouch Of My HandOutrageousShadowThe Hook UPand Brave Girl and the rest too.Overall, The CD was worth That Money. Get It!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Racey For Kids","review":"A few of the songs on here are a bit racey for younger kids, like \\"Breathe On Me\\" although she never admits to doing anything in the song it's pretty obvious what she's talking about although she says \\"don't even need to touch me, Breathe On Me\\" please! Oh and Anyone who listened to the 90's song \\"Legend of A Cowgirl\\" By Imana Coppola will recognize the verse rip off on \\"Brave New Girl\\". I actually like the techno song \\"Touch of My Hand\\" and the Madonna release is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney's Grown Up...","review":"This album is the same Britney as we have known since she emerged in '99. Lyrics that are as deep as a kiddie-pool, and not to mention, she sings through her nose worse than any artist I've heard. The songs on this album are pretty good, I must admit. I have heard better though.Parents are to be warned to not let their kids hear a few songs on this CD. The most risque ones are \\"Breathe On Me\\" and \\"Touch of My Hand.\\" Who writes a song about masturbating anyway? It's already been done before, Brit. :)I gave this album 4 stars. The music is good for driving in your car down the road, or to set a certain mood, but nothing that will ever earn rave reviews. Maybe Britney needs to get a new vocal coach, because she really needs to learn how to sing. Her voice is incomparable to Kelly Clarkson and Christina Aguilera...If you're curious, or just a fan, buy it, you'll be happy, especially if you're really into the whole POP scene. :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eugh..","review":"I concider myself a really big Britney fan, but once the newness of this album wore off on me, I realized it's a boring trainwreck of an album.All of the songs are Britney's scream of her loss of innocence. This album seems waay to eager to please and to get Britney some credit back because so many people dont like her. Im not expecting Britney to be deep, but these songs are all meaningless. If one more song featured a line about her low-rise jeans, her ass or her belly, the whole cd could be turned over to some clothes company to mass-produce an advertizing campain.If the songs arent about Britneys assets...its about Britney shaking them at a club. This album is completely entirely boring and pointless once the newness of it rubs off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney Spears","review":"I liked her music when she first started, but as of lately, my wife and I have lost respect for her, as she seems to dress with less and less cloths. No wonder there are so many rumors going around about her, and she wonders how they all start, the first place she should look is in a mirror. I pay for the CD to listen to the music not for the \\"Sexy\\" appeal of the artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney is definitely \\"In The Zone\\" with her latest release.","review":"Give it up for Britney. She is \\"Not A Girl\\" anymore. Her new CD, \\"In The Zone\\" offers up a more mature sound and an intimacy sure to shock some and intrigue others. Britney has entered the \\"Zone\\" and inched right up alongside pop icons Madonna and Janet Jackson as a premier performer. Britney may not have the best voice in the biz, and certainly doesn't claim to, but she has rarely sounded better than she does on cuts like \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\" and \\"Toxic.\\" She practically invokes Madonna's spirit on \\"Brave New Girl\\" and tells us how a woman can be \\"self-sufficient\\" on \\"Touch of My Hand.\\" (You'll have to listen to the words to know what I mean.)Anyone who is a true blue synth-pop fan should own this disc. I defy you to listen to this CD and not respond to Britney's command to \\"let me see you dance.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Liked her before....","review":"i gotta say that i never liked britney before. But after hearing just a few clips from her abc special during random commercial jumps. i found that i really like the songs. So i go out and buy the cd to discover she's really grown. i never liked her before, in fact i was one of those people who intensly didn't like her. But this cd changed that around. Buy it, listen to it. Think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HUGE IMPROVEMENT","review":"Britney Spears has been known for outdoing herself, and once again she does it. This CD is great! 100 times better than her previous ones. The beats and songs are amazing. You'll get hooked to the CD. I think her voice is also better on this. I think Toxic, The Hook up, Everytime are the best songs on the album. Good Job Britney."},{"rating":"2","title":"oops...she did it again!","review":"although the tittle for her fourth album sounds alot like product placement for \\"the zone\\" diet plan,it has a little less comercial appeal in comparison to other albums and tracks she has made over the years.before i begin on the music perspective of my reveiw i would like to say i am not a supporter of britney spears, however i had to give her props for her accomplishments on \\"in the zone\\".it most defenitly has a more mature sound a also lyrical astrabutes, but what surpised me the most was how original some of the songs were.unlike her past albums which are the same songs with semi-similar lyrics, this album strays away from anything britney has ever done. the music itself is lacking the shallow superficail pop/dance genre. she has managed to recrute all the right people and as a result her final product has the same sound just more depth(not that much but a improvment non the less)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Download In the Zone from iTunes","review":"I've always been a Britney fan, but this CD, especially coming after Christina Aguilera's Stripped CD, falls flat. Her voice is treated with special effects, even more so than her previous albums. And, usually you can get past her average voice to enjoy the poppy songs as a guilty pleasure. But, the only song that is good on this album is the single \\"In the Zone.\\" The rest is mediocre at best. I would download \\"In the Zone\\" from iTunes, listen to see if there is another song on the album you would like to add to your collection, and save the $$ to buy something else more worthwile on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"If her voice isn't annoying enough........","review":"just hearing about her is. So what if she kissed Madonna? I mean did anyone hear her voice, it sounded like if someone was holding her nose. It was like the sound of nails scratching the chalkboard. I mean her voice was awful.........Christina's voice was awesome. But anyways Britney album sucks. I mean these songs are so stupid that it seems like a 14yr old wrote them and on top of that an awful voice. Christina is a woman compared to this little girl. I think Britney should just quit singing and focus more on her next think to call attention for herself. I just don't understand why people keep buying this crap, maybe is airheads just like Britney. Christina's song fighter is better than any song that Britney has put out. I mean there is a lot of artist that I don't like but I still recognize that they have good songs, but her........the only thing she has is that she is a good dancer and performer"},{"rating":"1","title":"got AN ear infection get brintey!","review":"I listened to a few song samples enough for me Yikes!Her voice reminds of boys who used to scrap their nails on the chalkboard.

Kelly, Guy Sigsworth, etc.), so it's no surprise that this CD is full of tight beats and cool sound effects. But this album is all style and no substance. Even though Britney supposedly wrote 7 of these songs, we learn absolutely nothing about her other than the fact that she's hot, she likes to party, and she broke up with her boyfriend (all of which we already knew). There's also an incredible hypocrisy at work here. Britney pants and moans through almost every track on this CD, and yet in interviews she still strikes her virginal pose, claiming celibacy. If she's telling the truth, what we have here is a girl willing to exploit her sexuality for the sake of her career, but unwilling to enjoy it in real life. That's a screwed up message to send young girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old dull sound - no evolving here!","review":"Yes, this will sell tons of copies to all the masses who are forced to listen to this. (Unfortunatley it's everywhere.) But, as for quality...DULL, same old sound. Sure she can dance and shes pretty, but sing? Not a chance. She STILL sounds like a stuffed up kid but \\"breathy\\"-really odd. With all the money she has maybe a few singing lessons would help. I was hoping this would surpass the other cds, but its still as dull as ever. The songs all sound like they could have been on the last few cds, SHE DOES NOT EVOLVE at all. Same sound, same beats, same cheesy poppy tunes. Nothing new and nothing to speak highly of or celebrate. If you dig her, you'll probably dig the cd but I bet it won't last in your cd tray for long. She is no Chrisina or Whitney with the voice, (even she said so) & she is no -and never will be, a Madonna. Madonna made Madonna. Marketing made Britney. Save your $."},{"rating":"1","title":"not in the zone","review":"i thought this album was absolutely terrible. I only liked one song on it.

Does Britney think being provacative... constitutes being mature? She's sadly mistaken. There is nothing here that hasn't been done before and done much better. Britney's extremely limited vocal range seem to diminish even more after each album. Her squeaky voice is barely audible against the loud beats.

This album is really bad. Her vocals are terribly computerized & the whole album is pretty much over produced, polished dance pop. All her music consists of light weight dance pop that gives her an excuse to crawl around half naked in her videos. She can't sing & she can't write or produce music. She's not an artist, she's a pin-up model! Her appeal & what sold her music was her sexuality & the media hype, not talent! This album is not worth buying because it's the same as her last three albums along with some hip-hop beats & more computerized vocals.

They very cleverly use background singers and music and other magic to make her voice better than it actually is. If you put her and Christina A. side by side with no music, just their voices, it would be no contest! Christina would blow her away.I loved alot of the music though. Good to dance too.

I would like to hear Brittany sing without all the backup acoustics (sp.?) and assistance she gets from anything other than her own voice. I'd bet there isn't much there! Sorry, I just don't get it.

She is pretty though, but that doesn't translate into good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money and Time","review":"I heard the first five or so songs on this CD when a friend had just gotten it. We didn't even finish a song before it became either disgusting or just plain bad.

Most of it sounds like the soundtrack to a soft porn flick, but that is to be expected from a girl who has to get by through selling sex, or a distorted sense of it. This is because Britney just does not have an innate talent, at least not in the music genre. She is selling an image and persona which is sadly, and ultimately, harmful to herself and girls everywhere. Real girls do not resort to selling their bodies as mere objects for the entertainment of men. Girls should look up to some women who are beautiful as people, and not sex objects.

She is trying to sing these 'I'm mature' songs with her nasty nasal underdeveloped voice (a bunch of whining and moaning) and relies on shock value to seduce record sales. Oh, and by the way, don't see her as a role model, please. She doesn't want to take any responsibility for her actions.

I have bought this album together with Christina's \\"Striped\\" and the difference is so overwhelming that I find no words to explain it.Britney just keeps on meowing and purring throughout the CD and the only saving grace of this album are the excellent background sound effects.\\"Me Against the Music\\" seems so nice only because she takes refuge behind Madonna's and other background voices, otherwise you could have a glimpse of how absurd her voice really sounds in this CD.Anyway, I will not rush and say this is the beginning of Britney's decay, for great voices have disappeared into oblivion while other not so great voices prevailed, like Madonna's example. Let us wait and see what cards she still has to play (and by the way, she will have to do much better than that wedding gig)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst - dont waste your money or time","review":"Someone should have banned this cd... it is the worst CD I have heard. A mix of rap and slut in a tight leather outfit - Britney has outdone the definition of \\"bad.\\" The songs are a mixture of different styles and her voice does justice to none of them. The words are trite and lack any form of worthiness.I have a very extensive collection of CD's, but this one will NOT be one, and I have serious doubts that any future attempts by her will be added. Most famous artist enter a \\"slut\\" phase but the really good ones get back out of it. Let us hope Britney wakes up and manages to realize she has a decent voice before she ends up singing in third rate bars with a cover charge and a pole."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst album of the year, PERIOD","review":"After listening to this CD, I think you have to be a \\"hard-core\\" Britney fan in order to like it and to give it 5 stars. I like her first album, but after she declared to be a \\"mature\\" woman (actually her behaviors & music declare more immaturity than ever), her music starts going downhill real fast. The music of this CD shows no signs of maturity, the maturity Britney talks about means exposing more of what/who she really is instead of growing up. I think her first album is the most decent one among all her albums; if you already have it, then you have it all. Don't need to waste a penny on this CD. If there's a CD rental store, this CD should be a rental and not meant to be owned. Because you'd probably just listen to it once....and that's hard enough. Listen to samples before you actually pay for it...you will definitely regret if you're not a hard-core Britney fan.Btw, what's up with the heavy nasal sounds?? I find that very annoying! Stop using your nose to sing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What The...","review":"Wow, OK I'll be the first to admit that I liked the song Baby One More Time, it was catchy, and it was before Britney Spears became Britney Spears(tm). I knew she couldn't sing but at least the songs were somewhat upbeat, something you could listen to without having to think, which is good sometimes. Now this CD is released, and I'm not even sure there's singing on it. They pump the music up so loud to cover her inferior voice, they modulate her voice electronically to make her sound more \\"adult\\", and then her panting to really make the 14 year old boys crazy. This CD will be a huge seller I'm first and she'll probably go on to slaughter a couple more records before we can finally start talking about her in the terms we should be: a Tiffany-clone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lady is a tramp!","review":"Girl, I'm sorry, but you really are trailer park trash.

Listening to this CD repeat the same beats and same moans and groans over and over for too many songs was too much to take. She is quickly losing any relation she once had to being a true musician. Spare yourself the agony and money and just replay your other CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This album is uninteresting, unoriginal, unaesthetic.

I REALLY HOPE THAT SHE COMES IN HERE TO READ HER REVIEWS, BECAUSE I WANT HER TO KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT HER. SHE CAN'T SING, DANCE, ACT, AND JUST HAS NO TALENT WHATSOEVER. WHY PEOPLE MAKE A BIG DEAL OVER HER IS BEYOND ME. I WAS IN NYC A FEW WEEKS AGO, AND SHE WAS IN TOWN PROMOTING THIS ALBUM AND I COULD HAVE THREW UP ALL OVER THOSE FANS OUT AT MTV STUDIOS.

ANYWAY, BRITTNEY SUCKS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I'm going to places i can be out of control...\\"","review":"Britney Spears, In the Zone is probably her best and most interesting album to date. Well I don't love all the tracks, I like seven out of twelve and those songs include: Me against the music (with Madonna), Everytime, Brave New Girl, Shadow, Toxic, Touch of my Hand, and Breathe on Me. unfortanely, her voice has not improved, it's still thin, flat, and monotone but that's not why I somewhat like her, she has this great and natural ability to make crummy songs into catchy and fun songs. The rest of the tracks are so dumb and senseless. Spears is obviously obsessed with singing songs that talk frankly about sex. We get the idea, you like to get down and dirty, now move on! But still she shows growth and promise with In the Zone, maybe one day she will make a record with depth. Good luck with that Mrs. Federline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Well, there will always be critics, professional and amateur, who say that Britney stinks and can't sing. Funny. Sounds just like what they said about Madonna.Personally I don't care so much that Britney doesn't have the vocal range to sing an aria at the Met. That's not why I listen to, or like, her music.I think this album is much more mature than the others and I love the trancy bent to it. It really is her most solid effort yet. Love tracks 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11.People who think that the musicians they listen to, and those they bash, make them cool kids should go back to posing and patting themselves on the back for thinking that Coldplay and the White Strips are SO brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"britney's time is up","review":"industry anaylists have just confirmed that the sales figure of in the zone are bad IN OTHER WORDS THIS AWFUL CD HAS FLOPPED.it would be prudent to ask this lip synching princess to call it a day and retire and spare us folks the agony of listening to such rubbish.avoid"},{"rating":"1","title":"what can I say.....","review":"To anyone who has ever listening to good music....I don't need to say anything but...come on it's britney....it's garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Like It","review":"I should never have brought this record.

What's wrong, too ashamed to admit you like Britney?Her music is pathetic; it only proves that anyone with good looks (her only asset) can make it big in music biz. Sure, she has a decent voice, but most of us do (unless you're tone-deaf)Bet you anything Brit wouldn't be as big without her looks. If we were all blind, no one would like her.I grow weary of reviewing all this bull**** music these days. Find me some artists who don't sell out, and I'll be happy. Until then, the only music I can appreciate these days is the White Stripes.(I am under 35 (actually under 25 too), and male, so don't think I'm another one of those parents who disapprove of her or anything.)Too bad I can't rate lower than one star. I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney is NOT a singer!","review":"Awful! This cd stinks! Almost every song starts with her talking into the microphone. Many songs, you also hear her heavy breathing or laughing in the background. The songs are so digitalized that you never hear her actually singing, and when she does sing, she sounds like she's 12. Lyrics include \\"When I'm shaking my ass\\", \\"outrageous, my sex drive\\", \\"my sexy jeans\\". Yuck, yuck, yuck!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Vocals","review":"Britney might win the young crowd over, but for anyone who has any clue about her singing talent, she is old news. With each album she does, her vocals get weaker and weaker. Take away the background vocals and all you would hear is a very weak, nasal sounded duck. I have nothing against Britney, but her vocals are terrible. She covers herself up with background singers and lets them do all the work. If you see her live, you can't even hear her sing, her microphone is turned down twice as low as everyone else who sings. I don't know what has happened to her voice, but it does not even compare to Avril, Pink or Christina."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed :-(","review":"As a HUGE Britney fan, I was very excited to get this album; however, I was very disappointed after listening to it. It didn't live up to its hype & its so-called much more mature sound. In fact, her voice sounded weaker than all her previous albums. A lot of the songs like \\"Shadow\\", \\"Early Morning\\", \\"Breathe On Me\\", \\"Touch of My Hand\\" are pretty boring--no climax in the music or vocals--very bland. She mostly whispers & talks in a sexy way than actually singing throughout the album. I wasted my money on this CD & this is coming from a hard-core BRit fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever","review":"This has basically nothing of musical content worth listening to. \\"Everytime\\" is respectable but it's more a song for someone like Celine Dion. Britney stuggles to get it out. The rest of the CD is junk. Personally, I really like Britney. But, this is really bad. She should stick to the style she's good at. Forget the notion of an \\"image makeover\\". She can't be something she's not. The supporting cast is to blame for trying to force that issue. Reflects the pathetic state of the music industry in general. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Re-wired, re-worked, re-designed music selling machine..","review":"Brit, or I should say Brit's controllers have produced a new set of carefully crafted pop music for the masses. Oh Boy, regurgitated music! I can't believe that people would even consider buying this stuff but you can sell anything if you hype it enough; and that's what B.S. has been doing.Its still the same old \\"look at me I'm sexy\\" stuff put into a new box, but then again, what else can B.S. do? Does she have any real talent besides prancing around in a tube top? Of course not. Someday soon, people will wake up and stop buying this, then maybe some real music will be heard on top 40 radio.."},{"rating":"1","title":"a Bad Voice but Good Marketers","review":"Kudos to the marketers of this album!!! To make up for britney's way-below-average-voice, there are many very catchy tunes in the cd that help 'revive' this album. Britney should thank her marketers, record company and the producers for her success in the music industry. With technolody so advanced, any voice can be drowned out/made pleasant/ or made markatable. So this album is just one of those highly digitalized albums. If that's what you're looking for, get this album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"please shut up","review":"To all of you people that were talking bad about britney....shut up....this is her best work yet....2 songs are kinda boring ....but overall the cd is GREAT!!!.....i think you should go and buy it(if it was a bad CD why would it be the #1 CD on the billboard charts???)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD worth listening to......","review":"This CD is very good comparing to her previous albums with one great hit and many fillers.

This album reminds me a lot of Madonna's Erotica album, one that I have but I don't enjoy that much. This album, however, I was quite disappointed by what I heard on it. The songs don't seem to have much substance and I found myself annoyed by some of them. The only ones I can actually say have any holding power would be the Kylie Minogue flavored \\"Breathe On Me\\" and the balladry \\"Everytime\\" as well as the chart hit \\"Me Against The Music\\". For a fan of nothing more than the music, this album was a real disappointment and will be lucky if I change my mind and add it to the other three on my shelf. I've given it 2 stars just to signify the only songs that are worthwhile. Sorry Britney...."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHOCKING!!!","review":"Well, I've always been TOTALLY anti-Britney, long-awaiting her demise. I heard this record the other day and after it 'settled in' overnight, I realized that it was actually really, really, good. She has some great songwriters. A lot of the songs are really catchy and memorable, making you want to dance sexily!! I kind of respect her after hearing this album. The album has a definite Madonna vibe, she definetly is hoping to follow in her footsteps. If you like cheesy-pop, this isn't the album for you. But, if you like sexy dance music, this album is purrrfect!!! And her little sad song at the end is pretty good too..Britney-- I ALMOST respect you now~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boring?? Excuse me!","review":"Whoever said that In the Zone is boring compared to Stripped should have their head thoroughly examined.Except the lyrics, there is no other way Stripped can outdo In the Zone. Stripped's songs are supported by the same background which gets boring after a while. In the Zone is way more interesting with its awesome beats and tunes.My favourites in order are - Toxic, Everytime, Showdown, Breathe on me, Brave new girl, Shadow, Outrageous, MATM remix, Touch of my hand and Boom boom.There are a lot of styles on this album and the lyrics are just ok. Her voice isn't very good but altogether, the songs are a lot of fun to listen to.Worth buying"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its pretty good....for Britney..","review":"Putting aside the fact that Britney has no talent, the album is okay. The one song that really sticks out is No. 7, Outrageous. Me Against the Music with Madonna is kind of pointless. You barely hear madonna singing at all, and the song isnt really that great. One good thing about the album, though is its got some good beats, for dancing and whatnot. Even though she has a pretty face, Britney just plain out has no talent whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could be better","review":"I can always count on Britney to give the goods, but I can't say that she gave her very best on In The Zone. There are some excellent songs on here but there is too much types of music that is thrown together: hip hop/r&b, electronica, teeny-bopper pop. So there isn't much of a theme with this album; she worked with a variety of different producers with different styles.Pros:ShowdownBreathe on MeEarly Mornin'ToxicThe Touch of My HandEverytimeCons:(I got that) Boom BoomOutrageousThe Hook UpBrave New GirlShadowThis is just in my opinion, it really depends on your own preference of music. I think that Me Against the Music would of been a lot better if Madonna didn't collaborate, I'm a big M fan but she didn't really seem to have much chemistry with the song. Otherwise, this album isn't a complete disappointment and it's worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect pop disc","review":"In The Zone is the best Britney album yet. It offers strong dance tracks that show off what the real Britney's thinking about: dancing at clubs and having sex.The lead off song \\"Me Against The Music\\" is a hot, funky, bump and grind dance tune featuring Madonna. \\"I Got That (Boom Boom)\\" fuses country rhythms with an undeniable dance beat and some flare added by the Ying Yang Twins. \\"Showdown\\" is a sexy tour de force club track and \\"Breathe On Me\\" is the quentissential techno pop song of 2004.Perfect pop song \\"Toxic\\" and the eery, but moving ballad \\"Everytime\\" are the album's strongest cuts and were wisely released as singles and became huge hits. Yet, there are other highlights here. \\"Outrageous\\" is fun and \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" is the sexiest silly song since \\"I Touch Myself\\"There's some crap here though: \\"Brave New Girl\\" and \\"The Hook Up\\" should have been cut. But you can't have it your way everytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite good, Not Fantabulous","review":"This album is good. It's just not great. The songs I love I REALLY love, but the songs I don't like I REALLY hate. The best track here is 'Toxic', but other high-lights include 'Me Against The Music', 'Breathe On Me', 'Outrageous', 'Shadow' and 'Everytime'. These are really fine songs, with some good ideas. But some songs are catastrophes, '(I Got That) Boom Boom' and 'Brave New Girl' being two. If you like the singles, get this album. It is good, not terrible, but could have been much better. This album is certainly Britney's best offering to date, and is more mature and interestin than Britney's past efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rate this 0... true offal","review":"me against the music... this is extremely accurate as Britney Spears is against everything that REAL music is. This is the latest in a long string of pop garbage, which also includes such masterworks of shallowness as the N'sync and Christina Aguilera (hey at least she can sing though, but in a show-off was) that has pervaded the music market for the past 5 years. I like listening to real music performed ny real people. Britney Spears cannot even sing without \\"electronic aids\\"... her voice has to be run through about 13 filters before it even sounds remortely decent. I go to concerts to see intense bands perform energetic music... not to see a body with no talent other than the ability to poorly shake itself. If you want real music with real meaning i suggest Coldplay for those who enjoy mellow, properly done music, and if you want music with high energy and a termendous amount of talent i suggest such bands as Smile Empty Soul and Staind. Avoid this like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"is she singing? or whispering? this is CRAP","review":"This CD is crap. Britney doesn't sing, because she can't. All she does is whisper, moan, and do those orgasmic sounds she's really good at. They try to drown out her voice with all these loud, generic beats and do computer effects to her voice. The production is horrible. Britney is just copying other people because she has no talent of her own. I swear this CD sounds exactly like her last one, and the one before that. She is not a real singer. Mandy Moore is so much better. Everyone, go get 'Coverage'. That's real music. Let Britney lipsync and strip all she wants, that's all she's good at. Don't buy this crap CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"I absolutely love this album! It has a ton of great dance tracks and some beautiful mid-tempo songs and ballads.

Which is probably why Christina Aguilera can get away with more.Her latest effort is a sort of rebellious attempt to get the attention that slipping away from her. Rebellious against the squeaky clean image she was supposed to portray...mind you she's a fine one to grumble, she started the i'm a virgin thing herself. Attention because of the provocative lyrics in her album. doesn't anyone tell her stripping yourself on your video and bumping and grinding around with moans and breathy lyrics does NOT help you get noticed for your talent?This album gets annoying after the first few songs.

I literally listen to the entire CD without skipping 1 track! This has never happened EVER! Believe it or not, I was never much of a fan of Britney in the past, but this album has definitely changed my mind! Some of the tracks are easily among the best pop songs I've ever heard, especially Breathe On Me, Toxic, and Touch of My Hand.

I don't think it ought to be compared with 'Stripped' because they are two different categories if you ask me.I do wish her voice would get better. It is, however, better than it used to be. I really don't think people should keep critisizing her voice. Because that's the one thing people can't help. I mean there isn't any surgery that improves your voice. She sings pretty well even without very good vocals so I appreciate her efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best so far...","review":"I have to say reading the reviews and seing that no-one bothers to mention \\"The Hook Up\\" best second song in the album, i think its sounds kinda like a jamaican vibed its is realy good.

Here, shes trying 2B serious, as if she matters. She cant pull this off. Half the album is her breathing heavy & hispering the other half is try-hard beats that really dont go with her \\"voice\\" or style. Blatant ripoffs of other crap music that was popular in past years is abound on this record. Shes an image, not an artist.

I respect Britney Spears and her influence on the music industry, but most of the songs were just horrible. Granted, there are a few (very few) songs on the album that are good (for example, I liked \\"Me Against the Music\\"). However, this CD is really just full of club music. Really bad club music. Listen to the second song on the album, and you'll know what I'm talking about. Britney used to have catchy songs that you couldn't get out of your head (seriously, who doesn't remember the words to Baby, One More Time?), but this CD is full of very forgettable music. She should have stuck with her old formula. Don't buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Zone is the Best!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"At the beginning of her career, I didn't really care too much about Britney Spears at all, due to my hatred of bubblegum pop. But as soon as I heard \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" and \\"Overprotected\\", I began to change my mind. And then I heard, \\"Me against the Music\\" and then decided that I loved her music. In the Zone is so different from her previous albums. My favorite tracks are:ToxicOutrageousThe Hook UpTouch of My HandMe against the MusicShowdownShadowEverytimeEarly Mornin'Well, I love all of them, but I fell in love with those the fastest. However, I didn't like Brave New Girl at first, because it reminded me of her first two albums. Many people think Britney Spears is a fake and not a real musician because she doesn't write any of her own songs. I say that is a huge load of bullcrap. She co-wrote 7 of the tracks on the album. A whole lot of artists out right now don't write their own music.

My suggestion is to download the two singles off of itunes and forget the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney IZ HIZOT","review":"A good entertainer to me is::Someone who possess's a strong stage presence.Has some banging songs to back that performance up.Looks good of course.Has some banging dance moves and nice choreography.Clothing..Actually sings and not always lip singing..sometimes ok..Britney does that all and much more..Now Her CD is hot because well for one it just is awesome..It has a diverse feature of songs. Its not just a pop album..It has some hip hop, some slow pop and allot of dance. She is nice and this album is nice. She sings a ballad to the best of her ability, and it sounds nice. Now i dont say go and think you are getting Christina's voice because she is not her.. Thats like saying you want Janet to sound like Whitney..Its just not happening. Cop this cd if you want something to dance to. Not something to sleep to trust me"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD ever","review":"I love this CD!!!!!!!! I have been a fan of Britney since she first came out and even though she has changed a lot I think it is great and I love the old and new her. This CD features a lot of other great artists like Madonna, Moby, and R. Kelly. My favorite song on the albulm though is \\"Everytime.\\" The first time I listened to this song I started to cry. It is one of those songs that is about heartbreak that everyone has experienced and it really gets you in your heart. You can tell from her voice that she means every word she is saying.I would recommend this to anyone because it is trully a great CD and what I think is the best of her!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is crap!","review":"Being a bonafide Britney hater,I gotta say that this album is so crappy that anybody that buys it needs to get help.I mean,who wants to hear this trash.If you\`re looking for a better pop artist,I would recommend that you listen to that new CD by JoJo. She\`s hot,she can sing and she isn\`t trashy like Britney Spears."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is bad!!","review":"Why does Britney Spears sing as if she is being struggled? It's aweful! And this album is totally boring! I prefer her first album better. She seems to be getting worse! The songs in the album are....BORING! I hope she gets some singing lessons and stops singing like she being struggled."},{"rating":"1","title":"So everyone in America wants to bang her.....","review":"but let's not mistake that for talent. This album and the hundreds of imitators that will come out this year are examples of the kind of s___ that has been ruining pop music for the last six years. To any guys that consider themselves fans, separate your hormones from your musical taste. Yeah, I'd like to f___ her, but I don't get that mixed up with the kind of music I buy. The fact of the matter is that she is a no-talent harlot that probably smoked a lot of c___ to get where she is today. Watch the videos, but don't give this stupid b_____ anymore money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wheeee! Britney grows on ya!","review":"Britney Spears has come out with another great CD. Don't bea poor sport, BUY the cd instead of burning it!My absolute favorite song on this cd was Brave New Girl. Admittedly its mainly bouncing bubble gum lyrics its still quite good and different.Her ballads are great! Shadow rocks. When I first heard these songs I didn't like a lot of them. Then I listened to it like three times and I started LOVING THEM! Wheee! This is a great dance CD and definetly if you're a girl and like Britney you should buy it! It's MUCH better than her last one.xx brave new girl"},{"rating":"2","title":"How does Britney keep doing it again?","review":"Britney is without a doubt the best performer in the world and this new CD illustrates how she has adapted to show how she and her music are maturing. She changes tempo and style in each different track to offer something for everyone. This is her best since OOPS!. Definately worth buying. Listen and you will become adicted to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"I Love This CD.I never really liked Britney Spears and I never bought a cd by her until this one.I personally like the Cd...I Love the song Everytime... Sad song but she sings it Beautiful....I don't know why all the Bad reviews..."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Complaints, A Hit Album In My Eyes","review":"In this day an age of mediocrity in music I feel that \\"In The Zone\\" is a hit. Britney surprised me with this album. There were no cheesy ballads and most of the songs were really cool. The first single \\"Me Against The Music\\" is a good dance tune. A lot of the songs have a R&B or laid back vibe such as \\"Early Morning\\" and \\"Showdown.\\" T he song \\"Brave New Girl,\\" really reminds me of a 80's Madonna song. I am really glad that I have In The Zone. As someone who just enjoyed Britney songs here and there but never purchased an album this was a suprise hit in my eyes and it's also great music to take to the gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too much","review":"Oh god, this is the worst music I heard since... well since the last britney spears album. She sounds like a chimpmunk on helium and that whole I'm gonna whisper and sound cute thing ain't working. The Backrounds beats are horrible too. This isn't music. It's an example of what not to do if you really want to be labeled a singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britneys Album In Da Zone","review":"Well i liked toxic and in the zone but all the rest are rubbish!!!!! I was really disapointed as i have all britneys other albums but i will NOT be buying this album!Trust me it is nothing like her other work and it is not impressive!!!!! You would be better off (A LOT BETTER) buying Christina Aguileras album Stripped as she has 20 songs all written by her!!!! She also has an AMAZING voice unlike Britneys which is TOO LOW and alieny and croaky!! Hope this helps!!!!

Slap in the face!","review":"What happened to you Britney? This CD is horrible. Don't buy it. Spending a penny on this would be a waste. Britney used to sing good songs with pop that showed off her ability to carry a fantastic tune. Now that she's older, popular, and knows it, she went from innocent, pink, and sweet to \\"I'm so hot, might as well do a crappy album.\\"The songs are terrible and very techno-ish, I mean where did that come from? I especially hate \\"Toxic\\" I mean, have you seen the video? Yuck! This CD sold well because people probably expected it to be great like her other albums, without even listening to it first.Britney get a clue: Change may be good, but not this kind of change!"},{"rating":"2","title":"short and sweet review...","review":"Standout tracks, in my opinion, are \\"Early Mornin\\", \\"Showdown\\", \\"Toxic\\" and \\"I've got that (Boom Boom)\\". \\"Breathe on me\\" is the song that you can imagine hearing in a club filled with tons of sweaty people. It's pretty good and the lyrics are hot (\\"Boy don't stop \`cause I'm halfway there\\"). But I can't stand the song \\"Brave New Girl\\" (it's too upbeat and weird and annoying). Overall, the songs really grow on you. I recommend it if you bought any of her previous albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"SURPRISED","review":"I was not a huge fan of Britneys until I heard \\"I'm a Slave For You\\" and even then I was only into that song. \\"In The Zone\\" finds Britney at her sexy best. The song \\"Toxic\\" is one of the best dance pop songs of the decade. \\"I've Got That (BOOM BOOM) is equally addictive. \\"Outrageous\\" gives Beyonce a run for the real queen of pop. She does not have a beautiful voice but neither did early Madonna. What she does have is star quality. Whether you like it or not Britney is the pop icon of today. She is what Madonna, Prince, and the Jackson siblings were yesterday. I Like It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops she did it again.","review":"I'm waiting for Ms. Spears' inevitable crash. Watch for it, folks. I would not recommend this cd to the target audience, but Britney would love to drag as many little girls down into the sewer as she can. Pretty sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney Where is the Music in this CD?","review":"Britney voice is not really her voice but a sound supported by eletronic sounds and help voices in the back ground. Britney you have all the opportunity to show something good and you are blowing it alway. I think you should learn to sing and grow up as an artist. I am sorry but THE ZONE must got to SPACE and disapear forever!!! The music in this CD is terrible and if guys good music you should try something like Natalie Merchant, Cyndi Lauper or Tori Amos...."},{"rating":"1","title":"the lipsyncing stripper still can't sing","review":"go buy Mandy Moore's \\"Coverage\\", she doesn't have to be naked on every magazine cover or kiss her grandma to sells CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way out of the Zone","review":"This cd is just plain awful. I agree with the other reviewer on this. Pink Try This cd is better musically than this.

Keep this up and she's old news before her 23rd birthday. Since when is moaning, groaning and giggling considered music? Very BAD decision to hitch up to middle-aged Madonna too. Britney should spend less time partying and more time trying to develop a VOICE. It doesn't exist on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, Really, Please........Retire....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Britney....stick to what seems to be your calling, making headlines.......Leave the music making to the real artists, like Christina Aguilera.....You can take some singing lessons from her.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Is In The Zone!","review":"Wow! Britney Spears has definitly shown a great deal of effort and maturity this time around. In her past she has released albums sich as \\"...Baby One More Time\\", \\"Oops I Did It Again\\" and \\"Britney\\". Personaly I think those albums were nonetheless good but to much \\"bubblegum\\". This album on the other hand is very well-balanced with slow songs like \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Shadow\\", fast, upbeat songs like \\"Brave New Girl\\" and \\"Toxic\\" and some very sexual songs like \\"Breathe On Me\\" and \\"Touch Of My Hand\\". Over all this album deserves 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is pathetic......","review":"yes,, Britney spears is smokin hot,,, so when a new cd comes out that means 3 or 4 new hot videos... but it also means 3 or 4 new god-awful songs!Who the hell over the age of 12 is actually dumb enough to LISTEN to this garbage??

Don't blame people for pointing out the fact. Blame Britney for wasting plastics producing these songs that most people can sing better than she does. I was thinking, to be like Britney, besides stripping our clothes, we probably just need background music to help us sing. Another sad thing is the immature lyrics she wrote, what does \\"my weakness causes you pain\\" mean?? It's really trash.I think Britney's music is not a real music, we should invent a word for her so-called 'music.' And also, it's not fair that she lip-sync all the time on TV now!!

I now have the largest wax(funny smelling wax)museum this side of Hollywood. Thank you Britney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Britney Spears is probably the most awful thing to hit music within the last 20 years. She is so terrible that it is painful to listen to her. She cannot sing at all. God only knows why she would title a song \\"Me Against the Music\\". It just asks to be made fun of. It sounds like someone is choking her on every song on this stupid CD. She is not a pop star and she is not the next madonna. She does the same thing over and over again and people keep eating it up. Like \\"I'm a Slave 2 U\\" is so much like \\"Me Against the Music\\". She is so afraid to try new things. Pink is awesome. Buy here albun, Try This, instead. Pink is the next madonna, becuase Pink keeps re-inventing herself, where as britney is too afraid to even change her hair color!

Non existent...its more electronica than a musician slash vocalist - britney will sell becuaseh er image selss simple - why even bother argueing those merits...she has a a whole brigade of brainwashed kids who want to worship someone and they have found a willing idol. On average its better than her first three albums - however thats not saying much there is no breakaway single in this set. The best song is toxic and its not that great - its an average track -----I listened to all the tracks and was not smitten with a single track - I suggest Outkast - now that album I instanteously loved - an album shouldnt HAVE TO grow on you - but even then In the zone wont hold you for that long - GET OUTKAST!!!!!!!! that album is eclectic and amzing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"My 5 year old niece wanted this, so I bought it for her. She doesn't even like it, prefering to listen to Oops! I Did It Again. This garbage is so generic, to be laughable. Britney's vocals (never her strong suit) are poorer than ever. I did like her first two cd's, but the last two are plain bad-this one worse then the last. And Britney needs to get over trying to become some kind of party animal in her lyrics. These lyrics, as well as her interviews, just make her seem sad and shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE AND UTTER FILTH","review":"This cd is awful. The lyrics are so filthy. It seems Britney Spears is taking great links to be the next Madonna.

In my opinion, Britney Spears better thank her looks for where she is today. This album is a disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish BRITNEY could do something better!","review":"I don't understand the commercial PRODUCERS, they produce the fake singers and force it in the public minds.

The farther you get into the album the more excruciating it becomes. Hello Rhythm! Are you home? I am afraid to see what people look like dancing to this, seriously scary. Too bad she learned nothing from Madonna except publicity stunts. This pop is so flat that this album belongs with that open Pepsi sitting out for day (although tastes like years). There are far better ways to waste your money.

I think she's a beautiful and talented person. I must be honest though, there are a couple of songs on this cd that I cannot stand. One is the second track, 'boom boom' because of the annoying male rapper heard at the beginning,middle,and end of the track. I don't know who this clown is that she colaborated with, but he sounds awful and ruins an otherwise tolerable song. On the other hand, 'toxic' and the last track 'everytime' are great songs. 'Everytime' is a pretty song, although quite short and I just wish the lyrics had more to them. I didn't know that there was an import with extra tracks on it, or I would have bought that instead, but we love Britney so maybe we'll get that one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Of The Same Old Fluff!","review":"I heard Britney's new cd \\"In The Zone\\" playing in my local music store and I decided to listen to it from one of their audio sampling machines. All I can say is the music itself is nothing but electronic beats and keyboards. Her voice is covered up by much of the electronic music which isn't a bad thing because Britney's voice is just average. There wasn't one song that stuck out as being exceptional, this is just a mediocre cd that mimicks the likes of Madonna, Christina Aquilera, and Janet Jackson. I'm a female and I enjoy girl groups/singers, but give me Stevie Nicks, Carly Simon and Carole King anyday over Britney. Even when those singers were in their twenties they were far more talented singers than Britney will ever be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!","review":"Why do people keep making such a big deal over talentless performers like this? Does anyone honestly think they'll be listening to Britney Spears in 10 years or care who she's dating?

Britney Spears' previous hits tell the story. (And the story is: Britney knows how to make damn good danceable hits.) With her latest CD, the Big \\"B\\" steps into the zone with some ripping tracks. Current fave: \\"Early mornin'!\\" Hello??!!! This song GETS DOWN, y'all. \\"Toxic\\" is an excellent track that is really cool and danceable. But first and foremost, Britney has struck again up with another worthy smash hit, featuring the memorable line: \\"Hey Britney, you say you wanna lose control, come over here I got something to show you...\\" sung by none other than Madonna. The tune is already a pop classic, in my humble opinion.Look, Britney Spears hasn't sold 50 million albums because she sucks. Get over it, ye who insist on throwing rotten tomatoes at the girl. Sour grapes, people."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Zone or Out of the Loop?","review":"I was fairly disappointed with Britney's new album,for one she is all over the place with the record switching from hip-hop to reggae to techo to soft ballads not that that's always bad but she just didn't pull it off.I give her A for effort but I think she could of done better,sounded like a rush job Britney!Best songs on the album:Me against the musicI got that Boom BoomOutrageousShadowEverytimeI won't say it was a complete failure on the album because I did enjoy some of the songs and I am a fan of Britney,but she just didn't do it for me this time but I'll let you other fans be the judge of what it might do for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good!","review":"If you like pop and/or dance music, you will really like Brit's new CD. She is awesome. She really stepped it up on this album. I honestly only liked Britney in the past because she was adorable, but now I see her talent coming through as she grows up. This album has elements of her poppy past, but has a lot of great beats and hip-hop elements also. This album definitely makes you want to dance. Brave New Girl sounds a lot like something that the Bangles would have done in the 80's, but better. Early Mornin' completely rocks, it is like a hip-hoppy/dance track that you could listen to while getting ready to hit the town.I'm not going to lie, this album is for the girls. Britney is all grown up and shows it. With only two ballads, one of which is actually not too cute-poppy, this is an album you blast while hanging out with your girlfriends.Oh, I forgot to mention Me against the Music...but do I have to? I think everyone understands how hot that song is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, crap disc","review":"I guess I didn't read all the features of the disc, or it's probably because I'm not too familiar with Dual Disc.

She entertains us with her awesome music which this cd brings. It has mind-blowing and outstanding songs. It also has danceable songs which are really groovy and have awesome beats to it. I think this is the best cd that I've ever purchased. I think Britney will be famous for a really long time just like Madonna. I really love this cd. I read some of the reviews and people keep comparing her to her rival Xtina. But Xtina is too skanky and slutty. Britney has more clothes on then Christina which really shows that britney's smarter and more intellectual than Xtina. Britney's even more successful than Xtina and Britney appered in the music business before Christina. Anyways Get this album right now cause it rocks!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney remains famous...for now.","review":"Britney Spears has always been a trendsetter. She is this generation's version of Madonna. Fittingly, the two icons team up to sing together on the albums first single, \\"Me Against the Music\\". The track shows Britney's vocal powers, rather than her range, which unfortunately she tries to emphasize on a lot of the album. (An exception is in the tracks of \\"Toxic\\", \\"Outrageous\\", and \\"Touch of My Hand\\".) Britney's true vocal talent is hidden behind her gaspy, high-pitched singing through a lot of the album. It is almost reflective of Mariah Carey's latest album attempts, where her earlier albums were chock full of powerhouse vocals and fullness. Hopefully Britney starts to recapture her strength rather than holding on to trying to reach the top octaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review from a previous Britney sceptic","review":"Upon hearing the first single off this album, I was expecting nothing less then pop-influenced dance drivel. How surprised I was when-upon reading some decent reviews and deciding to take a chance-the album was extremely listenable! The single doesn't do justice to the rest of the songs, with many influenced with a very trance-y vibe, from the quirky beats of Showdown to the very... bass of Breathe On Me (the total standout track in my oppinion), this album blew me away. Granted, the girl doesn't have the best voice in the industry, but she's definately tried some different vocal techniques and it really works for her. For anyone wanting to purchace a very awesome record in the near future, give this one a try, you won't be dissappointed :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its gonna become a hit anyway","review":"Who cares about what you guys say if dont even like her music????

She has the looks, the body, dances really well, controversial, and an okay singer-this makes the perfect package for a successful star. I use to make fun of her old songs from her last album. I thought it was so stupid that she had to prove that she wasn't this little girl anymore, but not yet a women-huh?Anyway, In the Zone is a pretty good album. It makes you want to move to the music especially when driving during those traffic hours! Toxic and Boom Boom are the best ones in the album-and this is coming from someone who is not a fan of Britney Spears!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst album of all time by the worst singer of all time","review":"britney new album is a new definition of the word sucks how can this artis keep on saling is beyond me. the \\"new\\" trip hop sound has the worst beat of all time. why do people keep on buying cd's with talendless singers who don't know anything about music in the first place.buy the beatles album or any other rock band like the white stripes \\"elephant\\" or coldplay live 2003 or u2 if you want to hear real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO LEFT THIS STINKY LADY OUT OF HER GATE..?","review":"This girl's music is an ofense for everyone!

It sounded disgusting to me!Please do not buy any of her albums. Money is very important in you life, and you know that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Don't ever miss Showdown, toxic, Outrageous, Brave new girl, Shadow and Everytime. There's something for everyone (except rock so stop suggesting people to buy evanascence instead)One-star reviewers have not listened to it and they're the ones missing out on the good stuff anyway. I love almost everysong and don't judge the album by that crappy first single (me against the music).Recommended for britney and nonbritney fans. And for whoever said that this album was a flop, this album is the strongest female release of this year (after alicia keys). It's less compared to her previous massive hits but in today's music world no artist can sell more than what In the Zone just sold.Buy it!! Worth it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible!!!","review":"first I have to say this, I have actually listened to this album, unlike most people who hate britney. Why are people still buying her crappy music, she seriously sounds like a stripper whispering, how can someone like this be past other people on the billboards, like say people who have talent or actually play music, and also just because she gets a song credit does not mean she wrote the song, you can get a song credit for writing a couple of words. So to people who actualy like Britney go out and buy good music, because in a few years you will ask youself why did I ever buy this crap?"},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Zone","review":"'In The Zone' is quite different from Britneys three previous CD's. I have been a big fan of the earlier music so its taken a while for 'In The Zone' to grow on me. Now Im really loving it. My personal faves are 'Me Againsed The Music', 'Boom, Boom, Boom' (yes okay its a basic, repetative song with somewhat cheesy lyrics but its fun, I like it), 'Breathe On Me', 'Toxic', 'Shadow', 'Brave New Girl' - that ones got a dance vibe to it and the beautiful ballad 'Everytime'. 'Outrageous' is probably the only song that I dont really like on the whole CD, besides that its great and definately recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeesh","review":"I'm tired of all these so called 'music experts' who are so far above listening to Britney that they come on Amazon.com just to complain about her...don't make much sense to me.I'm also tired of people saying that Britney lacks depth and diversity...who cares, did she ever once say that this album was on the same level as Bob Dylan or something? No, she said that this was a dance album, pure and simple. And that's what it is, and it's a great one at that. Yeesh, she's like 21, not 60. Even if she was singing about life, nature, politics, would u take her advice since your so against her anyway? Didn't think so.Stand outs are, Toxic, Breathe On Me, Early Mornin' and the remix of 'Me Against The Music'.The albums got great beats, great hooks, great songs, and the liner pictures are nice...;)I say good for you Britney, give all those 'I'm above listening to Britney' people (who listen to The Clash and The Strokes because they think they have to) more to cry about.Five out of Five"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's changed so much!","review":"I still can't over the fact that this is a Britney album every time I listen to it. Except Brave New girl, there is not a single song that really reminds the listeners that they are still listening to the girl who used to sport pigtails around a basketball court singing...??My favourites are Toxic, Breathe on me, Everytime, Shadow, Showdown, Touch of my hand and brave new girl.

She is not jumping the shark and becoming D-I-R-R-T-Y like some other performers. She really needs to change her image little by little or she won't be around much longer ,,, her 6-12 year old fans are getting older and so is she.Parents ,, stop looking to her as your kids roll model ,, raise your own kids and protect them from much more important things !The album is loaded with cool dance songs and really nice change up in vocals from song to song ... I think she did Do It Again ! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as her last album \\"BRITNEY!\\"","review":"Okay ... I know most people wont admit it that they are a Britney Spears fan but, I am. Having bought her first album, I thought it was great! The favorite song from the first is \\"Sometimes.\\" After buying the first one, I had to wait for the follow up \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" only good songs were \\"Stronger\\" \\"Lucky\\" and \\"Dear Diary.\\" I had to wait LONGER for the long awaited album \\"Britney,\\" which was to be the Crossroads soundtrack (well ... had 3 songs from her movie.) Only good songs on that album was \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" and \\"Overprotected\\" also \\"I Love Rock-N-Roll.\\" Had to wait for about a year for this long awaited smash hit to BRITNEY. I was wrong! This album is crap and I'm not afraid to admit it. I bought it thinking it would be as good as the first 3, but, not even close! What has happened to the Britney Spears we know? Good songs are \\"Me Against The Music\\" and \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom.\\" Listen to me and don't buy this album!! It sucks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney Had Better Albums","review":"Britney Spears isent back at all. Her new album \\"in the zone\\" clearly states that spears isent quite IN THE ZONE. Her album has (4) Great songs, \\"Outrageous\\", \\"Touch of my hand\\",\\"Breahte on me\\", and \\"Toxic\\". The rest of her songs reak with electronic voices, and off rythm beats. She \\"trys too hard\\" with this album. I was surprized she debuted at #1, \\"it must of been all the fans that had fallen for her first single\\"\\"Me agianst the music\\". Speaking about me aginst the music, the only reason why it sounded \\"OK\\" was because of madonna, other wise its \\"wishy washy\\" and \\"Boring\\". She wants to be a sexy symbol, but that's all ready taken by Willa Ford. Britney, quit smoking, quit crying about justin and GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!In conclusion, if you have $12.99 that you dont want to waste, than Save it. This is not the album you need to run to, yet walk to. You can wait for this one and donate the money for a better cause. ( for the homeless )"},{"rating":"1","title":"ghasp","review":"Those who actually listened to the lyrics will agree with me when I say that she shouldnt try it again. She has other artists singing with her on her album because she can't rely on her own talent. She is insecure because she knows that she can only prance around in her underwear for so long before people get over her. Putting loads of sex in her music to get people's attention isn't particularly original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simply","review":"An immense pop album, from a well decided pop singer. Britney chose just the right producers for 'In The Zone,' and luckily avoided anything to do with the Neptunes. Just like any good pop album should sound, every song has an appealing, different, exhilirating, and interesting resonance.This cd is definitly worth buying if your into Pop music. Simple as that. No doubt the best in its genre"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"i loved the cd. the whole entire cd was great. theres nothing bad to say about the album. she chose wonderful people to collaborate on this album from madonna to the ying yang twins. theres not one song on this cd that youll not want to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get In The Zone","review":"I really don't know what is wrong with all u haters. The first time Britney dropped a CD it was evident that she didn't have tremendous vocal ability but who cares. Show business is all about image and that is what Britney has; a great image. Kelly Price and Lil Mo have good voices, but do their albums sell? 'NO'. Madonna has a good image, and sells quite a few albums despite her heavy instrumentals and little voice use. I think Britney has a wonderful career ahead of her. I hated her at first but then i realized she is a great performer and that is what i like,a good performance and it takes a whole lot more than voice to put together a great performance. Her latest CD sounds rather good and i've only listened to it once so far. I found \\"Toxic\\" to be rather catchy. I know i will listen to this album over and over again. U go Britney."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money!","review":"I was appalled when I found out that Britney made a new album. I was even more appalled after I listened to it. This album had absolutely no real music in it. Just some catchy dance beats with a chick attempting to sing. Britney seems to lose more and more talent after every album. Mabey she should just make videos for now on because the only way she'll make any money is by taking of her clothes in her videos like she normally does. This album is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"She may be In the Zone...but she's out of touch","review":"What to say...She tries so hard to make an adult album that is more like listening to the soundtrack of a pornographic movie. Adulthood is not all bout sex honey...learn to grow up a little. The songs are okay but her voice is overshadowed by the beats of the song. Not that I mind because her voice isnt that good to begin with. She's average and mainly sells because she is good looking. Personally, I rather listen to Christina Aguilera, who may be just as trashy looking but at least has some moral lessons in her song. She is also more talented. Overall this CD isnt even worth glancing at...it's a space filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely \\"In the Zone\\"!!","review":"Britney Spears has done it again! After three bestselling albums, Spears has another bestselling album out! At first, when I listened to the album, I was a little leery about it. After all, Spears is a role model for younger childeren whether she likes it or not, whether she wants it or not and a few of these songs - \\"Showdown\\", \\"Breathe On Me\\", \\"Touch of My Hand\\" and a few others - are sexy, perhaps bordering on too sexy.Don't get me wrong, this is a great album. It really is. I just don't think, in my opinion, that it's for her previously targeted fan group. It has some great dance tunes - \\"Me Against the Music\\", \\"(I've Got That) Boom Boom\\", \\"Toxic\\", etc. With songs like these, you can't help but dance to the music.This is an album not to be missed even if it's a little wild.

You go girl, your new cd is wonderful, my favs would have to be \\"The Touch Of My Hand\\" \\"Breath On Me\\" \\"I Got That (Boom, Boom)\\" \\"Shadow\\" \\"Toxic\\" \\"Early Mornin'\\". Brit, you are a very beautiful woman and I wish you all the success you deserve, I would say this is her best cd yet, it doesn't have that teen pop beat to it, it has more of an adult grown up beat, the music on this cd is banging, I can't wait till to see what her next cd is going to be like.

She's nothing more than a no-talent who wishes she were Madonna (but sorry to tell her she'll never be on Madonna's level). What can I say? The girl can't sing, her songs have no point, and she tries to be shocking, but she's not. Everything she tries to shock people with has already been done years ago. And do we really need more songs about how she's not a girl anymore and she's a woman now? Enough already! We get it! On this album her songs sound the same as her previous 3, filled with cheesy lyrics, plain Pro-Tools music, and computerized vocal effects (but even that doesn't help her terrible voice). I don't have anything against Britney, but what has she done that's so great? Oh, well.

Tired techno with some hip hop thrown in the mix, and Britney's cracking voice through it all. In some songs she sounds like a computer recording because they've mixed her voice through computers so much.The worst thing is that she tries to shock us with this album. As if kissing Madonna weren't enough, now she sings about her sex drive, her shopping, bumping and grinding with boys and her \\"boom boom.\\" She even sings about masturbating. It isn't shocking, because everybody else has done it first. Heard of the Divinyls? They did a better song about \\"touching myself.\\"Oh, and I notice that a lot of recent positive reviews for this are by the gushing \\"music fan\\" who keeps posting anonymous reviews.

It seems like there is more moaning than singing on it and sex is of course the main topic of the lyrics. I've bought all her other albums, but wouldn't touch this one w/ a nine foot pole. The woman has gone off the deep end and is out for nothing but attention....there is no artistic integrity to be found on this disc. An absolute waste of the plastic that was used to manufacture it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More pop rubbish","review":"Pop music is such a stale genre how can you listen to this ?. You don't need to buy this album(why would you?) because you eventulally here every song on MTV repeated no less than 20 times a day.Every song sounds the same and lyrically the content is repetitive and not diverse.What you need is Superunknown, Soundgarden rocks.... daaa Whose Soundgarden?"},{"rating":"1","title":"take it off","review":"I think for Britney's next album she should be on the cover naked with no CD or liner notes or anything not only would it be better than this, it would also sell better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!!!","review":"I will start out by telling you this might be one of the best CD's - yes it is sexy- very sexy - is that such a bad thing?? I love every song but like 2 on it- that is pretty good I really like Toxic, and Early Mornin'- it is just pumpy - it is not like any of her other cds which I enjoyed - I would really buy this- With Britney you have a lot of haters that haven't really listened to the CD- so believe me I am sooo glad I bought this one!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not a huge britney fan but....","review":"I really like this album. It's fun and most tracks have a good sound. a couple of boring ones, like shadow and brave new girl, but the rest are pretty good. Toxic and Outrageous are a couple of really good ones. If you're into dance music, or if you enjoyed madonna's last two albums, i would recommend you check this out. True, she is not a Great singer, and her lyrics are far from poetic, but it's good dance music or driving in your car music. If you're searching for more than that, i suggest you pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"As usual, no voice, no substance, but more sex.","review":"I expected a mature, grown up Britney with this album, but WOW I was wrong...The album is TOOO \\"samey\\", and it's still bubble gum pop...She's yet to establish herself as a grown up artist...Why is it so hard for her? In a nutshell, this is just another Britney album."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy something else!","review":"this cd sucks. i used 2 like britney's music, but every 1 of her cds has gotten worse. she shouldn't even get credit for singing these songs because it's not her voice. it's all synthesized crap. the only thing britney spears has going for her is hype, her looks, and dancing ability. if u want a pop cd with some substance buy christina aguilera's stripped album. now that girl can sing! she writes her own songs too."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIVE IT UP BRITNEY","review":"Ok, each time this girl comes out with a new album, she shows the world more and more what a fake talent she is. Unlike Christina, she gets the hype and it shows esp. with that fake kiss with madonna and in the end, Britney just goes on the sell out path. Yeah she can she dance TO A POINT but the girl can't sing. Every time I hear \\" Me against the Music,\\" and hear the words in the zone, reminds me of the stupid Auto Zone commerical on TV. As the weeks go by, Britney's album and Single, are dropping off the billboard chart, and people with real talent, such as Toby Keith and Alicia Keys are selling music. I say don't waste your dime on this hooker/stripper and go buy the new Outkast's album, Speakerboxx, Alicia Keys' new one but not this album unless you want an expensive frisbee"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney's Makeover!!","review":"Britney started an evolution, and that's pretty flattering for brit's fans... I am a fan of electronic music and britney just knew how to incorporate it on her new album, that's just great.

It's much more mature in both subject matter (Touch of my Hand) and musicianship (Moby collaboration on Early Mornin'). Breathe on Me is destined to be remixed and to become a huge club hit. I can't wait. I don't have to remind anyone that this is pop music--nothing too deep, but good, fun, shake your booty music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn this CD was a disapointament!!!!","review":"I don't understand why the producers can put out such piece of CRAP.

I am a Britney fan and have been following her career since she first came on seen, but I think she is at the point of going mock 4 straight into a brick wall.This album is full of breathy lyrics backed up by the repititous sounds of various beats. The songs are good, but that is only if you take away the repitition she seems to have fallen in with every song after - Me Against the Music. Hate to say it, but it aint worth buyin or burnin."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happened to the record industry?","review":"This album is a complete joke. If you research the album credits (oddly they don't disclose them here, maybe because it would effect sales?) it took more people to put out this album than those needed to fill out an orchestra. Whatever happened to the band, sitting down with one sound engineer and one producer to produce an album of exceptional quality? Instead now you get an exceptional number of people who put out an album that by all reasonable standards is a complete waste of airtime? Why does it take an army of people to make her sound good?

The only songs I actually like are \\"Me Against The Music\\", \\"Toxic\\", \\"Shadow\\", and \\"Everytime.\\" The rest of the cd isn't that great. I just think that Britney sings too much about sleeping with people and that bothers me a lot. I'd rather listen to people like Hilary Duff, Ashlee Simpson, and Lindsay Lohan who at least sing about good stuff not sleeping with people."},{"rating":"2","title":"great job britney","review":"I was never a big britney spears fan. I liked a few songs but thought her vocal abilities were limited and she was just a female backstreet boy. But I decided to give this CD a try and I was impressed with how much her music has changed for the better. I wouldn't call her a music innovator or a great vocalist, but she tried something different and the results came out great. This CD has a lot of r&b/hip hop and techno influenced tracks and beautifully written ballads. Britney's 15 minutes aren't up, she is here to stay! I wouldn't have said this 5 years ago but I'm saying it now and I'm saying go buy this CD if you want light hearted, fun pop music with an urban twist and try not to judge the person, rather judge the music"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but not good enough","review":"Oh Britney, Britney, who's trying so hard to change her image and show her \\"true\\" self. It's very unfortunate that this album is not as good as her past albums, and lacks the catchiness and melody her other albums have had I also noticed she's following the recent (or popular?) trend of mixing in a Middle Eastern (and Asian) flavor to her songs. Good points for this, but nothing special in her case.Me Against the Music, Touch of My Hand, Early Mornin, Breathe On Me and Toxic are the more standout tracks. I really think the song Boom Boom is annoying because the chorus is sampled from another song. Otherwise, it would have worked. Overall, this is a mediocre album with mediocre to boring songs. For those who are curious or interested in buying this album, I recommend you sample it if possible first. Otherwise, I'd say buy Christina Aguilera's album instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defintley not her best","review":"I have been a fan of Britney since \\"Baby One More Time\\" came out and I have loved all of her albums until this one. The album starts out great with \\"Me Against The Music\\" with Madonna which I love. \\"Boom Boom\\" is good, I like the beat. After the second track the album goes downhill and FAST. \\"In The Zone\\" is different from her past albums and it is good to see her doing something a little different. But this album was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Dreck From A Clueless Fembot!!","review":"This is even worse than I expected.

You make J-Lo seem like an artist!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In The No Talent Zone","review":"She can't sing--bottom line. And her sub-Kylie Minogue posturing on every single song is forced and tiresome. She was great as a kid star and even better as a mini sex kitten, but as a \\"take me seriously adult entertainer\\" she just falls flat. Witness the paint by numbers execution of the first single \\"Me Against The Music\\" with her pseudo sex pal Madonna (another big yawn)and you get the picture. It all comes off sounding like Justin Timberlake knock-offs,and he could actually sing them better than she does here.Save your money, and buy the new Kylie cd instead....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what music is MADE FOR","review":"Let's get this straight; music is made to listen to, to dance to, to sleep to. It's not made to investigate if her voice is generated, if she wrote the lyrics, how bad they are, how ugly she is, how slutty her album is.... music is about beat and dancing, and lyrics, but if you want an album to listen and dance to this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"In my opinion, I think we all need to get a grip and relise that girls become women, such as Britney. She is an artist just like Madonna and she will express herself in many ways. She is on a journey and we get to watch since she is famous. Madonna did the same thing and we all gasp, but ultimately Madonna has her fan base and so will Britney.This album has great dance music, I'm certain they will play it in many dance clubs. I think the little girls have lost interest because they can no longer relate to her, young women can since they are at similar stages. I think the album is a great pieace of Britney's expressions as she \\"grows up\\". I hope she finds her spot in the ground and continues to blum every year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, she's toxic... she makes me puke","review":"\\"The best thing about being an artist is that you get to travel overseas to places like Canada.\\" ~Britney SpearsI'm sorry, but this piece of trash pop star is too stupid to take seriously.

I am assuming that either they are younger, or they don't have any passion for music outside of immediate gradification.Also, for me, it has become necessary for albums to spark thought. Not a single relevent idea resounds in this album.

It's filtered, completely lifeless and the lyrics are meaningless. You can search and search for different reasons to justify this album, I know I did, but it's as hopeless as her movie career.

I like Britney Spears in general, but this latest CD was a real dissapointment. Very \\"clubby\\", which is fine, but it gets monotonous. She has no range or self expression on this CD. It's the kind of music that is boringly generic and blasted at cheesy clubs just to get people to gyrate. Nothing special and extremely tedious, every song sounds the same. Same tempo. Same octive range. Her voice is devoured by the backround vocals (which are just as monotonous.) Whispering and moaning seem to have become her latest skill. I think she needs to stop partying and start working on something that matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just when you thought she was cool...","review":"This is Britney's worst CD by far. Most of the songs are slower than her other CD's, and that means she has to SING, or whatever it is that she does. It's not a secret that Britney's voice sucks, but it really shows on this CD. Good thing I didnt' buy this CD or I would be really pissed off."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME OF YOU BRITNEY!!!!!!!!","review":"I feel sorry for this confused adolescent called britney spears. Poor woman who thinks that she has talent. The only talent that she has is its body and how to showing it. She seems a squirrel singing, or moaning. Facing the reality of Britney as a huge star is totally ridiculous . She is too beautiful, but she is not an artist, she does not deserve to have a single recording. Persons like britney show that if you want to be a singer the only thing that you need is a big breast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney's best","review":"First off,I'd would like to say that I prefer this album to Britney's previous albums, because ,in my opinion , her previous ones had essentially four or five outstading songs and the rest were fillers. This album is a dance-pop album and has only two ballads. In this album , there aren't any fillers to me, since all songs are great. This album is a huge progression from her previous albums. The example of this are the songs : \\"Showdown\\",\\"Breath on me\\" and \\"Touch of my hand\\". These are also my favorite songs.Other songs are:\\"Brave new girl\\"and \\"Toxic\\" ,which are reminescenct of her previous recordings, only with a new make-over.The two only ballads are:\\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\". The former is a beautiful song written by her and THE MATRIX and the latter is a touching song about her break-up. Note that this songs are much better than the ballads of her previous albums. All of this makes a true fantastic albums and better than her previous ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Britney! Growing and sounding like a younger Madonna!","review":"I was hesistant about buying this CD but I figure for $9.99 at Target wasn't bad. I was astonished at the style, variety, and hiphop/pop feel and sound of the songs. The best tracks are # 1 (The Zone),#2 Boom Boom (with the Ying-Yang Twins), #6 Toxic, #9 The Hook Up (my favorite and can't wait for the video), and # 11 Brave New Girl. Maybe it is because Madonna, whose music I have loved for over 15 years, was on the 1st track but the style and coolness of the music sounded like Madonna. This CD will give Britney more appeal, exposure, and sales. The music has a style that will definitely be awesome in a club setting or as remixes. Britney has come out of one zone into an awesome NEW ZONE...You go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Pleasant Surprise!","review":"What can I say other than this is her best work to date! With razor sharp production entwined with sexy vocals make this cd a must have for any person who wants to get up and have a good time. Britney shows that she can take risks and they truly pay off here with an explosive (not to mention surprising!) colloboration with the Ying Yang Twins on the earthquake-like club anthem \\"I've Got That Boom Boom\\".Britney also takes on the suggestive side of things once again with a surprising dance/trip hop track titled \\"Breathe On Me\\" and the middle easternlike track \\"Touch Of My Hand\\". Britney also proves she can tackle ballads with the haunting ballads \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\".This CD is easily one of the best of 2003 and really showcases how multi-talented Britney can be. This is a must buy and essential for your cd collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a f*****g dumbass","review":"I hate pop music but this is by far one of the worst albums ever to go on sale.

The song's heavy dance beat and slinky lyrics ooze maturity and fun.In The Zone bounces back and forth between dance and hip-hop oriented tracks. Though the dance tracks are undeniably stronger than the others, there really isn't a bad song on the album.Overall, this CD is strongly recommended for anyone who likes fun pop music. It's not exactly heavy or thought-provoking, but let's be honest: Everybody likes a fun CD now and then.

This album has no substance. It's not a lasting record. All the songs sound alike. The tune is bleak, with mainly a lot of Britney moaning and groaning, but not so much singing. The song \\"Everytime\\" is okay, though it does sound more like a 13yr olds letter written to a boy that broke her heart in jr. high.The bottom line is that this album sounds like something thats gone wrong in the club scene.

The standout here is, of course, the Grammy-winning \\"Toxic,\\" a track that is perfect, but other songs like \\"Showdown\\" and even the two ballads (the most popular being \\"Everytime,\\" another radio smash) show that Spears, a product of media frenzy, has the potential to bring a lot to the table if she's given the right material. Sugary sweet bubblegum classics like \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" may have been where this babe began her music career, but it's songs like \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Everytime\\" that show where she has the possibility to go far with in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!!!","review":"\\"In the zone\\" is a great cd!It is different from the other three albums cause the songs are more sexy,r'n'b and the voice of brit is improved.In songs like showdown,touch of my hand she sounds like Kylie Minogue or Madonna!!My favourite songs are:me against the music(the remix)boom boom,showdown,toxic,hook up,shadow,everytime.The last two are the two ballads of the album and everyone would agree that they refer to Justin Timberlake.The songs of the album make u wanna dance...ok,Brit did a great job but i have to say tha t i am a little disapointed with the image she shows.Go and get this cd NOW!i think the next cd-singles will be:boom boom,toxic,everytime..."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad She can't Sing,it has some decent Moments","review":"I Bought this Set mainly for the R.Kelly Written&Produced Track \\"Outrageous\\" which is tight.the Ying Yang twins bring it as well.\\"Me against the World\\" with Madonna works better for Madonna in a duet form than if She did this track Solo.if Britney could only Sing this would be a better than Avergae set.but Her voice hurts my ears.but in Her defense there has always been suspect vocalists of all eras.this is Probably the best Album She has done yet overall.She is a trip when you listen to the Lyrical content here."},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Zone","review":"This cd is really good I like it alot. I'm glad that she decided to branch out and try somthing new while, at the same time keeping her pop style the same helping her sell albums 3x before. The ballads done on this cd \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\" are the best ballads she has ever done on any of her cd's. I especially like \\"Breathe On Me\\" and the only song I really don't like is the number(9) track \\"The Hook Up\\" I find it rather annoying. Another thing is yes, I do like the number(2)track I Got that (Boom, Boom, Boom\\") but I think it'd be better with less Ying Yang Twins and more Britney. So I give this CD 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Zone","review":"I think this is the best album by far by Britney Spears. My favorite songs are Toxic,Showdown, and many more. This album shows how she's grown up into an adult as well as an entertainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney rocks!!","review":"I have to say this is my favorite Britney album. She is totally amazing. Though \\"In The Zone\\" is not the strongest song on the album it is definitely my favorite. Her duet with Madonna is amazing. The CD showcases her vocal range beautiful and mixes a whole bunch of styles together - from pop to techno to r&b to hip hop. I recommend anyone that likes Britney to have this in their collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm. Britney should dance and not sing","review":"I'll admit. I find many of Britneys tunes to be catchy and fun on her albums. This album is no different. However, I hate to say it but Brit should stick to dancing and not singing. Her voice sounds so artificial that it is almost insulting. No matter how beautiful a song could be, she has that trademark nasalness that continues to ruin her music. She should stick to something she has talent in, which is dancing, and stop morphing her weak voice into some wierd computer sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool album!!!","review":"This is an excellent album to listen to....fun, entertaining &catchy! Britney tries to explore different music tunes & she actually does a good job. If you can keep an open mind(BE POSITIVE), you will be entertained!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What zone?","review":"I know people either love Britney or hate her. I have liked some of her work in the past but this album makes it clear that she can't sing (or think for herself). It seems as if this final desperate grab for fame will either make or brake her, but I find no reason to buy into this lackluster performance.If you want sleazy and nasty but still FUN and GOOD, try listening to \\"Lords of Acid\\". Other artists can make being bad sound so good, But Britney is just a let down.Sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared to dance............","review":"With slick production, catchy hooks and excellent experimental beats, this may be the best Britney, Inc. album to date. With little traditional pop fare, 'Me Against the Music' is NOT representative of the material on this largely dance-infused compilation. The two strongest tracks on this album are probably the two best Britney songs I have ever heard, these being 'Toxic' and 'Brave New Girl'. The Rishi Rich mix of the Madonna-duet rocks, and collaborations with the Ying Yang Twins (Boom Boom), as well as Moby's 'Early Mornin' are all great dance tracks. 'Breath on Me' and 'The Hook Up' are two other strong dance-pop tracks. This album is up there with Madonna's 'Erotica' and Janet Jackson's 'Rythm Nation' as a dance compilation you'll be playing for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave New Britney","review":"I have loved Britney from the very beginning. This album is pretty different from her past stuff, but its really great!! It has something for everyone and definitely moves in a more mature direction. My personal favorites are Breathe On Me, Touch of My Hand and The Hook Up. This is a diverse CD that at first listen may be different, but is really worth giving multiple listenings to! Give it a try!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney made this CD to Worship HERSELF","review":"The songs on this album are ALL about Britney herself. Songs about centering herself in \\"Me\\" against the music, immature and stupid cheat on Justin...WHO CARES about stupid mistakes you made in your life which you constantly denied??!! Britney's fame came from the innocent/sweet image she had, and she's running out of that. I don't know why Britney forgot HOW she got famous in the FIRST Place. This whole CD has no souls in it. It really makes me sick even listening through it once. This CD will eventually go to your trash can when you clean your room<-- that I can guarantee. Why do people listen to Britney who's so conceited even produced a CD to worship herself!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"this album is great!!!!!!!!! This is for the TRUE britney fans!!!!!!!!!!!!! DONT listen to the bad reviews!!!!!!!!!! The only bad song is '' Shadow'' the rest are great!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great music","review":"This is a good CD and I think you should have it whether you are a Britney fan or not. I mean there are people here who have listened only to the samples or only a few songs who give it one-star reviews because they hate her. Please talk about her music not her! I know she's sort of poppy and sometimes tries to put on an image and also lip-synches but this is a review column not a Britney forum. Reviews about the CD are hard to find in here...This CD is great and music will get you in the beat so please buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney's album Stinks!!!!","review":"I do admit her song \\"Toxic\\" is catchy, and her song \\"Everytime\\" is nice, but other than those two songs, the album is boring and the songs are horrible. \\"Me Against the Music\\" stinks and I hate it. \\"Boom Boom\\" is the most horrifying, annoying, pathetic song I've ever heard in my life! There is no point to that song except for yelling out words on the off beat. \\"Early Morning\\" also has no point to it but I believe it is definitely better than \\"Boom Boom\\". I am done with this review, and though there are two good songs I like, I believe a good album needs at least 6 out of ten songs that are good. Britney's album just doesn't have that. Sorry all you Britney fans, but she stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bit older, and a little more wiser...","review":"At first I followed Britney. Then she took her break and I took mine. When I heard this ablum, I realized, this girl can't really sing. I mean, she has talent, but she really can't sing. I have never really heard her sing from deep down. Her tunes are catchy, but that's it. No meaning, no feeling. The only reason she is a pop princess is for her looks. Her voice is less than mediocre. At least Jessica Simpson and Xtina can sing. Give it a try Britney! You might just become a singer! You let me down :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Ever!","review":"I have been a fan of Britney Spears since her first album but this new Album called In the Zone is just terrible! The music is all different types and not many of them even have a good tune for them either. I like the Song In the Zone and Toxic but that's about it. The rest is crap, never heard such a bad CD like this from Britney before. I may not be buying anymore of her CD's if this keeps up in the future. It was a big disappointment for me too because I requested this CD for Christmas, only to find out, it wasn't half as good as I had expected in the end. Two thumbs down from me, don't waste your time with this one unless you like a CD with no general format of music. If you do then buy it because it has R&B, Hip-Hop, Rap and so forth on here. But for me its just not organized and its not very enjoyable to listen to due to that big mistake right there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A brand new high in disappointments...it's almost offensive!","review":"I'm thanking my lucky stars that my friend, one of a group of quickly shrinking \\"Britney-ites\\", let me listen to this disc before I bought it. Oh My Gah!! This is, in my opinion, the most tragic, unlistenable, inconsistent plethora of garbage I have heard in years - and I'm sugarcoating it!!Luckily for me, I only have $12.00 invested in the Britney Empire...I purchased her first CD, and that's all. After listening to this complete trainwreck of an auditory nightmare, my investment will stay at $12.00.I normally summarize and elaborate on some of the good tracks on recordings, but I am not able to with this one because THERE ARE NONE. All things aside, Britney should go into therapy for letting her record company even release this. The Doomsday Clock has started ticking Britney. You better change your ways or you'll be singing to a slot machine crowd of eight in some Vegas casino...a fitting end?? I think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse and worse ...","review":"I don't know what should I say?I mean I don't think there is any worse than this album or not?I don't know when there are good singers like Shakira, Christina Aguilera, etc... WHY should we listen to a crow voice?Britney becomes worse and worse every day and in every album . I suggest her please stay at your home and learn something like baking cookie.I have tried to rate very fairly. Unfotunately these are truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the zone alright","review":"...The Twilight Zone. I've got a cat and if you step on her tail (by accident of course) she sounds better than this no-talent Spears.God, what crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please","review":"Can this b--ch please stop making music ? No-talent, retarded, overproduced, re-arranged voice, siliconed-up.Please don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"just horrible","review":"This is a horrible album by a horrible singer. The only reason it's even remotely listenable is the magic done by producers to mask Britney's horrendous voice. Mandy Moore has more talent in a fiber of hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IN THE ZONE","review":"I admit it, i bought the CD. It is anything but in the zone. i like the beats and the music but britney cannot sing. she is an amazing performer, she always puts on a good show and offers a lot for the stage but her singing...sucks! Shes got millions i suggest she invest in some vocal lessons"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go away now!....","review":"I heard some of the songs on this CD at a friends house, and was not impressed at all. The only song I even came close to liking was Everytime, hearing that song made me hope for her sake when she crashes and burns; that she spends some time in a mental institution. I can really see why since her first CD each one after that has sold less copies than the one that came before it. The ulimate duet would be JC from NSYNC and Britney since they both seem to want to push such sexual material to young girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Up the ZONE!","review":"This CD is terrible and could team up with Madonna American Life. Those two women should grow up. One is OLD trying to look young and the other is an adult acting like a TEEN. Damn her music is immature and SUCKS!!! Don't buy it because you will hate it!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I bought 3 of her albums. Yes she can sing but she is not using all of her vocal abilities at all! Its all about image and shockery. I think the reason why her latest album has gone bad isbecause she has been making some real stupid decisions and perhaps has pushed aside those who were being protective of her as well as their counsel-perhaps her parents. The MTV kiss so grossed me out and saddened me that I broke all of the CD's I have ever bought of her. She really does not care about her base fans and I don't see the need for her to be continually slutty.I am sure that most that buy her albums are men. I am not surprised that her albums do not sound like music. The music has stopped after her3rd CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old pop crap","review":"Britney Spears is a pop idol... what has music become? We all know that Jive Records employs other people to write hit songs, with the aim of making money off the record...what does Britney Spears get? --More money. Britney Spears exemplifies how superficial and empty music has become. Listen to real, honest music, not what \\"corporations\\" want you to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not \\"In the Zone\\"","review":"I was so excited to recieve Britney Spears' new cd for Christmas, but after listening to the whole thing I only liked about 2 or 3 songs and was very dissapointed. Britney's new cd \\"In the Zone\\" is very different than her past 3 cds and I guess she is trying to come up with a new sound. However, her new sound isn't working, because if you look at the charts, even Hilary Duff's album (whom I didn't like as well) is doing better on the charts than Britney's and it has been out longer. I think Britney is losing her touch and has gone from attempting to sing to moaning and whispering.She should also never co-write any songs again because those are the ones that i couldn't stand at all on her new cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not a fan but I liked it","review":"but I can honestly say that britney has finally released a solid, creative album. Her voice isn't good, but the quality of music this time around makes up for it. Maybe the long break she took paid off, she should try that more often and continue making good albums like this one. And her music videos are establishing her as a music video artist as well, keep it up britney, best of luck in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone is completley different so dont read others reviews","review":"First off there is no doubt that this album is way different than any of Britney's other albums and like every single ablum some songs are better than others and some songs are worst than others. Have u ever listened to an album and liked every song alike? This is a good album and Britney has worked hard on it. I like every song except for i wish the ballad everytime was more vocal. Who cares what other buyers write in their comments. Every person is different and theres no way to tell if u like this album or not unless u buy it. I am not saying u will like it though and im not saying u wont. But its cool and every song is completley different than the other. I am definatley a britney lover but u dnt have to be. Just spend the lousy 15 bucks or so and try it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonus tracks are worth it!","review":"I originally purchased the US version of In the Zone and then found out about this Austrialian version. The bonus tracks are awesome and worth the buy! \\"The Answer\\" is produced by Sean \\"P.Diddy\\" Combs and has a funky, original feel to it. I absolutely love \\"Don't Hang Up\\" because it is a different style than the other songs. It highlights her vocal talent while remaining catchy and upbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRITNEY!","review":"SHE ROX IN THIS ALBUM, FOR ONCE IT ALL ISN'T JUST BUBLE GUM POP. SHE HAS THROWN IN HIP-HOP, RAB, AND A BUNCH OF HER OWN STUFF ALSO!THIS ALBUM ROX!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In The Trash","review":"Give me a break, this media tramp has nothing to offer musically and the only thing showcased is her own ambition and desperation on this CD. A good barometer of how good an artist(and B.S. hasn't a clue what that is) can be defined on how they market their work. If the music were any good would you really need to \\"expose\\" yourself? Wouldn't you trust your musical instincts and let the music speak for itself? Well, duh, B.S. has no musical instincts and those of you who continue to prop up this lame excuse for talent in a lifestyle of the rich and shallow are the real losers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The below 5 star reviewer is stuck in 2000(chuckles)","review":"Cranky Reviewer, no one likes you and no one likes Britney anymore(chuckles). This b*tch killed her own career with this album which sold less than her three previous records combined. As for the singles, Me Against the Music with the gini wap Hagdonna tanked. Toxic was a fluke hit which ripped off James Bond movie music. Lastly, Everytime was a ridiculous whine-infested ballad. More fans abandoned her after this due to her wild child behavior, stealing men from expecting mothers(the most famous being Pervin Freeloader), her abusive attitude towards fans(refusing autographs, yelling verbal swears at her), consistent lying and so on has ruined her. She should now join Tiffany, Debbie Gibson and so on at the place my buddy Roger Waters immortalized \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home for incurable tyrants and kings\\" as she is a former."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is her own talent ?","review":"sure, she is famous. but she never wrote one single song in four albums. maybe a couple co/writing. but by real musician standars, that is sad. and why in gods name can't she sing live. i have only seen her sing one song live. everything else is lip syncing. i know she has all those dance moves to perform, but x-tina and madonna do that and sing. brit's voice is just soo weak, she never sings high notes, she never \\"belts\\" out a tune, not even on studio tracks. i won't say the songs aren't fun and bubble-gummish. but they are not meant to be rock classics. really once you grow up , you will get rid of her cds, embarassed that you ever owned them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I'll tell ya, if the music industry pumps out anymore Britney Spears wannabes, everything is going to go down the tubes.

Guess she is really running out of ideas and trying her hardest to keep afloat. I don't see her being around much longer! She is just played out and looks can only take you so far when you are lacking in the talent department."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise, not","review":"This CD is bland, all of the songs are about the same exact thing, lets go clubbing ... no real emotion into it. Britney should start writing because although the writers she has do a very good job, she has very little variety in the songs she does choose. I gave it two stars because when I listened to it, a song actually caught my attention, \\"Toxic\\", and I fell in love with it after awhile. The other star came out of, She actually collaborated! I was expected way more since she \\"took time off to make this one good,\\" but I guess I look at Stripped by Christina Aguilera(One of the best CDs ever by a female artist, in my opinion). I do not disrespect her or dislike her at all, but if she's going to be the next Madonna, she's got to get into Madonna's shoes and reinvent herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't I rate this one a zero star","review":"What a waste. She cannot sing a lick. No substance or range to her thin wispy voice. The songs are not fresh. She needs all the help she can get. Just look at the list of credits. She might make a good aerobics instructor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney Fading Alway!","review":"Britney should be more serious about singing and learn the art of siging. She can't sing even with the help of eletronic stuff and voices behind. Her producer is making a lot money selling to lost TEENS. CRAP like this only TEENS and people don't know about music buy. The DESPERATE Madonna tries the survive her fading career singing with Briteny and even giving a her a LESBIAN kiss. Britney should get mature and Madonna must learn she is not a GIRL anymore at 46.

As a far-away liker of Britney Spears from the beginning, I was appalled! This pop/techno cd is unlike any other Britney album. \\"In The Zone\\" has some good songs like \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Everyime\\", but the rest aren't really worth your 13 dollars. The songs on \\"In The Zone\\" are very selfish and over-sexy( It's super hard to be OVER-SEXY, but she pulled it off!)Most of the songs on the album sound like they're a computer or a back-up singer.If you need a dance song or etc., look here. But if you want a true Britney album, I suggest her Greatest Hits: My Perogative or Oops, I Did It Again!, some true hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh...","review":"Now, in my opinion, Britney Spears started out as a wonderful artist, and it all went down hill from there.

Buy this CD now!Hopefully, one day Britney will pair up with say, Kathleen Hanna, and give dear Britney a few lessons on what REAL lesbians do.And if you like Britney Spears, try listening to Ashlee Simpson. Yes, that sweetheart kid-sister of Jessica Simpson.

Better than the last one....","review":"I have to admit, I was having my doubts about this new record from Britney. The last album was good, but you could tell she was hitting a dry spell. She did the right thing by taking some time off, and getting some new producers and writers. \\"Me Against The Music\\", \\"Shadow\\", \\"Outrageous\\", and \\"Brave New Girl\\" are all standouts here. Britney's voice is getting a lot better. She still needs work, but I think she has what it takes to stay around awhile if she takes a few hints from her mentor and idol, Madonna. Stay fresh, Britney! Keep changing your sound from time to time...and the pop world will remain your domain! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is music?","review":"It's amazing that Britney Spears continues to make so called \\"music\\". She has no talent, she can't sing. Yes she can dance, but that's not enough to save her. She is an empire, and there are very smart people that keep her in the public eye, which helps her get attention and the constant talk around the water cooler each day. But when it comes down to the music, what is there? Nothing. There is absolutely no substance on this album. This isn't real music, can you honestly hear any real instruments on the album? No because its all synthesized and overproduced. Anyone could have made this album, and a lot of people could have made this a better album than she did. She wants to show she's all provocative and edgy, but she's not. Every album she has this new image, and she completely contradicts herself.

I'm sorry sweet heart, you seem like a very nice girl- but stick to dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I don't see why anyone should be even thinking about buying this CD.

I do enjoy the ballad \\"Everytime,\\" but there is little I can say that is positive about this album.

So what? Does that make it any better? No! She still sucks. Although I must admit that she did get me temperarely hooked on Toxic, I soon found out thats what it is, Toxic. With her annoyingly high voice and futuristic editing I don't know what she was thinking! Not that her video was any better. Yes, I admit, her album is different from the others, but that does not mean it's any better. You've heard enough of this CD on the radio, no need to go out and buy it. It's a total waste of money.

OK, now that I said that, I believe that this album is the one of the best, like all the other albums Britney has made. It has a very good toone, all the tracks are just perfect. They really show how Britney has grown since the last 5 years. All tracks are my favorite, specially TOXIC, which was #1 for many weeks, didn't want to leave that spot :).

Her 4th album is hands down the best yet! \\"Me Against The Music\\" is a catchy song, as is \\"I've Got That Boom, Boom\\" and so many others. In no way does any of her songs sound childish, as alot of them did on her previous albums. She may be a bit racy, but she doesn't go overboard with it. After listening to this album, you will be convinced that Britney is not going away...she's still the best! BUY THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's over!!","review":"Her Career is over, my friends.

Everytime I turn on one of the music stations she is on. I would never waste my money on this crap music. Anybody can teach someone to dance like that. I also saw her also on SNL a couple of years ago and she sounded terrible. It is bad when your background singers sound better than you. She could not fake that because it is live. I will be glad when she finally plays out, like most pop artist do.

Not everyone has to sound like Christina Aguilera or Mariah Carey to make it in the music industry, and obviously tons of people adore Britney because she has been making albums.

I like her second, and third album, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"She still can't sing","review":"It might be the girl's 4th album, but some songs, literally made me want to cry, and no not from emotion, but from the fact that Britney sounds like a dying dried out old goat in heat.The melodies and beats, in some songs are nice and catchy . I loved the melody in \\"Touch of my hand\\" with a little asian sounds, and \\"toxic\\" that sounded like some techno western music, really rocked, but her raspy voice cannot reach many notes, and ruines pretty much anything she sings. Actually her attempt to \\"sing\\" is blasphemy! It's like calling processed cheese food, provolone cheese, or comparing spam to brisket.Britney is trully an intersting mutation of a female zygot, but she ain't a singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest album yet stop complaining and just give it a try","review":"this is a great mixture of genresshes better than christina aguileraall christina does is take off her clothesbritney was always like this she just tried to break it to you very slow so why does it suprise you now?me against the music 10/10boom boom 9/10showdown 10/10breathe on me 10/10 foreign uk stuffearly mornin 7/10toxic 10/10outrageous 7/10touch of my hand 10/10the hook up 9/10shadow 9/10 love endingbrave girl 10/10everytime 10/10 great great great songremix 5/10 too much beat"},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKER","review":"WHAT WAS SHE THINKING ...

If I like Britneys Music I can buy it period. If they don't like her music they have no buisness on this site they can go to what ever site they like better because you know what I don't go to pages of singers I don't like and rate them baddley so why should they get to do that?

No matter what she does, she's not going to get any respect from the critics. But In The Zone is as good as contemporary pop gets - it's fun, sexy, danceable and mature. Her voice is not a great instrument, but neither is Madonna's. What she is is expressive, sensual and energetic - she makes you feel what she wants you to feel. She had some great producers on this album, and it shows. It's probably a four star album, but I give Britney the extra star because I know she's going to take so many unfair shots from the haters. Which is too bad, because she's adorable and talented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flopney Spears","review":"Honestly, this cd has catchy tones yes, but i would say lie 70 percent of the time britney isnt even singing, and the actaly rythme of the song overpowers her voice, i would the only good song on this album is toxic, and for this u might as well jsut buy the sngle cause the rest of the album suckz, she goes from trying to be mature songs, to immature songs, that a 5 year old would like. i think she could have done a bterr job vocally lyrically, overal i gave this 1 star, i would recommend, oher albums such as Stripped which is an amazing album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn shocked","review":"I am NOT a fan of Britney Spears, but after I heard 'Toxic' I got this CD, and it is not overwhelmingly great, but it is fantastic dance music!

I was never much of a fan of Britney in the past, but she definitely gained my respect with this release! Most pop albums that are released suffer from monotony and overproduction, but ITZ has neither of these problems. The quality of songs are excellent and, more importantly, they are each incredibly different from one another. I have listened to this CD countless times and it never gets boring for this reason. Every track has something different to offer the listener and every possible taste in music is satisfied. Britney's voice is extremely well-suited to every song and she sounds better than ever! I've gotta give her major props for this album and, to those who aren't, you clearly haven't listened to it!! I strongly suggest you pick up this album even if you're not a fan of Britney.

No one is too cool, too old, too hot, too young, too smart, too dumb, too skanky, too prudish, too gullible, or too lame to listen to this mainstream masterpiece. People who give one-star reviews and say turn off the radio and listen to \\"good music\\" are pretentious fools who want to inflict their cynical beliefs onto everyone else because they are depressed from listening to Elliot Smith and Wilco. I'm In the Zone - Are you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasantly surprised","review":"I am not a Britney fan but I have liked certain songs here and there of hers as they've been released.....I bought this CD solely for the song \\"Everytime,\\" which I just love--a haunting & beautiful ballad. I was pleasantly surprised to put in the CD and find two or three other great songs in addition to that! \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Brave New Girl\\" are both very pretty songs.In general, I wish these young singers who start out doing straight pop wouldn't always end up doing rap/danceclub stuff. It gets really old.But this CD is going into my must-haves case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney's Best Album!","review":"I've been a fan of Britney ever since \\"Baby One More Time\\" hit the radiowaves. Her music really started to slide after that first album, but this one is an exception. She's got great new ideas for improving her music like hooking up with Madonna, the Ying Yang Twins, and R. Kelly for some songs. It's got great beats to dance to and definitely new flavor to the tunes. My favorites are \\"I Got That Boom Boom\\" and the remix of \\"Me Against the Music.\\" I definitely recommend this CD to anyone who loves to dance and need something fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown away by IN THE ZONE!","review":"I was blown away by this cd.

But then I remembered all the stuff about her kissisng Madonna. Also here video for that song was really gross. The end was just like on stage. Although Britney did kiss Madonna, I kind of have simpathy for her. Nothing ever came up about Madonna kissisng Christina. Well, I found the picture of Madonna kissing Christina the same night she kissed Britney. Plus, all the songs on her cd are really babish. They all sound as if she were eleven years old. Sorry Britney but after hearing about the Playboy thing and crap, I was just a bit grossed out. She'll be out of business before you know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the message of this movie: All Religions Are Equal","review":"If you are looking to remove Jesus Christ from your Christianity, then this movie is for you.

We can all go to Heaven...\\" there is but one way to Heaven, and that is by the atoning blood of Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multiculturalism Nonsense","review":"Snowboard Christmas could have been wonderful, given the theme, but the message is pure liberal propaganda. The plot and dialog are unnaturally subservient to political correctness. All beliefs and genders are equal. The predetermined ending becomes obvious about ten minutes into the story. Remakes are generally bland, and this one sure is. A big disappointment is the voice of Goliath. Oh well, we live in Orwellian times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Correct and Snowboard Stupid","review":"Although the style of this new addition to Davey & Goliath has the proper nostalgia, the strained and unnatural politically correct dialog is distracting, and seems even inappropriate in what was once considered Christian storytelling. The original purpose of this series was to teach proper behaviour to children as Davey takes his hard knocks. In this episode, the old lesson of being tolerant is revisited with a vengence -- almost as if the new writers decided to cram in 40 years of missed opportunity.One faux pas that is absolutely unforgivable and which had us all laughing out loud in disbelief at the ignorance of the writing: two bullies (male) are shown to be able boarders, but when they spot the girl with Davey and friends they shout something to the effect of, \\"Get off the mountain -- girls can't snowboard!\\" Seriously, this would never happen. Girls ROCK at snowboarding and everyone who has spent any time at all in the sport knows it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"All religions are equal\\" message","review":"If you are not a Christian parent, this review is not for you.I know there are many out there who would be pleased with the \\"all religions are equal\\" message of this DVD.

Not to poke fun, but people who like this sort of thing should find this the sort of thing they like.The music I like. Very good selections ranging from Romantic to neo-Romantic with very good to excellent performances. Some run right into each other, depending on how many appear on the disc. But there's no cut-and-paste or other sonic juggling going on, and I appreciate that in a collection. No composers appear favored, and I like that too.My faves are this one, \\"Healing,\\" \\"Love\\" and \\"Meditation & Reflection.\\" They're all out of press and you'll have to play the collector's game to get them all, but on the whole you should find that worth the effort and expense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean and Fresh","review":"Order came in quick...the tea is clean and fresh tasting.

It touches on some theory, teaching techniques, and drills. However, it did not address the three-deep zone adequately. Nor did it really address run support. A lot of time in the book was spent addressing corners, but as far as cornerbacks are concerned, they are either good enough athletes to cover receivers or they aren't. Safeties have far greater responsibilities in 2-deep, 4-deep, and 3-deep coverages and in run support. Most of these coaches give safeties a bit of a cold shoulder.

My chief complaint is that they all fail w/in about 3 weeks of use (I swim about 3000m a day, five days a week). Dissecting them shows that the internal cables are hair-thin and have all broken from metal fatigue.

If it doesn't seal properly, you don't get good sound. And these stay put in the ear. I have swum laps for an hour without any problems. All others either could not achieve a proper seal in the first place due to design flaws or eventually lost the seal due to movement during swimming. Either way, they simply didn't work for swimming laps. If you've got sensitive ear canals, you probably aren't going to be happy with any waterproof headphones.

She actually read it! She said it was a great read, very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I purchased this book for a 13 year old writer and was very disappointed. While the book may be useful for writers several years younger than her, much of what was covered in its pages is taught in late grade school and early middle school classrooms. Chapters that do hold potential--such as the one on revising--still fall short of what they could provide (particularly if your writer already revises and has others review his or her work). If you are at the point of trying to find guides and writing resources for a budding young writer, the child is probably already beyond most of what this book has to offer. If you are looking for an introduction to the very basics of dilogue, points of view, rising action, and character, this book is probably a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Writing","review":"so this book was helpful. The author does sound \\"pessimistic\\" that you may not be published, but I think she's just being realistic. It doesn't mean you're a bad writer (sometimes), but that your story isn't the one they are looking for. If you don't succeed in finishing a story, don't blame the book. It's you.I think it's a helpful book and it's great for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"New look at Love","review":"This book has an inciting mix of fantasy and reality. Like most of Anthony's books the setting in this book is magical and a fantasy. But don't be fooled by its background, for this books has incorporated in it a serious subjects, including love, loss, and the controversial theme of inter-racial relationships. This has many levels and its easy to appreciate all of them with Anthony's once-you-pick-it-up-you-can't-put-it-down style of writing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing fare","review":"This 1994 collaboration came to me used, via a friend, which I read primarily because it was available when I needed a book in hand quickly (can't be caught without reading material, now can we?). Much as I like Mercedes Lackey, this is not a book I would have bought, due to the Piers Anthony influence. I found the characters superficial, with a cumbersome and contrived sexual situation, more typical of Anthony than Lackey. I have ceased reading Anthony over the years, feeling that he has been almost a caricature of himself and extremely formulaic. I was not too surprised to discover that Lackey developed an idea/outline of Anthony's, which he then edited and added 10,000 words. I suspect I know the pages he added: there's a lot of telling, not showing, of characters' thoughts and emotions. The world is not uninteresting, and might make an intriguing role-playing game, but that's not enough to carry the book. There's lots more good fantasy out there; pass this one by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful.","review":"I like Piers Anthony unactively, and Mercedes Lackey little at all (though I enjoyed her \\"Black Swan\\"), but this book was fun, entertaining, and a very in-depth fast read.I'm more of a pleasure-reader than anything -- if something makes me think and cry, I'll never read it again. If something makes me smile and laugh and daydream -- and still think in the meantime -- then it's entirely worth my time.I read to get away from the world -- and as a female, this book struck me as a terrific blend of girl-power, social issues, and romance. ^_^;; It's not as in-depth on the social issues as some more serious readers may like, it's not feminist in the sense that men are degraded, and it's not sickeningly sex-full.No, indeed, it's a terrific girl-book for readers that like something light and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I love Mercedes Lackeys Valdemar and Piers Anthonys Xanth Series, but this book was not up to those standards. It started out all right in an interesting new setting, but even ideas that could have been breath taking suffered from the lack of personal involvement of me the reader of the book. Personally in retrorespect I think that those two authors are incompatible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Spencer's A Brother's Price instead!!!","review":"This book was recommended to me by someone who saw I liked Wen Spencer's A Brother's Price, as having a similar setting. In Spencer's fantasy novel women lead the society, women are the soldiers and farmers, it is matrifocal, while men raise the children. Men are rare and highly valued, as a result. Spencer's book is light and fun and the oldest brother, who is about ready to be married off, has adventures. READ THAT BOOK!!!This one one has a 16 year old girl Xylina, a magic user as the narrator. Faro (or Ware)would have been better choices. It's better storytelling to read the POV of the underdog than the Alpha Dog. Especially when the Alpha Dog whines as much as this one does. And goes through nonsensical changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad to boring to ugh","review":"I thought Anthony went down hill with the Fractal mode books and here he puts it into overdrive. Perhaps the authors have too different of styles. Perhaps the first part is too whiny. Perhaps the second part is too boring. But it all adds up to a waste of time and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Convoluted and just plain irritating","review":"So, I read the back of a potentially good book co-written by an author I was fond of (Until I read Fractal Mode, anyway). Great! Then I read it. It started off so well. Descriptive and successful at portraying a different society, a different world. The Demon was even interesting to me as a part of the plot, until the relationships went into this odd three-way. Stupid plot twist, just irritating. Couldn't they make up their minds? What's it got to do with the story? But that's not why I didn't like the book. By the time it GOT to that plot point, I was already bored and completely unsympathetic with the characters. Don't waste your time, just go read Dune again, but if you have to have sex, Piers Anthony goes out of his way to have nubile pre-teens go after it with adult men. Guy's got problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not up to par","review":"Although I thought the beginning was interesting and even wrenching at times, with a refreshing new idea for a setting and story line, the middle and end were vastly dissapointing. I think Ms. Lackey can do bettter than this writing even in collaboration with other writers such as in \\"Tiger, Tiger, Burning Bright\\" but this book was such a huge dissapointment that I could not even stand to keep it on my shelf"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mercedes should have written this one by herself.","review":"I like this book very much but it was obvious to me that the two authors have very different styles. Mercedes Lackey is the one to write a tale that is true to Pier's original _Arabian Nights_ source. She understands desire and its physical and spiritual interactions on many complex levels (she reminds me of Anais Nin...very real and very profound). Piers understands romance and conventional heterosexual relationships. I read his novels when I want simplicity and hopeful positive feelings. I think his style is what slowed down this particular book. I wish there were a sequel written entirely by Mercedes Lackey that deals with the tri-being relationship, the shard and the babies that will result from that relationship! and that Piers Anthony would write another great Xanth novel ..oh with maybe Electra on a quest where she gets to be an adult for a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I Pay Thee Not In Gold","review":"While this book started out promising it managed to lower my high esteem of the two authors by a notch. The book takes place in a world where women rule through illusion. One of the women risks everything for a man. The book has the makings of a intriguing story, with both inner and outer conflict. Unfourtunatly everything ends suddenly with an unsatisfactory plop. It appears that the authors became tired of their project and so wrapped it up quickly hoping the reader wouldn't notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough","review":"There is not enough information on this video, especially compared to the DVD.

She takes the climatic situation and just as the main character is stunned into silence the next phase begins at just that point with the newest lead taking over.

Just Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Divine!","review":"This novel was the Absolute Best! It was so packed with Emotion and Passion that I was hopelessly addicted to it.

I loved the complexities of the plot(s), the development of the characters, the English/Welsh setting, and, most importantly, the multiple viewpoints, which gave the book so much depth. The fact that it's based on an historical premise makes Susan Howatch's achievement even more impressive. This is the first book of hers I've read aside from the Church of England series, and I was a little nervous because everyone says that series is her best work, but I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I'm still reeling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wheel of Fortune follows what historical family?","review":"In Penmarric, Susan Howatch mirrors the lives of King Henry II, Eleanor of Acquitaine and their sons.

This book steps into the computer graphics domain, where his knowledge is only partially applicable.He fully recognizes the problems related to the limited pixel resolution of the computer screen, but he doesn't know what to do about it. In his example screens for the Museum kiosk, his vision is clear but impractical. He knows what should be done if more screen resolution were available, but fails to show how his vision can be embodied in the computer screens we really have available.I hope Tufte will rethink the subject and figure out how to properly apply the high temporal resolution of the screen to make up for its low spatial resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to content","review":"Everyone producing tons of fancy, colourful charts for management meetings (including the tons of consultans) must read this book. It helps you to impress people with graphics telling a story not by showing your deep knowledge of every goodie your tool provides.

I certainly never expected the multi-sensory bombardment which M.O.T. turned out to be. Every song has 2-3 catchy hooks which could each be the basis of its own song.

Unfortunately, this album is none of those things. I'm just hoping Amazon will give me my money back. The beats are horrible, the production sounds like it was recorded in a garage (a bad sounding garage) and the lyrics are, well, what's worse than unbearable? It's too bad because it looks like it would be a good album. The packaging is kinda cool, but it does not deliver in any way whatsoever. I suppose that's why they never released another.

Passages of a filmed version with Dawn Upahaw and David Zimnan are seen with pictures from WW2 and famine in Africa. I know we have to be aware of all this but Palmer's use of this footage is unnecessary. The music speaks for iteslf. Palmer shows scenes from the Holocaust even though Gorecki himself said that his music is not about that. The movie is more about Palmer and his overblown ideas about cinema. Gorecki is really secondary. Also many of the moments with Upshaw are in shadow. Stupid, really stupid. Listen to the CD (that has sold over 1 million copies) but avoid this dreadful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures, silly suggestions","review":"Some of the recepies were enjoyable, but on the whole not particularly exciting.

Who cares if it's punk? Everyone ranting about what punk isn't without giving a concrete definition of what punk even is. For instance, criticizing that Green Day is too easy to play, claiming they're not punk, while offering the Ramones as an example of what punk is. Don't get me wrong, I love the Ramones. But they wrote very simple, very POPPY songs and I don't see how Green Day are too far different (except that it's not \\"punk\\" to like anything remotely successful).

My favorite songs are St. Jimmy, American Idiot, and She's a Rebel. I don't see the point of making 10-minute songs. Some of the songs get boring after a while though, like BOBD and WMUWSE.

They have Jesus Of Seburbia and Homecoming which are a disgrace! I can't even get through these songs once without changing the track, it's like a faster version of Pink Floyd.Well at least green day had previus albums that were outstanding so it makes up for this.

I dont see many old fans liking this stuff, They were punkish before, with 2 - 4 minute songs and such, but this cd has 9 minute ballads.

Boulevard of Broken dreams is as simple as a tune gets (if you heard someone humming it you might think it was from the \\"Barney\\" show), but crank up the amps and it sounds sort of tough. Simiarly, Wake Me Up When September Ends becomes powerful due to the strong arranging skills of the band and/or producer.These guys will not win any awards for their chops as musicians, but that is what makes them so appealing. The 11-year old green day fan (a huge part of their fan base) can learn this stuff on his guitar at home.Their use of explicit words to make them seem rebellious or something apparently helps them sell records to young kids who think that cursing equates with cool.

Reviving the \\"rock opera\\" concept, the band looks at America through eyes clouded with rage. Starting with the hard driving title track, a song that questions his place in America as it currently exists, the narrator begins a journey from his disaffected home to the world at large; a place he discovers is just as difficult to survive in. Through trials and tribulations, he finds love and loss, momentary peace of mind and blinding anger. The music ranges from pop to punk without pause or even noticeable hesitation. This is a work of assured authority. Like any \\"rock opera\\", the \\"book\\" is often confusing and open to a variety of interpretations, but for me the bottom line was this band has taken on a most difficult of task, trying to put into words their dismay at the way the world is going. And they have succeeded admirably."},{"rating":"1","title":"not their best","review":"really... i've been a green day fan ever since their beginnings in 1988, and this album is not their best. not only is there slow emo songs like 'boulevard of broken dreams', 'wake me up when september ends', and 'we are the waiting', but it sounds less punk than ever.there are a few good songs that can satisfy: 'holiday', 'st. jimmy', 'she's a rebel', 'letterbomb', and 'homecoming'... but that's about it. if anything, you might want to get those from itunes or something.if want a good green day album, try one of the first four: '1039/smoothed out slappy hours', 'kerplunk', 'dookie' (my personal favorite), and 'insomniac', they're MUCH better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALBUM IS UNBELIEVABLE!!","review":"I've always sort of liked Green Day, but I am now an official fan!

Over all, this is THE BEST Green Day album so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Must admit I have never been a big Green Day fan. They have had a few songs over the years that I've liked but nothing that ever really got me excited. After hearing Blvd of Broken Dreams several times on the radio I took a chance on this CD and boy am I glad I did! This is a masterpiece. Jesus of Suburbia is a modern classic. Holiday, Letterbomb, Wake Me When September Ends are also great. Wasn't that crazy about American Idiot (the song) when I first heard it because it sounded like too many other songs they had already done, but even that has grown on me. This is a modern rock CD but there are plenty of influences from classic rock so if you like rock music at all, go out and get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Critic's\\" Darling That Actually Lives Up To The Hype","review":"Never a fan of concept albums per se, but here's a new moniker - \`Punk-Opera.'

In all likelyhood Green Day has assured their spot in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with American Idiot. Blvd. of Broken Dreams one day will be mentioned in the same breath with other classic songs such as Layla, Who Are You & Life In The Fast Lane.

It has some interesting songs on it. I like all the singles, but as a whole, it's not worth actually buying unless you wanna get the full feel of the album (the \\"rock opera\\" deal). The only thing I'm not too crazy about is the tone or mood of many of the songs; a little too emo-esque, like dark, depressing songs most emo kids would buy into.Nonetheless, Green Day has made a comeback and this album is pretty good work, and to those who denounce the album itself: a Grammy award and 7 out of 8 VMAs can't support those negative claims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Born and raised by hypocrites","review":"The flagship song for this CD is Jesus of Suburbia, imo. It is by far one of the best 9+ minute songs I've ever heard.The entire album goes together perfectly. In some ways it reminds me of Pink Floyd The Wall, not in the style of the music, but in how the entire album flows together like a large music opera/movie. The entire album could be a soundtrack for a movie.This is one of the best overall albums I have heard in a long long time.

Johnston from hick country and every one else who actually spent time replying to my review, when I said Billie Joe wrote 'Wake Me When September Ends' in memory of Joey Ramone, I knew that he wrote it originally in memory of his father who died from cancer when he was only ten. The only reason I said that was because any time he plays the song at their concerts he always dedicates it to Joey Ramone and also because I was just trying to prove a point, so please don't take it seriously.

Earlier efforts such as Dookie and Insomnia showed promise for the rising tide of Pop-Punk bands in the late '90's. Yet this album is a question mark to the genre. Pop-Punk was meant to be fun catchy and stupid but intellectualizing and politizing the genre made it seem that it was in its dying days. Somehow this album instead revitalized it Lables are signing Emo-Pop bands left and right indie has been compramised to an extent and Punk is all but dead. While i enjoy early Green Day I condem them for doing the unspeakable to indie and punk music C+"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it..but...","review":"Well what is there to say? I think that any green day fan would have to agree that this is one of the best albums that green day has ever released. Or at least I think so. However, I am a Republican and I must say that this album is very politically charged and controversial. A republican could find some of the lyric's quite offending. That would have to be the one thing that I am not so into on this album. But then there are the catchy songs that you can't help putting on repeat on your cd player. These songs consist of She's A Rebel, Whatsername, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and many more. And the music, guitar, etc.. is outstanding and Billy Joe proves again to have a talented and unique voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's see","review":"I've read a lot of people saying that this s GD's best album. Yes, of course it's their best album, and maybe Jimi Hendrix is still alive, he's just living as a monk in the himalayas. Cotton Hell and wheelchair Assassin are right. Go buy anything by GD up to Nimrod and ignore anything after that.

I walk over to them they say \\"MaN HaVe YoU HeArd GrEEN DaY's NeW CD iTs So PuNX\\". I said \\" Do you even know who the hell green day is?\\". They said \\"They are a new band, American Idiot is their first cd\\".Smoothed Out, Dookie, Kerplunk, Insonmiac, Nimrod, all fantastic albums.This album was just too poppy, too bland, just little girl music.I mean come on, Billie Joe even went with the whole scene/emo look.This is not Green Day.This is Scene Sellout Emo Day.Want some real Green Day?Buy any other albums mentioned in this reviewP.S.

Little did I know this album is amazing!! Oh wait never mind thats the opposite of how i felt. Their sappy new single Wake Me Up When September Ends has simple lyrics and simple guitars to try to have 12 year old girls go nuts. This cd belongs not on the top of everyone's cd collection, but in the bottom of everyone's trash can. Green Day used to pump out good solid punk music that related to people, and this September song doesn't even make any sense!! What is so bad about September?Theres just no feeling behind any of this. It's like they are just trying to appease the record labels and make millions of dollars, which they did with ease, i'm sure.Anyway, don't buy this cd unless you are a guy who wears eyeliner and/or girls pants. You are the only type of person who deserves to listen to music like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont understand the hype","review":"I've never been compelled to write a review on Amazon until I started reading some of these reviews for American Idiot.

After the disappointing \\"Warning\\" in 2000 (generally regarded as their weakest effort) Green Day has reinvented themselves with the massive megahit \\"American Idiot.\\" Although it is perhaps a bit too political and biting for some looking for subtleties, Green Day does not let their true feelings die - this and Velvet Revolver's \\"Contraband\\" are two of the best albums of the year, although \\"Idiot\\" does have a bit of filler and that's why I'm giving it 4.5/5.Oh by the way, I know everyone's going to disagree with me saying it has some filler but unless you're a die-hard Green Day fan, chances are you won't be listening to the other songs as much as American Idiot and Boulevard of Broken Dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"god they suck","review":"this is pure $h!t. who likes this album anyway? i used to think green day was cool. they seriously were raped and now they sound like this. please, oh please don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green day - thumbs down","review":"Green Day, a band that never really impressed me anyway, has taken a sharp decline in my opinion.The video to \\"american idiot\\" showing the flag of the USA in green, then bleeding, is blasphemous enough, but the lyrics are the real offense.

They weren't making that big a statement (everyone else on TV hates George W.Bush anyways, so it's not that rebellious), and are trying to brainwash the youth to their own political mistakes, oops, I mean, beliefs (ha ha). This album is not a classic, and it's deffinately not punk rock (punk rock is a 70's and 80's genre that died because of bands like this). I personally think that there was a much more well-written album that was made about a year before this one, and it was from a much better band (AFI's Sing the Sorrow). That album should be considered a classic. I remember Green Day's first big album; Dookie. It had much better songwriting and was more unique. Don't buy this album!

I was very disappointed in the song and the video. It simply was not Green Day. I have been a huge Green Day fan for three years. They are one of my all time favorite bands. Sure Green Day has not been the Green Day I love since the release of 1997's Nimrod. But this was an all time low.

Generally, this is the same stuff. Not as much of it, but still... THE SAME. Theres a few minor changes, really, i mean GEESE. Their single, Bouelavard of Broken Dreams, is one example of something different. OK, just ok, thats all it is. And it gets tiring after being played as much as every other blink 182 type pop-punk wonder. This litterely boars me. Music is not meant to boar. Music is not meant 2 b the same exact power chords played over and over. This is not energy or \\"punk rock\\" its unoriginality. The dope'll only crate songs for you for so long.

They wanted to make a statment with what they believe in when it comes to this country and where we are headed to. Out of 13 songs on the album I didn't care for 3 of the songs track 6 St. Jimmy, Track 7 Give me Novacaine, and track 9 Extraordinary Girl. Unlike some people I didn't know what to expect with this album when it came out, but I didn't buy this cd for the title track I actually desire the album for the songs Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Wake me up when September Ends, and last Whatsername. But I ended up liking 10 out of 13 songs which is a very good amount for an album like this both is lryics and music. Just don't believe everything you hear about this cd if you haven't listen to it yet just go out and buy it and listen to it with an open mind and ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come On!","review":"Green day Hs been rocking the scenes for the last 10 years but i dont like them. Mike cannot play a guitar. They give him no solos and i can see why. In Holiday he starts with a solo but its 2 power chords.

I thought oh a new green day cd to listen to. so I borrowed the cd from a friend to see if it was any good. What a piece of crap. They gave up there original sound to move on to the popular emo corporate rock sound it sounded like yellowcard (another crappy band). Because of this cd I can't stand any other green day song i hear from now on. If you like sellout popular corporate rock this cd is for you.

Probably nobody reviewing this album. Anyhow, more of their same power chord crap, empty, talentless, boring.

Some songs are good like 'she's a rebel' and 'whatsername.' 'american idiot' is good. And also 'holiday.' I prefer to get those singles.

Most of the stuff on this album could be on an Avril Lavigne record. Cliche, pop-esqued, and mediocre, the band's new album is nothing special.Coming from a long-time Green Day fan, save your money.

But perhaps Stephen Thomas Erlewine provided the best exposition on how awful this work actually is. It is important to note that Erlewine is such a fan of Green Day that he has persisted in gushing over the band's meager, lackluster efforts from the very beginning, contrary to all evidence. Here, however, in a lucid moment, he inadvertently tells the truth: \\"dismiss it after one listen as a bit of a mess.\\" That says it all. Heck, if you're really motivated to get rid of that cash, send me ten bucks and I'll send you back a mess you'll listen to once.

Unless, of course, you consider the lyrics \\"My f*cking America\\" to be political, and if you do, you need your head checked. Just because a band shouts obscenities when mentioning a country doesn't make something political. If you want a real political song that fits the recent day (and past), listen to The Offspring's \\"Baghdad\\", which still holds as true as it did fifteen years ago when it was released. That song still holds its own today, and proves that history of America (along with its ongoing mid-eastern wars, hatred, and arrogance) repeats itself. Green Day are just trying to cash in on the fact that this year is an election year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-American Music","review":"I think that this album is extremely offensive. Calling Americans idiots because they support their country is idiotic in itself. They supported Kerry who would have put his tail between his legs and ran away from the terrorists if he would have won the election. As for the Agitator who is supporting Skinny Puppy don't listen to him because that band staged a mock assassination of the president during their live shows and did a fake beheading. Absolutely sickening. And look at what the Agitator is saying about it in one of his reviews. He says they have balls for doing it. People who do suck idiotic things aren't brave. They're cowards.

In case anyone didn't notice, american idiot sounds exactly like a lot of the songs on international superhits. boulevard of broken dreams and holiday are almost exactly the same, and the rest of the album doesn't deserve any of my attention at all, even for criticism.

What it comes down to is this album contains very good punk-influenced pop/rock. A few of the songs don't really work (including, IMO, Boulevard of Broken Dreams), but others are just great tunes (e.g., Holiday), and the album as a whole is strong.

These aren't the crappy B-Sides some of those other artists have. You know, Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance. But this thing is awesome!

Peace out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"i used to think that this album was good. hell, i was stupid enough to think it was a punk album. i bought the album, and i said it was good. after a while i realized that i was kidding myself and that it was a terrible album. green day claims that they are totally against bush and that they are helping defeat him, but then they go on trl and do all this crap supporting corporations and people that they supposedly hate. they do all this while making terrible music that sounds like the the worst possible mix between the backstreet boys and my chemical romance(who are both god awful in case you are an idiot). All of their fans think its a mature record because it has a)a political statement and b)has profanity. this is sad.a terrible band and a terrible album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Me Up When The Fad Is Over","review":"Green Day is sooo kewl. Period. With such moving songs like Boulevard of Broken Records and the megarock of American Retard, I can see why they rule! They rock so hard I might need a Holiday!Forget it. Green Day sucks worse than Simple Plan and Good Charlotte's nursing baby. And that, my friends, is a whole lot of sucking."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't get it...","review":"Yes, the revolution is over, and yes, it was 30 times harderto be a punk back than, but, back then, there wasn't much to rebel about. Now we have Bush, and Democrats, and soon(probably) Hillary. No, there is not much difference, but this is good. Get a life."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BAND EVER!!!!!","review":"OMG..OMG..OMG..OMG Green Day American Idot is the best thing ever!!!! i love green day!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY RULE!!!!! ( X27 FOR BULIVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me of Operation Mindcrime","review":"A concept album by a so called \\"punk rock\\" band?? well, I was never much of a GD fan. I bought Dookie when it first came out, and liked it, but not enough to buy the other albums they came out with until I heard \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\"... I couldn't believe they could write a song with so many chord/tempo changes and to top it off, the song just kicks A**! I went out and bought the CD that day and didn't look back. to sum up, the whole album is quite simply, amazing... buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Change is good.","review":"I just read a couple reviews from a couple Green Day fans who appropriately rate this album low from the viewpoint of never wanting a band to change, always wanting the same old same old. Well, being a real person who likes to have some variety in life as well as ever escalating challenges to overcome - I can relate to why Green Day has come back to the scene with something new and fresh, yet not unlike them. This album is simply fantastic from start to end. Just like with everything new, the first few listens can leave you feeing a bit alienated. However, each time I listen I find new reasons why this is likely to be one of the best albums of the decade thusfar. But don't take my word for it - listen for yourself and give it a well deserved chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it some time!","review":"When I first heard the newest Green Day CD, I was pretty unimpressed. I'll admit, I greatly disliked Warning and was a bit leery of buying this CD -until I saw them in concert. The CD is by far one of the best Green Day has done. It shows a lot of growth and maturity, which is bad for a lot of people. Yet, these guys are 32 with children, how many songs can you write about pot and beer and teen angst when you're a father? They grew up, and it's great to see their music grow with them.Some of the subjects did change, but the basic sound is still there, and it's only gotten better with time! Their \\"rock operas\\" are truly amazing, conjuring up images of Queen and Tommy. The music is so rich, it's impossible to get sick of this CD!Some tracks to definitely listen to: Whatsername, Blvd. of Broken Dreams and Holiday."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENOUGH! To bad their isn't a star lower then one","review":"If you spent any money on this CD, you wasted your cash. This CD is the worst ever by Greenday. It is over produced and is as Pop as Pop can be. You don't believe me? Just listen to the radio, it's on at least twice an hour on several radio stations.Greenday has fallen SOOOOO low they shouldn't be calling themselves Greenday anymore. They are some totally new band that plays to the record producers and to the middle/high school crowd. Their songs are repetitve and their sounds are over played. This isn't even close to being \\"Warning\\" in its sounds. I would rather be strapped to a chair and forced to listen to Dashboard Confessional's emo bullcrap then this garbage.If you REALLY want this CD, get it from somebody who already wasted their money and save yourself almost $20. Better yet just use a tape recorder and get the songs off the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"sigh","review":"If were 15, I'd probably like this album, then again, what's really frustrating is that, a band like at the drive-in never got the praise this band has. But whatever, just listen to the lyrics, plain bad... even with the catchy riffs, and the artificial pasting of them in jesus of suburbia don't save this album.Then again taking it into context, only teenagers listen to this poor musical offer, but given the praise in the music media and pressing this gets only one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is music??","review":"Dear listeners,All though the majority of this country will contradict me,(believe it or not, I USED to be a greenday fanatic!) I think that this is almost as far from true music as possible.The musicality-- chords,overall sound is very sophomoric and rudimentry; in every song you can hear the SAME chord progression.The lyrics are about drugs and stupid things.Why don't you go listen to some Beatles, or Sigur Ros, or even classical, which, by the way, is TRUE music.I don't know why I'm making this argument; no one will listen. I hope someone out there will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable!","review":"I just got this as a present so I tried to listen to it. I am not a Green Day fan, neither do I have anything against them, but the hour or so that the album lasted was not joyful at all. All the tracks seemed the same to me, I thought that there had been a mistake and I was listening to the same song over and over again. Moreover, it is just TOO \\"noisy\\", like listening to a motorboat engine.I only hope I can change it for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Losing a Ton of Money....","review":"Why no edited version of Greenday? Yes Billy Joe, some people find cursing very offensive. Even though the music's great, they're losing a lot of money by not making an edited version, just about everyone I know would like one. And what's with the picture on front of the CD? It doesn't have anything to do with ANY of the songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most annoying band on the planet.","review":"They have no redeeming qualities. They can play maybe five chords tops. They're not musicians. And their lyrics are a joke. (Their rhythm section can't produce a worthwhile beat. Try Franz Ferdinand instead and stop listening to wannabe punk. Punk died in the early eighties.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-war.","review":"The lead singer Armstrong has stated that this is an anti-war(not anti-American) album. The record was released during the '04 election as Greenday's statement regarding Bush (Jesus of Suburbia on the record), the war in Iraq, and what the band feels is fear-mongoring. The record tells the story of fighting men in Iraq who come home to a disjointed and unrecognizeable place. Just so's you know..."},{"rating":"1","title":"green day punk i don't think so","review":"hi im not really a 13 im 14 i just forgot my password and im here say to that green day is not a good band they suck they dont sound punk and i dont know why people like this band. If you want to listen to a band thats good and talks about poltics dont listen to this listen to system of a down or rage against the machine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Pure, unequivocal garbage. You want some punk? listen to the ramones or velvet underground. If you want mass-produced music for easily-entertained apes, then this is your buy! Its not the fact that this album is so popular that its garbage, because modest mouse got wrote a decent album recently that was moderately popular. The fact is that this band writes mediocre music, with no substance whatsoever. I've heard children's albums with more depth and heart than this. But i know that most people are stupid, and stupid people are into this kind of thing, so enjoy! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful on the ears.","review":"This is definitley Green Days worst album, they sound rather polished and maufactures on thi labum as well.Green Day started going down hill with Warning.This is'nt the Punk Rock sound of \\"dookie\\" or \\"Insomniac\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody kill Billie Joe!","review":"Just kill Billie Joe Armstrong and put an end to Green Day! The end of Green Day would be the best Christmas gift ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome (crappy)","review":"OMG this is da best album ever! It's soo heavy and brutal it makes metal bands seem girly. Green Day is far better than that Boysetsfire band that someone in one of my classes listens to. Green Day 4-eva!! Boysetsfire neva!(If you believed my sarcasm, then you must have an IQ lower than the number of tracks on this cd. Bathory's Sainthood by Boysetsfire is better than anything that Green Day has ever wrote. Boysetsfire rocks!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suckes","review":"Green day along with all the other New rock bands suck.

This is a nightmare! heres the story on how I got this album. I asked my mate to copy me Ja Rule R.U.L.E, Beastie Boys To the 5 boroughs and Jay Z The black album (I like Hip Hop)and the next day he walked in and gave me Jay Z, The Beasties and THIS. I was like what is this? He said he misheard me so I thought may as well try it, I liked American Idiot. I got home, tried this last and by the end of the crappy song Holiday I was ejecting the CD out of my stereo and destroying this screaming f**k Green Day! I now spend 30 minutes a day destroying the disk. i've done all the following things to it which could help you!Stamped on it, Chucked it out my window, Used it as a frisbee for my dog, stick the disk to a wall and smash it with my soccer ball (I'm british and I call it football)and more. buy for torture.R.J from Britain"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Politics of Boredom","review":"I have heard this album being compared to the Clash's \\"London Calling\\". Whoever would do such a thing should be spanked. I am so sick and bored of all mainstream music, mainstream tv, and just poeple in general. This album is the epitmy of many years of MTV trying to shove their \\"punk\\" bands down my throat. Enough is enough, ya' know? Too much of any thing is bad. It's time to get some talented musicians some face time. Maybe talent is a long gone fairy tale that will never happen again. Some people are content to think that this is alright, and that we should just accept it. Not me. Real punk was a result of people being bored with the music industry and trying to change it, but it obviously didn't work. It seems as if nothing can stop crappy poppy bands. And this band isn't helping anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST ARTISTS OF ALL TIME","review":"1. They are the worst case of sellouts2. They have barely any musical talent3. Their songs all song alike4. They tried to become new-generation rock5. Anyone associated with them is a poser6. They are posers and have made more kids into posers7.

I can't believe so many people like that damn song, it's annoying! A lot of people actually think Green Day is punk, but they're actually just pop. There really aren't any punk bands around anymore because punk is dead. I don't get how this crap is supposed to \\"save rock.\\" This crappy music is the anthem to dumbass teenagers smoking, getting wasted, and having unprotected sex. Green Day is the anthem to morons in general. F*** Green Day, that's all I have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"The American Idiot is you my friend","review":"Another bland, predictable \\"effort\\" by Green Day. How can any of you say \\"American Idiot\\" brings anything new to the table that this band hasn't been overdoing for the last 10 years. Honesty, their first record was pretty good, why now does American Idiot sell so many records. It shows no improvment or difference in style, and shows absolutely no originality or talent. Your all a bunch of idiots for buying American Idiot, but I guess thats the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Idiots","review":"They forgot the \\"S\\" at the end of the album name. These guys are prime examples of \\"American Idiots\\".

American Idiot is by far the best song. It's a nice fast heavier sound. They also slow it down in some parts of the cd with Blvd of Broken Dreams, and Wake Me Up When Sept Ends. The production is pretty good, it sounds like it should. I also like the upbeat St Jimmy. Thats a good fast tune. Towards the end of the cd they slow it down a lot, and it starts to get old. But my biggest problem with this cd, isn't the cd, but the radio. They overplayed blvd so much that its one of my least listened to songs on the cd. I also think they give Holiday too much credit, that ones just ok for me. But overall, good cd, if you like hard rock but not metal, or both, pick this one up, you'll like it. The end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Idiot!!!","review":"I heard the song \\"American Idiot\\" and was HOOKED by its catchy tune! After buying the C.D. however, I have found thats not even the best song on the C.D.! I give this C.D. 5 stars because after hearing the whole album i instantly became a fan and went out and bought Green Day's \\"International Superhits\\". In my opinion, Any CD that can make you buy an earlier one, is a great one. Although I feel there music style changed a little from \\"Dookie\\" to \\"American Idiot\\", I feel the change was good. However i prefer thier older stuff. Anyway, Most of the songs on this CD will just stick in your head and you will find yourself singing them all over the place. The CD contains two, over 7 minute songs that almost give it a Bohemian Rapsody (didnt spell that right)feel. All of the songs are great on this cd, but my favorites are definately Holiday and Homecoming!!! BUY THIS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"To tell you the truth i never even new who Green Day was until after i heard American Idiot the song. I am one of those Usher fans Fans that are so lovin his body that they don't know what else is going on in the music world, exept what they show on VH1 and MTV. So one morning i was up whatching the top 20 coundtown and american idiot came on. from the second it started i wanted to know who it was and where i could get that CD. A week or so later i heard boulvard of broken dreams and fell in love with the song....yes, im sorry Usher, but i would have to say boulveard of broken dreams is a little better then SOME of your songs. I found my self going on iTunes and buying the whole CD cause i loved it so much! now its on my iPod, and i listen to it every day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Draw!!","review":"This cd I am happy to say is every bit as good as dookie is. It just reflects an older and more mature Green Day. Something, wesaw a little of on Nimrod and a lot of on Warning. There music has finally transitioned into reflecting the adults they have now become and the result is nothing short of amazing. I look forward to seeing a lot more from them in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Green Day album","review":"Green Day are one of my favorite bands of the 2000's. Their newest release, American Idiot is really good which has rocking songs in Jesus of suburbia, holiday, and give me novacaine. Thisis much better than anything by the Beatles. Get this album along with CDs from Dire Straits, Foreigner, Nirvana, GNR, and Metallica and Warning, but stay far away from overrated bands like Beatles, Black Sabbath, and Queen who suck.The Kid Who Loves Waiting For A Girl Like You."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hating a band because they aren't \\"true\\" punk rock is one of the most ignorant things I've ever heard.","review":"If you don't like Green Day, that's fine. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. But if you hate a band because they aren't punk, you're an idiot. Some of you just need to accept the fact that some of us are going to like Green Day. Have any of you even listened to a Green Day song? I bet you haven't. It's not fair to call all of us fans preppy girls who go by whatever MTV tells us to do while we wear heavy eyeliner and slit our wrists in our rooms and cry because our parents won't take us to the mall. That sort of thing applies only if you do watch MTV. I've never watched MTV, and I don't plan to anytime soon. I own all of Green Day's albums and am proud to say I enjoy them all.I like Green Day, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. But if I'm a poser/prep because I like a certain band, then I guess I'm a prep."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest album ever!","review":"Almost every song on this album was great!

I admit I like the earlier Green Day music a little better, but this is one of the best punk rock albums ever made. Now, if any of you have a brain in your head, you'll know that Billie Joe is NOT dissing America... he's simply telling it like it is, and if you can't realize that than I think you should get out of the country because you're what's ruining it. Everyday I am surrounded by lazy idiots who are screwing this country with their brainless selves. The problem here is that no one in American wants to work at all anymore, they just think it's a free ride... and it's not. If any of you want to see America stay powerful I would suggest actually taking advice from Billie Joe's songs. They're alot more powerful than you'll ever know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great punk but a little explicit","review":"This is a great CD by Green Day, even though it is a little explicit. It has two popular songs played on the radio, both American Idiot and Boulevarde of Broken Dreams. The rest of their songs are good as well. I would recommend this CD for those of you who like punk and rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh come on...","review":"seriously, this album is horrible. yeea, it was a good way to get on mtv and make millions of little teenagers buy their album. i'm sure more than half of the people who bought this can't even vote yet. it's not even the fact that its all political, its that they play all power chords.want to know the first thing i learned on my guitar? power chords! believe me, i can play these songs and i'm pretty horrible at guitar. get over the fact that they can play something political, so can any other band. go find some band that is doing it for the music and not the fame and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Green day!.","review":"All i can say is, it's got great guitar playing, it has awesome lyrics. and billie joe's voice is really good for singing.So go and get this Cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Of 2004.

Why did Green Day have to sell themselves out? I mean, I'm still a fan of all their past albums, but this is by far the worst ablum I've heard in years (well, second to anything by 50 Cent).This would have been great if: 1. they didn't go with a mainstream alternative/rock sound. 2. it wasn't heavily laden with politics. See, I want to listen to music, not hear somebody's political viewpoint.And, please, everybody stop calling Green Day punk. They are not punk. Take it from a fan of the band, they are not punk. They are alt/rock/pop. \\"They're punk because they rebel against the system\\". That would actually make them hippies. Punks rebel against society and they don't care what people think of them. Green Day does care and they're not rebelling against the system. They're not punk.Anyways, if this is the direction this band is going, I'm just going to have to turn my back on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Band really could one of the worst ive ever heard","review":"first of all. i used to think greenday was awesome. until i relised they aren;t doing it for the music.they get payed millions of dollars to play instraments they arent even good at. the reason people like them is because they listen to classics with talent change a few chords and put lyrics saying they hate poser sell-outs and that the government is bad. then they get some famous butician to dress them up to make them look like a \\"punk\\". i personally put these dumasses under the line them up and shoot them category.the people actually saying this is good probably never even seen a real punk preformance before. and are even worse then greenday itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"they are NOT punk!","review":"bands like these piss me off, they start out as a perfectly good punk band and then they turn pop on our asses! if you think your punk cuz you buy this cd, smack yourself!! i support the cause, bush sux! but come on! its a pop boy band with guitars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why I have little faith in modern bands","review":"Oh my god what have they done? Is it just me or is it that ever scince the release of this new album Green day has become another one of MTV's little drones? The fact that they would spend as much money as they did on a music video is actually quite anti-punk and offends me greatly. If you have no depth and don't care about whether or not a band is a big money seeker with no other goal then you might like this, if not search elsewhere. If you must have your Green day fix please listen to their older albums and only if you absolutley need to because those arn't that great either.

And they couldn't have done it any better. Their daring Punk Rock Opera \\"American Idiot\\" features the rocking headline track American Idiot, the amazing Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and the headbanging Give Me Novacaine. The album sets the standard for punk rock in a way never thought possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of 2004?","review":"When speaking of music, people generally do not understand when I distill the terminology to simply, rock & roll. American Idiot is great rock & roll. Monikers developed in the last 40+ years describing genres beyond basic rock & roll matter not. When you hear great rock & roll there's just no denying it. Dissecting the work, suggesting some songs are \\"A\\"s while others are \\"B\\"s miss the point of a work in it's entirety. The music and lyrics on this CD merge into a consummate whole. American Idiot, as such, deserves a grammy nod (IMHO). I have been waiting since 1967 for Brian Wilson's epic opus; SMiLE. American Idiot overshadows that other incredible 2004 release for me (blasphemy even in my own mind but A.I. rocks . . .) JV"},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Day's Best Album in YEARS","review":"I loved Green Day when I first heard them in a confused adolesence frame of mind. Since then everything i've heard by them has been less than mediocre. Not Blink 182 bad, but not Dead Kennedy's good. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a punk album by any means, but one of the best straight ahead rock records released this year. I wanted to hate the album when i heard about it, then we played it at work, and i was converted. The new album is an astounding piece of sonic art that all should purchase, no matter what your preference is, you will love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you call this punk?","review":"This is one of the worst albums I've ever heard. All the songs are stupid manufactured commercial radio pop. And everybody calls it a \\"punk opera\\". It's not punk and it's far from an opera (in fact, I think fat Italian women singing gibberish would help this album). If you want real punk go look for Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, Sex Pistols, Misfits, Casualties, Damned, Stooges, and MC5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green Day??? more like Gay Day","review":"truely, these guys suck, WHERE ARE THE GUITAR SOLOS?

Nothing more and nothing less. Boulevard of Broken Dreams? it was good the first few times I heard it, now it's so repetitive and just boring, same with American Idiot, Holiday, and Wake Me Up When Setember Ends.The one thing no one gets is:REAL ROCK BANDS DO NOT DRESS UP IN BLACK AND RED, AND [laughs],WEAR EYELINER AND MAKE UP.TRUE ROCK IS NOT ABOUT IMAGE OR MUSIC VIDEOS.IT'S ABOUT GOOD MUSIC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha....","review":"Since when Greed day start making songs that have season or month? Wake Me Up When SEPTEMBER Ends??? That is real funny when I saw it on TV, I can't believe it! Green day become an EMO band!! Just like FALL out boys, early NOVEMBER, taking back SUNDAY, etc,.etc.,A good emo band shouldn't name their album American Idiot, it's not emo and it's idiot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This CD is perfection. Thank god someone like Greenday spoke out, we need bands like them to be our voices. The album flows perfectly from song to song and you will end up listening to it over and over and over again and never get tired of it, unless of course you are someone who is blind to the world and the mess we are in, and in that case I could care less what you think and I doubt Mike, Billy, or Tre do either. BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its not Anti-American, its just awesome music","review":"okay, so as some ppl have said, the song American Idiot is Anti-American. but u always must think of free speech. but thats besides the point. this is just the greatest album ive heard in a long time. ive been listening to sugarcult and have been LOVIN it, but this album blows them away. you can relate to some of these songs, and some are just plain fun like \\"She's a Rebel\\" and \\"St. Jimmy\\". this is the album to buy if u want the ultimate Punk Rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great C.D.!","review":"My name's Dan & i would just like to say that this is a very great c.d. if u think that life is unfair & that no 1 can ask for a \\"perfect\\" life.

WOW BEST SONG ON THIS C.D.!!Whatsername- 10/10 another 1 of my favorite songs!There's my review... hope this helped u to go out & buy this rockin' Green Day album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mainstream punk with an intelligent message","review":"I don't really care whether this band is \\"commercial\\" or \\"pop punk,\\" because the fact is, they're a good band. It's impressive - and slightly comforting - to see a CD so overtly political receive so much radio play and media attention. Unlike other punk bands, Green Day is accessible to not just those with a rarefied knowledge of music, but anyone familiar with radio, MTV, Vh1, etc. (I'm assuming that's most people). And I think that's a good thing, because, unlike so many popular groups nowadays, Green Day have a smart, valuable message: think for yourself and advocate for your rights and freedoms. I'm glad that \\"American Idiot\\" has experienced such great success, because Green Day is a talented, politically savvy band that churns out solid, catchy music with important implications."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best rock albums in a decade","review":"This is truly an all american rock album! Every track is great and displays the musical maturity of this legendary group.It's not often that I buy an album and enjoy every song...this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD and very addictive!","review":"I got this CD a week ago and have been listening to it almost exclusively. If you already like Green Day you'll really appreciate the maturity of their latest release. If you haven't listened to Green Day before, this is a great place to start. Throw caution to the wind and spend the cash. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope THIS greenday isn't here too stay","review":"I havent been a major fan of greenday, but i can remember singing along to the minority video in 3rd grade. Hell i even remember seeing longview on tv, and i think their older pre 2004 stuff isnt that bad. Unfortunately, this album gets repetetive and annoying. Maybe it is the radio overplaying it, but sorry, all you 13 year old teeneebopping girls who think otherwise, the songs arent that great. I always switch off my radio when they come on, i find them seriously iritating. Whenver i hear an old greenday song, i leave it on. This album proves a step down into the mainstreem MTV teenebopping pop world for greeenday, and i hope maybe someday they're return to their roots.Avoid.2/10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter rubbish.","review":"I am a 13-year old junior high student.I try to listen to \\"good\\" music,like Radiohead, Joy Division, Smashing Pumpkins,Cocteau Twins, Wilco, etc.Everybody at school listens to this album.Over and over and over. It's so dumb. Every little snotty kid asks for this for Christmas. And it's possibly the lamest album I've ever heard. So many cliches...so much fluffy pop...This is PUNK? This is anything but punk. Is it \\"punk\\" to be MTV darlings, making cliche-filled video after another? Is it \\"punk\\" to lodge 2 songs on the radio to be played 6 times a day? Listen to classic punk from the 70's (e.g., the Ramones, The Clash, X-Ray Spex). It's so much more passionate than this hunk of crap.Green Day has totally sold out.

Green Day was a decent band that lived out its heyday during the early 90's punk revival. Now they are trying to repackage their tired 3 chord tricks in the form of a \\"concept album,\\" with drawn out epic versions of basic Green Day pop diddies, and a few 'sensetive' tracks to grab the attention of the easily swayed MTV crowd. It's decent for what it is, but I certainly don't think it deserves the ridiculous amount of attention its been getting. Try listening to a real concept album, like Yes' \\"Close to the Edge,\\" or Pink Floyd's \\"Animals,\\" and then listen to \\"American Idiot\\" and decide for yourself whether Green Day is really as 'ingenius' as they've been made out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh god....","review":"ANOTHER pop band with 12 year old girl fans that will listen to anything they see on MTV. They were decent when they made Dookie way back when, but god, they've just joined the rest in the pathetic MTV line of bands that you'll never see again in 10 years.METAL UP YOUR ASS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"These guys have gotten a lot better since their last albums, which were a little too \\"pop\\" for me. This album on the other hand is pretty catchy. Everyone has (or should have) heard \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"Boulavard of Broken Dreams\\" before (they're constantly playing the music videos on MTV). But it's the massive 9-10 minute song \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" that impresses me the most. Although it's not the best track, it manages to keep you entertained for the whole 9-10 minutes... not something a lot of bands can do. All in all this is a pertty damn good album, it's a little too slow for my taste, but still very good. Green Day fans should love this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk Rock Opera?!?!","review":"This album is great. Its strength comes from the fact that it is not simply leveling its anger at 9/11 politics and Bush, but it is digging deep into disposable suburban trash culture, isolated and apathetic to the horrors around it. Green Day is raging against the loss of feeling in themselves and the world around them. American literature (Richard Yates, Arthur Miller, Norman Mailer) has been doing this for years, its about time r'n'r stepped into the breach and bashed the dead and decaying consumer culture of TV and Fast Food that we can't seem to get enough of. Green Day has been gorging themselves on it just like everyone else, and they're here to say enough! They Don't Care if We Don't Care! This album is bigger than liberalism vs. conservatism, it deals with how happy you can be with the place you live and call home, and Green Day aren't that happy in the America of today. Neither am I, but I'm a little bit happier after hearing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true roots of Green Day","review":"Doesn't any reviewer here see that the root of Green Day's two fantastic \\"American Idiot\\" mini rock operas is The Who's \\"A Quick One (While He's Away)\\", and that, more than The Clash, the seminal influence on Green Day is The Who, the prototypical, Godfather of punk rock? Watch The Who perform \\"A Quick One\\" in the brilliantly remastered DVD edition of \\"The Kids Are Alright\\" and tell me that I'm wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"from a punk","review":"I am not a big fan of huge stars, or media mogules, but I've been a fan of Green Day forever, since I was like 6 or 7.

Buy this now, no regrets, love."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMERICAN IDIOT ROCKS!!!","review":"Hey.I got the American Idiot CD after a long battle with my parents, and I am so happy I did. It may seem like a super political, biased disc, but it really isn't. So ya, Green Day wrote two or three songs about their opinions. Exactly that. THEIR OPINIONS!!!!You don't have to hate Bush to truly enjoy this CD. There are several songs that have nothing to do with politics and are awesome to rock out to. And if you really listen to the words in \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", I think you'll get what i mean. Even my dad liked it, and he was the one who didn't want me to get it!!! Definitely five stars, and i hope you people have the 'time of your life' listening to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"man i can't belive this band still has it in them to keep thier style and not to sell out this is a great cd go buy it now!! dammit..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was skeptical","review":"A friend of mine bought this early the day it came out and called me raving about it that night. I was skeptical at first, having heard the single before and not really being happy with it. I went out and bought it and listened to it all the way through.This is really a well done album and shows the band's maturity. The music builds off all of their earlier stuff but is different in its own way. It might become my favorite green day album to date, my favorite song was holiday and my least favorite was american idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Radio Friendly for me","review":"Dookie was great.This is just basicly every track but 3 trying to get on the radio .While all the pop punk fans want to feel part of somethign and say wow they are really doign something no one has ever done wow.But the fact is that Punk Rock has been about qestion issues since the begging and now 30 years later green day gets the memo and it's like wow Green Day really pushed issues . News Flash nothing is life changing about this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG! This album SERIOUSLY kicks ASS!!!!","review":"I can't believe it, This album kicks this much ass! I am listening to Jesus of Suburbia from the almighty \\"American Idiot\\" as I write this. This song is just the first reason to buy it as well as Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

Seriously BUY THIS NOW!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Never Bought a Green Day CD Before...","review":"But this one hooked me!I don't know what it is, but this is one kick ass album that I can't stop playing over and over again, and all of the tunes are so f'n catchy.I say, buy it, it's aiming to please, and it does, there's something on it for just about everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"New meaning to Ripped off","review":"Well, reading through these reviews, I figured, hey, doesn't seem bad, rarely have reviews been so wrong. Where do you I even start, I don't want to make too much of it, because my 2 stars should pretty much speak for themselves, but there is nothing new in this at all. There is no innovation, you pretty much hear the same riffs and powerchords in every song. They all kind of run together and blend, unfortunately, with a non-cohesive overall experience. I guess I should have known what I was getting into. I'm glad I have Motorhead's Inferno to get me through the disharmony that American Idiot left in my mind. Sure made me feel like an American Idiot when I bought it.The only reason I gave it 2 stars is the fact that I definately have some listening bias, and although this would appeal to some, you're all better off just burning it, and saving your money for something good (like Motorhead's Inferno, or Megadeths The System Has Failed)."},{"rating":"1","title":"BULL S***","review":"Alright, I go to school with a bunch of Abercrombie and fitch wearing skater fagets like all of you who say this s*** is music.

If you know absolutely nothing about the band but think you might want to get into it, this is a good place to start. Or just get Dookie, that's an awesome album too.

One of the lines is \\"She's holding on my heart like a hand grenade.\\" Man, it took me MONTHS to figure that out!

American Idiot is overplayed and worthless. For a GOOD song using the word Idiot, try Bob Dylan's masterpiece Idiot Wind, particullarly the intense, ten-minute plus live version. The only good song here is holiday, the rest is bad. Look into the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Bob Dylan, Steely Dan, James Brown, U2, Nirvana, Coldplay, Parliament, the Pretenders, the Ramones, the English Beat, the Jimi Hendrix Experiance, anything Eric Clapton ever worked with, Bob Marley, Marvin Gaye, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker and Charles Mingus (plus countless others) for some great music.

People say their sellouts i dont because they were never big enouf to be a sellout. Their music really sucks its kinda like if the backstreet boys got bored being a boy band and decided to take a stab at rock. Their lyrics just thrash the government thats not original bands were doing that since the 60's come on try something new my gosh. Even if you do like this band you wouldn't require this cd since their horrible music is ethier always on mtv are as i call \\"queer tv\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure if they're american but idiot is right!!!","review":"I'm going to be straight up honest with ya'll. American Idiot was the worse crap I've ever heard. They're like Ozzy Osbourne or the KISS group. A bunch of gothic losers who can't sing at all.Why would they call themselves American Idiot? is that funny? What's the deal with these white males who dress gothic? Good Charlotte is wack! Helena is wack! and other female names with gothic virgins group.\\"Green Day\\" was so bad. They are pathetic goths who need to get a life!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of American Idiot","review":"Any one who has heard true punk rock knows that Green Day definitiely doesn't fall under that category. They are a watered down, commercialized imitation. Their lyrics are little more than socio-political cliches and their guitarwork is simplistic at best. Their songs all blend together after awhile, with no distinguishing attributes in any of them. Billie Joe Armstrong's grating vocals are as irritating as the lyrics. Tracks like \\"Dearly Beloved\\" sound more like pop than rock and in \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" Armstrong whines and tries but fails to be profound. Furthermore, their whole attempt at a \\"concept album\\" is merely a self-absorbed conceit on the part of these inept wannabe rockers and lacks any real creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"TO ALL YOU STUPID PEOPLE COMPARING GREEN DAY TO LED ZEPPELIN","review":"I DONT MIND GREEN DAY'S MUSIC AT ALL.

This is one of the better recordings in recent years. The idea of a punk opera is really amazing. The talent to make it work is true incredible.

Then do it again. The amazing thing is that after 10, 20, or more spins, it only sound better and better. Maybe you'll hear a nuance you didn't hear the first, second, or 20th time. As others have written, there's not a bad cut - the only hard part is deciding which song (or movement - this really is a complete concept album) is best. It just plain ol' doesn't get boring or tiresome - not in the least. Of course, that is assuming that you don't set your CD player to play track 1 - the title track, \\"American Idiot\\" - over and over, since it has the best rock hook since I don't know when.When Grammy time rolls around this album BETTER be nominated and in an ideal world there's a good chance it would win because I couldn't imagine a better set of songs coming out this year - or any year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Master Minds","review":"This is the best of Green Day!

Green Day shows an amazing range of influences in this watershed album, building on the themes that shape the rest of their body of work in ways that may be unexpected by some. Perhaps only Green Day could have come up with such a risky project in this \\"age of paranoia,\\" but they do it with a style all their own, tounge firmly planted in cheek.

It was just one great blurry moments.Years from now, I will proudly tell my son that daddy's around when the first commercial legendary opera-punk 'American Idiot' was released by the mighty Green Day.

Yes, this album has found its way to the front of my cd collection and it's staying there. I've listened to it 3 times now and am convinced that it's one of, if not the, best album of the year.

But the main point is, the songs on this album are pretty dern terrible. Green Day have failed, as we all knew they would eventually. If you want a good rock opera check out the Who's \\"Tommy\\".

Punk bands aren't supposed to be high and mighty like Green Day. If you want truly complex yet heavy music, Get one of Rush's (a heavy prog rock trio from Canada) early albums, like 2112.

Next time you release an album and claim it has nothing to do with politics, please don't come back a year later and claim it has a strong political message. Wake Me Up is and was never about 9/11 so why is it all of a sudden about just that? How much more money/respect/acknowledgment do you need?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I'll never forget the first time I listened to AI. I loved American Idiot, Blvd of Broken Dreams & Holiday but as soon as I heard \\"I'm the son of rage and love, the Jesus of Suburbia\\" I was entranced.Unlike many albums these days, there are no fillers. Every single song is wonderful, but I remember immediately loving Give Me Novacaine, Jesus of Suburbia, Extraordinary Girl & Letterbomb.People should really give this album a chance instead of writing it off as a anti-American/anti-Bush album. 2 out of the 13 songs are political so that's just ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This cd is one of the best.

I was never really into this band because when they were popular while I was in high school, I had gone backwards a bit and got into more of the classic rock. But my husband recently bought this CD and told me to check it out. Of course I've seen the video for \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" quite a few times and I really like that song, but the rest of the CD is just as good, if not better. My favorite song has to be \\"Are We The Waiting\\". It reminds me of the 80s. Also love \\"Holiday\\", \\"St. Jimmy\\", and \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\". Check out the second section of that song. Sounds like Motley Crue's \\"On With The Show\\" (something my husband pointed out). This is a great CD for anyone, especially if you're wanting something different. They definitely deserve a Grammy or two for this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best album ever!","review":"this is the best album ever released no matter what the people that gave it 1 star say i think its wicked and so does everyone else i know!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Day: still rocking","review":"Green Day still has it. I love this album for it's anger, honesty, and beauty. Wake Me Up When September Ends has set a new standard for the music industry when it comes to their songwriters. This is one of their best works ever. Bille has a voice so strong, and this record makes a social imact, too. VEry thoughtful, and poetic, while rocking out at the same time. I recommend this with My Chemical Romance, Nirvana, Evanescence, Corinna Fugate, and anything by the Doors."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!

I love everything about it!Every song has some amazing hook or lyric that you will find yourself constantly humming or thinking about. Billie Joe's voice sounds fantastic, too! I love the cover art as well. I would give anything to see one of the handful of shows where they are going to perform the whole record. Hopefuly they will record it and release a DVD in the future! I hope people won't be put off by the \\"rock opera\\" tag because it's so much better than that. Even though some of the songs have long track listings, there's so many changes in tempo and structure that it's like three or four songs in one.

The riffs (If you could call em that)are junk and half the songs are filler. there are a few good songs like Holliday thats why I cant give it 1 star.

Greenday matured with age but havent lost touch of there roots which have never been clear punk, alternative or rock. They have always blazed there own path and this new album is a clear sighn. I cant say it resembles any past greenday album although you may fine sighns of a Nimrod or a 1039. A good alaround album but watch out like all good (not great) albums it can get old if overplayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Treat","review":"It's been ten years since I purchased CD that got me this excited.

This album is mostly great, tracks 1,2,3,4 are the best and the rest of the album is pretty good, i would probably say track 4 is my favorite, its a really deep song. The vocals are improved, but really he stayed pretty much the same, tres drumming is as usual incredible, and of course the bass work and guitar work is simple yet still rocking and soundin great. Overall its probably their 3rd best album so definetly you should get it. 8 out of a 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally not Green Day...Old School fans know that!","review":"The only song on this cd that sounds like traditional GOOD Green Day is American Idiot...a good song with awesome lyrics that reflect what anyone could see is going wrong with America through the media....but the rest of the album is ballads!!! Green Day are a punk rock band, descendants of the Ramones...so why do they have to make a concept album? Rock N Roll isnt brain surgery and if they had stuck to their working formula this album would be absolutely kick-ass just like every other album from them. I'm not saying that I want the same album over and over again...Green Day doesnt do that. I mean Warning had slow mellow songs but it worked and it was quirky(like Misery). I love that album. But for the first time since the beginning I am disappointed. Hopefully next time they will make another Punk Rock record minus the piano and ballad sound. Stick to the good stuff, dont buy this one this time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok...","review":"I'm sorry but Green Day is so overrated; easily the most overrated band of the decade. The music isn't even interesting or thoughtful. The songs are so repetitive, basic, and full of hooks: perfect cocktail for the mainstream audience to gobble up.

Green Day just shoulda sticked to their roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"UK Fools","review":"What a crock of **** this is , its meaningless wailing of the sort you guys seem to lap up at present.

Every little poser who only likes music they see on MTV is a huge \\"fan\\" of Green Day, probably not even knowing that they have other, much better, albums. Green Day sold out.

Sept ends Sounds more like a cheesy bon jovi song to me and thats really bad a for a so called \\"punk band\\". The only song I enjoy is holiday which i thought was decent at best.Conclusion: I am over with green day and they'll probably have a new fan base of 13-15 year olds.. There r so many better new bands out there today. I suggest u spend your money on other new albums by new bands like arcade fire, franz ferdinand, bloc party, interpol, kaiser chiefs,razorlight, or even u2 who I believe r still king eventhough they made that cheesy ipod commercial!"},{"rating":"1","title":"they were once...alright.","review":"2 1/2 ,I saw Greenday Play many years ago ( 1991) they openedfor some local bands I was into and at the timeI thought they were pretty good.

There is no comparison of this album to the classic ones done by Pink Floyd, The Who, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.

Green Day are a complete rip off of not very well known and much better punk band from the 80's called the Descendents, listen to their music and you will see obvious similarities. Anyway, why am I wasting time here, I don't even like punk that much, much less Green Day.

However, LOOKOUT! records was beginning to treat them more like assets than a band, so they had to leave. They were hesitent about signing with a major label, but they were promised complete and total freedom, for less cash, that is. They took it. Now, that's punk rock, not punk mock. Yeah, so next time you decide to bash this band to boost your ego, or whatever other dumb reasons you decide to, take THAT into consideration.

Although it is written for a juvinelle audience, my husband and I loved reading it because it reminds us of little boys who hate school and how they challenged teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for 5th graders","review":"As a fifth grade teacher, this is by far my favorite book. I love the theme, the dialogue, the ending. It kept my kids engaged and was accessible to various levels and interests. Would recommend for a book report idea or for adults looking for a quick, fun read. It has something for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Teachers","review":"I am a college student and read The Teacher's Funeral for a class on young adult literature. I really enjoyed the book and don't see why others would not - it is wonderfully written.I also want to say that this book can be seen as one about teachers, not just one about a boy who lived long ago in Indiana. If you look at the difference between Tansy's style of teaching and Ms. Myrt's way, there is definately something to be said about what is effective in the classroom and what is not.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a teacher, or to anyone who loves a read about the good old days and country living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaing little book.","review":"I am a pretty big Richard Peck fan and this book did not disappoint me. It's not his very best -I think that would be A Long Way From Chicago- but Peck's humor and knack for charming a reader with small town flair is very present. This story is quite predictable but then again it is a simple tale. You won't find a mystery or intrigue, just a good yarn. Over all this is worth your time and money. As a teacher I'd recommend it for fifth or sixth graders who enjoy Americana themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comedy in all Parts","review":"I loved this book along with many of the others Richard Peck has written. He truly transported me back to the early 1900's and what it was like to farm and live back then. My ancestors settled rural Indiana in 1800's but I doubt they had as much fun as the Culver family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vary Good Read","review":"This book has a great story and it is awesome the way your find out what happens to them all in the end. The language was alittle difficult for my 12 year old son to get used to, but he thought it was worth it and so did I."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best book","review":"This book disappointed me a lot. I thought it would be a lot funnier since part of the title is \\"A comedy in three parts.\\" Plus the main characters pull the worst pranks. In addition to that one character in the book wants to go to Montana for no good reason and the ending is horrible.I would highly suggest that you not pick this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comedy Indeed","review":"When the teacher at Hominy Ridge School, a one-room school in rural Indiana, suddenly dies, the school is in jeopardy of closing. This is fine with fifteen-year-old Russell Culver, who wants to quit school to join a team of harvesters working the new steel threshing machines. Russell's dreams of quitting school are dashed when his older sister, Tansy, takes over as teacher. With the required eight students enrolled, Tansy takes her new role seriously. Faced with vandalism, snakes, fires in the privy, and stolen supplies, Tansy not only manages to keep the school open, but also manages to change the direction of Russell's life. Peck's humorous portrayal of life in rural Indiana at the turn of the twentieth century is a pleasure to read. Grade 6 up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Teachers Death...mwahahahah","review":"I read this novel for a book report. I definetly enjoyed this book! It is filled with humor to keep you laughing thoughout this book. I think that many kids can relate to this book, wherein they do not want to start school again, and don't intencionally want there teacher to become sick, but every kid has dreams. There is a twist...with one of the main characters! I think that this should be a book that you read in your literature circles."},{"rating":"2","title":"amy's review","review":"This book is so funny.It talks about a kid named Russle. He is telling the story about his teacher whodies. Since there are no teachers around Russel's hoping that there will be no school.

Like one time he got a blanket and he wraps it around the school bell but in the morning to there suprise he here a clang clang.In many other parts of the story boys are after Tansy in the end there's a suprise on who she marries, read the book and find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"I absolutley loved this book. Richard Peck blends hummor so well into his stories and this one is no different. Very vivid characters allow us to follow as though we were in the story.

My group didn't laugh at all, but then when we had to make recomendations to tell others to read the book. That HAD to have been one of the hardest things in my life. Though it was well written, I'll give Richard points for that, but still, even though this book is meant for kids 11-15 it most probably will not interest the kid at all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Disc","review":"I finally got around to buying this cd, not quite sure what to expect. What I got was a very pleasant suprise. Russ Lawton and Mike Gordon hook up on some extremely sick grooves. Bela Fleck and Gordon Stone add some really cool textures. The overall sound on this disc is extremely unique, somewhat of a cross between The Flaming Lips, Ween, and Phish, Mike's songwriting and harmonic structure is very strong on this disc. If you are a fan of his recent writing efforts (Clone, The Collin's Missile, Car Carrier Blues, Round Room, Mock Song) you will really be impressed with this cd. It is his best solo work on record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allen in Downtown Ambient Spacejazz Territory","review":"My Polish comrade below has his facts confused: none of the music on this album was written by Glass or McCartney. It is indeed a mystic wonderful album, however, produced by Hal Willner, the imaginative impresario who also created the jazz-savvy tributes \\"Weird Nightmare\\" and \\"Amarcord Nino Rota.\\" This album lays moody, resonant readings of Allen's poetry into atmospheric and haunting jazz soundscapes played by NY's best and brightest: Arto Lindsay, Marc Ribot, Bill Frisell. The recording of \\"Kral Majales\\" in perhaps the best musical setting of Allen's poetry ever done -- all of this is passionate, intelligent music, with Allen's Jovian Blake voice the dark jewel at the center."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten extra can't go wrong.","review":"I was looking for some CD-R and came across many that look the same and many that offer the same thing.

Shawn Brice's music is as rhythmic as it is beautiful. From the passion and strength of \\"Heat\\" to the calm and serene softness of \\"Lullaby\\", you are taken on a trip for the ears that should not be missed. Maria Azevedo's vocals seem stronger than ever...but there's something else there that wasn't there before. She has exorcized the anger from the past leaving her free to express her new found love and happiness.

I was a little disappointed there was not even a small attempt to create even the most meager of a story line. In review, there is no story, no dialogue, no set to speak of except a mat in a gym. Just nude wrestling. Why this is rated X is beyond me. It is entertaining. Not the kind of movie you will be watching over and over.

Read my review","review":"This disc is nothing more than junk in surround sound. That is the reason you see NO SAMPLES here. That is the the reason that all of the reviews here are FAKE- designed to convince you that this is a good product. This is a GUERILLA MARKETING tactic. You can see that for yourself simply by clicking on the reviewer's names and looking at their other reviews. They are mainly ALL for this series with a few for others BUT those are cross-linked back to these!So what is on these discs? Basicly nothing more than MIDI sounding versions of classical music. There is absolutely nothing artful here at all. I would not take any of this series if they were handed out for free.

Neither my OPPO DVD-Audio player nor my Denon DVD player can find any DTS encoded track on this disc.Otherwise to review this disc on its merits, to me it sounds like it was mastered or composed using \\"garage band\\" on an Apple Mac and then converted to lossy MP3. It's awful.Giving it 1-star is an over-rating, if zero was an option then that is what it would get. My copy of this disc is being returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bach done porly","review":"I have heard Bach transcribed for everything from harmonica to electric guitar and he usually sounds good...but not in this case.

What I cannot tolerate is the 'Jake' character, who is an absolute bore, immature, irresponsible, yet 'Gwen' falls for him completely. The viewer is not given one reason to like him, nor to understand the 'Gwen's attraction to him. Why was this character written so shallowly? We're given depth with 'Dahlia' - and a very fine performance by Delta Burke, I must say.Eh. I just can't watch the movie again, I mean, it has a bookstore, publishing, the foils of celebrity, and the cinematography is great, costumes, lighting, art direction - but so wish I could get past the 'Jake' 'Gwen' relationship - although you cannot call it that at all -- and it's irksome to have an entire movie destroyed by such a throw-in/throw-away character.

They offered an explanation about silver tarnishing easily, and perhaps the plastic bag it was in wasn't completely sealed. In light of this, and the fact that tarnishing is a natural process, I have taken the picture down, but I still want the review to stay up as a warning of what you might get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I love this necklace!

The clasp came apart from the jump ring the first night. Also, her hair keeps getting stuck in the links. This is a snake chain which should be very tightly linked. Altogether I found this to be pretty and shiny, but rather thin and flimsy, and the clasp is so tiny that it is hard for anyone to use unless they have very nimble fingers. I went to a local department store and purchased another one that was higher quality for the same price as this one.

I actually ordered two, one 18 inch and one 20 inch, but sent them both back. They were sturdy but the silver was almost unnaturally bright for sterling.

When my last chain finally broke after many years of abuse (LOL!), I found this one on Amazon. Reviews were quite good, so I ordered it. The only time I take it off is to change pendants. Seriously, I sleep with it, bathe with it, play in it, and hang my sunglasses from it. Living in the Deep South, we are still having weather in the 90's, so the chain has even been exposed to sweat, but no sign of tarnish or dulling of any sort.

In some parts, the ones in which the author attempts to explain how Geller supposedly cheated on some of his scientific test, the book reads like a Tom Clancy novel - without the suspense.

Randi's book about Uri Geller is riddeled and loaded with lies and errors and it is totally one sided. It's my opinion that Randi is utterly obsessed with Geller.

So why should anyone believe anything he says or writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is claptrap","review":"Seldom have I read a book that is so filled with garbage that purports to be \\"facts\\".

Claptrap it may be; however, I have it one my shelf as a reminder to be vigilant of those that try to undermine others' belief system with lies instead of truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilariously misguided","review":"This book is insightful only in that it reveals the depth of the personal animosity James Randi has for Uri Geller. This is curious because, without Uri Geller, no one would have even heard of James Randi.

Objectively, the book seems to be nothing more than a frustrated rant against a man the author apparently sees as having wronged the world.

Though not a literary masterpiece it made a lot of sense, but dispite the book and remembering watching the television set many years ago with my spoon and broken watch which was futile, there's still the imaginative part of me that wants to believe in Uri's magic. Yet the logical part of my brain has to go with the book and agree. I've gone on an official looking Uri website and discovered it's main purpose is to gain a few buck from sponsors. So my fantasizing has been shattered. My conclusion is to believe in the book. I have never received convincing evidence or proof from the books \\"subject matter\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent expose of a Fraud","review":"James Randi is the skeptics skeptic.

It wouldnt be so bad if Geller admited he was just a good magician but he is passing himself off as a psychic/guru which is a fraud. It is all about the money for Geller and with his manager sidekick they have conned their way round the World. He bends spoons and keys by distracting viewers and then either pushing them against a hard surface or physically bending them. When hes asked to do his 'tricks' under tight controls he fails. I was taken in by Geller as a kid and even bought one of his books a good few years ago. Don't believe the hype, the guy is a total fraud and Randi does a good job of exposing him. Good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I always thought Geller was a fraud. I liked Randi's explanations. It all made perfect sense to me.

He never considers that Geller's alleged powers may be genuine -- he simply takes it for granted that they are and proceeds to explain how he would do the same tricks. Coming from someone who makes his living by trickery, this is not unexpected. Anyone who reads this book will be convinced that Geller is a charlatan -- whether he is or not. Randi is not a man who is skeptical here -- he is a man who is positive about things that he CANNOT know in an almost religious manner. His intentions are well, but he will only succeed in alienating the people who have the most to gain from reading this book, because of his apparent disrespect for logic and fair-play which he claims are so important to him. Even so, people who are inclined to believe that Geller's powers are real without questioning them are in for a rude awakening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suburbia","review":"This is an excellent movie. I saw it about 30 years ago and was very surprised to find it on Amazon. It's about a runaway teen who ends up living with a group of punks. Their day to day lives and how they survive on their own. Great punk rock groups are also, featured in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low-budget Punk-rock Cult Classic","review":"Suburbia is a punk-rock cult classic. Made with an extremely low budget and starring genuine street-punks(including the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea), the film is funny, chock full o' meaning and undertones, and is full of great anti-authoritarian one-liners. It's a punk-rock must see. Punk bands featured are: early TSOL, D.I. and The Vandals. It centers around of homeless punks called \\"T.R.\\" or \\"The Rejected\\" who go around vandalizing the city and live-in a shack. I'd go on, but I am at work and I don't have much time.

The truth is, that it is the ONLY book of its type. The only possible exception to that would be M. Segal's book from Oxford in 1927, but that book is out of date and was written only as a comprehensive reference grammar and not as a textbook.On the other hand, this book, (which, incidently, was first published in Spanish in 1992) is an lesson-by-lesson textbook designed to introduce you to Rabbinic Hebrew (i. e. of the Mishnah, Tosefta, etc.) and its culture and literature. It provides practice passages for reading and other exercises. So, besides, being an excellent (and so far the only) update to Segal's reference grammar, it is (as far as I know) the only _textbook_ of Rabbinic Hebrew ever written. So, if you interested in this subject, you have little choice but to buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like my ramps","review":"\\"I like my ramps\\" I just bought a four seater UTV (1250 lbs) and knew I wanted to replace the ramps (wooden) I owned at the time.

What I liked the most is a systematic disucssion on a wide variety of areas in machine learning with a certain degree of details.But at the same time, I will also say that the book at some places,(for eg the treatment of Multi Dimensional scaling and Linear discriminants analysis,) lacks depth in its derivations. Also if some explanatory examples are put,it would help the reader, who is doing a first time reading, in understanding the concepts.At the same time, I think the book achieves it's target of introducing to the reader, a whole gamet of techniques, at a fairly reasonable level. The book is no doubt, a nice and one-stop quick reference for many topics, as such. A commendable thing is an up to date errata maintained by the author, with latest editions made.

As a disabled person with Muscular Dystrophy (SMA Type III), The life, feelings, sex issues, and daily things a disabled person encounters is VERY well portrayed. The medical details and procedures that are explained gives the reader a geat visual of whats going on.

Mr. Brito is such an artist. Go listen to Lecuona himself, or the incomparable series of Lecuona on the BIS label by Tirino. The tempi here are slow, languid, having more of a \\"cocktail\\" pianist kind of feel. Little color except one mezzo-piano throughout, little bite. The sound quality on the disc is a bit muffled as well. There are many other Cuban artists who run rings around Mr. Brito's Lecuona (Frank Fernandez comes to mind, or Paquito d'Rivera, another Cuban, on saxophone). When can only wonder having studied with Renee Touzet, a great Cuban musician, how this pianist conceived these lack luster, un- Latin performances-and living and teaching in Miami no less!I was very dissapointed with this one: I expected much, much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico","review":"This is an outstanding account of the conquest of Mexico.

I've got to say, of all of Jessica's random guys, Nick is the only one I actually liked, in character and in story. He's a great guy, and I'm just disappointed we didn't get a better ending for his story (and here, my first ever fanficis born XD). I also enjoy reading about Enid/Alex, despite the minor role she plays, but she's finally starting to grow out of Alex, it seems, and that's great.

I knew they would be heavier than a standard tube, but I also expected that they would be firm and usable. Unfortunately, it was like riding on flat tires, including an unpleasant squishy noise as I pedaled along. On the plus side, I got an excellent workout from a very short ride, as they probably doubled the amount of energy I might have normally expended.I think that my experience with this product might differ greatly from that of someone needing a smaller tube for a smaller rider.

Leslie Nielsen is back, this time with funny man Archie Hahn (famous for being attacked in \\"Gremlins 2: The New Batch\\".) Nielsen's idea to \\"play bad golf but feel good\\" is perfect. All the antics shown in this film are dead-on, hidden truths that we as golfers can surely laugh at. Some of these crazy things may even work on a golf course!Also, the \\"Behind-the-scenes/Making of\\" at the end of the tape was ahead of its time. Now a common thing on DVDs, this VHS version had \\"extras\\" on it. These extras are great and show some great stuff.The only two downsides are:1. No laugh track. When the jokes are made, silence follows.2. Archie Hahn is great but clearly over-acts in a few situations and comes off as a little annoying.Whether you just hit the driving range or play the course, any golfer can find humor in this! Snappy production with slapstick humor makes this great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great!","review":"The Velcro strips made it easy to fit and so far it looks great.

This book is simply terrible. I'm not sure what else to say about it that could accurately portray just how horrible it really is. The sex is not sexy. It's not erotic. The general idea of \\"sexy\\" in this book is using the 'c word' in a poorly constructed sentence or in a midst of purple prose or in a formulaic bland scene. The writing and prose is juvenile, boring and pathetic. If this were something someone posted online for fun, or fanfic, then it would be expected to be at such a substandard level.

The tunes instead are much more ethereal than anything prior; it seems the band is trying to find its new sound after Bill Berry's departure.It's not necessarily a hard album to get into, though, even with the experimentation that is going on. Songs like \\"Lotus\\", \\"At My Most Beautiful\\", and \\"Sad Professor\\" are tracks you could listen to years from now and yet immediately embrace upon first hearing.Overall, R.E.M.'s work is still eminently \\"listenable\\" though don't expect a lighthearted romp despite the title of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful and Beautifully simple","review":"I don't often give five stars, and had I rated Up after one listening, it would have gotten three stars at best. I'm glad I gave it a chance. Maybe I'm getting old, but I appreciate the evocative minimalism of many of the songs on Up. At My Most Beautiful is R.E.M. at their most beautiful. There are many other gems here, but it achieves it's atmospheric success as a collection. I'm always disappointed when I'm interrupted in the middle of listening to this CD. The songs on Up belong together. Peter Buck's sparse, restrained guitar work may not be appreciated by everyone, but it works - and when he does step up to deliver a few well aimed punches, the contrast is truly something special. Mike Mills again demonstrates his skills as an instrumentalist, but it is his backing vocals which give Up so much of its beauty. The lyrics are true poetry. Give this CD an honest chance; you'll be happy you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd, original and innovative","review":"I love REM and this CD is one of the reasons why. Songs like: Daysleeper, Airportman, You're In the air, Why Not Smile, Diminished, and Falls To Climb are soooooo unbelieveably beautiful. Stipe's lyrics are extremely poetic and very deep. You really have to think about what he means sometimes. I love that this cd is a combination of the styles of a lot of REM's other albums. The only negative that I see about this album is that you might have to be an REM fan to like it, but buy it anyway and give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!!","review":"REM seem to be more mature than ever with this CD.

I wish they wouldn't have printed the lyrics.. better not to know. He occasionally writes wonderful words..but it's really rare...especially here. As an art approach, he's still weak as a writer..compared to beefheart or robyn hitchcock...their lyrics don't always make sense but their ideas are so unique and they flow.Stipe's lyrics blow.I like some of the songs despite that...I even like Airport Man. But God, I wish the lyrics were ABOUT something ...OR...interesting nonsense.Neither one!But, my hats off to any band that takes this many chances. I have taped my favorite tunes and will trade it in on the new XTC.SO, I like it OK, but it's not that inspiring.Maybe more listens will change that, as it did Out Of Time.We'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.E.M.'s \\"Up\\" is a masterpiece!","review":"Michael Stipe et al have done it again-\\"Up\\" is a triumph, one of the most personal, emotional albums R.E.M. - or, for that matter, any artist - has ever made. It explores the possibilities of the sonic sound, and comes through bursting at the seams with energy and creativity. A well-earned five stars to the band, who have managed to pull off yet another phenomenal album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album blows","review":"I love r.e.m., but this album blows. It's apparent ever since the drummer left that this band has gone down hill. I saw r.e.m. in 1995 when they were probably the biggest band in the world during the monster tour. Don't you miss the early 90's output. Out of time, Automatic for the people, and Monster are a lot better then anything R.E.M. has put out in the past ten years, case closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dear sweet lord...","review":"Up is the best REM album ever, period. It's so full of emotion it hurts. Songs like Walk Unafraid, Parakeet (a much neglected track, in my opinion) and Falls to Climb are simply gorgeous. If there's music in Heaven, this is what it sounds like. Don't get me wrong, either, all the songs are excellent, but those three just blow me away. Of the other songs, I would have to say that my favorite is The Apologist, which reaches way back to Document-era doom and gloom. The only song that doesn't really fulfil its potential is Hope, which has great lyrics but is a little too dissonant for me. I'll be listening to this one until the next album comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Circles","review":"This is a perfect song to kick-start up. Its typical rem melodies with stipes enchanting lyrics just roll the whole tune along. Day sleeper is the start of musical journey perhaps UP will be a mix of automatic's sombre melodies and monsters raw feedback. Moody Strings and digital SoundBites rolled together with rem magic will be some journey. Can't wait.:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"R.E.M. keep movin' and groovin' and so much more","review":"This album doesn't topple the seamless perfection of New Adventures in Hi-Fi. Then again, with a band as consistently superb and unique as R.E.M., who can quibble? Up is an excellent piece of work and easily their most unique. The Amazonian reviewer did a good job of describing its atmosphere, so I won't re-iterate other than to add a few unique comments: the true rocker on here is not the somewhat awkward \\"Lotus\\"...it's the steady, powerful, overlooked masterpiece \\"Hope\\". Lyrically, this spellbinding song seems to laugh depressedly at the concept its title implies. Like Up as a whole, however, its surging melody spells something deeper and more optimistic. You will crank it up and feel invigorated even through the end, as distinct notes are enveloped in a crashing wash of feedback that fades away, sudden and eerie, like a ghost you only caught a glimpse of....And that's just track 4!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Pink Floyd? No way!","review":"Up is nothing like Pink Floyd. This is NOT invetive music/noise/trash/poetry. REM are over folks, face it!

Pure trash, come ON Mike, Michael and Pete! You can do better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this album.","review":"Stipe moans his way through a collection of tuneless, whiny songs that reflect a lack of effort or talent. Stipe once imbued his vocals with an aura of quiet mystery, but now he's just whining; Mills used to contribute intricate melodies and harmonies, but apparently gave this album nothing more than some disgusting synthesizer grackle. Peter doesn't sound like he knows what he's doing.Do these guys really think this stuff is good? I wonder. You can sit back and listen to Murmur by candlelight, and it'll draw all your tensions out of you; this just grates on you until you finally get up, turn it off, and fling it out the window."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unafraid and Beautiful","review":"I cannot compare this album to any previous R.E.M. album. Each of their albums stands alone, and this one is way UP there. It is great that they continue on in new directions. There are a couple songs I feel they could have left off, and I feel that way about all their albums, but they do not distract from the great songs here like \\"Walk Unafraid\\" \\"The Apologist\\" and \\"At My Most Beautiful\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshingly new R.E.M. on its way 'Up'","review":"This is possibly R.E.M.'s strongest album, and certainly makes up for the dissapointments of both Monster and NAinHF. An unusually somber album for this band, this reminds me of OK Computer by Radiohead, with many depressing undertones. It clearly is a different R.E.M. without Bill Berry, but their new sound is incredible, especially on songs like Lotus, You're in the Air, Walk Unafraid, Daysleeper, Diminished, and Falls to Climb. Michael Stipe's voice is as strong and powerful as ever. R.E.M. is a must buy for any fan, but except a new sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible album","review":"I haven't been a big fan the last few years (Monster really turned me off after a loooong time of liking the band)...but this album is incredible. I'd go so far as to say it's one of the top 6 or 7 albums of the decade. It's got a Radiohead kind of feel, and great lyrics as always.REM totally reinvented themselves and it sounds great. If only U2 could do something similar, with all the talent in that band...This is their best album except for maybe Out of Time (even then, maybe that's nostalgia talking). This one will be in my laptop for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"give it UP rem! (PLEASE!)","review":"The bottom really falls out on this record. It has no soul! One thing I thought REM always was able to accomplish was strong music - not always great music ... and certainly no 5 star records since Document ... but strong records. This is a pitiful effort that they should be ashamed of. There must be too many people kissing their butts for them to release something as lame as UP. Give UP REM - your days are over - you've taken rock music with you into the crap-hole!"},{"rating":"1","title":"past their peak","review":"REM is definetely one of my favorit bands of all time, but UP was a disappointment. It seems that UP lack a lot of the vibe that all four original members had toghether. The use of drum machines and synthesizers give a really wierd artifical sound to the band, a far departure from its more organic roots on albums like Green, Document and automoatic for the people. It's a lot harder to get into these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Easy Music","review":"Well I've only just got hold of this CD, so I'm still familiarising myself with it but so far I have to say there are a lot of interesting ideas and sounds going on here. For me there are loads of nice melodies to get your teeth into and it reminds me of Automatic for the People \\"Walk Unafraid\\" is probably my favourite track here though there aren't any I normally give the 'skip track' treatment to. A lot of the songs are pleasingly simple - avoiding that cluttered sound you sometimes get - these are kept basic and I love that. Also, nothing to upbeat or jarring either which makes it a good Cd to put on to relax to without having to worry about \\"track 6 waking you up too much when you get to it\\" Nice...:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brave new world for R.E.M","review":"I have been an R.E.M fan since their \\"Green\\" days and am normally acustomed to their more earthy guitar ridden tunes. Naturally when I first listened to \\"Up\\" I wasn't so sure that I had made the best decision. Once I cleared my mind of the way I expected the album to sound, I found that I really enjoyed it. The many experiments with keyboards and synthesizers were most interesting and the lyrics, as always, are just as intellectually stimulating as their last albums. It takes an open mind to enjoy the album but once you rid yourself of expecting it to be the same kind of work as they have done years ago, you will fall in love with it like I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Recordings of the 90's","review":"Up is R.E.M.'s best album, and one of the top ten albums of the 1990's"},{"rating":"2","title":"And Away...... Dog that lost leg learns to fly","review":"There isn't an REM album that doesn't have something superb on it somewhere. The disappointing 'Monster' had 'Let Me In', the good but slightly patchy 'New Adventures...' had 'New Test Leper' and the wonderful 'Electrolite' - but it is fair to say that following the genius of 'Green', 'Out Of Time' and 'Automatic For The People' one could be forgiven for thinking that the best of REM had come and gone. Then they release this stunning collection of songs which actually makes 'Automatic...' sound a little dull and predictable. 'Daysleeper' - their best single for years. 'At My Most Beautiful' is, well, beautiful. 'Walk Unafraid' is storming. To top it off 'You're In The Air' sounds like the best track that was never on 'Green'. Thoroughly modern and utterly classic, this is simply the best thing REM have ever done. The accompanying tour was a blast too...."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor effort","review":"i thought that i was such a great REM fan that i'd appreciate all their works but this album seriously isappointed me. lots of it is tuneless with few memorable tracks such as daysleeper, hope and why not smile. only about 3 or 4 songs are listenable, the rest leave a lot to be desired. i still believe REM's a good band, they just need to get their act together, with or without their drummer. automatic for the people and new adventures in hi-fi are still 2 of their best works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Melody, Kenneth?","review":"After 5 listens, Up! is still a major disappointment. It reminds me most of New Adventures in Hi-Fi but pales terribly in comparison. The songs are stripped of melody and the lyrics seem contrived. Like Smashing Pumpkins' latest, they seem intent on doing their own thing, audience-be-damned (though SP did a better job balancing the two), which is fine, they earned that right. I'll give it a few more listens and I'm still a fan, but I'm expecting something BIG for their next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry...I don't get it.","review":"I don't know why...but I keep giving them another chance. I've been a fan since the first time I saw R.E.M. for $5 at the Mad Hatter in Athens, GA in 1984. But since Out Of Time, I just don't get it anymore. Now, with \\"Up\\" I think I'm finished with R.E.M. I've tried, really tried to listen to this CD with an open mind. But I can't even stay awake through \\"Airportman\\", \\"Suspicion\\", and most of the rest of it. \\"At My Most Beautiful\\" was cute, just because Brian Wilson is my musical hero. Unless you want music to put on at night while you're trying to go to sleep, I'd have to recommend passing on this one. Oh, to just hear one more \\"I Believe\\" or \\"Driver 8\\" before they finally hang it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Up\\" does not measure up to previous R.E.M. efforts.","review":"With few exceptions, R.E.M. albums grab the listener's attention from the first track and hold it until the very last note. Sadly, \\"Up\\" is one of the exceptions (along with \\"Reconstruction of the Fables,\\" \\"Monster\\" and \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\\"). The sonic effects are more distracting than innovative, and the near-total lack of melody makes the band sound unsure and unfocused. In the past, in songs with virtually unintelligible lyrics or no lyrics at all, R.E.M. has proven itself adept at creating moods solely through music (e.g., \\"Murmur,\\" \\"Automatic for the People\\"). Not so on the new album. R.E.M. offers plenty of distinct sounds, but they simply don't add up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grabbing at straws","review":"Disappointing...usually when a new R.E.M. comes out I listen to it a thousand times, commit it to memory almost. I listened to Up twice and then put it aside. There is some good stuff here: \\"Daysleeper\\" is superb standard early 90's R.E.M., \\"Suspicion\\" has a lush, twilight feel to it like \\"Star Me Kitten\\", \\"At My Most Beautiful\\" is okay second rate Beach Boys (not as good as \\"Near Wild Heaven\\" though). But for every good or even merely okay song there's another that's out and out bad, embarrasing even. Far too much Stipe. \\"Lotus\\" sounded good live but on record it's annoying. I'd say Fables of the Reconstruction was worse than this, but at least it had \\"Driver 8\\". Instead of UP R.E.M. should've named this Out of Ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"give it a chance--youll love it just as much as I do","review":"REM lives up to its reputation in my mind--the first time i put this cd in my stereo i think well, m.s. voice is just as amazing as ever, but im not too sure about the music. this is exactly the same thing i think every time I hear a new one of their albums. Yet, after listening to it about 3x, i realized that this cd lives up to rems potential. i have SO much respect for these guys--M.S. vocals and lyrics have gotten inside me-they have gotten me thru so much-and i feel that all true rem fans need to hear this album for themselves before they form an opinion--just b/c your best friends say this album \\"stinks\\" doesnt mean anything--try it out- you wont regret it--thanks M.S.- for coming into my life-you have my respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"put down!","review":"Dont pick this one up!

THIS ALBUM WAS PLENTY OF FUN TO LISTEN TO. IT'S NOT ONE OF THEIR BEST, BUT IT'S STILL FUN. THE BEST TRACKS ARE ''LOTUS'', ''AT MY MOST BEAUTIFUL'', ''HOPE'', ''DAYSLEEPER'', AND ''SAD PROFESSOR''.

I know there are diehard fans who hate this album because its different, I say Vive la differance!! I like this album as much as I like every other REM album, sure the first couple of listens made me unsure as to how I felt about it but I can safely say that a few years down the line it's often put on repeat and I can listen to 2 or 3 turns when I'm cleaning the house or just chilling with a book (bought from Amazon of course!!) If we wanted artists to stay the same we wouldn't expect them to make new music but we do, so we have to accept that their music will develop as they mature, along with ourselves. If you really like REM you will appreciate this album as the fine piece of lyrical and musical work that it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning melodic effort","review":"Never been much of an REM fan but based on all the raves I have been hearing about from my peers, I thought I would have to check out what the hoopla was about over REM's last studio album. The first two tracks \\"Airportman\\" and \\"Lotus\\" didn't strike a chord with me. Those two songs could have easily been left off the album but for some odd reason the band decided to put the two most boring songs on the album. \\"Airportman\\" I found rather repetitive and annoying. After those two tracks, I started to enjoy the album. \\"Suspicion\\" and \\"At My Most Beautiful\\" really captivated my ears with the sparse melodies and beats, particularly \\"At My Most Beautiful\\". What strikes me about REM is that they never tend to repeat themselves with each album they put out, at least in recent years. \\"Up\\" is another album in 1998 which barely registered on pop music charts and with music buyers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it time","review":"If you are looking for another Murmer, look somewhere else. Like Murmer, the album is atmospheric. But this one extends REM's progression from New Adventures in Hi-Fi with more soundscapes and layered guitars and keyboards, though many of the songs are instantly accessible, like Lotus. The band is getting older and I guess less inclined to rock out. The highlight for me is the final song, \\"Fall to Climb,\\" an anguished coda with Michael Stipe lashing out and pitying himself at the same time to a haunting melody that has REM stamped all over it. But as they are now superstars with no motive to make any more money, REM uses up its alloted time with its share of weak spots. But, of course, the good far outweighs the bad. Docked a star for its length. Up sounds like a collection of experiments, promonged by the 70+ minute CD format."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.E.M's most passionate album to date!","review":"This album is nothing like R.E.M's earlier albums -- it's much more subtle, heartfelt and passionate, and in my opinion, one of their best!I read a review where it was said that it wasn't rock -- well, what'd you expect? R.E.M. celebrated their 20th Anniversary on 5th April, and I certainly wouldn't care to listen to them if they had not changed a bit from what they sounded like twenty years ago.Unlike almost any other band, R.E.M. continues to broaden their vision, and you'll never know what their next album will sound like. Sure, \\"Up\\" might be nothing like for example \\"Monster\\", but what's wrong with that? Change is usually good, and in the case of R.E.M., it's even better!If you're a R.E.M. fan, and haven't already got this album, you owe it to yourself to give it a try -- as I said, it's one of their best efforts to date (which says a lot when we're talking about R.E.M.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"R.E.M.??

R.E.M. could handle his loss and continue on without much of a problem, right?Wrong on both counts, as \\"Up\\" proves.After Berry's departure, the band tries to make up for his absence by using drum machines and a strange techno type sound with dire results.R.E.M. is a great band and can do many, many things very well, techno rock, however, isn't one of them...especially when it's argumented with the awful orchestration and drippy strings that have ruined many a later day R.E.M. release. Only \\"Lotus\\" shows any hints of rocking at all and the fill-in drummer doesn't help the song any, it remains clumsy.There is good material here, but it's few and far between.

Also, composing an album with the three members in different places resulted in a lack of quality. The only song that is at the same level of some of their previous albums is \\"Lotus\\", the rest is just a way of filling some disc space, without any real inspiration. They made the same mistake with \\"Automatic for the people\\", but the songwriting there was a little better, here it is really terrible, and the musical arrangements are clearly awful"},{"rating":"1","title":"REM has lost its edge and direction","review":"Don't get sucked into the hype surrounding UP. With Bill Berry gone, Michael Stipe and friends seem to be looking for a musical and artistic direction and did not find it. All the songs sound the same and Stipe sings like he's in a rotten funk. It's hard to believe this is the band that gave us OUT OF TIME. This is a disappointing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is garbage.","review":"Commenting on a song by song basis would be futile, as the tracks on this CD blend into a hideous mess much like the putrid aromas rising from a landfill come together to create one overpowering, horrible stench. This CD truly is garbage. Michael Stipe and partners have departed from the sounds that got them to the dance in the first place, and have instead vomited a compilation that is so unmoving and non-melodic it will leave you longing for the good old days of swingin' to Yanni and Kitaro.

All I can say about the latest offering is that I listened to it once and that will be the only time I listen to it. It seems like the old REM of Automatic For The People is dead and the ugly experimental REM of Monster is back for good. Experimenting is a good thing, I only wish they did it in practice sessions and actually bothered to write MUSIC for release on this CD. I guess the old addage that the older a band gets, the less energy it has is true, at least in this case. I wish I could return this piece of trash for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"REM is dead.","review":"UGH.REM's newest \\"album\\" sounds like something thrown together by an incompetent 10-year-old kid with a synthesizer and an old guitar he doesn't know how to use.

I think New Adventures is their best Warners album and strikingly evokes sounds and moods from their entire career. Now there's Up, a tired hung-dog collection of played-out random verbalizing from some once scrappy musicians now leading the good life. They needed to take some more time off, get over themselves, and find some drummer that they could just jam with. Lotus hints at some new mellow funky sound but the rest is just dull prog-rock noodling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"After Document, REM left IRS to sign a multi-million dollar deal with Warner Brothers because they wanted international exposure. On their second tour under Warner Brothers (after a five year break), they were on MTV complaining how touring is such a drag and whining about a 16 hour flight to Australia. During this tour, they recorded the forgetable and bland 'New Adventures in Hi-Fi' to fulfill their contract and sign an even bigger one. 'Up' reeks of this sentiment. It was not recorded by musicians or artists. It was recorded by business men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks","review":"I've had all I can stand; I can stand no more!!I used to be a huge R.E.M. fan, but now I have COMPLETELY lost interest. The downward trend started around the time of Out Of Time (and there were hints of it even on Green, with lame songs like \\"Get Up\\"), and then it just continued. Automatic For The People -- what was the big deal with that album? I can't STAND \\"Man In The Moon,\\" and \\"Everybody Hurts\\" really makes me want Stipe to go back to mumbling again rather than try to make Big Statements. Monster just plain sucked, all the way around. Adventures in Hi-Fi was unfocused weirdness. And Up is even MORE unfocused, whiny weirdness. There is NOTHING -- NOTHING -- here that is salvageable. And that statement is coming from a former fan that used to think that R.E.M. could do no wrong. It's really sad how they have messed up their legacy like this. This band is over.

The guys have done a complete 180 from past albums and perhaps from any other record ever done by any band.

Though the catchy teeny bop sound that caught on in the late 80's is not around anymore this is a masterpiece on it's own no matter how many copies it sells.

So they release an album which doesn't have the cheerful little sing along choruses, the wildly misinterpreted popsongs, the straightforward pop-rock music, and people think they've lost it! Listen to it. For god's sake, listen to it. The music is nothing short of gorgeous. And yes they can still rock. And they can still drag emotion out of you whether you're the most taciturn or unemotional person to ever walk the earth. And the lyrics. Listen to \\"Why not smile\\" and tell me it's not beautiful. And \\"At my most beautiful\\", the line \\"I count your eyelids secretly and tell say i love you.\\" Another moment of imagist beauty from Stipe. So REM have moved on from all you ever though they were? They have grown and moved. Listen to REM and realise they are fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not R.E.M.'s best, but it's worth buying.","review":"This album has no chart topper like Losing My Religion in 1991. That cd, entitled Out of Time sold more copies than any other R.E.M. release, but in my opinion is not as good as Up. Up is better cover to cover and Out of Time had only one or two good songs. Hope and Lotus are the two best songs and have recieved quite a bit of airplay here in Greensboro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up: Good, but easy to get tired of.","review":"When I bought this CD I listened to it all the time, for a long time.

Thanks guys-keep it coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"The first time I listened to _Up_ I liked it, but found it elusive somehow.

More noodling garbage from a bunch of guys who are only interested in trying to keep up with true innovators.One review I read said that \\"Up\\" is the Sgt. Pepper to \\"OK Computer's\\" Pet Sounds. Bunk.\\"Up\\" is what it sounds like when a band is running scared and out-of-touch with what made it relevant in the first place. Furthermore, if you're going to remake \\"Suzanne\\" by Leonard Cohen (\\"Hope\\"), you'd better have something to contribute to the song. Sadly, this is not the case.Fans have gotten used to thinking that everything R.E.M. does is manna from heaven.

However, \\"Up\\" is anything but. The dismal lyrics, monotonous vocals and non-existent melodies stunned me in their complete lack of even a trace of the humor, beauty, exuberance, or longing I found in their past work. I loved every song in \\"Monster\\", \\"Automatic for the People\\" and \\"Out of Time\\" as well as most of their earlier work.

I liked Michael Stipe a lot better when I couldn't understand him. It's long past time for REM to break up, and this record is proof positive. I used to be an REM fan, from \\"Murmur\\" onward, but now I can't even listen to their old stuff, because their last 3 albums have been so embarrassingly bad.

Indeed, I don't want artists to keep churning out the same record, again and again. Green is not Life's Rich Pageant; Out Of Time is not Reckoning. And that's a good thing. But this, this is just awful. Whether you like the earliest REM (Murmur, Reckoning), REM at its hit-making prime (Automatic for the People, Monster), or their most current incarnation (Accelerate), this one is just a clinker. Even the best of artists occasionally produce bad stuff (see young, Neil: Trans, re-ac-tor, Everybody's Rockin', Arc). This is that disc for R.E.M. A song by song review is overkill & unnecessary.

RIP."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their very best!","review":"UP is a beautiful album and the sound of a more mature band. It has a certain feel to it, somewhat modern. Part of that sound is due to losing drummer Bill Berry and often relying on electronics for the beat.Only \\"Lotus\\" sounds like a full-on pop/rock song with its live drums. It sounds like floating - one of their best. \\"Airportman\\" sets the relaxed mood with quiet synths. \\"Suspicion\\" is softly sensual while \\"At My Most Beautiful\\" is one of their prettiest and most heartfelt songs, with orchestration, Christmas bells, piano and 60's style \\"do-do-dos.\\" A very strong set of songs, but \\"Diminished\\" may be my favorite here. That or the last one \\"Falls to Climb\\" which can bring a tear to my eye if I'm not careful.This isn't R.E.M. rocking out like they have in the past. This is much more of a quiet album and it's brilliant. Ignore the nay-sayers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Keyboards kills it","review":"Change is not always good and this is a good example. For most of the CD there is a real poor use of keyboards that made me have to remove my headphones. There is an attepmt to delve into the use of more keyboards and it flops.

Not exactly, Michael Stipe's ego is more like it. UP makes me cringe and wish for the days of Green. Trust me on the cut out bin part.

The darlings of the music critics and college crowd have yet again come out with an album that is completely uninspired. \\"Up\\" is a terribly medicore effort by a once creative band. Michael Stipe is continuing his attempt to be a singer with a voice that is more reminiscent of a dying, or bleating at best, sheep. He was much more tolerable in the heyday of REM, when the lyrics were not discernable. Although Mike Mills and Peter Buck, the TRUE remaining musicians in the band since Bill Berry's departure, are still dependable, the album as a whole is an insipid effort to put one over on REM fans, a dwindling number to be sure as the days and bad albums go by. There is plenty of better music out there folks, that you can grab up for the holidays. It's better to spend your money on a recording of cats copulating than this album; at least it's the genuine thing instead of Stipe sounding like he's imitating them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Up=P.U...ie. it stinks!","review":"I've been an avid listener since the early days and this one was a tremendous disappointment. Fables is a great forgotten album far above and beyond Up. Besides Daysleeper and maybe one other song, the album is just one repetitive mundane beat after another. And, the 20sec of maniacally dull drum beat in the beginning of at least two of the songs was enough for me to move on. It's almost like they're trying to meet contractural obligations to fill time on an album. We don't need the nap guys...you do! It should have been called Nyquil. Throw out the drum machine and go without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought as a replacement!","review":"I have all of R.E.M.

Needless to say, when my anticipation was mostly unfulfilled, I put the album on the back burner and forgot about most of it. I've recently rediscovered it and realized that most of it isn't as bad as I originally thought. I really liked the first three songs especially, and the rest of the songs all have some interesting sounds and good lyrics in them. Overall, a challenging work, but gets better over time, check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to One of REM's Best Albums Ever","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with 100% of what Andrew Welch says (see below).

But none of these songs do anything or go anywhere. You will not be able to tell any difference between the beginning, middle, or end of any given track. Unlike most REM albums, there is nothing poignant or memorable here. The only songs worth sitting through are Daysleeper and Walk Unafraid. Nothing more than mildly pleasant background music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete miss","review":"I can understand when a band gets tired of producing main stream recordings to line their pockets with cash, but this one is just plain lousy.

I must admit that it took a couple listens for this album to take me in, but now that it has, I can't stop listening to it.I am baffled by those who think that this is full of corporate fodder. The thing that struck me is that they are all great songs, unike anything else on the radio, and none will get much airtime. It's everyone elses loss, but I'm glad to see that REM is still making albums, and not just a bunch of \\"Radio Songs.\\"Rock on REM. I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfortuantely overlooked","review":"This album is a great listen: plenty of energy for background music at work; great subtleties for when you're just relaxing with the headphones on. As an artist, I can personally attest to it being a wonderful painting companion.Critically panned by many, Up suffers like Hi-fi for being too 'different' for mainstream audiences--surprise folks, REM makes 'alternative' music. I can't help but feel that reviewers had Top 40 REM (Out of Time, Automatic for the People) in mind when they first popped this disc in. Any other band producing something this revolutionary would be lauded. Not quite as strong as some of the previous albums, but certainly in the top 5 of the band's discography."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.E.M. UP IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE A WONDERFUL CD!","review":"I was very happy when it first came out.They did a super job no matter what anybody else says.Though I know that all the fan's miss Bill Berry. I love all the songs on the cd they take me to a far away place. Wonderful melody's abound a great buy. It should not be measured up to any of their other music. It is special in it's own way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it time","review":"If you are looking for another Murmer, look somewhere else. Like Murmer, the album is atmospheric. But this one extends REM's progression from New Adventures in Hi-Fi with more soundscapes and layered guitars and keyboards, though many of the songs are instantly accessible, like \\"Hope.\\" The band is getting older and I guess less inclined to rock out. The highlight for me is the final song, \\"Fall to Climb,\\" an anguished coda with Michael Stipe lashing out and pitying himself at the same time to a haunting melody that has REM stamped all over it. But as they are now superstars with no motive to make any more money, REM uses up its alloted time with its share of weak spots. But, of course, the good far outweighs the bad. Docked a star for its length. Up sounds like a collection of experiments, prolonged by the 70+ minute CD format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid A inutero?","review":"After putting this album away for a while I decided to pull it out after listening to Kid A (Which the critics loved). Which leads me to belive that if R.E.M. had have aproched UP with the same style that Thome York and the boys of Radiohead did, Stipe would have been praised as York has. This Album is very R.E.M. like in the fact stipes vocal are consistent and drawling. The post berry era started softly and refectively as shown in the lyrics. This album has many layers to it as Does Kid A.Is this album KID A inutero? I think without this sound that R.E.M. Produced some of Kid A could have not been made. So kudos to Stipe and here's to hoping more of not the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up pushes creative boundaries","review":"Two reasons i love REM is that they are extremely creative, and no two of their albums sound alike. \\"Up\\" continues both these traditions. This is also a very innovative piece of work that really seems \\"out of time\\", if you will (ahem). It's genius and depth will have people debating over it for many years, in the way they debate Andy Warhol's work, and in twenty years it'll be considered a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"one point I'd like to make","review":"There seem to be an awful lot of reviews that advise anybody new to R.E.M. to stay as far away from Up as possible. I completely completely disagree, mostly because this album sounds nothing like anything else they have ever done. It is far more akin to OK Computer than New Adventures in Hi-Fi, and I feel that it probably appeals to a far different audience than R.E.M. has previously courted. This is not to say that previous R.E.M. fans should avoid it, as many seem to think it's their best album (which it is =), but it's an entirely different sound. Most, if not all, of the negative reviews are a direct result of people expecting one thing and getting an ambient, often electronic sound that directly contradicted that expectation. Even if you are not a fan of R.E.M. but enjoy emotional and experimental music you OWE it to yourself to pick this up =) It's one of the best records I have ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"1of 3 best","review":"in the age bittney sprears and korn it seems that there is nothing left in the mainstream left to hold onto. huge multinational corporations shovel out as much tripe as the public is willing to stomach an it seems that we have an insatiable appetite. but thank god for people like rem people who are willing to offer some ammount of artistic integrity and some musical skill beyond what you can bang out on a loosly stringed guitar or buy at the nearest uniform talent shop. this album not only represents some of the best work by rem to date but it stands as one of only three albums given wide release in 1998 that offers me any glimmer of hope in regards to our collective attitude towards music.(the other two being adore by the smashing pumpkins and x/o by elliot smith.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY sad","review":"What happened here?

I have been a fan since seeing the band back in '83 and touted as cutting edge. It was true back then and even until not too long ago. But now with all that fabulous contract dough it seems there're content with using their musical blade for not cutting edge but for cutting cheese.

The unit's laser mechanism failed recently, rendering the drive useless. The drive has had minimal use, 3 recording sessions. While laser failures are common, short warrantees from prominent manufacturers are not. Upon contacting HP tech support I was informed these units only have a 90-day warrantee because HP has decided to exit the CD-RW business and focus solely on DVD offerings. Thus the pricing on their latest CD-RW products is substantially lower in price than previously.

Thule makes some great stuff and you definitely pay the price for it. Be sure to buy a lock to protect your investment.

This seems like a very secure lock...I never have to worry about my bike rack while I'm out on a ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should make these","review":"It serves the purpose of securing your bike rack to your hitch but Thule is clearly bending us over without the courtesy of a reach around.

I was installing my new rack the morning I was leaving for a road trip when I got to step 11 and realized that this piece would have to be purchased separately in order to prevent my bikes from being stolen. I can't believe they would intentionally leave their customers in that position in order to extract $50 after selling an already over-priced rack. Can you imagine buying a house and then being told that if you want to be secure you need to spend an extra $5000 on doors that have locks?I would put this in my top 10 product rip-offs I have ever experience. Whoever conceived this idea at Thule should be fired and have all of their bicycles taken away.

So I ordered a new one for the locking mechanism.However, what Amazon shipped is the STL2 Snug-Tite (which I can get locally). If you want the STL, don't order this one as you may not get what you ordered. I requested a replacement with the correct one and asked that they confirm it was the correct one. Unfortunately, they shipped the wrong one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"As others have said, just go and buy at locking hitch pin for a fraction of the cost, or better yet, use a cable and lock which will be much more secure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"First, the lock fits very loosely on the hitch\\"pin\\" (screw), so the unit adds noting to the stability. But, the real issue is though this lock will impede the removel of the hitch pin, security is an illusion. The upright assembly is held to the hitch with two standard bolts (nuts). So, with the lock, instead of removing one bolt (the hitch pin), you have to loosen two nuts and remove two bolts. You've really gained almost zero added security."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Very expensive, doesn't self lock easy to lose. Can be smashed off with a hammer with one blow. If you try to lock this while it's on the hitch up under your car you have to be very careful to get it all the way over the little nipple and then lock it and then really triple check it to make sure it's locked or it will fall off while you are driving and you will have to pay $45.00 for another one. The Sportworks and the Yakima lock self lock when you slide them on, it's still possible to lose one, but it's much more difficult and you don't have to crawl up under your car to lock it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Very pleased with the product and quality, good instructions and easy assembly, and the extra wrench is nice to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much a waste of money","review":"We bought this to use with the Thule 665C Cargo Box. First we found it un-necessary (the cargo box has a bolt that would perform just as well).The \\"lock\\" end is cheap plastic with a junk lock that can easily be pryed off with a screw driver/lever or knocked off with a hammer.It is threaded at the bolt head end which provides additional security should the \\"lock\\" end break or fall off.It does the basic job a bolt would do.It does look nice even though it is extra long for 1 1/4\\" receivers.All-in-all, if you like paying $50 for a bolt with a \\"pretty\\" plastic nut (lock) when a $5 bolt would do, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my own for $2","review":"MAKE YOUR OWN - This part is a total waste of money. I went to REI to pick-up this lock, when I asked the salesman the price he told me $50! I asked him why I could not simply use a small piece of chain to connect the rack to the trailer hitch. He told me I would be better off doing that and said just last weekend they had broken one off for a customer, with a single whack with a hammer (on the lock side which is thin evidently).I picked up a small length of strong chain for $2.09 at the hardware store, put it through an old bike inner tube so it would not clang against the hitch and used two old padlocks to lock the chain ends to the rack and the trailer hitch (which is bolted and spot welded onto the car). So please, don't waste your money on the Thule STL2 Snug-Tite Lock II, MAKE YOUR OWN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice quality, but not worth the price","review":"I purchased this thinking it would be an easier, quicker way to remove my bike rack, only to see that I would still have to use a wrench to remove it. If you're not familiar with a Thule rack, it doesn't use a hitch pin to hold it to the receiver, but uses a bolt instead. I was under the impression this lock would work as a pin. Slide it through and lock the end. Not like that at all. Go to a trailer store, buy a hitch pin that accepts a lock and walk out at least $20 better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too expensive - create your own","review":"I just purchased the Thule 9031 bike rack and hated the thought of some thug making off with it by simply unbolting one bolt at the hitch so I considered the Snug-Tite Lock. When I found out that Thule is charging almost $50 for a bolt with a cheap lock on it, I decided to create my own solution. After a couple days thinking about it, I came up with a solution for just about $10. When you install a Thule hitch mounted rack, there's only one bolt that goes into the hitch receiver. This leaves you with a hole on the opposite side which is perfect for sliding one of those thin cable Master locks through. Simply slide the thin end of the cable lock (the male end) in through the hitch hole on the opposite side of the bolt that holds the rack to the hitch. Push the cable lock through the hole until it exits out of the rear of the hitch receiver, then just click the lock shut. Only about 10 bucks for the lock and probably more secure than the Snug-Tite."},{"rating":"1","title":"False sense of seurity","review":"Thule makes exceptional products. This is not one of them. Use 3' length of chain or braided cable with a sturdy padlock to the frame of your hitch receiver assembly.

If someone wants to steal a rack, they'll find a way and this won't stop them, but it provides peace of mind by adding a second thing that has to break before your rack falls off the car if the screw fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Ok people.. there are actually two bolts that hold your rack together. Why would this lock make your rack secure? Any idiot could just unscrew the other bolt and get anything you had on your rack plus most of the rack itself. This product is completely ridiculous. The design of this bike rack is very lacking. They should design the rack with security in mind and not charge extra for it. Seriously.. isnt that part of their job? Who would want to buy a rack that is easy to steal? If you bought this rack then you are much better off just using a chain and a decent lock to chain it all together and chain it down to your hitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Pilates lovers...","review":"My mother asked that I write a review of this product.

(a great coming-of-age story.) This book is full of the immortal truths of English boyhood. It's also a good naval yarn. Jack Easy is the prototype for young seamen in the post-Trafalgar era. The book is actually quite funny, too. Marryat's characters are very well-drawn, if a little rough around the edges. This is a very good story, and Captain Marryat was quite a story-teller. There is truth in this book, and a hard-edged plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy does it!","review":"Considering the era in which it was written, this book is remarkable! Fast paced, uproariously funny at times, \\"Midshipman Easy\\" is a delight to all who enjoy seafaring novels. True, it is far-fetched at times, but it was never intended to be a true grit novel. The satire involved gains perspective if you understand Marryat's position for naval reform after he retired from active duty as a British Naval Captain. Marryat's use of a black man as Easy's guide and balance is something else ahead of it's time and I applaud him for that. The real purpose of this book is to provide a good read and it does it beautifully. The best of his novels,although Peter Simple ought to please the Forrester crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic? for boys","review":"Marryat is a bit disappointing to me, after O'Brien, Lambden, Woodman, et al., but no doubt true to its time, when this story was a great favorite of young men who wanted to escape to sea. Mr. Easy has an entirely too easy time of life for a real midshipman under sail, full of successful derring-do without any visible training or sail-handling to it, but thanks really to his practical and experienced Negro servant! I can see how young boys might have enjoyed this fast-moving story of endless adventures when it was written 140 years ago, but for me it lacks grit, sweat, and tears (perhaps the very reason it successfully recruited boys into the navy, as Parascandola avers). Maybe this is a valuable historical document from a real sea captain, moralizing from an outlook lacking in the more \\"politically correct, sensitive, and sexual\\" attitudes of modern authors, but as the \\"best\\" of Marryat's novels, I'll pass on the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midshipman Exremely Easy","review":"Great book in that it doesn't take itself too seriously.

Easy leads an unbelievably charmed life, to the point of delightful reading but not incredulity. Characters are real yet outstandingly rich and beautiful. Find yourself putting your head back now and then and laughing in a most horse-like fashion... In regard to sea stories of this nature, I put C.S. Forrester 1st (He is the master, and will always be 1st just as Tolkien will always be 1st for fantasy readers), Marryat 2nd, O'Brian 3rd (too much pontificating...) and Alexander Kent and others a distant, distant, distant 4th."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining book!!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Despite the fact that the book was written over one hundred years ago, Marryat's creation is entertaining to this day. One thing that made it such a good book was Marryat's experiences as a participant in the actual war. Writers of other Maritime books do not have as clear an understanding of what life was like on the ocean because they were never there. While Marryat can describe life on the ocean well and tell an entertaining story, he cannot be counted among the great authors of the english language. His book is entertaining and exciting, but not outstanding"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Patrick O'Brien fans","review":"British Naval life circa 1808 written by one who was there.Marryat was a midshipman at the time.

Thedifference, of course, is that Marryat knew the men, andin some cases it seems it was Marryat himself, whose deedsare echoed in our favorate works of fiction.Marryat writes with great humor, and his prose style, whilesomewhat archaic, will be familiar to O'Brien's readers. Hehas some axes to grind that might offend the modern reader(anti-catholic bigotry, and a determined attack on theprinciples of human rights that drove the French Revolutionagainst which he fought) but taken with a grain of salthe can generate a humorous view of many institutions thatare above question these days.This volume is beautifully printed and bound, and well worththe hard cover price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated by today's standards","review":"This book has been a mainstay in Communications Theories courses in universities across America for most of the 21st century thus far, but it hasn't been updated much since its original publication in 2000.

It makes me wonder how much progress has been made in the field in the 12 years since this book's initial publication.Buy it if you must, but know that there are more up-to-date resources out there that deserve to bump this dusty tome from its revered position among college faculty."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Journey to Take!","review":"Having been an avid reader for thirty five of my thirty nine years, I can wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone wanting to partake in a journey of the mystical, the spiritual, the heart.

I laughed, I cried and I felt as if I were right there beside both authors as they journeyed their way into each other's hearts.

It was really fun and the atmosphere was beautiful (just like the first one). But the reason I gave it 4 stars was because, although the loading sequences didn't take long at all on Gamecube, the graphics weren't that great they were kind of choppy, but I think it's because it was on the Gamecube. I don't know if it was just the game that was designed for gamecube or if it's for all the systems but there were some bad qualities in the characters too (such as Farah's hair moving through her chest when she moved and the voices being off sync). I'm totally not downing the game though. I loved this game, I loved it more than the second one but the first is still my favorite. This one took the atmosphere of the first one, dreamy and beautiful, and the prince has the same voice from the first one. Also the gameplay is fun and the storyline is great. But it was way too short if I should say so..It was fun, I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I'm not usually very harsh in my criticism of CDs. I realize music is subjective, and one person's trash is another person's treasure. HOWEVER, this \\"steel drum band\\" CD turned out to be a single steel drum playing over top of a \\"drum machine\\" (stiff MIDI sequences utilizing low-end sound libraries, for you musicians out there). Actually, I'm not even positive that the steel drum is live, it might be MIDI (fake) as well. The guitar sounds live, and the player likes to insert solos as often as possible, as though he's a frustrated guitarist who is using the lure of \\"steel drums\\" to trick people into listening to his guitar solos.

This means it also collects heart rate data and now I can also check out my heart rate graphs and average for an activity. This is an excellent tool to help my training, the only thing lacking is a 'real time' read, but it is great to go back after a work out and be able to see my heart rate graph, all with out any wires or pushing any buttons or setting anything up."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!","review":"This is a slick little piece of technology. The tiny strap communicates wirelessly with the sportbrain unit to track your heart rate. Although there is no real time readout, it downloads automatically with the other information and appears on your website in graph and chart form. It is small and fairly comfortable to wear. There are no buttons to set; you don't even have to turn it own. Just put it on and go. Although probably intended to track heart rate during exercise, I wore mine the first day around work to get some baseline information about my heart rate during the day during my normal activities. It was small enough under my shirt that no even noticed it. I plan to do this again in a few months to see if I can see evidence of cardiovascular conditioning from my exercise. This is a nice product that is surprisingly inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best case of all!","review":"Sea World adventure is the best of all Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley.

Sometimes, you get to travel in different ways, such as snowboarding, travelling in a space ship and a jet ski too.The levels are colourful and there are a number of different enemies to overcome which are not too difficult. The levels start of quite basic but gradually increase in difficulty. However, they're never so difficult that you can't be bothered to play anymore.This is a really fun and addictive game.

While searching they discover mans' body attached to a boat motor. But the motor looked familar. It was a motor off a boat of the local marina. When they found that out they searched the logs and got some names of people who were at the marina that day. That's when the detective work comes into play. After days and days of searching they finally find the murderer. To find out I guess you will just have to read the book.

For instance, the chapter on web graphic technology sounds like a paid ad. for photoshop. No real reasons were given on why photoshop is great compared to others, only a handful of quotations from other people. The book skips totally about other tools for graphic design. The chapter on web programming is impossibly pointless. It tries to cover a bunch of web languages in 30 pages, and over half of those pages are taken up by half-page sized screen shots that offer little information.The book is a complete disaster: it's incomplete, shallow, and full of useless opinions and quotations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly an awful book.","review":"Molly must have got paid by the pound to write this book.

Much of the book consists of examples - full pages of text in some gibberish (not real words) with a few HTML keywords, then the next page shows what it looks like on the screen. There must be 100 pages of comlpete gibberish. There is a big section of color pages in the middle of the book, (a \\"Color Reference\\"), but the colors aren't right-someone didn't communicate properly with the printer.

The characters' experiences provide different viewpoints on similar topics (false accusation of rape vs. reactions of rape victims). Presented in flashback form, characters are developed and their motivations become understood. Jodi Picoult is effective at adding to the layers of the story as well as in peeling back layers of characters' personalities.Look for clues throughout the book of Gillian's hate of her father and the early years of some older characters. Two things I found hard to believe were Jack's mother's turning against him so relentlessly and the fact that Jack could be so irresistible to teenage girls.

It seemed that every chapter she added new characters that would confuse the heck out of me.....and the story was so slow and I just didn't like the character of Addie........and found Jack's character just too hard to figure out. And wayyyyyy too many characters to keep track of -This won't deter me from Jodi's books, but I'm hoping I don't cross another bad one......I do NOT recommend this book - it was terrible.....sorry Jodi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Picoult's Best Work","review":"I really love reading Picoult books - I love the switching between viewpoints and the exploration of rather dark subjects. The idea behind this book - witches starting a \\"witch hunt\\" and the terrible nature of rape - was very good. But overall I was left unsatisfied. The twist is obvious from 1,000 miles away and it is disheartening that no one discovers it during the book or even takes the time to put some mild clues together.

Before gettting there, I did not like the doubts thrown in about Jack, after we were lead by the author to believe in him. The ending is horrible, not because of anything horrible that happened, but because it is not clear. You are left with an IDEA that MAYBE you understand. Maybe some readers like this, for me, it diminishes the experience of the book. I don't want to \\"make up my own ending\\". I can do that by reading half a book. I've asked others what they thought the ending meant but I can't find anyone who has read it. I'm just chalking this one up to a loss of about six hours of my life and keeping the writer and her style in mind as things to avoid in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Huge fan of Jodi Picoult, a magnificent author that grabs the reader from the first page. Her depiction of Wicca was accurate and respectful, and as in all of her books, her knack for suspense and characterization was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read most of Jodi Picoult's books and could not wait to sink my teeth into this one. It was very difficult, for one, to get into the story. The book jacket tells you most of the story without turning a page. Secondly, I was really not interested in the characters. They seemed to be just that, superficial. Lastly, too much of the story was unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous Melodrama","review":"Maybe it's the audio CD narrator alternating between sickly sweet mooniness, to out-of-place scorn, to stilted cardboard cut-out attempts at male voices, but I can't believe this is the effort of an award-winning writer. She apparently doesn't even know that \\"The reason is because\\" is improper English. The events in this \\"story\\" are so ridiculously improbable, she destroys her own credibility. The writing is at best, specious. At worst are lines like \\"throw away his freedom like an extra stick of gum\\", and sappy offerings such as \\"his name rolled around her mouth like a butterscotch candy\\" - I won't torture you by quoting descriptions of gratuitous teen (and adult) sex, or the occasional, oddly-placed crudeness. Hyperbole and melodrama reign supreme here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and unrealistic","review":"I knew halfway into the book how it was going to end and hoped that I was wrong, that the writer wouldn't be that silly. But she did it.Lots of inconsistencies throughout, but the most ridiculous parts were the antics in the courtroom during a serious trial. First we were led to believe the judge was a no-nonsense kind of woman, but then she allows Roy to bring in muffins and sandwiches before giving his testimony.Also unrealistic was Addie living there quietly and peacefully with two of the men who had raped her. I didn't care much for Jack or Addie and found it hard to sympathize with Jack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sucks you in to the story until you HAVE to know what really happened!","review":"Jodi is a twisted, facinating writer that delivers every time and knows how to grab a reader.

If Opera d'Oro's sound at least matches that of EMI (which is close to that heard in the Toscanini broadcast on RCA, also with Vinay, from around the same time), this recording is well worth having -- especially at this price.One simply must hear Vinay in this role, and this could be a supurb alternate to any modern recording you may own. Actually, you could well come to regard it as your first choice.

Out of the first four books of the \\"trilogy in five parts\\" (I haven't read the last one yet), this one is by far the least engaging. As short as it is, it took me three days to read it because I found it difficult to absorb. There is a mere skeleton of a plot line, which might have taken all of five pages to tell if not for all of the meandering and weaving around the story line. Much of what happens throughout the story has little to do with what the characters set out to accomplish. I know that this is characteristic of the Hitchhiker series, but at least in the other books, the meandering and going off on tangents leads to a funny occurrence, or is at least humorous in itself. I didn't get anything like that out of this book. While there are a few funny lines in it, it hardly stands out in my mind as a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum...","review":"\\"Life, the Universe, and Everything\\" took me months on end to get through. Every time I opened the book I'd think \\"Ha, ha! What a funny and crazy man that Adams is. Why don't I read this more?\\", but after a few pages I'd grow weary. This book is genuinely funny, but I think instead of being a five-book trilogy, the Hitchhiker's franchise should have stopped at one. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was one of my favorite books for a time, and still holds a special place in my literary tastes. It's hilarious, and Douglas Adams has undoubtedly the sharpest wit this side of Oscar Wilde! Unfortunately, his abilities in the field of plot propulsion are weak at best. I read through this series, loving the first, liking the second, and by the time I got to this one, I just felt like asking what's the POINT? All this book was was another opportunity for the author to demonstrate his wit, which is, i reiterate, amazing. However, it's not enough to keep me reading, ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?

As with everything in the series I often had to remind myself that the plot doesn't have to make sense. Once I got past the foolishness of it all I realized that there were moments of warped verasimilitude after all if only I'd look.But I didn't look. I read it for the scenes of mindless humor instead. That's the way I think it should be read. I will never forget Ford thinking that he is a lemon and entertaining himself by jumping in and out of a lake that thinks it is a gin and tonic. (At least Ford thinks the lake thinks it is.) Or when Arthur realizes in horror during his encounter with Agrahjag that he still has a rabbit bone in his beard (the bone being a remnant of one of Agrahjag's past reincarnations)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A War of 2 Worlds","review":"The Kricket Planet have been locked up for years trying to get the 3 pillars and the Golden Bail so they can have the key.

While the first books had lighthearted yet well developed plots, the plot in LUE (Life the Universe and Everything)was darker, less well developed and very unorigonal (I mean come on, saving the universe is so passe). I was also very disappointed with the humor. While it had its moments, LUE had fewer humorous portions and most of the humor seemed very out of context and had nothing to do with the plot. The ending was also very anti-climactic, not having a cliffhanger like the previous boooks. Overall it is a dissapointment compared to the rest of the series but is neccessary to read to get the whole plot of the series. I recommend it to only those who are going to read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"LifeUniverseEverything: The worst of the guide.","review":"Of all of the hitchhiking books, I thought that Life, the Universe, and Everything was the worst of them. I can say that it was fairly entertaining, but it was definitely not the best book in the world. I enjoyed Douglas Adams's other books much more than I did this one. This book lacked plot, theme, and revolved around random comments and jokes (that were not very funny). In the other books before it the jokes were much more funny, and fit into the story line better. I am somewhat disappointed in this third book in the marvelous series: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"rating":"2","title":"42!","review":"I have no idea why no one seems to give this book good reviews!

LTUAE is a very funny book that will make you keep reading, and reading, and reading . . .In my opinion every book I've read by Adams Has failed to let me down. They are all very funny.

Having played the thoroughly enjoying game Worms: Armageddon, I feel that this game will be even better, for in this series of games, each time the next game in the series comes out, it is always even more enjoyable. In addition, I must say that the major highlight of this game is the multiplayer mode. There is fierce competition whenever a multiplayer game is going on like no other game I have ever seen. Plus, unlike most games with weapons, Worms has no blood, plus to ad in some fun ,there are fantasy weapons such as 'Super Sheeps' that you direct through the air towards your opponent(s) The creators of this game must have an ingenious gaming mind. With all this said, I will close by saying that the Worms series is the best series and best multiplayer game so far in the short history of computer game developement. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the difference?!","review":"Why did it take them a year after the original release date to release it if it is so much similar to Worms Armaggedon.

His films are gritty, great to watch, and character driven. Hell's Hinges is a perfect example of a man attempting to exonerate his past while another man wants to erase what good he has done. When the two merge, Hell's Hinge's will never be the same. The back of the DVD case tages this is a 'B' film. Hart never made a 'B' in his life. Like the rest of his films, this is an 'A' production, and one that any lover of the Western, not to mention classic film, would enjoy.

The only mechanism we have to defend ourselves is the plethora of critics and which one do you believe? I didn't hear one negative thing about this movie, the opposite was true, but yet after I'd bought it and watched it just now I couldn't believe I'd been conned into wasting my time and money on this NOT FUNNY remake of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" minus Christmas and a watchable movie. Adam Sandler has worked hard to get where he is, but he needs someone to dare to tell him \\"Sorry, this isn't very good\\" when that is the case. He can do better, way better, and I look forward to the day he does. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLICKS","review":"THE MOVIE WAS NOT THAT GOOD, I WAS SURPRISE THAT IS WASN'T THAT GOOD.

I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan but I am a fan of Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken. I was sorely disappointed with this film. The audience can't relate to the main character at first because he is just down right irritating. I was hoping that the gags would get funnier but they didn't. I also found most of the film rather depressing as we watch the main characters life being slowly destroyed around him. Overall Click was ok, Kate Beckinsale looked beautiful as usual but even that was not enough to save it. I would NOT recommend buying this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"It won't make movie of the year...","review":"... and it surely isn't going to win any best actor awards, but it was uproariously funny and had a moral. Walken was, once again, a great weird/bad guy, but not a bad guy... is it my imagination or does he play the angel of death a large number of times in his career? And what was it with his dancing? He actually CAN dance, but he sure didn't look like it at the wedding scene.Anyway, Sandler's acting is sub-par, but that's nothing new to me. I adore Winkler, though, and think he did a superb job on his part in the movie as well.There were some moments in the movie I literally laughed out loud, and I'm not usually one to do that. The liposuction scene, \\"It looks like a tongue,\\" just killed me!It's a decent movie for kids, but it does have a few sexually suggestive scenes with the animals, so probably not for the very young crowd, but my pre-teen loved it and laughed big belly laughs all the way through.It's definitely worth the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I rented this movie expecting to be disappointed. I sat down to watch it with my girlfriend, and waited for the (nowadays) usual predictable plot. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!Sure, the begining of the movie is standard stuff, but then you start to laugh, and laugh, then laugh some more... and then you cry like a baby!! Well, at least my girlfriend and I did.And when a movie makes you laugh, then makes you cry, and leaves you feeling GOOD all over... that's a GREAT movie, isn't it?And it has a message to boot! I recommend it 100%!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it instead","review":"This movie started out well enough but turned to multiple crude jokes that got tiresome really quickly. Having dogs humping a stuffed duck and even Sandler once (in shadow)during sex with his wife, definitely does not make this family movie material. As everyone has mentioned, Click does in the end, mirror the message from It's A Wonderful Life -- and for that reason, it is worth a rental. Watch it with your favorite workaholic who is missing out on family.The casting was great. Julie Kavner and Henry Winkler were perfect as the parents and the make up department did a great job of making them appear younger and older. David Hasselhoff and Sandler's crew of regulars were totally funny in their parts but as much as I love Adam Sandler, Click was disappointing. If it had a stronger script, it would have worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Adam Sandler movie yet!.","review":"This movie is about a man named Michal Newman (Adam Sandler). He works a lot. So 1 night he goes out on the town, and he meets Morty in the Beyond section of Bed Bath and Beyond. Morty gives him this remote. It lets his watch time in his past, fast foward, pause, just like a regular remote for a DVD player. But the problem in the story is Michal is skipping most of his life. He skips some stuff 10 years at a time. But, near the end of the movie Michal dies. What will happen next? Find out by watching the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"The idea was great, I grant you that, it always was. I've never watched anything so pointless and such a total waste of time. Long, unfunny, and unrelentingly down beat. A bad, bad movie, really bad. Here are some things that are not funny; heart attacks, divorce, manipulative bosses, losing years of your life, the grim reaper. It just goes on and on. It is hard to describe how poor and predictable this movie is. It does not do justice to Sandler's mediocre talent and abuses the greater talents of the actual actors in this movie. Again this is a bad movie with no redeeming features whatsoever. A very big disappointment for anyone looking for a comedy of any sort. It is NOT like Bruce Almighty. Sure, we'd all like a remote control that controls the universe, right? But this one starts screwing up way too early in the movie, turning it much too quickly from \\"wish fulfillment\\" to slightly depressing nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"The acting is ordinary, no brilliant special effects and nothing deep or original as I am sure I have seen something similar. It is a silly film about a man who has a family and career and puts his career first. He gets this remote control which enables him to manipulate much of his life. Eventually it ruins his life and he finds out that he needs his family first. So we have a Hollywood happy ending that makes it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT funny!","review":"I bought this movie for a laugh but hardly even got a smile out of it. Sandler is good at comedy: he should leave movies \\"with a message\\" to serious actors. He doesn't have the range to carry this one off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adam Sandler is the worst comedian and actor ever","review":"Ok, so Sandler is an architect that apparently is the second-in-command at an architecture firm, who designs buildings and reports to the boss on the most important jobs? Why is it that he drives an old Impala, his kids don't have any nice toys, despite the fact that they live in a decent house, next to people that do have money? Then he lives his life like some dude that lives in his mom's basement. Look at his wardrobe in much of the movie. It's like he's wearing his personal lounge clothes in the film! Sandler is just a nasty, slovenly guy who wouldn't be making movies today if he didn't have so much control over his own productions. He's an unfunny bum that exists only to get his sad ex-SNL cast mates work. Sandler is stuck in the early 90's and surrounded by sycophants that won't let him understand what reality is. I feel sorry for the guy. I really can't understand how his films still make money. Click was just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Gift - Click","review":"I love Amazon.com.

The movie had everything that a good movie should have.The acting is good, the story is good, the camerawork is good, the editing is good, and everthing is done just right for a movie that's fun for the whole family.Then they threw bathroom humor into every other scene (for no apparent reason). I hope you like to watch shadows have sex, because that's there too. (Why? I don't know.) Oh, and barnyard porn. With stuffed animals.All I can say is I'm glad I watched this movie before letting my kids near it. It's going back to Blockbuster in the morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"under-developed and over-hyped","review":"The funny parts were all in the 60 second TV commercials- and they were funny, but there wasn't that much more for comedy. The plot was reasonable and had the similarities to classics others have pointed out.The PG-13 was really pushing it. With the exception of full nudity, it had all the elements of an R. I only mention this if you were going to watch it w/ your kids. I've been into bars that had shadow-box dancers and this was similar.I almost gave it one star, but there were a few good scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching","review":"When I went to see this movie I thought I was going to see another funny Adam Sandler movie. There was certainly the traditional Adam Sandler humor and then....a bit more. While I'm sure it won't be voted best movie of the summer it still has great merit. There is a message about family being more important then career which isn't new. However, I was surprised in this movie as I was with Adam Sandler in Spanglish and Jim Carey in The Majestic. Adam Sandler can show some emotion and depth even if the movie is somewhat predictable. It's worth seeing at the theater. Adam Sandler fans (such as myself) will like this movie. Kate Beckinsale in NEVER hard on the eyes for all the male viewers. I'll certainly buy the DVD when it comes out. Hopefully they'll have a soundtrack to go with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome entertaining comedy with a moral to the story","review":"I knew this was going to be a good movie, but surprisingly was a lot better than I thought.

It starts off as a fairly pleasant typical Adam Sandler (looking old and drained these days) comedy and ending up as a melodramatic, tragic and sentimental soap opera. The movie reminded me of \\"For the Boys\\" with Bette Midler, not in subject matter, but in its similarity in tone. That movie by started out as a musical comedy and ending up as a tragic melodrama. The contrast in both movies is just too jarring, leaving the viewer cold.Personally, I think Adam Sandler is getting too old for this sort of nonsense. He has not really matured as an actor in the same manner as, say, Robin Williams, and would be wise to take some acting lessons or stick to producing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Click is a comedy with a serious side.

We talked about life and death, love and family. The comedy is over the top. There is too much of the dog and chicken, and there could have been less profanity, but I feel that about a lot of movies. Christopher Walken is an angel of death, and although I do not like angels in movies, he fits. As Adam Sandler moves back and forth through his life by clicking a remote, it becomes apparent how much he has wasted. Life is short. Sandler can be boring, and I wondered how he has mades so many movies. I was intrigued with Kate Beckinsale. She is British."},{"rating":"2","title":"good family movie","review":"i def. thought that this was a good family movie--shows good morals and what is truly important in life--your family"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dreary melodrama marketed as a comedy [2.5 stars]","review":"Don't watch Click if you're in the mood for a light-hearted comedy. The middle of the film is miserable. Of course, it has a Hollywood happy ending. The comedy bits are OK but few and far between. If Click had been marketed as a drama, this would be less of a problem.The story line has some great life lessons. Without giving away too much, the morals of this movie are: 1. put family first; 2. don't wish your life away, but enjoy every minute of it, even the mundane. For driving home those lessons, Click has some value. It is also great to see Adam Sandler do well in a dramatic role. He has more range than you might imagine.But there's something very unsatisfying about watching Click that's not fixed by the sugar-coated ending or the few bits of Sandler-esque pranks and smartass jokes. In short, it's a mediocre film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"This was a great concept, however the movie just didn't reach the potential of the story. I would like to see better screen writers re-do this picture. This time with a little bit more imagination"},{"rating":"1","title":"Change the Channel","review":"This is a very disappointing movie. If Adam Sandler opens a flix for you, then get it. You'll possibly enjoy seeing him roll out his rag tag bag of pointless expressions in a B-level comedy trying desperately not to insult the concept of \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\" You really cannot mix charm and slapstick. More importantly, you figure out this one from the start which makes a majority of the movie pointless. (Spoilers Ahead). The movie makes no attempt to hide its heavy handed hint this is all a dream, which makes it hard to be invested in the diabolical that will become this man's pathetic and empty life. Ultimately, we end up not caring about our \\"hero\\" one way or the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragicomedy","review":"This is the first Adam Sandler movie that made me cry.

Well, the idea is quite powerful but not new, the characters are done in the \\"comics\\" style and very primitive, the jokes are quite boring.Actually what is really amazing, that it could've been ok to watch as a family movie, but a few really tasteless jokes made it PG13 rated without adding any fun, so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids.Too boring for adults, not appropriate for kids, too much moral for young crowd - I can't really think who might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As long as the Kids are happy!","review":"I actually took the kids to see this movie and it was entertaining for the whole family.

The Wedding Singer is still his best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in your hands (by railman5)","review":"Click is a great family movie that I recommend all familys to watch in there spear time.

Though it had it's funny parts, it's not as funny as Sandler's other comedies. What makes the movie so great, is the message it gets across to you. It reminds you how short life really is and how often people take things for granted. You should appreciate even the smaller things in life and always accept the bad with the good. Life isn't supposed to be fair and it's never perfect. This movie shows how important family is and all the things you can miss out on by working too much and putting all your focus in work.

The barberry is going to live. The Rose of Sharon was given some assistance also, though it was not as moribund as the barberry.The $10.00 that I paid for the small bottle was worth it to me.

What do these hormones do? Do they act simular the same way hormones do in humans, if so, it looks like this could be a scary road to go down with your plants. I don't know, it's just my thoughts.

It is nearly impossible to lose a plant when using Superthrive. The big BUT....Because the company chooses not to manufacture the product with a spillproof opening, the same amount of liquid (or more) that you pour into a measuring device, runs down the side of the bottle. I've purchased every size, and it happens with all. When ordering, figure that you will be getting half of what you order. Superthrive is expensive in the first place; losing half of what you pour makes it astronomically expensive! There are plenty of good fertilizers that are easy to use.

About 5 minutes into the movie I was confused, thinking it was another story with the same title...but I kept watching and discovered it is a different story with the same title, but is based on Lisa See's book. Loosely.It's completely baffling to me as to why anyone would think to butcher Ms. See's powerful story like this in a movie like this....seriously, WHY?? The book is so beautiful, and this could have been a great movie too! Basically, the story is about two girls in MODERN Shanghai who are sworn sisters. It's superficial at best and neither storyline- the modern one or the flashbacks to the old story- are properly developed. Maybe the twist was that Snow Flower and Lily reincarnated as these two girls, but in any case it's a big massive fail.Go read the book, it's truly superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchered!","review":"I read the book and loved it because it conveyed the culture in China during that period of time. It was all in first person ... a personal conversation describing her feelings about the things that were happening in her life. This movie butchered the original story by making the movie about 2 modern day Chinese women. It reduced a rich and intriguing novel into a few fragments of imagined scenes in which these two modern women played the main characters. VERY disappointed and actually, I'm very annoyed that this movie was allowed to be made in such a juvenile way. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stories in one, but not enough story in either one","review":"While the acting and cinematography were great, there was far too little substance in either of the two parralel stories in this movie. By taking the book's story and running it as a parrallel to the protagonists in the containing story, set in modern times, it fails to add enough character development to either story, which would be fine, but this movie is all about the characters and the special bond they shared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I give the film 2 1/2 stars. I am one of those bookworms that prefers the book and like the other bookworms was truly hoping that the movie would have some resemblance to the book. Why did there had to be a present time and WHY did Hugh Jackman have to be in this movie!? I felt his character like that of Nina and Sophia were mostly pointless to the central plot. I much prefer the story related to the times of Snow Flower and Lily rather than Nina and Sophia. If you love to read, read the book, if you like slow movies this one is a good match. While the acting wasn't terrible I don't recommend the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down from book","review":"Horrible let down from the book. Very few ancient customs depicted. Filial relationships lacking. No character development.... No need to interweave future relatioship with that of the two girls from the past. Wasted valuable time and left out so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter Disappointment","review":"Loved the book, hated the movie. The modern story line and its characters did not exist in the book and failed miserably. It's not a matter of the expected changes or omissions that typically take place when a movie is made based on a book. In this case well over half the movie had nothing at all to do with the Lisa See's beautiful story about Snowflower and Lily. Very glad I didn't spend the money to drive 6 hours round trip to see this in a theater!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the book","review":"This movie was a disappointment. I was expecting to see a movie version of the book. This is not it. This would have been such a wonderful movie if it did not include a parallel modern storyline.

However, the DVD was faulty and kept skipping sections of the story. We cleaned the DVD, but we were never able to view the complete film and finally gave up. The film used subtitles which made it difficult to follow the story at times. Also, the film followed two story lines, present and past; in the novel, only the story from the past was presented. All in all, I loved the book, but the film was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Absolutely loved the book.

Sweet and loving moments shared between the girls as well as painful traditions they endure in the novel are glazed over to make way for the modern storyline taken on in the movie. The combination of the modern and ancient narratives sacrificed the quality and detail of both stories. I know people always say the book is better than the movie, but in this case, the movie plot is so different from the novel that I'm not even sure you can call this film \\"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan.\\"Without comparing it to the book, this movie tried to follow two very deep-rooted and complicated relationships and I didn't feel emotionally connected to either due to a lack of detailed exploration. However, if you're into Asian female dramas, although this film ranks far below the likes of \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" and \\"The Vertical Ray of the Sun\\", it may satisfy your itch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful But . . .","review":"A truly beautiful movie but please do not miss reading this most incredible book (available on Amazon of course) by Lisa See.

But worth seeing just for the visuals of China--a beautiful period piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tres chic","review":"Oops, I meant 'tres chick.' The movie cuts back and forth between pairs of friends centuries apart, one in the time when Chinese women's feet were bound, the other in the current day. Back then, social norms very nearly created segregated worlds for men and women, especially in the upper classes. As a result, friendships between women had a special closeness.Despite the lovely actresses, especially Bingbing Li, the story came across as inert. I didn't gain insight from comparing the two friendships, and that's really all the movie tried to offer. If you love \\"relationships\\" movies, then Snow Flower might suit you. I'm a guy who likes guy movies, though, and this was too chicky for me.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book lovers, don't bother with this.","review":"I read (actually, listened to) the book and loved it, so I approached the movie with some trepidation.

In fact, for a band ever to make an album this effective is a rare feat.They shape a new \\"neo-psychedelic\\" sensibility out of creative stinging guitar and gothic band sounds. The lyrics evoke something new, something strong, something that does not want to be seen as a progression from late 60's hippie music. The music adds up to more than the sum of its parts. The band plays sparsely but effectively. The songs are a strange combination of sting and sweetness.Much further advanced than the music of their North American tour-mates U2 were at this point in time. What are the influences here?

You will have to paste and resize each frame of the template individually. You may have to print testers. I print one on cheap bond paper and match it up over a light box.I use these and make them work but they are not as good as Avery would like you to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware smudges","review":"Nearly half of the sheets in the package had weird blue smudges or drag marks on them.

Only that it is for \\"Ink Jet\\". On my Epson NX625 ink jet, an otherwise trustworthy and very reliable little desktop printer, this product fails to feed and print.I wasted a lot of expensive ink, an hour of my time, and a couple dozen sheets of this product to yield a total of twelve -- count 'em, twelve -- usable business cards. I have a trashcan of smeared and bent card stock to show for the rest of that hour.Next time I'll go with the 250 pcs. for $10 over the internet, from other printing vendors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad templates good quality paper","review":"This is a waste of time for card designs that need centering. The templates are completely useless. I wasted hours trying to get them to line up on while copier paper, so I don't waste the Avery. The template I used was for Photoshop. I'm good with Photoshop so it wasn't me, it was the template. I tried the word version template also thinking maybe it's easier, it's more useless. The paper quality is good and looks similar to the professionally printed stack - that's why it's getting 2 stars instead of 1. I would recommend this only if you don't need to center your design, or you'll hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed In Quality","review":"I convinced people that I could make business cards for them, and invested in the software and paper. Software worked outstanding, but this paper looked little better than standard copier bond. The thickness is minimal, and the texture is just on one side.

They need to do much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product says \\"cheap\\"","review":"Avery is living on its reputation, and like other companies that try this, their reputation is going down fast...Cards can only be printed one side (no indication of this on box or in literature); also, they had problems w/ink spotting (not printer related)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was very disappointed with this book.

The reader will feel that he or she is personally experiencing growing up with the author in the most modest and simple circumstances, in the young State of Israel, from before statehood and into its early years, getting to know as friends and neighbors some of its intellectual leaders who were the writer's family members and friends. The book is a sheer delight, and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and passionate","review":"This is a gem of a book.

Richard Chamberlain does not fit as Alan Quatermain, but Sharon Stone is shining. It is not faithful to H. Rider. Haggard's book, but it is a very nice script with great characters such as the bold nazi militar who's crazy with Wagner's music. If there's something that saves this movie is the original musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. It's something so beautiful and full of energy that doesn't deserve to be in such a bad movie (the special effects are worser than the ones used by Ed Wood jr). Yes, you must see this movie so as to fall in love with Goldsmith's music. If adventure has a name, it must be \\"Indiana Jones\\", but if \\"King Solomon's mines\\" would have been properly shot, Allan Quatermain and Jerry Goldsmith's music would have made an excellent competition for Indy and Jhon Williams outstanding score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Region 2 King Solomon's Mines DVD","review":"In the area where I purchased the video on Amazon, it did not have anything about region 2 videos not playing on video players in the US.

Also, the handle is attached loosely and comes off easily which makes it hard to carry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very friendly deck","review":"I was unsure of how well I would like this deck when I read the description of the cards. The images are very friendly and they have a very \\"nice\\" feeling to them. The readings are accurate and have a more positive twist to them. Some of the images are of people from the 1800's and, at first, I found that a bit odd but I realized that for this particular deck, it's perfect. Great for everyday use or to just collect. I was very surprised by this deck and I'm sure others will be too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like Bubble Gum Trading Cards","review":"I bought this deck based upon the glowing reviews I'd read here. I was disappointed. The cards are about the size of regular playing cards (smaller than a standard Rider-Waite)--which wouldn't be a bad thing, except that they also have garish graphic purple borders. They make the cards look like cheap bubble gum trading cards. As for the paintings themselves, the artist paints in the styles of various famous (in this case, mostly impressionist and fantasy) painters, and the result often feels a bit inconsistent. I would've liked it if the artist had more of her own developed style. I realize that this is only a tarot deck, and wasn't meant to be a great work of art, but it's worth pointing out. But those borders are so atrocious and distracting that they'd distract from any kind of painting. I don't know what the designers of this deck were thinking.It should also be noted that this deck is supposed to be very celtic."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome deck","review":"This is my first tarot deck, and I must say, it's a good one. The artwork is totally fantastic, very elaborate yet simple and beautiful, and the little book that accompanies it is great. However, it( the book) could do with a little more info. But don't get me wrong! this deck is exquisitly done, and i definatly recommend it. I think i'll check out the accompanying book, also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art work is fine!","review":"Pity that the deck forces Golden Dawn Hebrew letter attributions: they are included upon the cards. Via the Waite/Colman Smith deck and the many commentaries discussed in numerous books, these attributions have spread widely, yet, many share the view that these are *not* correct. To have them presented leaves the person unfree to work with letter attributions (if at all) as they so wish, or as they discover differently from deeper study.If it wasn't for this, I would have given it a far higher rating - the artwork is worth a four or five star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful imagery!","review":"My husband bought me this deck as a present and I immediately fell in love with it. I have other decks that I use but since receiving this Spiral deck, I find that I'm drawn more to it and have gained a new understanding of the cards. The images for the minor arcana are insightful and I find that interpretation has come much more readily and I don't always have to consult a book for meaning. It's also nice to compare and contrast this deck with others to see how the images are portrayed. I recommend this to beginners, collectors or almost anyone interested in Tarot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Anthony","review":"As usual, it's filled with sexism, women as victims or sluts, a convoluted plot, shallow characters and poor dialogue.

To add to that, the men's bodies are toned, lightly tanned, neatly shaved and very easy on the eye. The previous reviwer's comments are quite justified, but this should not discourage the fan of the male nude from purchasing this video. The bodies on display are superb and the effect of the rythmic beat and the firmly masculine tone of the narrator create a sensual effect. This video is meant more for display than instruction and who could pass up the opportunity to view five glistening hunks performing their morning workout nude? My main criticism is that it dwells too much on frontal views and more rear shots would have been welcome as the glimpes provided show that all the men are very well turned. Having said that, the ample anatomical detail on view is superb and this is a wonderful opportunity for any lover of the naked male form in motion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Get Your Heart Beating","review":"I was disappointed with this video. If you want to get fit, the video is fine for muscle toning but it certainly did NOT make me break a sweat, get my heart beating or make me breathe heavily. I recommend you just watch it 1 or 2x through first to get over the X rated closeups, and to learn the transitions. Then you can move on and focus on actually exercising. Music was forgettable. Lighting was poor and there were a lot of shadows. Often, I was annoyed that the camera was zoomed in extremely close on a body part during a transition to a new move. I needed the camera to pan back showing the whole room so I could follow the next step. Also annoying, was the fact that someone offscreen is narrating or counting out the steps while you see the lead model silently mouthing the count.

The machine is powerful, quiet and has excellent dust collection. The oscillating range is fine, it should never be more than a 1/2 inch. Two improvements could be made to the machine. First, it would be nice to turn off the oscillator when you need a little extra height. Secondly, it would be nice to have a handle crank to adjust the sanding angle. It is not the easiest operation for one person to accurately set the angle.

She reaches into Celtic lore, 9th century chistian belief, shamanic ritual and Germanic myth to create a world where religion and forces of nature are in flux. Part of this is the sacred marriage between the male and female principles (hieros gamos). The various sexual acts in this story illustrate the uses of sex from the sacred to the profane.

Her tale follows three thirty-something women: one actress, one producer, and one receptionist/would-be-screenwriter as they deal with work, love, and life. Sprinkled liberally throughout with the trials and tribulations of backstabbing co-workers, dishonest showbiz types, afrocentric power players, fast women and faster men, \\"Blind Ambitions\\" is good entertainment. If you're looking for a soul-searching, soul-stirring story, this isn't for you.

Where is the plot? Where is the character development? Where is the intrugue? Where is the unexpected twist? Why was everything so predictable? As another reviewer said, what has been written is just an outline for a novel. A very good book could have been delivered, but what we got was air.I was relieved that Ms. Files wrote this book without the rawness of her first two novels. For that she gets the two stars. However, she needs to refine her writing skills to produce good, solid, memorable storylines and characters. \\"Blind Ambitions\\" missed the mark.Ms. Files has the potential to transition to a good novelst.

I read it at work, during breaks in the car, and just before bed. The writing kept me hooked all the way through. I just saw Lolita Files at a booksigning. That in and of itself was phenomenal. She is not just an excellent writer. She is personable, entertaining, accessible, and seemed very friendly. The crowd loved her. She is also gorgeous, which has nothing to do with anything in terms of writing, but makes her even more fascinating in a layered way. She looks like a star but feels like a friend. The bookstore owner said that Miss Files is one of the most popular authors out there because of how she writes and how she is as a person. I'm already sold. I'm a Lolita Files fan fa life. P.S.

I LOVE the other two books from Lolita but I thought this one was way to intense when it came to show business terminology.

I think fiction should be enjoyable and full surprises and suspense not an in depth study of any type of information...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I am a fan of Ms. Files. I still talk about her last two books and it's been a long time since I've read them. The reasons I liked those books so much was because she made the characters come alive with the depth she gave them. In Blind Ambitions, the characters do not have that same depth, but the book is as entertaining as ever. It is a very quick read. If you're looking to take a break from ANYTHING, pick up this book for a short-lived refreshing get-a-away. With that attitude you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reading...","review":"I must say that Lolita did not let me down, it was some good reading. I wouldn't give it five star's because I was really let down in the end. I was all hyped up, just to be kind of let down. With her I am used an ending that just keeps you wanting more, and I don't. There was a lot of show biz terms thrown around and a lot of material things mentioned, but hey thats showbiz. It is a book of Love, Power, Politic's and Money.

No. I would encourage people to either check it out of the Library or wait for the paperback version.Without giving away the story for those who haven't read it yet -- I didn't know what to think after I was finished.

There's also a variety of metal songs to please the angsty rocker in you (\\"Sleeping Awake\\" by POD had been criticized of being a weak song for them but I still think it's great)!Don Davis also features on the album, making a pleasing return from the first movie soundtrack.

It will be another example I'll use in my ongoing quest to \\"voice\\" my preference for instrumental music.I intensely dislike these particular Marilyn Manson & Rob Zombie tracks for their use of language and tone of voice, though I have enjoyed both artists work in the past. Granted there are other singers with talent on the disk, but the overall effect shows that more and more often, music is being cranked out simply to meet expectations of production/merchandising with only a fleeting glace at quality.I admit I'm impressed that we could get two CDs for the price of one, but again its quantiy over quality in order to sell.Thanks anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough beats","review":"Sorry to say but what ruins this whole soundtrack is the distasteful mix of rock and techno.

But, this is far from a soundrack. It's the record company squeezing a couple bucks out of \\"The Matrix\\" name, and putting out a sampler basically. Half of the tracks are available on the artists albums, and the rest is tailored specifically to the film. Just like the soundtrack to the first film that everyone seems to rant and rave about. Sure some of the songs are good, but some of them have been around long before \\"The Matrix\\" franchise. Nothing new here folks. Lets not think too hard about this one with 3,000 word reviews and how you like this song and don't like this one. Go review a real album.

P.O.D.'s \\"Sleeping Awake\\" is a very catchy tune that fits the soundtrack to a \\"T.\\" Various instrumental songs and trailers are included on the second of the 2-disk set. Disk number 2 contains a preview of \\"The Final Flight of Osiris,\\" \\"The Matrix Reloaded,\\" and \\"Enter The Matrix,\\" the game due out the same day as the movie.

The scene is always very important because it shows that Neo (the one) is indeed (the one) and it shows power and that the agents are nothing to him, representing man overcomes machine. Burly Brawl is also indeed a masterpiece, techno and orcestra collide with this one and this is when Neo is faced with over 60-70 agents, fighting about 6 at a time, it is a very uptempo piece with a nice sound and it easy to listen to over and over and over again, I have, anything else is decent on the track, and is not really worth listening to unless your actually hearing it with the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUNO REACTOR!","review":"I only give this soundtrack four stars because of disc 2.

And to end the first cd you have a Oakenfold remix of a Dave Matthews Band track which for some strange reason, works amazingly. This soundtrack has so much energy to it just like the first soundtrack. This cd is a must but especially with the second cd which is more instrumental which they should have included in the first soundtrack.

It's probably most of the fans opinion that the second CD from the album is a lot better than the first one. I just think that way because the second CD is the real soundtrack from the movie. Therefore it contains the songs played in the movie.Not that the first CD is bad, or anything like that. If you like Linkin Park's style you will probably like the CD because it is basically that style, but it doesn't have much to do much with the movie. I just think that it is not the kind of CD I would buy. But the second is worth the entire price of it, it simply made me ruffle. Oh, and there is a little surprise in it too.

Also, it is a well know fact that ferrets prefer to poop in corners. This carrier has to-the-floor zippers in all corners, meaning that, rather than wiping up any poop at the end of the trip, you find yourself either giving up cleanliness or picking dried poop out of the teeth of the zipper with a toothpick.

At the end, without any prior hint of hostility towards her father, she is depicted killing him in a remarkably dispassionate manner while taunting him sexually. She then blows up herself and her mother (apparently the original script just had her killing the father, but this wasn't lurid enough for Hopper, who threatened to quit if they didn't let him take the film over). I suppose I could buy the depiction if it worked dramatically, but I don't think it does. All of the actors have some excellent scenes (although Hopper's are often marred by his manic tendencies), but the film as a whole isn't convincing in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly wonderful","review":"When I went to the theatre to see this 20 plus years ago (!!!)

Finally, a true portrayal of faeries!A lot of people complain that the book is \\"too dark\\" and \\"too ugly\\" of a portrayal on faeries. The interesting thing about these complaints however, is that faeries were NOT limited to the cute little winged figures that sat in flowers (this was in fact, a much later and highly romanticized form added). Nor were Faeries truly good. Though the Faery Realm was indeed a realm of beauty, laughter and music, it was also a realm of darkness, ugliness, and even evil.

I definately learned something and I plan on purchasing this book in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous!","review":"I have never seen such gorgeous and detailed art with faeries! The entire book is fascinating. There's some regular handwriting along with typed text, so it gives the reader a break from uniform letters. A lot of the faeries have some sort of folk-tale to them. Some are simply described. The pictures come in such variety! There are paintings, extraordinarily detailed drawings... drawings that look inked. As an 18 year old aspiring fantasy artist (who loves to draw faeries ;o) ) Brian Froud's work is an incredible inspiration! I adore this book so much. It's something you can read over and over... read out of order... I could spend hours alone just looking at the pictures! This is the best faery book I have ever had the pleasure to come across!

Either you love the story and lore, or you hate the imagery. If you want a book with a light hearted story and fluffy lore with beautiful pixies/faeries; this is NOT the right book.

Since I live near the ocean I naturally love to read beach stories. This book has a little of everything. A little romance, a little ecology and how ordinary people can save our shores from overdelopment. The last is a particular concern of mine. This book showed how anyone can make a difference. It also demonstrated that although we may want things to be exactly the same we do have to accomodate the needs of the community as a whole.Once I started to read this book it was difficult to put down. I feel this book will appeal to anyone who is at the beach, would like to be at the beach or who likes to read interesting,quick reading material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Intro to Media Structures","review":"This was the main textbook for my Mass Media class at Trinity University. It was a very interesting book which had a lot of good things to say. I had never conceptualized television and radio as a for profit industry with structures governing their behavior just like the steel or automobile industry. The book does not waste tim eon boring chapters full of gory details about this and that medium of communication. It looks at all media as an integrated system. It was a little dry at times, but not to much for me as an undergraduate.

I thought I was assisting to a highschool performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it cause I thought it was funny, listen because it's good!!!","review":"I originally bought this CD because I found it amusing that a hasidic jew was singing reggae. To me it was basically a novelty act. When I originally heard Matisyahu on the radio, I thought that it was some jamacain name or something. After a few listens to the CD, I realized how good it was. Matisyahu was better than a lot of the artists that fit the traditional reggae stereotype. True, his songs were filled with old testament propaganda that I don't totally agree with, but either way, you can't understand half the stuff he's saying anyway!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entirely unique and surprisingly well done","review":"If you would have told me to listen to a NYC kid turned Hassidic Jew's take on reggae, I would have declined. But after hearing about how amazing Matisyahu's voice was, I decided to give it a shot. I am no reggae expert, Bob Marley is as good as it gets right? So why bother with all the other crap?Well, Bob is as good as it gets, but Matisyahu has breathed new life into the possibilities of reggae. His sound is FRESH and his voice is undeniably amazing. This is a new type of music and it's simply great.The recording quality of this live show is above par and the energy Matisyahu exudes throughout the performance is fantastic. You may find listening to this album to be somewhat spiritual and uplifting regardless of your personal faith.I highly recommend giving this a chance, and I much prefer the energy and rawness of this live album over his studio album."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok reggae","review":"There is nothing bad here, but nothing that great either.

Just relax and take it as it is: good parody, sucky music."},{"rating":"1","title":"*yawn*","review":"one of the worst imitations i've ever heard. this really is getting ridiculous. i had high hopes for this record, judging from the apparent 'spirityall' content and 'tight rhythm section'. the band was without the push and pull of a seasoned reggae riddim section, and no vibe. so i tried to appreciate it for what it was, not what it's been billed as. and what is was, incidently, was boring and repetitive. if you really need something to prove that 'white guys can play reggae', try gentleman. it blows this garbage away with the quickness. jah bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gift that I am trying to keep on giving.","review":"Save your money.End of story.I am unable to give this gift away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is not reggae. This some hasidic jew whining and saying oogi yoi over and over again.Not worth it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its cool and it grows with every listening","review":"An orthodox jew doing reggae?! That was such an odd combination that I just had to buy his two CDs. Believe it or not, but Matisyahu has created a really new and totally cool sound! The man combines real musical talent with a burning belief. He uses his music to express his own strong passion.This is art inspired by religion much in the same way as the Sistine Chapel is. The religiosity or religion of the listener is not that important.There are some songs that are not that good, but others, like Chop 'em down and Sea to sea are just great. He is still finding his way in the musical world, and some experiments are bound to fail (eg. Warrior and Beat box). I prefer this CD to Youth.He also sounds like a quite cool guy in interviews, and is not a fanatic in any way, which is a relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD purchased in a long, long time!","review":"I was prepared to not like this CD, cuz I generally don't like ANYONE's live albums. However, I found myself equally moved by this live version, as I was the studio recording of Matisyahu's first album, \\"Shake Off the Dust - Arise.\\" I'm not Jewish, but Matisyahu's music transcends to all races and religions. When you go to bed at night, try listening to this CD in the dark, wearing headphones, volume cranked. I guarantee it will give you chills!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST OF THE YEAR!","review":"This is the best thing to come out in a long, long time. It combines reggae beats with the talent of great musicians and some very passionate vocals. The energy of the music transcends any religious or ethnic titles and can connect to all people. This live session truly engages the audience and encompasses many musical forms from the traditional reggae, to jamming guitars, and even to spoken word and beat-boxing. Its an enhanced CD and has a copy of the video for \\"King without a Crown,\\" so you can see the live performance.Matisyahu is truly incredible! I doubt anything this GREAT will come out for the rest of the year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was skeptical too....","review":"I am pretty big Ska and Reggae fan particularly in it's Latin form. A while back (mid summer i belive) i saw a banner add for Matisyahu on myspace announcing him as the \\"Hasidic Reggae Superstar\\". I checked it out and i was suprised to find a genuine and heartfealt effort. The music is something unique esspcially when you compare it to other stuff out there take Nickleback for example. Like i said i was a skeptic too but i was suprised if you are looking for something unique than give this album a shotI had the luck of seeing him perform live in Dallas and simply put he has an amazing presence on stage, you can feel the energy he conveys through his album however and if you ever get the oppurtunity to see him perform live please do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live at Stubb's","review":"For those of you who started out with his album Youth or Light or even the new Live at Stubb's II this will be a bit different. Same great sound but this recording leans more towards an orthodox soulful sound, that I personally love. If you want to feel something grab this download. It has strong Jewish ideas this makes the sound richer. Give it a whirl. Matisyahu is true to his heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"Very good CD! You can feel the emotion in the singing. This is my favorite Matisyahu CD. Great lyrics. Wonderful beats! Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully created live album","review":"Although I noticed many print reviews of this album knock it for not delivering much new to the songs, especially knocking the quality of some of the transfers, I think these reviewers couldn't be more wrong.Essentially, every song from Shake Off the Dust... Arise that is on the live album is a completely different sounding song. Each and every time, it's a new and fresh experience. This live album shows his power as a singer, and it's a great thing to listen to.I definitely suggest this album; it's pretty close to perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"just good music","review":"I am neither for nor against religion in music... This cd has very good jams and has a nice beat and good flow. i enjoy to just mellow out to it. I dont care about all the positive and negative criticims of him/his message. GOOD MUSIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightenment","review":"I believe Matisyahu is an enlightenment to all. He lights up the stage every time he performs. The same is to be said about his words and message. I feel like a new person every time I hear his voice. He puts a new view on every circumstance in life for me. I believe if given the chance, Matisyahu's words could change the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly different","review":"One of the most satisfying cd's I have gotten in a while. Different like Beck. Sounds of Marley, combined with Sublime and Eminem. Listen to the music people! Ignore all the racial undertones that others have reviewed and ripped this album apart. He speaks of some of this in his songs (very few), but it isn't enough to turn anyone off. It isn't a faithful album. I am not Jewish. I am not really religious and this album is one of the most refreshingly creative sounds I have heard. His voice and tones are mezmorizing. Worth the purchase just for the blending of sounds and the different kinds of music that are presented. One of the best albums I have heard in a long time. Fanastic! Worth the money. If you like island music, if you like the sounds of sublime and something different like Beck, buy it. Buy it and listen to the music. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"A powerful album, with impassioned performances by Matisyahu and his band (some great guitar solos)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chop em down","review":"Who says reggae and hasidic judaism don't go together? Matisyahu chops down the boundaries of those limiting ideas. This album has uplifting, beautiful music with a positive message. The production quality is phenomenal for a live album. If it weren't for the cheering crowd, I would almost have mistaken it for a studio album.My reason for only 4 stars: I absolutely love about half the songs on the album. Those songs are some of my favorites and have touched me on many levels. The other half are okay. But I find myself skipping many of the songs to hear the ones I really dig.Open your mind. Open your heart. People of any faith (or no faith) can enjoy this wonderful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This album is a brilliant collection of so many influences. It definitely lifts the spirits to a higher conciousness. Simply rythmically this music get the body moving, I dare you to sit still when listening to it. It is a great combination of reggae, scat, jazz, and soul with a deffinitly beautiful message"},{"rating":"2","title":"Matisyahu is a genius!!!","review":"This is possibly the best album I have heard in a long time. M is a musical genius. Not only do his song lyrics have substance, his sound is a beautiful blend of reggae with a dash of hip hop and dancehall. The album does start off slow, but it builds to an excellent ending with Close My Eyes. I can not wait to see him live or see him in concert. This is a must have album!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy is the real deal","review":"I bought this disk simply on word of mouth, I am quite satisfied with my purchase.Matisyahu is a soulful reggae performer with deep meaning behind his songs. While much has been made of his orthodox Jewish background, and his music is spiritual...there is no holding back or conservatism in the music. While his voice is somewhat lacking in depth he has broad range from scat to soliloquy to melody, range he sings with emotion, heart, balls, what ever you want to call it...he puts himself out there and that is what you want from reggae.The band does not dominate the music but the more you listen the more you realize their unique vitality. They are every bit as good as he and perhaps its the singer and the band together synergistically make a great album, the sum which is better then the two parts.In review, this is great reggae and I look forward to buying more albums by Matisyahu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Joking?","review":"First of all, anyone giving this a positive review is a straight up idiot. Seriously, you all have to be kidding yourselves. This is indeed a novelty act - and a bad one at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst imitation of reggae I have ever heard!!!","review":"This guy can't sing to save his soul and while the lyrics may be religious, it is hard to listen to his off beat, off tune offerings.He can't beat box, rap, or sing. If you need a coaster or paper weight, buy this cd cause this is no reggae sensation. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live at Stubbs","review":"Descent CD to put on while people are over, very chill with some upbeats on a fair amount of tracks.CD is a CD-ROM that plays a live video for King Without A Crown. Can't wait to see him live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting mix of Reggae/Rap/Religion","review":"This was my first introduction to Matisyahu. I got this CD as a gift, otherwise I might never have heard him. I must say that the music was so different from anything else I had ever heard that it took me some time to get use to. Matisyahu's music is like a strong cup of coffee, you have to acquire a taste for it. Having said that, after a few listens to it, I began to really like it. The fact that this is a \\"live\\" album really enhances his style of singing, because he interacts with his audience and they respond. There is an aire of electricity throughout the concert that is palpable. This CD rocks folks! I now own 2 other Matisyahu CD's, but this remains my favorite. His words will shake you and inspire you. Try him, you like him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"I've seen Matisyahu live at my college. It was a dynamic performance, as he and his back-up band really have the talent to stand at the forefront of current reggae <a href='http://consumeralertsystem.com/cas/zx-hclick.php?hid=268' target='_blank'>music</a>. Matisyahu's vocal abilities are excellent when he starts going into his long raps and exercises his beat boxing abilities. Aside from all that, this album is one of the most uplifting pieces of [...] that I've listened to in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one's all about Pletnev, not Scarlatti","review":"If you like bizarre accents and distorted tempos to the point of recomposition--Pletnev's performance of K 404 is a perfect example--then you will love this album! Other works are fast, and that's all they are. K 113 is a case in point, played so quickly that one hears nothing of the dialogue of the hand-crossing.It's not all bad--sometimes Pletnev's technique can show a new dimension that works as music--K 214 is a good example. And Pletnev does offer a nice variety, divided about 50/50 between same ol' and less familiar sonatas.But I've listened to the album over 10 times and much of what struck me as new and exciting at first now just sounds weird and distorted. I recommend Ivo Pogorelich or Michael Lewin if you want to hear Scarlatti played well on piano."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my taste","review":"I found these versions to be grossly distorted exaggerations of exceptional music. Pletnev, in my humble opinion, shows poor taste in over-interpreting Scarlatti.There are many splendid versions of this great composer's works to choose from on piano(i.e. Michelangeli, Pogerelich,di Bonaventura, Horowitz),or harpsichorcd (Hantai) which capture the beautiful simplicity of this music.Pletnev does not capture it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure","review":"This recording is a brillant example of artistic failure, musical distortion and poor intellect. There's no sign of brain activity. It's clear that \\"artists\\" like Pletnev should be executed for the damage they do to music.SHAME.I read some comments about humorous playing, guys you confuse art with circus. Yes, I think it's amusing too! And yet I couldn't avoid of being angry. Pletnev belongs in the elite category? Yes, indeed, the elite of the musical tsarlatans. Waste of money and time.Go and listen Anthony di Bonaventura, just to have an idea of what Scarlatti really wrote and above all, what's music and honesty is all about. Pletnev couldn't create a better crap than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't but this one","review":"There is another release of this exact same CD from Virgin Classics that is priced at only $11!!!!

Otherwise, this is definitely a five star CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have Guitar, Will Travel.","review":"Jeff Turmes is a very gifted and talented musician.Unfortunately, for people not in the know, Jeff will only be 'a face in the crowd' and his name won't be indelibly etched in most people's memory bank.I find his music to be universal and his voice, although unique, still an acquired taste.This disc is \\"hot\\" and worthy of high ratings, but will not be everyone's \\"cup of tea\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased!","review":"Reasonable price for quality of product.

With a short biographical introduction it starts with his early artistic adventures then goes on to detailed, if eclectic, subjects, blending Realism with whimsy. The final pages showcase his ingenious and mechanically marvelous sculptures which are exquisitely painted, with detailed marquetry and metalwork. The printed page shows but a shadow of what these constructions must be like in 3D.If you like his other work, and you can find this one, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful work in a nice volume.","review":"Fantastic overview of Kit Williams' early work. Good printing and colour reproduction. The commentary on his own work is both witty and illuminating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Phenonmenal Comeback. Bravo!","review":"Hands down, this album radiates excellence. Lake of Tears have long been a favourite of mine. And, like so many grief-stricken fans I was mortified to learn of their separation. However, LoT has returned with an album so utterly compelling that it will indeed summon tears to the eyes. Perhaps not a lake, but there you are.Black Brick Road is a lush soundscape, replete with gothic, melancholy vocals and high keening guitars. Standout tracks include the eerily thunderous 'The Greymen', the keening 'Making Evenings,' the masterful 'Rainy Day Away,' the haunting narrative 'A Trip With the Moon,' and finally the albums softly uttered centerpiece, the subtle and pervasive 'Black Brick Road.'If you care about consummate craftsmanship, if you thrill to deep, evocative lyrics, if you enjoy music that just kicks general gothic ass, you couldn't do better than 'Black Brick Road.' Quite simply a masterpiece. Oh, and it's good, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe is the man","review":"Hey what can words say for this album.It is just a great album.This is that type of cd you want to listen to the whole thing instead of skip tracks. With songs like \\"STUTTER\\", \\"BLACK HAWK\\", and \\"TREAT HER LIKE A LADY\\", this album should or will go 2x Platnium at least.If you are like me and hate *Nsync you will love the track \\"I BELIEVE IN YOU\\" they did with Joe.If you love *Nsync you will love this track.So take it from me, if you get this album you will not forget it.Joe i hope your future albums are as grate as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"This brother has been quietly putting out the hits for years,whether writing them or singing them.It's nice to finally see him get his due.A man of true romance that knows no rival,Joe is a force to be dealt with.Now's a good time for all of you who slept on him to run out and buy his first two cd's \\" Everything \\" & \\" All that I Am \\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe is Great","review":"This cd was a great purchase.

I Want to Know and Stutter are my two fave songs on the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Cd Will Get U a TABLE 4 TWO!","review":"This Album is rated with its five stars in five ways: Content, Creativity, enjoyability, Comparing to other artists and , THAT EXTRA ONE STAR IF IT IS EXTRA HOT!. Joe's Album Starts off hot with \\"Somebody's Gotta Be on top\\", A hot song to kick off the hot album. With all of the phat slow songs, he comes in with the ill, fast pace \\"Table 4 Two,\\" A track I happen to like better then \\"I Wanna Know,\\" the hit single. Joe hits it off with all of his unique talent. Unlike Many other R&B artists, each one of Joe's songs sounds different, with both a different tone and a different beat(Sometimes I even forgot it was Joe singing). Each song tells a different story. Not like other artists where They tell you how much they want to rip a girl's panties off (this includes Sisqo). If U \\"wanna Know\\" what a good R&B cd is, Get \\"My Name is Joe.\\" \\"Make it Last\\",\\"Get Crunk Tonight\\", and some of the others I've mentioned are my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disappointment!","review":"I loved Joe's last album \\"All That I Am\\" -- but this one was a total disapointment. After waiting patiently for this album to be released -- I am sorry that I spent my money on this cd. Joe has a beautiful voice -- only if he had spent time using it on the right songs. The best two songs on this album are \\"I want to Know\\" and the remix with Mariah Carey - \\"Thank God I Found You.\\" I hope his next album will be better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY TYPICAL TODAYS R-N-B","review":"Another facotry based Disc.I've heard Joe for a few Years&He still sounds Like a Low Budget 2nd tier R.Kelly.He Won't Ever Be On R'S Level Let a More Keith Sweat's.This Album's Music Could Easily Be on Anyones Disc that's out now.Very Predictable&Boring.Thank God Remix is Bad Bad.Keith Sweat's Make it Last Forever didn't Need a Weak Re-make.His Voice is Alright but the Material is so Bland as is the Song-writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice C.D.!","review":"This book is great from a toddler's point of view! Sure it's crude and simplistic, but so are 3 year olds! My small son loves this one, takes it to the bathroom with him. It shows him that poop is a normal, acceptable thing that all living things do, and has really helped us in our efforts to toilet train him. Everyone poops, and kids need to know that it's okay, a good thing even :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"His best album so far","review":"After much anticipation of his third album, Joe has made a comeback. With his smooth vocals and meaningful lyrics, this is an album definitely worth the wait. With collaberations with Mariah Carey, Nas and N sync, Joe shows his ability to work with artists of various styles. This album, has proved that Joe is just as talented as all the other RnB stars at the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Wanna Know Joe!","review":"Joe's third album may be his most succesful and I might be going a bit overboard, but I think it's his best. I Wanna Know, the song currently heating up the charts has brought a lot of attention to this man. It is well deserved and if you love that song like I do then you will probally love this cd.Even though I have liked him for a while I think R. Kelly overshadowed him a bit(just an observation). But this cd seperates them by far now. Joe even colleberates with N'Sync, and not being a big fan of them, I kinda like this song.The standout's are: I wanna Know, Treat Her Like A Lady, One Life Stand, and the Remix to Thank God I Found You.I think Joe has another classic on his hands and I am happy to see him having even more success. If you like R&B and Keith Swaet and R. Kelly then you'll like this work, maybe even better. To all you current Joe fans go ahead and pick this cd up, it is another steller piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"My Name Is JOE\\" Joe's best work yet!","review":"Hey! I just bought \\"My Name is JOE\\". The reason I bought it is because I am a die-hard *NSYNC fan, and there is a collaboration with them on the album called \\"I Believe in You\\". Not only is that song totally awesome, but every other song is too! I feel that I definatly got my money's worth, and I recommend this album to anybody who likes R&B. Even if you don't, I think after hearing this album, you will! Check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe Won't Be In My Cd Collection!","review":"Ok, now I am a guy and I really like Joe. His songs are mad cool! I think he can sing a song in a very poetic way and his lyrics are like that. Like a love poem, but I HATE the freaky songs. After reading the editorial, i will not buythis cd becuase to me the bad outweighs the good. I love the songs like \\"I Wanna Know\\" not songs like \\" Somebody's gotta be on top\\"! I repulse at lyrics like that. He can be a true romantic and then be freaky. I hate that kind of personality! If you are a christian and you believe that songs like that are wrong then don't purchase this cd. There is too much bad too overlook. Don't let the nice beat lure you in because it's all about what you put in your spirit and is freak nasty songs the kind you want in your spirit?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is definitely a good buy","review":"No surprise, I have been listening to Joe from the beginning and this is without any doubts a great album. It will surely match the expectations of a great r& b listener and sooth your evening. Enjoy the CD with a date and you won't need to talk(too much................"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album from Joe","review":"he is such an under rated artist! this cd is filled from beginning to end will great songs, he is truly an amazing singer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Joe","review":"I love Joe's music, I have every CD that he has ever made, I hope that he continues to make great music he has a great voice, there are not many great male singers out there and I am glad that he keeps it real and keep putting out great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as I expected.....","review":"I bought this CD by Joe because I know the brotha can sing and he is very talented but I was a bit disappointed with this CD. His last CD \\"All That I Am\\" was much better. It seems he went from telling his audience who he is to sexing all night. Their are some key songs on the album that I like and they the following: Table for Two, I Wanna Know, Treat Her Like a Lady, Thank God I Found You (remix) and I Believe in You. Apart from these songs, I think Joe did a pretty good job and it's a great party CD, especially if your trying to \\"Get Crunk Tonight.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the bomb","review":"When i first listened to this album i was like, nah the album before is definetly his best work. But as i got more into the album,i realised that Joe really out did himself on this album. The man is hot, he's the bomb. The album even has a great intro. It just shows that the album is great from the start right to the end. He has definetly out done himself this time around, can't wait for the next one. This album is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"no title","review":"Though his hit \\"i wanna know\\" is one of the all time best jams, I don't find much else in My Name is Joe. The album just doesn't make me want to listen to it over and over and not worth my money to buy it. I like Joe and his voice but there isn't enough songs to attract me to the album. \\"treat her like a lady\\" and \\"one life stand\\" are enjoyable tracks to listen to while \\"table for two\\" brings a lift in spirit. The \\"make it last remix\\" is a good mix of hip hop and r & b but the overall album isn't that strong. Joe repeats themes but he is still able to mix up the tempos. Final rating-didn't buy the album and won't but it will be better if it's listened to long enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"joe,go back to the drawing board","review":"i was anxious to pick up this cd,the \\"all that i am\\" is a classic for which i can play throughout,sad to say this new effort is not a follow-up but a attempt to capture fans who feel asleep on his excellent first two efforts, gold is will achieve, platinum time will tell.the tracks that stand out to me are \\"i wanna know\\",\\"5 6 3(joe) \\",stutter\\",\\"so beautiful\\".these tracks are ok, but not dynamic, joe has the talent, but there is not a consistent flow here,too many people in the producer or director's chair, as with the last disc, joe was in command, i wanna know will the real joe please return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Came quickly and good p!rice","review":"Thank you for offering this book we needed and it came quickly and was a good price. Thank you for your service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For lovers of the Arthur Legend","review":"If you crave Arthurian stories, then you got to read this one!! It's an excellent book and fleshes out the queen's side of this old, old story. Nancy makes her characters come to life. While you know the ending, you don't want to put the book down. This is the 1st of a series and deals with Guinevere's side. The other two books (Gawain & Tristin) are also very good and each book can be read by itself"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"This book is an absolute page turner. The hazardous and tragic love triangle between Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere is finally plausably explained. If you enjoyed Mary Stewart's Merlin trilogy, then The Queen of Camelot is an absolute must-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EPIC...","review":"Stunning. I didn't expect to be so enthralled and captivated... I've read my share of Arthurian legend, and love the genre and age and characters... but I thought I'd already read the good ones... far better than even The Mists of Avalon, for this delves into the heart of the character where Marion Z Bradley delved into the magic (which was pretty awesome too, just saying!). Made me see Gwen in a whole new light... made me pity Lancelot... and made me adore Arthur, despite his faults, his shortcomings... We also get to meet more knights of the round tables as PEOPLE... Here is truly a world completely and lovingly crafted, with a people whom you won't soon forget. I promise you that. A long delicious read, which I wished would never end! Enjoy the read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story, Nauseating Speech, Weak Heroine","review":"Good story. This is the first time I have ever read such a detailed version of the Arthur and Camelot legend. He and his knights and Gwen seem as tho they really existed in the telling of this tale... BUT the speech is nauseating. If I have to read the words \\"honor...love..my lord\\" one more time, I may have to throw it aside. Something else I am beyond tired of, seems that Gwen has ADD or something.. Always has the tremors. On every page, she is trembling with joy, lust, passion, fear.. awful lot of trembling going on. Getting old. I would also like to add, she is a very weak female in this telling. She is apparently an angel as she is queen of not only Camelot, but also of turning the other cheek. She excells at letting others walk all over almost as much as she does at trembling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"This book was so boring that I could barely get past the first 20 pages.

I loved the attention Ms. McKenzie put to the details of everything she wrote about. There were times that I wished the book would go faster but it kept my interest enough to be finished within three days. At the end, I mourned at the characters' fate and I wished that somehow they were real and I could change the way things ended. Nonetheless, it is a truly memorable book, though I don't think I can read the book again because it is too painful to fall in love with the characters and then bear their fate again.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peaceful, exciting, emotional and extraordinarily soothing","review":"After hearing Tian on Naitonal Public Radio and listening to a few samples of his music I made an all out effort to find this album ... and the time spent looking was well worth it.

Probably the finest book ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"and the search goes on...","review":"Building on the previous characters and places, we get an intense view of the conflicted relationship between Marcel and Albertine, along with in depth micro-account of vicious high society salons of the belle epoque, as well as an intimate account of Marcel's reaction to Vinteuil's septet. Marcel is by no means an admirable human being, but as finely observed a person as I can imagine. You have to have read the earlier volumes to appreciate this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book...","review":"I admit I've only read the first part of A La Recherche (Remembrance of Things Past, In Search of Lost Time, depending on the translation) but it is an utterly stunning novel.

The simple, full-color artwork of Stephane Heuet paints the characters in a style reminiscent of Tintin, bringing to life the world and thoughts housed in Proust's immortal pages. Remembrance Of Things Past: With A Budding Grove is very highly recommended as providing a new and absorbing perspective on a worthy literary classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth sailing from here on out!","review":"I was committed to reading the all 7 volumes of \\"Remembrance of ThingsPast\\" once I started, so the difficulty didn't stop me. But what apleasant surprise when I got this different translation of volumes 5 & 6!I'd read the Pleiade editions of the first 4 volumes by C. K. Montcrieff,and although they were good, it was like walking through loose sand.But now that I'm reading this different translation, it's a breeze--it almost feels like I'm reading a trashy Joyce Carol Oates novel, it'ssuch a page-turner!So if you've gotten this far, don't stop now: get this translation andlaissez les bon temps rouler!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the best translation of this????","review":"My bookstore offer 5 different translations, each one claiming to be 'radically new'. If you read Zola, you'll see how truly horrible these translations can be (full of British terms like 'he was keen to go'). The brits have ruined many French novels. Which version do you all recommend??"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Anthetical Take on Human Nature","review":"Reading the many reviews in praise of Proust's estremical opus, I must wonder if readers are confusing quantity with quality. Though one must admire Proust's sheer anthenticity, the work seems to rely more on the complexity of the narrative than it does the power of the actual writing. Much like Faulkner, Proust capitalizes on his sentuplative talent for description, which is admittedly stunning. Even in translation, Proust's prose retains is almost ethereal quality. However, Proust proselytize so long on everything from his childhood bed to his lover's eyes that any beauty in the language is lost. Once the reader has been stripped the illusion that skillful use of language must convey some profound insight, they are left to face the grim, hackneyed subject matter: once careless bon vivant realizes the emptiness of his ways. The work is not one of literature, but of self-flagellation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most beautiful novel ever written.","review":"Proust's prose is unmatched in its ability to express the richness of both inner and sensory experience. Furthermore, Remembrance of Things Past (better translated as In Search of Lost Time) is full of philosophical insights of which most professional philosophers can only be envious. Proust is fascinated by the phenomenon of involuntary memory: a smell, a taste can suddenly transport an individual to the past, to the person he or she was and is no longer. The simultaneity of experience (it is always a present sense that triggers the memory) and consciousness of experience (it remains, after all, a memory) shatters the illusion of integral identity. An individual dissolves in the waves of experience that traverse through time. The English translation does an excellent job of conveying the beauty of Proust's words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"The greatest masterpiece of our century. Nobody will NEVER write anything similar. It's a celebration of senses, memory and life; it's misterious and sarcastic; it's amazingly beautiful and sometimes sadly cruel. It simply changed my life, nothing's the same since I read this book. Now the Duchess of Guermantes, Charlus, Odette, Swann and the others are a part of my life, just as my family or my friends. Thanks God, Proust was born and decided to become a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD, SOLID SHOOTING FUN!","review":"If truth be told, isometric shooting games are not easy to mess-up. I mean, what is there not to like? Ever since ZAX:THE ALIEN HUNTER, such games offer an array of weapons and upgrades, a multitude of enemies and a variety of maps that will keep you zapping until the early hours of the morning!This is a worthy \\"successor\\": the graphics are better (still 2D but with a lot of 3D effects), the weapons have been enriched - and there are numerous distinctive RPG components that you will greatly enjoy!My only complaint: instead of designing the walls and environments in a unobtrusive way, they get in the way - but the mouse-wheel can rotate the camera for you to follow your character's line of sight; and this can get pretty disorienting, even after one gets the hang of it.RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Well Made For the Price","review":"This product contains many glue joints.

However, it also describes how hard life was for her, being Jewish, going into hiding and being captured and being transported to different concentration camps. Anne was born on June 12, 1929 in Frankfurt Germany. During her time in hiding she kept all her secret thoughts in a diary that her mother and father (Edith and Otto Frank) gave to her the day she turned 13(June 12, 1942).

The next day my mom and I went into town to the library and I took out all the ones that were there. The Sunflower Forest, Just Another Kid, and Somebody Else's Kids.

I immediately removed the needle so that my kids would not get injured; I attempted to call the company's phone number for advice (they seemed surprised anyone would want to change a needle -- which suggests it really is not for use), but I eventually was able to by using a wrench to pop it out. After being dropped on the floor, it certainly has shown its age -- anything that can break of, has already (the handwheel, the presser foot). It is a fun item for someone to pretend to sew on, as a model sewing machine, but I don't think it is an appropriate choice for a real sewing machine. It's far too small with too few features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"I bought this machine for my daughter as her first machine. It doesn't have a bobbin, and therefore doesn't create a stitch. The first piece of fabric we tried bunched and made odd stitches that came out. It was frustrating and disappointing. My boys liked the sound of the machine, and thought it was fun to push the peddle... Not what I envisioned this machine being used for! I finally took the batteries out and threw it away. If you want a first machine, look for something with a little more umph. This one isnt' it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much useless","review":"I bought this for my daughter a while back thinking it would be a good way to let her start some simple sewing. Bobbin-less machines are always problematic because you are only sewing on one side of the fabric, which makes it very easy for the stitches to come out, but you can usually get them to hold well enough for a child to sew a few things together. No matter what we did though, we couldn't even get it to sew two pieces together for long enough for her to hold them up and say \\"Look Mommy!\\". It is also very fiddly to get set up, so every time she tried to use it we would spend 20 minutes fussing with it, only to have it sew one seam and then need to be fiddled with again. And then even that one seam would fall out within minutes. You are really better off finding an old treadle machine online to start kids with - they are much safer than the motor driven ones because you can stop them instantly and you can control the speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singer Toy Sewing Machine","review":"This is the crappiest toy I have even bought. Don't buy it it doesn't even have things that pull the fabric through. I hate that I wasted my money on it. It might be fun for a 2 year old, just because they like to push buttons and hear noise. Spend alittle more money and get a crafting one if you actually want something you can learn to sew with. Again it's a toy and just not what I thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOt what i expected","review":"The action sequences in this anime were cool, but this was one weird series.

I got the 2215, which is large -- but the curve at the bottom and the slope of the sink render it quite elegant. It looks absolutely perfect with the new granite vanity top and Kohler Devonshire faucet.I also have to give major praise to the speed of the shipping. I needed it for a project in London, and it arrived in two days. TWO days! I could not believe how quickly it came, when all the stores here that sell Kohler products said it would take two to four weeks for them to source the sink and get it to me.

We follow Fell, a gambling boss, as he checks himself out of a mental sanitarium, regains the power he was in danger of losing, and then goes over the top into manic psychosis. Kill is well-written and believable, but it's not very entertaining, or even very interesting. Part of the problem, I think, is the cold, clinical tone -- it feels more like a psychiatric case study than a novel. The other part of the problem is that there's no one to root for in the book: we never care about Fell, so ultimately we don't care what happens to him. That could have been dealt with if the book was more racy/lurid -- one would read on just to have one's sensibilities shocked -- but this is so quiet, it only manages to inspire indifference. Don't bother hunting this one down, and don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very fun to read","review":"Imagine a crime book without any compelling characters, snappy dialogue, or surprising plot twists and you should get a pretty good picture of 'Kill the Boss'. Dry, detached, and plodding, this 125-page novel drags on in a monotonous tone that really got on my nerves.

I was expecting a serious business book, but what I got is a witty, sharply observed series of ten essays on why bureaucracies function the way they do. It may be satire, but there's a grain of truth in the observations nonetheless. Parkinson's law is as relevant today as it was half a century ago. The spiky pen and ink illustrations by Osbert Lancaster are an added delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"Basically, this book may be distilled down into a few statements (below). The examples used are from the late 1950's, and not in touch with the culture of 2007.**The work expands to fill the time available.**People will attempt to hire more subordinates regardless of workload.**Large committees will spend more time arguing over small line item expenses they understand, as opposed to huge expenditures they don't.**Have two issue supporters sit next to and kibitz an undecided yahoo -- this will sway the yahoo into voting their way.**Approximately five - eight people are the ideal number to run a huge endeavor.**The best want-ad will only be answered by one (qualified) person.**Rich men avoid taxes.**Younger people force older conservatives to retire.If you are interested in Parkinson's Law, I'd suggest buying a later edition with examples more in tune with modern computerized business. This older edition is for collector's and has limited business value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fifty years on, the insights are few and the humour laboured at best","review":"Although the corporate situations Parkinson describes are still familiar in outline, we have become used to a far more acid critique these days (Dilbert comes to mind). \\"Parkinson's Law\\" meanders in making its points, which may once have been surprising and fresh but are now laboured and obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 8 Months","review":"I purchased this for my son in december 2009.

A blend of styles and influences, a transition point for them that started back in the preceeding 'Rubber Soul' and served as a bridge to the masterpiece 'Sgt. Pepper...'The album contains tracks that were composed under the influence of pot and acid (\\"She Said, She Said\\" and the experimental closing track), tracks that take the band's earlier work one step beyond with the use of instruments foreign to their music until then (strings on \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", sitar on \\"Love You To\\", Motown-type horns on \\"Got to Get You into My Life\\"), and as a whole, it constitutes a recording effort where they took on more of a leading role in the studio.No record collection can be complete without this album, its predecessor and, indeed, most of the following Beatles albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opened a whole new doorway for the Beatles","review":"Don't listen to that LH guy. Just look at all his reviews and you'll see that he spends most of his time reviewing the same albums over and over, and bashing the Beatles while praising the Stones. Skip over any reviews by \\"LH from IMG\\" and listen to reviewers who don't have some sort of grudge.Anyway, Revolver is the first great Beatles album. It moved them from pop into rock and roll and led them into the Sgt. Pepper era. Rock and roll has never been the same since."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles together at the Top","review":"With some Beatle albums, either John or Paul or both together might deliver a weak song in the mix, but not here. Every John and Paul song is wonderful- they both present us with brilliance and they balance out nicely. Paul's sugary songs are countered with some edgy ones from Lennon and they work together wonderfully. This is a very playful and joyous album- \\"Good Day Sunshine,\\" \\"And Your Bird can Sing,\\" \\"Yellow Submarine\\" \\"Dr. Robert\\" \\"I'm only Sleeping\\" and \\"Taxman\\" are a lot of fun.The weak spots are the two other songs from George which are a bit dull. Paul's songs here show depth and John's songs like \\"She Said She Said\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" are a revelation. Both John and Paul wrote better songs than any that are on the album, but they still are so consistently great on this album, it is considered one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The absolute best!","review":"There is nothing negative I can say about this album. It is simply the Beatles masterpiece, they never got close to this again, neither Sgt Pepper or Abbey Road are in the same ball-park. And the reason is simple. They were working together as a true creative group with fresh exciting ideas. Strong songwriting and above all. QUALITY CONTROL! I can honestly say, this is about the only album I have ever listened to from start to finish and enjoyed every song. And songs like \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\" ,\\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" ,\\"Eleanor Rigby\\" & \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" are pure magic. This really is the greatest pop album ever made. I think all lovers of great music should own a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was just a kid...","review":"Some friends down the block purchased the Revolver album. Teenagers, that is. Though I was just too young I enjoyed the music, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remasters of their domain","review":"For those wondering if the remastered Revolver is worth buying, I say yes. I bought it today and despite all the hype was still impressed with the sound quality. Even on a good car sound system, the difference is obvious. On a home audio system, the improvement is more striking.I haven't heard the other remasters, but I have to believe they're all worth the cost for serious Beatles fans. All the little things the Beatles did to make their songs great can now be heard as clearly as your ears can hear them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Beatles Album","review":"As a life long Beatles fan, what can I say? It is their finest album. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"There had never been an album quite like Revolver before, and there hasn't really been since. There is an electric thrill of discovery and studio experimentation about it, the likes of which is sorely missed today. The sheer variety of styles and sounds is fascinating. The spiritual, the silly, the serious, the fantastic, the happy, the melancholy, the sublime, and the imaginative combine in a sparkling pageant of damn good songs, damn good recordings, and well, what can I say? It's damn good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles=GOD","review":"This album is one of the finest uses of human labor and invention ever. It should be ranked with the mona lisa as greatness in art. The Beatles do it with a style so unique and wonderous that every thing that has come since must be compared(unfavorably) with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles Head Toward Psychedelia","review":"Revolver encompasses most, if not all of the beatles wide-ranging strengths: masterful recording, creativity, adept songwriting, psychedelia, and variety in style.Some highlights on this album: \\"Taxman\\" (one of Harrison's best rock songs), \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" (perhaps McCartney's most powerful and somber song yet), \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" (a cool, sublime Lennon song), \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (a Lennon precursor of psychadelic things to come), \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" (a beautifully crafted McCartney ballad). Other notable songs include \\"Good Day Sunshine,\\" \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" \\"For No One,\\" all McCartney compositions.Recorded in 1966, around the time when they stopped touring, this album doesn't lag in any area music-making. It marks a key transition from the Beatles' short, radio-friendly, and carefully-crafted pop songs to more lengthy, uninhibited, and groundbreaking songwriting that would follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple Corps. Revolver Rip Off Remaster 2009","review":"The hype is, they spent four years working on the Beatles catalog to remaster it, yeah,right, what were they doing, smoking dope and taking LSD to while away the time? Because, while Revolver is a great Beatle album, this new CD remaster does not make a big difference over the one issued in 1987 on CD. The liner notes to the new remaster must have been written in ten minutes or cut and pasted from information on the internet. And the bonus in this overhyped remastered Beatle CD is a video that you can only play on your computer. Save your money and wait till this disc ends up in the used CD bin....Oh, one minor difference is that on this CD , McCartney must have told the re-mastering bozos to boost the bass sound. And finally why couldn't they put the mono mix on this cd too? Answer cause Apple is a greedy orgazniation ....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated","review":"Attributing the success of ground breaking artists of the late 1960s and early 1970s to this release is laughable. While the Beatles deserve credit for moving music out of the Elvis and Beach Boys era into a more guitar oriented rock sound, it happened with A Hard Day's Night. Not with likes of Eleanor Rigby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatles Album Second to Plenty","review":"The following Beatles albums are better than Revolver:Abbey Road, The White Album, Let It Be, A Hard Day's Night, Help, Meet the Beatles, and Beatles for Sale. The only albums worse are Sgt. Pepper, Mystery Tour and Rubber Soul.This album has a few good songs, but a lot of mediocre songs. I am surprised to see this on so many \\"best of\\" rock album lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolver - Hardly the Mona Lisa","review":"Without doubt the most overrated easy listening album of all time. Taxman has a great bass line, and And Your Bird Can Sing reaches back to the great sound of the early Beatles. That's it.The rest is so dated, I can hardly see how this album changed music forever. The Beatle albums that changed music were the early ones - A Hard Day's Night, Help, etc.Music has made a lot of progress from these orchestra-backed easy listening songs. In fact, this was almost a step back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrary to Popular Opinion","review":"While the early Beatles and the final album (Abbey Road) are good, I find the transition period (Revolver & Sgt. Pepper) pretty erratic. While people put \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" on a pedestal, how can one say that it represents the completeness of the Beatles, since the backing music is purely orchestral? On the other hand, \\"Taxman\\" reaches back to the magic of the early days. Then again, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is a mess, and a hint of the self-indulgent chaos forthcoming on The White Album. 2-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beatles' worst album.","review":"Revolver is the Beatles' weakest album, worse than Yellow Submarine.It displays poor production by George Martin and superficial songwriting, although George's contributions are far better than John's. Ringo's influence is felt strongly on this album. Revolver does the Beatles' reputation irreparable damage, and it was also their least influential work. A candidate for the worst album of all time by any artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A \\"Must Have\\"","review":"There is flat out one good song on this album - \\"Taxman\\". It is one of the worst albums ever recorded by a decent band.Just buy \\"Beatles 1\\". Your record collection can be complete without the mediocre songs on Revolver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the hype, taste the truth","review":"I have always considered this a great album, mainly because everyone tells you it is and I believed the hype.Finally last week I sat down and listened to it seriously for the first time. I was amazed at how poor it really was. The \\"groundbreaking\\" songs are nothing of the sort, certainly Hendrix was light years ahead. As for the standard songs, they represent the worst tin pan alley fluff imaginable.I won't even mention taxman, as an earlier reviewer put it, hearing multi-millionaires complaining about their tax bills is appalling.Thankfully I am no longer blind and can see this album for what it really is, regardless of how many critics tell you it is great, use your own ears and determine the truth.One star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly poor","review":"This is certainly one of the poorest albums ever made. No track can be considered outstanding. The musical prowess of the Beatles, never strong at the best of times,(witness the abysmal guitar and drum \\"solo's\\" on \\"The End\\", is laid painfully bare on this album. Without the energy of their early songs, these tracks hang by the slimmest of melodies and the weakest musical hooks.Truly a weak and disappointing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"The following were the best periods for the Beatles:1968-1969: White Album, Abbey Road1964-1965: Meet the Beatles, Hard Day's Hight, HelpSkip the Revolver, Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour period; especially Revolver. This album is dominated by lightweight pop tunes in which the Beatles don't play as a group (like Here, There and Everywhere and Eleanor Rigby) but instead are backed by orchestra tracks.On songs like And Your Bird Can Sing, Dr. Robert, and Taxman the Beatles are great, but the closing song (Tomorrow Never Knows) is just chaotic experimentation which is supposedly insightful, but it makes for poor listening. Although these songs are good, they can't compensate for the weakness of the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck in the 60's,,","review":"People should realize the difference between importance and greatness. The beatles were by all accounts an important band, but the music they made rarely lives up to their legacy. This album is a good example of that. It sounds dated, and there's a lot of filler on it. If you experienced this music when it was released, then i don't expect you to find its sound stuck in the 60's. Today, with albums like loveless in existence, this album pales in comparison from a production view point. Not that all albums from the sixties are irrelevant today. Trout mask replica and exile on main street are two albums that have stood the test of time. As for the filler, yellow submarine is by no means anything but a torture to listen to. This really is elevator music compared to the stones, zeppelin, stooges and even some of the beach boys' albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"The cd i ordered took 3 weeks to finally arrive. it was delivered 3 days after the expected delivery. i never waited this long for an item to arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst band of all times ?","review":"What can you say about The Beatles? The best thing I can think of is that they came from Liverpool. But given that noone of them even cared about football, never mind Everton, I won't even say that's a good thing. The Beatles is in my opinion the worst band in history. OK everyone was totally loaded on crack and drugs in the 60'ies, but surely you've all woken up by now??? It's pathetic! Every single song. Yellow Submarine is an embarrasment to the human race. It's the kind of song you thought was hillariously bad even in children school. If you like music then don't even consider buying a Beatles record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifeless Sound Solution","review":"As with many others who have been disappointed with the audio quality found on these 2012 LP releases, I also found the mid/high end to be quite lacking. However, I also found a solution that I recommend everyone try -- cleaning the new record.I wet cleaned using an enzyme solution (Walker Enzymes or Naturally Its Clean) with a special record cleaning pad from www.better-records.com, rinsing with cold tap water, and drying with a microfiber cloth along with an hour of air drying. The results were astounding -- clean and crisp with all the detail found on my early British Parlophone copy. Purists can feel free to substitute distilled water for the tap water I use.Skeptical? Give it a try on a less valued record first. All I can say is this is the same cleaning process I've used for several years now on all my vintage records and I can only say it works every bit as well as my brother's VPI 16.5 record cleaning machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's the million dollar question, Is Revolver over hyped?","review":"Does Revolver deserve the much tagged No. 1 album of all time label?

Grade school students often carried 8 inch sheath knives to school (mumbeley peg) and there was no objection from the teachers because there was no trouble. A free society brings forth free music. A P.C. society brings forth P.C. music. Beatles music is 4 stars. Gospel rates 5.

But in the middle years (Rubber Soul, Revolver, Mystery Tour, Sgt. Pepper) perhaps nothing captures their slump like Revolver.The excitement generated by the opening ringing chord of A Hard Day's Hight gives way to the orchestral background of Eleanor Rigby and Here There and Everywhere.Taxman is awesome. A couple of other songs are good. The rest is boring filler and the experimentation of Tomorrow Never Knows. Taxman is so good I'm giving it 2 stars.

George Martin provided able assistance, but Paul's idea for the string quartet that undergirded \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" was all his own. Tape loops, a new cryptic bent to his lyrics, and soaring, chanting vocal's made John's \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" a pioneering piece of studio music. Harrison's tabla-and-sitar \\"Love You To\\" offered up the possibilities not only of Indian music but of Eastern religion. And Revolver was only the prelude toSgt. Pepper."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIFE !!!","review":"So much better than Rubber Soul, although the two would have made a great double-LP set!

Words can't describe the incredible work of are this is. To listen to this album is to appreciate the Beatles and the world, so buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon Should Screen Its Reviewers","review":"To give this album anything less than a five star review is criminal. It's mind-boggling the influence this album and the band have had on music since their inception. I'll accept that somebody doesn't like the Beatles, though with the overwhelming influence they've had it's hard to imagine that to be the case, but there are those who fail to grasp the impact and importance. But, to say that this album is dated is to completely admit your ignorance and complete lack of musical knowledge. A few pointers: 1)Amazon places a \\"Iam over the age of 13\\" check box for a reason. Make sure that you understand and use it properly. 2) If you're going to be ignorant enough to give this classic album 1 star don't perpetuate your ignorance by allowing others to view your \\"OTHER REVIEWS\\".

This album is no exception. The songs are great, the lyrics are interesting. But some of the songs are altogether too catchy. Yellow Submarine has got to be one of the most annoying songs in the HISTORY of rock and roll, simply because hardly anyone knows all the words. Elanor Rigby is a good song, but it's too catchy and can stick in your head for 48 hours or more if you're not careful. But, in short, this is a good album, if you don't mind getting songs stuck in your head.

He would get all of his good vinyl out and play it really loud for a few hours. A lot of what he played was music from The Beatles. Whenever my Dad would put on \\"Revolver\\", I would run into the room (almost skipping the record) and grab the album cover.I'd sit on the floor and stare at the combination of collage and line art. I always liked the little picture of John Lennon with the fake beard on, or that semi-blurred photo at the top where Paul is screaming.To me, this is the best Beatles album.

However, all of the aforementioned events pale in comparison to the creation of Revolver. The Beatles loved experimenting in the studio and this album made that very clear. No album preceded, nor followed, Revolver in its greatness. It's always been a personal favourite of mine and for good reason. Tracks like \\"Taxman\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" are timeless classics. What I love most though is that, for the first time, George Harrison was the Beatle that left me stunned. He really stepped up his game here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mona Lisa of rock albums?

It's supposed to sound dated, out of style, orchestral - and it delivers.Even the better songs like Taxman, although having a good beat, are simple. The awful Eleanor Rigby, Here There and Everywhere, Love You To, and I'm Only Sleeping barely fit into the category of rock music, and are more likely categorized as Easy Listening.Those that are just discovering the Beatles and claim they are \\"blown away\\" by the likes of this, or Sgt.

Revolver, the second album in that series, is easily one of the best. It deftly combines the Beatles sweet and melodic pop songs (\\"Here, There and Everywhere\\"), comic lyrics (\\"Taxman\\") and an initial forray into musical experiments (\\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\") into a classic pop album that Oasis only wishes it could make! Although Revolver doesn't contain too many of the bajillion radio staples that the Beatles have made over the years it is still among their strongest and most statisfying albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"With this album, the Beatles finally begin to emerge as the creative and musical geniuses they are known as today.

It is still the first thing I try any new audio equipment out with. The hits, Yellow Submarine and Eleanor Rigby, are my least favorite tracks. You can see the seperate paths developing as Paul keeps going pop, John gets more introspective, and George heads East. Also, George penned three of the tunes, suggesting that competition was stirring well before the \\"White\\" album. Some consider \\"Rubber Soul\\" Their best, others say \\"Sgt.

After that my father took me out to go buy Rubber Soul and after that I basically got hooked. The thing that makes Revolver stand alone from any of the Beatles other great records is the fact that this was their most experimental album. John wrote \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and \\"She said, She said\\" about experiences in drugs, and George used instruments like the sitar in one of his songs. \\"Revolver\\" was one of the first real \\"psychidelic\\" albums, and definitely helped to begin the whole phenomenon. I still listen to the CD for songs like \\"Taxman\\" and \\"Good day Sunshine\\". Sadder songs like, \\"For no one\\" show how Paul hasn't lost his ability to make us cry. I think. That's the one, \\"...\\"? right? anyway's, a must have for anyone. Even if you don't enjoy rock. This one will be around for awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album gives off light and heat","review":"I loved Revolver immediately, even at age 11, back in 1967, when I first heard it. I love it now. There is a richness of sound, and the record marks a point in the Beatles career much like a fruit hitting its perfect ripeness before falls off a tree and rots. I am glad that this album is still loved today, as evidenced by the other reviews on this web site. As long as people can spot brilliance, excellence, and inspiration such as found on this album, I can feel hopeful for humanity. Without a doubt, every song is superb (except Yellow Submarine, which I still listen to when I am too lazy to skip to the next track) and nothing has been written and performed like \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" since and probably forever. Could you imagine this album with Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane added to it as well? (they were recorded only a few months later than the other tracks on Revolver, at the conclusion of 1966) You'd have to create a six-star rating system."},{"rating":"2","title":"This would be my favorite...","review":"...if the White Album didn't have two records. Never mind the one-star reviews from Stones fans trying to get the average rating down, you *can* love both bands, and Revolver *is* (as a recent poll agreed) the best single disc of the century.As for the guy who said he could write better songs -- send me some mp3 samples, and if they're better, I'll buy your record."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever (no, really)","review":"C'mon folks -- let's just all agree on the obvious: this is the greatest album ever. Don't get me wrong, it has competition (Blonde on Blonde, Imperial Bedroom, the Smile fragments) but it outshines even them. Lennon's songs here ultra-enigmatic and slightly menacing, while Paul's are simply perfect little masterpieces. Throw in a complete and utter absence of fear and Harrison's tight, dead-on Taxman and you've really got something, haven't you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"With this, a door opened","review":"While Sgt. Peppers surely showcased the Fab Four at their peak in songwriting and production, this album was the true indication that they were about to take us all into a completely new compartment of our brains. Gone were the \\"fillers\\" like \\"Run for your Life\\" on Rubber Soul. Every song on Revolver is exquisite and unique. Of course, rating a Beatles album is like comparing 20-carat diamonds but this one truly is special in that George Martin finally loosened up and let these musical adventurers try any and all things that came into their heads. In short, 3-minute bursts they broke into and redistributed our established notions of what songs should sound like, lyrics read like and album art should look like, changing the world forever. For those who weren't there when it happened I can only assure you that they didn't have to disrobe at the Super Bowl to shake the very foundations of society."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say?","review":"What can I say, it is close to the perfect rock and roll record. Only problems: it would be better if some of the songs were longer (AYBCS, Elenor Rigby), because they are so good it makes me so sad after 2:00 when they are over. There are a few tracks that aren't that good (Yellow Submarine). Here are the outstanding tracks: Here, There, and Everywhere; I'm Only Sleeping; She Said, She Said; For No One; Got To Get You Into My Life; and Tommorow Never Knows. Listen to these songs a few times, and you will see why many critics call this album the best rock and roll album ever. \\"Turn off your mind, relax, and float down stream, It is not dying, it is not dying\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"embyonic psychadelica at it's best","review":"The true measure of music is how well it stands up over time. Ten years or so should do. It's been nearly thirty five years since Revolver was released, and it is still as crisp and cutting today as it was then. From the opening 1-2-3-4 of Taxman to the frantic wailing of guitars searing through Tomorrow Never Knows, this album never quits.The despair of Eleanor Rigby is as touching as ever. And Paul's For No One speaks volumes for anyone who's ever suffered breakup. Sure there are fluff pieces(Yellow Submarine, Got to Get You Into My Life).But for each one there are two or three monster tracks right on their heels( She Said She Said, And Your Bird Can Sing,I'm Only Sleeping). Were these guys great musicians? Absolutely not. Were they the greatest band in rock n roll history? Absolutely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical mystery tour de force","review":"I remember listening to this album for the very first time, having no opinion one way or another about the Beatles, and being truly amazed by the sheer diversity on offer here - proof that it's possible to make music within several different genres all at at once, and still make it work as a whole. But 'Tomorrow Never Knows' - what genre is that from? Here the Beatles had absolutely no starting point (it's 1966, remember!) and created something incredible from nothing. PS - this song was covered in an interesting way by Jimi Hendrix on an album called Live at the Scene Club, NY - check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles transition","review":"With Revolver, The Beatles threw gasoline on the flame that was their popularity in 1966. Furthermore, their creative spark ignited into a towering inferno, showing the world their genius. From the humorous cynicism of \\"Taxman\\", to the fast paced rock-fest \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", to the haunting melody of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", the Beatles music went from simplistic, yet excellent, love songs, to ingenious melodic and creative song writing. The Beatles themselves feel Revolver was the real turning piont of their music. And, like all musical fact, the proof is in the pudding. The key piece of evidence of the beatles genius is George Harrisons solo in \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\". That alone is proof enough that the Beatles were on their way to earning their place as the greatest band in the history of rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please!!!

You can actually turn this album on and sit through the whole thing. Like another reviewer, I'm not too fond of the sitars, but they work alright on this album.

I can't see why an LP with five good hits (\\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Taxman\\", and the beautiful \\"Good Day Sunshine\\") is so widely praised. Plus there is too much of a drug overlay. When you think about that, it just ruins the good vibes of even the best offerings on here.

Songs like And Your Bird Can Sing reach back to Beatlemania but songs like Here There and Everywhere and Eleanor Rigby are what resulted in boy bands like the Backstreet Boys (The Shape of My Heart). Thank goodness the Rolling Stones stayed with rock and roll and Led Zeppelin came along to drive music in a good direction. Once that happened, even the Beatles got back on track with The White Album and Abbey Road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fade VH1","review":"The hype generated by the VH1 poll naming this as the #1 rock album of all time should be downplayed. The poll was conducted among only musicians and critics, not the record buying public. Although this should be in the top 100, it probably shouldn't be in the top 50.Taxman and She Said are great, but are offset by Yelow Sub and Tomorrow Never Knows. Eleanor and Here, There & Everywhere are orchestral. The album is average at best, but I say 2-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"\\"really tuneful...really whacky...really psychedelic...really social...really unusual...\\" yeah.There are only a few songs on this album that reflect the greatness achieved by the Beatles pre-1965, which is sad. Nowhere near albums like Help or A Hard Day's Night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarcity of Rock Tunes","review":"Aside from Dr. Robert, Taxman, and And Your Bird Can Sing this album is just boring. Eleanor Rigby and Here There and Everywhere are orchestra tunes. Tomorrow Never Knows is barely musical, and is characterized by a faint melody and Lennon's whiney voice. Yellow Sub is stupid. Love You To is Harrison's self indulgence, forcing a sitar on the previously good Beatles formula when no one asked for it. I agree that this was a turning point, but it was in the wrong direction. Stay with the earlier albums. 2-stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"SURPRISINGLY BAD","review":"Music has a dreary quality, kind of depressing. A few good songs, but I'd say go with an album with more hits on it. These are rejects. Later beatles suck, with some exceptsions. Sgt pepper was great, but they kept going too far to try to be different and in later years the music was sick, more like they were wanna bees trying to be differerent, instead of sgt pepper where they achieved it naturally. Didn't care for this one, but love most early stuff."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],R={key:0},H={key:1};function C(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return i(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(i(!0),o(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(i(),b(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),o("span",H,"Loading...")):(i(),o("span",R,"See more"))],8,N)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-0d0a7e46"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/50.md","filePath":"glossary/50.md"}'),G={name:"glossary/50.md"},j=Object.assign(G,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(i(),o("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
