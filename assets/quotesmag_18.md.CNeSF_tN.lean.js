Mary Carpenter sounds unpracticed and bashful, she sounds like she does not enjoy the music she is singing, it appears she can only sing about 10 notes, and the accompanyments and the mixing sound amaturish.

It is a story of self-examination, repentance, prayer, forgiveness - all elements that from the basis of Orthodox Christian living (praxis). I can't count the number of people who've been inspired by these books. I would certainly recommend or even prescribe these two books to every Orthodox Christian. An absolute must, if there is such a thing.As for the non-Orthodox, Christian or not, I would of course also recommend this book. It is for them too inspirational, as well as informative.

It is just a death trap!! Everyone that has looked at this for me has had the same opinon. RETURN IT !!! I will be going back to Toys R Us first thing in the morning.

First the car seat is a total joke, It probally weighs by itself a hundred pounds, (serously Im not joking!) not to mention how much more it weighs with your child it it, its almost imposible to carry this along with your infant in it, never mind transfering this in and out of your car..The base does not snap in properly and its defintly not safe with out a base.

I returned that one and purchased this new updated version. I put my 3 month old in it and turned into a parking space and the whole carseat tipped over!! Luckily he wasn't hurt. The reason it tipped is because the base is smaller than the carseat so it is top heavy. When I returned it that day, a worker told me I was the second person that day with the same complaint! Needless to say, I will never trust anything Eddie Bauer again. When I voiced my complaint to the manufacture, they were very rude.

There is no countdown or predicted date because nobody knows.What the author is trying to do is predict when certain storms or eruptions will pop up in any given area by using the astrological positions of the planets.

There's not a song on it that I hate, which I can't say about many other CDs that I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am disappointed","review":"Vanessa Carlton is a very talented singer and I had the greatest expectations about this album. \\"A thousand miles\\" is a great song. The video is good as well, with vanessa and her magical piano going everywhere.I ordered this CD without even listening to it, because I thought all the songs would be like the debut single. Actually, I was wrong. The album is kind of boring. I don't think it is Vanessa's fault. She is great, but \\"be not nobody\\" does not work as an album (perhaps because the songs are all a little depressing). By the way, \\"ordinary day\\" is good and worths to be checked out.I bought this CD, and I also have avril lavigne's \\"Let go\\" and michelle's branch \\"spirit room\\".

The piano sounds great, and it had me beleive that perhaps Carlton's whole CD would be like that: the strong and powerful piano a-la Apple or Amos. However, when I checked samples before I bought the CD, I noticed that something bothered me, and it definitely was the voice. It does need more work and much more improvement, and piano could be as loose as in \\"1000 miles\\".

I'm actually surprised to read she's classically trained since the piano melodies and chords are not that complicated, just repetitive; i could play back any of these songs almost immediately, whereas other piano songs, take me a bit longer. She sounds talented enough, but every1 has different tastes. By the way, people who protest the comparisons between her and other female pianists are correct. I might even be so bold to say she is the complete opposite of amos, same instruments do not mean anything.

Although it took over a year for me to finally get her Cd, it is now by far one of my favorites. Her music inspires me to dance, design, and it makes me want to play piano. My personal favorites include:\\"Pretty Baby\\", \\"Paint it black\\", \\"Sway\\", and my second favorite song of all time, \\"Twilight\\".I am definatly gonna buy her next Cd asap. If you love her singles and are still contemplating buying the cd, go out right now and buy it, it is definatly worth the money!

She has an amazing voice, song writing skills, and the fact that she plays the piano is refreshing in this world full of guitar tunes.

This is a great way to introduce a new artist to a wide audience. Pay particular attention to 'Unsung' and 'Twilight' which I think are showcases of her musical range.

I absolutely LOVE the singles on the radio, but it pretty much stops there. I have to admit that the first time I really listened to this CD, it literally scared me. I thought she was some sort of psycho. The non-radio songs are VERY, VERY different from the ones on the radio--beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and great","review":"This album is great.I love the A thousand miles performance.The bonus tracks are really good.Plus she has amazing piano skills and a great voice.This comes from a NESSAholic."},{"rating":"2","title":"spunky","review":"As my mom says, Vanessa Carlton is a poet. Her lyrics are wonderful and you can get absolutly caught up every song on the album. Everything's been put together beautifully- although I admit that her voice could be better. After a while, though, it doesn't matter, because her sincerity shows through so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put 4 female artists in a blender, puree and pour","review":"Vanessa Cartlon's debut was widely hyped after the saturation of her first single \\"A Thousand Miles\\" on the radio. At that time, I thought she had potential, but bascially considered her to be Michelle Branch with a piano. Having listened to the whole CD, it's more like she's trying to be Michelle Branch, Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, and Alanis Morisette all at the same time... and not doing a very good job of it. The CD starts light then gets progressively darker - while it's a nice transition in a way, Ms. Carlton should stick with one style and develop it, rather than be all over the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am disappointed with this cd. A Thousand Miles is the best song. Her voice grows irritating after a few listens. I have read comparisons to Fiona Apple and Tori Amos... sorry but Fiona and Tori have more lyrical and musical depth than Vanessa. Just because they all play piano doesn't mean they should be compared. I give her credit for writing her own songs and playing the piano but the songs aren't that catchy to warrant continued listens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing vocals, great arrangements, and great songs","review":"This is an excellent albums with a lot of diversity, great production, and just good songs. This is like a less eclectic Tori Amos at her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album","review":"To a fan of good music and all of its intruments (especially the piano), \\"Be Not Nobody\\" is a breath of fresh air in a world of music filled with the suffocating genres of punk, offesive rap, and depressing rock. Every song on the album is wonderful, especially \\"Ordinary Day\\", which is my personal favorite. It makes me feel good that there still are a few genuinely talented people left in the music business -- real music. I've known of Vanessa's music for over a year now and I'm so glad that she is finally getting the recognition that she deserves. I cannot wait to buy the book of sheet music and learn every song on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring albums ever!","review":"Great album? Please! I bought this album because I love Thousand Miles and is there any other good songs? No. She's a good pianist, but she cannot sing! She should just go for composing, she'll be good at that but not a singer! People who have trouble sleeping would find this album very helpful - it would send you off to sleep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"its really good!","review":"all the songs are really good, except she repeats the same lyrics over and over and sometimes she sounds like a cat but otherwise, it's really good. the best songs are ordinary day, unsung, a thousand miles, rinse, prince and paint it black. if you're reading these, and trying to decide to buy it, i tell you DEFINITELY GET IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"Vanessa Carlton has impressed me with her debut singe 'A thousand miles', but the Album is some what of a dissapointment.The Album isn't Bad, but some songs didn't quite meet my expectations (for example 'Paradise'). It is to whiny and doesn't bring out Vanessa'a voice qualities.While other songs, like'Ordinary day' bring out the vocal talent of Vanessa. I believe that this is not the end of Vanessa Carlton, i just hope future albums will have more quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Piano........But I Hate This Album","review":"I love Ordinary Day, Pretty Baby and A Thousand Miles.....who doesn't. You've heard it on the radio. But this album does not follow that direction of pop and piano.The rest of the tracks are WAY TOO DARK. They're not fun, they're almost scary, LOL. Really! It almost creeps me out.Don't buy it. I downloaded it.....and it WASN'T even worth my downloading time. Now that says something ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"be nobody... exactly","review":"Be nobody, exactly what she is. A nobody, seeing as she can't sing at all, the piano playing is crap. The song \\"a thousand miles\\" is so annoying, and when this song was out, I would hear it everywhere I went. I kid you not, I just couldn't stand hearing it, I felt like I was gonna die or pass out in the store that they were playing the song. Yes, it was just that awful! Once again, I kid you not. so if you're thinking of buying this CD, don't! please don't waste your money on this garbage. i'm sure glad i didn't! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a very good CD!!!","review":"When I first got this CD, I listened to all the songs on it, and when I finished listening, the only songs I practically liked were \\"A Thousand Miles\\", \\"Ordinary Day\\", and \\"Pretty Baby\\". She has a bad, childish, shallow voice, and in some songs she sounds like Britney Spears. If you want a great CD to listen to, get Avril Lavigne's newest album, \\"Let Go\\" or Michelle Branch's newest CD. Anything but this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing . . .","review":"When I first heard the song \\"A Thousand Miles\\" on the radio, I loved it. I listened attentively every time it came on, and finally decided to purchase her album. It was a letdown. None of the songs match up to \\"A Thousand Mile\\"'s standard. Sure, there are some songs worth listening to: \\"Ordinary Day\\" \\"Rinse\\" \\"Paint it Black\\" and \\"Pretty Baby\\" aren't bad. In fact, I quite like \\"Ordinary Day\\". But none of the songs are like the one I originally heard. I'm not telling you not to buy this, because I don't know what you like in music, but I'd recommend listening to it first--don't just pick it up and buy it. I wasted thirteen dollars, IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there anything....","review":"original about this album? Anybody who rates this 5 stars must have a very limited frame of reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I had a choice, I'd say zero stars","review":"...And being a pianist myself, her technique is absolutely horrible!!! Look at how close she sits, it's like impossible to play properly when your arms aren't extended far enough. Every single released by her so far sound the same, the concepts are the same, and I quote Ashley \\"With deep lyrics like \\" You light me up and then I fall for you. you lay me down and then I call for you\\" you'll be deeply into the song.\\" ...a 2 year old can write a rhyme like that. How is that even deep? Her videos are all the same. To be in the music industry, one should probably constantly reinvent him/herself or atleast don't have the same concept... in every video. Her voice is painful to listen to..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music sales continues it's downward spiral","review":"As long as you people keep giving these sound a like artists 5 stars( her sound is already available by at least 5 or 6 pop singers)music sales will continue it's downward spiral. I just realized for the first time that radio and record labels maybe not to blame for low cd sales and inferior and un-original music heard on the radio these days. It's you fans out there- whom it seems have totally become quite ignorant to what unique and refreshing music sounds like. It's as if after years of un- original music these last few years the buying public has become programmed to adore un-orignal artsists and sound a like songs. That is so sad. I don't blame Vanessa Carlton- she's just trying to make a living- but I do blame you- the buying public. The music industry is doomed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Baby","review":"Well it seems that the some people don't really like Pretty Baby, but personally I think it is the most awesome song. The words, the music, just everything about it. The first time I heard it I just had to play it over and over. It even became me and my boyfriends song. Its a perfect song and everytime I hear it, it touches my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cd in a long time","review":"I am a huge Tori Amos fan, and have been for over 11 years now. I must admit that I don't usually buy music that I feel meets her standards. When I bought this cd though, I was incredibly impressed. It reminded me of Little Earthquakes with a little bit of Juliana Hatfield, but with a kick all it's own. Her voice is sweet yet haunting and the music actually moves me. I loved this album from the first listen and like it even more every time after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good CD","review":"I didn't have high hopes when I first bought this CD. I liked \\"A Thousand Miles\\" and \\"Ordinary Day\\", but they were very overplayed. However, I liked \\"Pretty Baby\\" and decided to give the album a try. I was very surprised to find such a well-rounded CD. It is rare to find a CD where the best songs are not the singles. The best songs are found in the middle of the album. \\"Rinse\\", \\"Sway\\", \\"Paradise\\", \\"Prince\\", \\"Paint It Black\\", and \\"Wanted\\" are as flawless as good pop music gets. The other songs are good, but there is just something about these songs that stand out to me. Many of the magazine reviews I read of this CD were very negative, which surprised me. I think she is extremely talented and am looking forward to her next album. It will be hard to top this album, but I think Vanessa is capable of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolute talent","review":"Any one of the songs in this album could have hit number one, not just A Thousand Miles.Vanessa is a mesmerizing talent at 21. She has a unique voice, and is a superb pianist. A fine orchestra just adds to the album without overwhelming her performance.You go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Debut","review":"\\"Be Not Nobody\\" is a wonderful CD, combining incredibly piano playing, orchestration, and Vanessa Carlton's powerful voice.While many have compared her to Tori Amos or Fiona Apple, I'd have to say she's a little more delciate, and her young age does come through in her perfomances. However, there are some some incredible songs on this debut that really show the promise that Carlton holds.I am not giving it 5 stars because there are a few weak songs on the CD that I don't like, even after several listens. However, the stronger songs ('Twilight', 'Wanted', 'Prince\\") more than make up for the less-than-perfect moments. And I must admit that I actually *like* her cover of the Rolling Stones 'Paint It Black'- it's a really great take on the song.I would definitely buy it. It may not be your favorite CD of all time, but it definitely lives up to the high expectations I had when I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD - great tunes!","review":"\\"Be Not Nobody\\" is one of the best CD's I've ever heard. Vanessa has a wonderful voice and is a skillful pianist, and uses them both to incorporate pop, rock, and blues into many great hit songs on this CD. If you liked her first hit single, A Thousand Miles, then you'll LOVE this CD. It has many great songs, such as Ordinary Day, Rinse, and Twilight just to name a few. This CD is going to be an instant hit and Vanessa is going to have a great career as a singer/piano player, and I would HIGHLY recommend that you get this CD, or at least listen to A Thousand Miles! Vanessa's songs are a lot like Michelle Branch, so if you like her, you'll LOVE Vanessa!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Great Voice","review":"Her piano hooks are catchy and good. She is a talented pianist, but I just don't get the big deal everyone makes out of her voice. It really grated on my nerves except for the song \\"Ordinary Day.\\" I didn't really like any other songs on the whole album. Her later 2 albums are so much better than her first atemtp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to balance the scale","review":"Ok, this cd is decent for pop music, but doesn't deserve the excessive praise some people are giving it. Vanessa Carlton does not compare to Tori Amos or Fiona Apple by any standard. This music is catchy and enjoyable, but void of any true passion, genius, or innovation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What Its Hyped Up To Be","review":"I bought this CD cause I read many reviews that spoke highly of it. Honestly, this CD isn't all its cracked up to be. If you really want a really good CD, go get Michelle Branch's SPIRIT ROOM and Norah Jones \\"Come Away With Me\\". Those two are quality CD's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uk likes VC","review":"A Thousand Miles caught my attention enough for me to buy this first offering and I wasn't disappointed with the rest.Sure I could do without Paint It Black & Pretty Baby.But those dodgy little numbers are more than compensated for by Rinse & Paradise.The lyrics show a maturity beyond her years,whatever age she may be.Comparisons with that other joanna tinkling woman Tori Amos are inevitable.Now ,I'm a big,big Tori fan and Vanessa is no Tori Amos.But she is one hell of a Vanessa Carlton."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new style emerges","review":"Before you read this let me remind you that I might be a little biased because I play the piano, drums/percussion, guitar, and sing. Vanessa Carlton was first shown to the world as a one hit wonder with her famous new style pop song \\"A thousand miles\\". Her fresh vocals are supported by and orchestra, bass, drums and piano. This combination of musical instruments gives her music a sonorous tone. She shows that a new style in music might be opening up to a sort of alternative/pop/rock style. This is not a CD that you will just play 1 or 2 songs on it is an incredible musical journey that will enlighten your ears to what music should sound like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still another young phenom","review":"One thing for sure -- you're not likely to mistake any of these tracks for the dozens of other talented young female voices out there. Vanessa has an oddly delightful, accent mannered voice that, together with her piano skills, stamps any song with her very unique signature.There are only two \\"commercial\\" tracks here, both of which have gotten plenty of airtime (\\"A Thousand Miles\\" and \\"Ordinary Day\\"). They are worth the price of the album alone, but be aware the rest of the music is considerably darker and less accessible. But if she's an aquired taste it's one that's easy to do, and a few listenings will probably convince most this is an album worth exploring many times.Vanessa has talent in abundance. When she gets over what amounts to teen-aged angst it's likely her music will reach a far wider audience. In the meantime we have this delightful album to enjoy and wonder just how her life experiences will grow and shape her future efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakthrough","review":"This album is remarkable in the fact that it is her first album. the range is amazing, from classical, pop to rock and groovy tunes.paint it black is a beautiful remake of a classic song, she did it really well. ordinary day seems to be everyone's favourite, with good reason. it's a great song.my favourites have to be (at the moment) Ordinary Day, Wanted, Paradise and Paint it Black. wanted and paradise are quite sad songs, and have much emotion in them which you can hear and understand. if you're not a fan of truly emotional music, this CD is not recommended to you.i really like this album, and i'm not one to like popular music at all. it's a revelation. if you liked her 2 singles so far, buy it, it's really worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst singer","review":"I can't stand the way she sings but she has good writing ability and can play the piano well. How she got to be a singer i don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shove it back in the horse! (Part II)","review":"Here's the story:You get some training as a ballerina, except you can't cut the mustard, and any hope that you had for a show biz career in ballet dies. You parents know somebody in the music business. They get you an interview and pull some strings. You get some training on piano and write some very rudimentary songs about female angst. Somebody at some record company thinks it'll sell so they put a lot of money into production and promote the hell out of it. Even the title \\"Be not Nobody\\" (Which some A&R; guy probably thought up) smacks of teenage naivette.Anyway, the CD sells.A year later, you put out another CD, and it bombs, big time. It seems like some big talent was in all actuality, a blow out.What happened?!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking substance","review":"it's great that she can actually play a musical instrument but her songs are booooring!!This album lacks substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rate zero or below, but I can't dammit!","review":"This is the baddest cd I have heard in ages!I got it sent to me for christmas by a friend who obviously didn't know my style of music. I had one listen a chucked it out the window. YUCK! Sorry if I'm affending anyone, but I can't seriously see how you could like this.If you were thinking of bying it, think again, coz this cd SUCKS!Oh, and I can't see how she could possibly be compared to Avril, who ROCKS! When this Vanessa \\"Carton\\" SUCKS!Thank you, come again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"be smart-don't buy this garbage","review":"Now, why I bought this cd in the first place is beyond me,since I hated her first two singles.But I was like, hey,I'll give the girl a chance.I'm sorry that I bought this cd.Her songwrting skills are very poor.Maybe she has a good melody that starts out,and you think,oh yeah,what a nice idea, but the song ends out dragging on and on and on, ruining everything.Her lyrics seem to be trying way too hard to be \\"intelligent\\".Instead of just writing from the heart, she says a bunch of bull that doesn't even make sense, just to raise herself above and make people believe that she is wise beyond her years.Her voice is so painfully bad, I can't help but wonder how in the world this woman got a record deal.Ever,it's nasal, and irritating, and she cannot hold a note for more than 2 seconds.If this is what passes for good music these days, I just don't know what else to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"a nobody indeed","review":"hi, I heard \\"a thousand miles\\" on the radio one day and after listening to some of it, i hated it! Just horrible music I ever heard! how can anyone actually like this crap? seriously. it's really bad.i didnt even listen to the whole song by Vanessa, cuz after 30 seconds into the song, i turned off the radio and felt like I was about to hurl. I'm not kidding either. sorry to give this young un-talented lady a bad review, but i wouldnt wanna lie and say \\"she's great\\" when she's not. be a nobody she will forever be and she can practice singing her song 'a thousand' times until she wears her tired voice out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Recording Quality","review":"This disc has great songs on it, but they are recorded in a very poor manner. You can actually hear the microphone input clip on parts of certain songs. This is solely the fault of the recording engineer. In other parts you begin to wonder if the other instruments are the feature and not Vanessa.If you are listening to this CD on a boombox or some HTIB system, you may not ba able to hear what I hear (I have Classe front end components pushing B&W; 802D speakers.) When I purchase a CD I expect recording quality better than what I can do in my basement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EWWW","review":"This CD is way to slow, I bought it expecting it to be fast and upbeat, but instead Ordinary Day, and A Thousand Miles are basically the only good songs on this CD. Her song-writting is good, but her piano playing is avarge, and her vocals are annoying, all she does is whine, and you can hardly understand a word she is saying.People compare her to Michelle Branch all the time, which is a big compliment considering Michelle has been doing a lot better then Vanessa. My advice buy The Spirit Room instead of Be Not Nobody, you'll enjoy it a lot more, considering that Michelle's album had a few diffrent kinds of music, incluing a few pop songs, some pop/rock songs, some pop/folk songs. Vanessa's CD is mostly made up of sad depressing songs, that'll make up want to hurl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"If you can, buy the single \\"Ordinary Day\\" and don't waste your money on the whole cd. A Thousand Miles is alright, but that's been played to death on the radio anyway. The rest of the songs are immature and annoying. What I don't understand is how she could have written \\"Ordinary Day\\", an exceptional song, and also have been the author of all this other crap. The other songs seriously sound like she was under a deadline to just write something ... anything ... to fill the cd. They're unimaginative, repetetive, and whiny. Pretty Baby is so irritating, I find it about as pleasant as nails on a chalk board."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!

I hate it, and I hate listening to \\"A Thousand Miles\\" over and over and over again.After seeing Vanessa Carlton play \\"A Thousand Miles\\" at last years' New England Patriots halftime show during Thanksgiving, I was ready to murder somebody. Even my nephew, Nathan, who is ten, said that Vanessa Carlton's music \\"was kind of sucky\\" and compared her with Bon Jovi, who he also called \\"a jerk\\".What could have Vanessa Carlton have possibly been thinking when she wrote \\"A Thousand Miles\\"? Does she have any music training? That would be hard to beleive.Anyway, I give \\"Be Not Nobody\\" one star because I used to think that anything would be better than listening to that b*tch Alanis Morrisette, but I guess I was wrong.Thank You"},{"rating":"2","title":"think michelle branch but with a piano = vanessa carlton","review":"To be honest,at first i really noticed that vanessa carlton looks and sounds alot like michelle branch but with a piano instead of a guitar But too bad she didn't get the kind of fame and number of hits as michelle did even though vanessa is still around today making more music than michelle who i last saw her in that duet with carlos santana.I think all her fans (including myself) will know her the most for her biggest hit \\"one thousand miles\\" just like bic runga will always be remembered for her song \\"sway\\", but still i think vanessa is still very tallented regardless of the comparisons to other female singers around when vanessa made this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and yet familiar","review":"This is a straighforward pop album. And it's a good pop album. Of course, everyone has heard \\"A Thousand Miles\\", which is a little softer than the rest of the disc. That piano pops up over and over again, and it's a good thing -- it sounds a little different than most other stuff out there today. Most of the songs are mid-tempo, but are different enough that they don't get tired. I hear a lot of Alanis Morissette in this disc, along with a little Sheryl Crow circa 1996. This is good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please tell me what's so special about this girl","review":"Yes, Vanessa Carlton can play the piano. Yes, she can write her own songs. However, she cannot sing worth a dime and her debut album is nothing short of boring. The lovely single \\"A Thousand Miles\\" is the best track here, while \\"Ordinary Day\\" is a close second. Other than the songs previously mentioned, \\"Be Not Nobody\\" is full of weak songwriting and production that almost tries to be like \\"Little Earthquakes\\" by Tori Amos. I do give Vanessa credit for writing every song but one on this album, but I still fail to see why she's so popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"obnoxiously bad","review":"if she stuck to instrumentals, this would be a much better album. but the fact is vanessa carlton cannot sing worth a lick, no matter how slickly produced this CD is.i was watching her on TV with my grandmother over christmas, and after ms. carlton got done singing one of her popular songs, my grandmother commented \\"i couldn't understand a word that young woman just sang.\\" neither will you. avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this CD was going to be good, but I was wrong...","review":"This CD wasn't too good. I thought this CD was going to be really good because I liked the singles and when they came out. \\"A Thousand Miles\\", \\"Ordinary Day\\", and \\"Pretty Baby\\" caught me into this CD. I got it on Christmas day. I thought they were going to sound like the first four, but no, they sound horrible, no offence to Vanessa. Some of them sound like she's half asleep. I really, really do NOT like it when the singles sound so good, and the rest of the CD sounds like a bunch of singing weasels. It's like a trick to make you buy the CD or something, which I bet you that's what it is. I'd rate this CD 4/10.In conclusion, I wouldn't buy this CD. Download some of the music off your comp. first or listen to it off a website, and your ears should tell you. If you want to buy it, go ahead, but I'm not going to make you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"why do people like this album?","review":"When I first saw this CD I figured it was guys buying it for the cover-art and her pretty face, and lo and behold it WAS men buying this at the local CD shop, last time I went. So I thought, what the hell, maybe this is good.It's not listenable. I cut my teeth on Tori Amos back in the day, and tolerated Fiona Apple's debut, and I am a great fan of the piano and of anyone who can play and sing with accompaniment, but this CD really [stinks]. She sings like she's trying out for an Annie revival, like she's trying to prove herself (even worse), and like she has attitude. I've sat through this CD twice and every time think to myself \\"Who cares?\\" I don't.Don't take my word for it, it looks like everyone who's reviewed this here really liked it, but it strikes me as strident, amateurish, self-important and extremely immature. Even Alanis at her most immature and amateurish sounds better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah Yeah Yeah!","review":"One Of the worst albums I've ever listened to. This girl may have some talent but she better start using it. She can play a piano but she surely can't write songs nor sing. this album laks both vocally, lyricly and artisticly. no originality here, no fun, just plain boredom. No risks envolved. This girl is 22 when I saw the video for Thousand Miles I thought she was 13. Just a Commercial bubblegum pop with no soul and no heart put into it. I Know it's her debut so I'll give it 2 stars but other than that she needs to do better material.

I thought the description of the book sounded great and that this would be a real psychological thriller. But the characters weren't well developed at all and the story really lagged. I should have felt something for some of the characters but I just didn't. I didn't feel badly for the victim and I didn't feel any anger for Alex Leonard (the murderer).

This terrible book promotes NOT sharing, exclusionary play and then REVENGE, not to mention male/female stereotypes. The story goes: two girls having a tea party and won't let their little brother play with them. Then to get back at them, he puts a spider in their tea and their game and book are over. Shame! I would never let my little girl read such a horrible book. The author should be ashamed to teach kids this kind of behavior. This book has absolutely ZERO redeeming qualities.

This CD has every song you could ever wish for but unless you don't mind your music sounding like your listening to it under water, stay away from this one.

She is one of the great contemporary writers, and she was teaching when I was in college. We were too young to be in awe of her, but reading or especially rereading Bowen is one of the greatest pleasures of a lifetime. This is my favorite of her novels, but she hasn't written a single one I don't admire. Enjoy the winter with Bowen on hand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"deep pleasures","review":"This is not an easy read and nor did Bowen intend for it to be so. God forbid any of these commentors who hated it should make the mistake of ordering a Henry James novel. Bowen has such remarkable powers of penetration; her ability to shape compelling images with words is nothing short of astonishing. Every time I read a review that uses the word boring, I feel the urge to buy the book just to spite them. What the hell does that mean, boring? Impatience, that's what I believe it means. Well, this isn't a book for the impatient. I'm not interested in what impatient people like or want. Sorry if this bruises any egos, but I have a great fondness for Elizabeth Bowen and this novel in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Death of the Heart review","review":"My daughter did her 11th grade English term paper over this book.

It's a fine read."},{"rating":"2","title":"very dark, sadly funny, very complex","review":"The orphan status of the protagonist, Portia, not to mention the circumstances around her birth, provides strong sense of uprooted, transient, and precarious nature of out existence. The world through this teenage girl's eyes seems non-sensical civility and pretentious righteousness, and ironically, surrounded by quite juvenile mischievousness. This book is quite a complex and throughly psychological testimony on, sort of, coming of age experience. Not a casual read because of its deeply introspective writing, and quite visual that sometimes reads like a play on stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written, but intensely boring","review":"Don't get me wrong: I like Jane Austen and I've been entertained by Henry James. I like Trollope and I've read numerous Russian novels. Why is this book on the 100 best list? It is soooo boring. The characters are static, the mood bleak, and the plot practically non-existent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight Review From a \\"Commoner\\"","review":"Sorry folks but 400 pages of pettiness is a downer. The snobby Brits in this book are about as shallow as the nothing lives they are living. The poor 16 year old girl, Portia, needs a good shrink, hopefully one not on the snobby side. Anna and Thomas, brother and sister-in-law and their friends, have countless conversations, during tea, of meaningless topics, saying meaningless things. WHAT'S THE POINT? The only part of interest for me was near the end, when the girl stood her ground. Of course, no good came from that either. The raving reviewers who 5 starred this book sound a little phoney to me also. But, alas, I'm just a commoner who appreciates a deep book about people with souls and a little personality and charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Death of the Heart","review":"Just like Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald & Evelyn Waugh novels that are all so-called classics, this book was excruciatingly insipid & worse still, aimless. I only suffered through it thinking there would be SOME type of conclusion. In reality, the conclusion was such a pointless dead end I was outraged & felt I had wasted precious hours of my life that I will never get back.

I was in Best Buy and saw this really hot guy holding a guitar and thought \\"Why not?\\" Well, I got home and wasn't knocked off my feet. The music itself is fairly good. However, the vocals are lacking. If he was a better vocalist, the album would be much better. His vocal delivery is very dry and monotone. Think Ryan Cabrera but less talented vocally. Anyway, the CD is alright and I don't feel like I was ripped off being as I only paid 10 dollars for it. However, I just wish he'd mix it up when it comes to his vocal delivery... it's too talkie. The best song is \\"Trouble\\". Check it out if you're bored with your current CDs, as I was.

My favorite song is \\"Like You, Only Sweeter\\" and \\"Young At Heart\\". I just don't know how to explain him, but I listen to his cd non-stop. I love him so so so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"unoriginal","review":"The history books say that William Tell was a Swiss national hero in the 15th century of debatable historical authenticity. What's much less debatable is that the Southern Cal pop artist with the identical moniker is unlikely to create nearly the same legend.William Tell's new album \\"You Can Hold Me Down\\" was released on March 13th, by New Door Records. It is Tell's first solo effort after his work with the band Something Corporate. A generic pop album, Tell majors in catchy hooks and sing-along type tunes, intertwined with forgettable lyrics. There's nothing particularly second-rate about the album, just not much that's memorable. Highlights include the driving \\"Slipping Down,\\" as Tell's energy provides a nice contrast from his sappier piano ballads. After a couple spin's Tell's bouncy choruses and feigned anxiety grow distinctly monotonous.Not to say it's so bad you might want to fire an arrow at his head.

This is a story about an unlicenced surgeon, who is genuis in surgery.

Terrorists take over a hospital, an epidemic is carried by dingoes in Australia, and Black Jack himself is operated on by a doctor who is profoundly jealous of his patient's superior skills.

Please release the original!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor acting, Poor Dialogue. Not a good start","review":"My wife and I were pretty disappointed with the pilot episode of Bionic Woman. As Battlestar Galactica fans we were excited to see Starbuck and Chief in this episode but unfortunately neither one shined. The story was not good, the acting even worse. I had high hopes for this show and from the previews I thought the new show Chuck was going to be lame and this show would be the one to watch ... turned out it was the other way around. The characters in this show were not interesting or likable. The characters in Chuck were both.I'm guessing once the novelty of this show wears off people will see it for what it is ... unless the writing changes drastically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much unnecessary sexual content & violence","review":"I was appalled by the violence and sexual content in this show. No there are no full on sex scenes but several scenes where it goes too far in my opinion. The violence is also over the top in my view. I found the acting to be good and the storyline to have potential, but just like Eick's \\"reinvented\\" Battlestar Galactica, the bad far outweighs the good. Apparently Eick's reinventions always require adding sex and violence in order to sell the reinvention. I will pass on this show. I am an avid sci-fi fan. I have enjoyed Star Trek, Babylon 5, Quantum Leap and many other sci-fi shows, none which needed to rely on sex and violence to sell the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"It's amazing it lasted 8 episodes.

It's the real bionic deal.[..]"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO PICKS THESE RELEASES???","review":"I can't believe this updated TV show of The Bionic Woman is already on DVD. Although the original show was not up to today's stanards, it was a stepping stone to the level of what some good science fiction is today. It also had a great deal of charm and a pulse.This new version of The Bionic Woman is a vapid and sterile framework that seem to exist to just to propel from accelarated fight scene to fight scene. The cast was good, but that's about it.The original series of The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman are still not available in the US but are in other countries. The same people who pick what is going to released on DVD must be of the same mentality that give the green light for production of very poor remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average show - nothing special","review":"It was interesting to see 2 characters from Battlestar Galactica in the show, though one was probably a special guest. But the show's main character acting and lines were extremely weak.And the pilot was just plain boring. The bionic woman gets a grasp of her skills immediately, without any training, common, make it plausible.Acting and the lines of the script were so flat, I really felt that I should have fast forwarded the show to the end.I was originally looking forward to it, but I had to high expectations, by the end of the show, I was seeing fight scenes straight out of the matrix and other action flicks, and it bored me.Character development is crucial, and I didn't see it. Nothing compelling, and nothing to see here, just move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word, terrible","review":"To be honest, I shut it off about thirty minutes into it.

So well-produced shows like \\"Bionic Woman\\" are right up my alley. I think that Michelle Ryan did a wonderful job as the new Jaime Sommers. I also loved Katee Sackhoff as Sarah Corvus. Watching the DVD without commercials really brings home the potential this show had. NBC did not give it a proper chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good tv.","review":"This was not as good a remake as Battlestar Galactica or some others, and it took a bit to get going, but I really enjoyed it. But it got cancelled, like most shows that aren't an overnight success.

Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"First David Eick version was better","review":"The first version of the show produced by David Eick without interference from NBC was much better. Dark, edgy, quirky. Then NBC executives got afraid that Battlestar Galactica's dark mood was what killed the show in its third season (it wasn't, just bad writers). NBC ordered recasting and reshooting. (Mae Whitman had been great as Jamie's deaf sister!) The result is this boring, committee-produced monstrosity. Flat, stale, boring and ultimately unprofitable. I won't watch it. Hopefully, Life and Pushing Up Daisies can save the new TV season."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"I really wanted to like this show.

The first ten minutes--perhaps the most critical--seemed forced and rushed, and most of the plot developments afterwards I could see coming a mile away. The only redeeming quality of this show was Katee Sackhoff (AKA Starbuck fromBattlestar Galactica - Season One), but she isn't enough to save this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I rarely comment on products, but this one was so abysmal, I must.

And to think that one reviewer thought the original Bionic Woman was much worse than this crap!This updated version of Jamie Sommers wears boots with an uncomfortable heel whenever she goes on a mission. Imagine running sixty miles per hour in shoes like that. The creators of the show sure did, which is why they're most likely on the unemployment line.This vacuous excuse for a television show is strictly for the teen demographic who don't want thought provoking programming in their lives.For those of you who fondly remember the original series, the one and only Lindsay Wagner, please do yourselves a favor and don't even consider renting or purchasing this lame show.If I can't reach you on some deeper level, then I'll leave you with these choice words: \\"If I'm lying, I'm dying.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointed Mac User","review":"All my friends who have seen the Bionic Woman on Broadcast have said it is worth the time.

I was expecting something more similar to the Bionic Woman of the 1970s, but this show turned out to be a great update of the original concept.

When I heard that the creators of Battlestar Galactica were involved in the Bionic Woman, I thought how could I go wrong...? Boy did it go wrong! The B.W. pilot was a mish mash of poor character development, cheap looking special effects, even cheaper sound effects (what was with that Fred Flintstone foot pitter patter when the B.W. was supposed to be running fast?) and very poor choices in the hideous score music. I found myself wincing my eyes at the trite dialog all throughout and I also had a great deal of difficulty believing that Jaime didn't want to just march right back down to that mountain bunker and get the other arm fixed after that fight with the superior cyborg Katee Sackhoff. I really found myself not caring very much for any of the characters in B.W. because they just weren't that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"No suprises.","review":"I watched this on amazon video because I missed the series when it came out.

Typical hollywood special effects and weak plot with dialogue that is laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see why this got cancelled.","review":"I bought this box set on Amazon because I only paid a few dollars for it (used). Although I wasn't around for the original series, I watched them all and enjoyed them.That said, I had high hopes that this would be a good series too, but it wasn't. The characters were not developed well, and there wasn't a good plot line. Part of what made the original series work was that Jaime Sommers was unique, a one-of-a-kind bionic woman. This one tried to have a second bionic woman, who was villainous and who caused the accident which caused Jaime to need bionics. It really didn't work for me. Perhaps if the show had lasted, the writers could have resolved some of the many holes/inconsistencies in the story... but maybe if they hadn't had these issues, the show could have survived.Still, all in all, I can definitely see why it got cancelled, but it might be worth the price of shipping to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible attempt at a revamp/replacement","review":"Sorry but the actress could never ever pull off this role, she was also the victim of terrible writers,bad time slot and just bad show revamp.Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gorgeous Bionic Woman, LOUSY SHOW","review":"I love Michelle Ryan.I wish I had read the reviews before I unboxed the season.

I predict it will not last on tv very long. Its too well made, dark, violent, and angst-ridden (The daughter character helps amp that up). The new Jamie Somers is rugged and easy on the eyes (then again so was the original). The pilot sets up the series well - hinting at some baddies. I think several of the female characters, including a stalwart rugged actress from Battlestar Galactica, look way too much like mannequins. They have far too much makeup on and one scene, bizarre thick red lips. The stylized female cat fight on the roof in the rain was engaging - but overall I think the show needs a little estrogen NOT more testosterone.At one point the Bionic Woman says \\"You made me a soldier\\". I can see this series going that way but I urge the director to keep Jamie a lady and a caring mom too."},{"rating":"2","title":"downloads are free in Avi or DIVX xvid...","review":"Downloads AKA torrents are free at http://thepiratebay.org/ in Avi or DIVX or xvid all play with most players.

I don't know if the rest of the series is better, but quite frankly, it can only get better. The over-glossed production and Matrix-like effects can't distract from a flat, under-articulated plot and character development. I finished watching the 43 minutes of show with little to no concern for the characters. The lead actress is great, but, she's not enough reason for me to stick around. Unless they get better dialogue writers, better stage producers so the actor's don't stand around in awkward poses and they start to give an emotional interest in these characters, I can see this over-hyped, over-produced show lasting all of eight episodes. But, it may improve and wind up lasting eight SEASONS.For me, I'll be passing on \\"Bionic Woman\\" this fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasé typical application of soap relying on a snappy title","review":"This is typical filler for those times when there is nothing else to present on TV.

I'm a Sci-Fi fan, but don't watch TV. I thought Galactica started well and devolved into chaos, and who knows where we go from here, but the Bionic Woman setup is really good and the pilot is well written, well acted, and plausible. It's got a bit of a \\"La Femme Nikita\\" redo feel to it (which is a good thing by me), with the chilly interplay between the handlers and the (sometimes reluctant) agents. I was pretty happy with the Amazon Unboxed download; I'd definitely buy things episode by episode that way (I've been considering buying the little video I watch from iTunes). Installing the player didn't bother me, although I would like to see a Mac version too (I have both and am moving more and more stuff to the Mac).

There is a lot of action but no adventure.The only good parts is the prettiness of Will Yun-Lee, the awesome characters played by Molly Price & Miguel Ferrer who usually are the best things in OK shows and Kevin Rankin who plays a smartass guy who is constantly in Jamie's ear.This show has some good potential with it's supporting cast and their story.

Such a great performance that almost brought tears to my eyes. If you don't believe me, listen to both songs and ask yourself why they aren't on his greatest hits collection.

Still, you can't go wrong with anything on the first disc of this version. The quality on the 2nd disc reflects some of his creative slumps.

I certainly didn't need the bubble-gum Crocodile Rock or the forgettable Island Girl in their stead. There should someday be a cd of Elton's greatest album cuts that would include such gems as \\"Ticking\\" \\"Madman across the water\\" \\"Take me to the Pilot\\" \\"Burn down the mission\\" and \\"There goes a well known gun\\" just to name a few...

The recordings have obviously not been remastered since they were originally produced for LP's, and the resultant product on these cds is scratchy and limp at best - incomprehendable at worst.

I'm sure the eleven minute plus running time led to the omission, but no Elton collection should be complete without this song. Also some lesser known fan favorites are missing like \\"Club at the End of the Street\\", \\"Blue Eyes\\", and \\"Roy Rogers\\". Ideally, it should've been a three-disc set, but as two disc sets go, this is pretty good (especially the first disc, which includes his hits from 1970-1976 and is track after track of good music).Not a bad purchase, I just think it's missing some tracks that prevent it from getting a five out of five in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An all mostsy","review":"A good collection but would be a Great collection if one [1] song had not been omitted .MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER should have been on it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elton John Greatest Hits 1970-2002","review":"This takes me back to my teen years.

Nowadays his worldwide record sales are still climbing with high intense. This last double-LP had already sold nine million units - 5000k in US alone - and will last as another great success. Although two or three dozen wonderful songs are missing, such as \\"Song for Guy\\" or \\"Healing Hands\\", this retrospective is nearly complete concerning the claim of beeing a best-of.

I have used the Yakima Top Loaders in the past, but prefer the Side Loaders because they allow the bars to sit closer to the top.The directions are fairly simple and straight forward, and they install in an hour or so (depending on how difficult it is to measure the top of whatever you're mounting them to). Something worth noting is that the supplied bolts are pretty short, so be aware of the shell thickness of your vehicle. I had to buy longer bolts from a local hardware store but it wasn't a huge issue.I'm only giving them 4 stars because they are pretty expensive for what you get. Even at Amazon's lower price, $30 for a pair of stamped steel brackets and some hardware is certainly on the high side."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read!","review":"Nobody wants to need Stephen Mitchell Sack's new book, but everyone should. Anyone can be fired, anytime. Sack was sacked, unfairly, from his first job out of law school. It must have ticked him off, because he's become the adviser of the pink-slipped population. His book explains when to call a lawyer if you're fired and gives an overview of U.S. laws protecting employees from discrimination and unfair dismissal. Despite the necessary legal lingo, the author keeps it readable. He warns you to prepare for dismissal before it ever happens and shows that simple record keeping can boost your severance package.

As it runs its course, the events continue to crescendo, then, when the reader is expecting the most, everything collapses.

It is taken word-for-word directly from the FileMaker Pro 8.0 book, including the images of the screen layouts. Which makes it completely inaccurate for FileMaker 8.5.For example; In Ch 4, Building Your First Database, this book walks you though starting with setting field options, which won't work with version 8.5. You have to build tables, and then build fields within them.This book is a waste of money. Don't buy it unless you are running FileMaker 8.0, or older, you want a very simple database, and you have no experience or understanding of databases at all. Even then you should just buy the the 8.0 version; it will be cheaper (being the older version), and exactly the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cyndi's Version Blows Celine's Out of Space!","review":"If you like modern music and real singers buy Cyndi's version, because Celine dion voice and style fits well the 70s and also is a great listening for mothers and fathers. Cyndi beside de pop Diva look and great vocal talent delivers this song like a GODESS. Listen to Cyndi TWELVE DEADLY CYN'S \\"I Drove All Night\\" and you will see why her version BLOWS OUT CELINE'S version. Cyndi's video of \\"I Drove All Night\\" is also fantastic. Ms. Lauper SHINES!!!!!!!!!! The DIVA bouces back!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY THE ALBUM SKIP THE SINGLE","review":"There is nothing worthy on this release.

Indeed, she does have a powerful voice. However, a great pipe does not constitute a great singer. As a matter of fact, her voice is down right annoying with all the shouting and scream. Everything has to be ended with a way over-produced note.People! This is a ROY ORBINSON's song! It is neither Cindy Lauper's nor Celine's. Listen to Orbinson's original recording and appreciate the spiritually bareness of the song. Cindy Lauper's version is way better than Ms Dion's melodramatic, ear-numbing screech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done Celine - but Cyndi's is better.","review":"When I first heard Celine singing this on her Chrysler commercial campaign, I could hardly believe my ears. Celine had covered a Cyndi Lauper classic? Celine does a great job with her version which is aimed at the dance floors. Her voice sounds great and the song rocks.But once again, this proves in the inferiority of remakes. Beat for beat, vocal for vocal, Cyndi Lauper's version blows Celine's out of the atmosphere. Whereas Celine's is guided toward the club, Cyndi's version is haunting. Cyndi sings this song from the heart and captures the longing and desperation in her vocals. Buy both if you can (they're both good) but if you had to choose one or the other, buy Cyndi's."},{"rating":"1","title":"When I Heard This Song I Became Nauseous!!!","review":"Celine needs to quit butchering other people's songs and write her own. This attempt at recording a re-make is dreadful. I just hope her fans don't think it's her song. Roy Orbison is probably turning in his grave and Cyndi Lauper is probably also wishing Celine would leave the song alone. I know I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Céline's new hit!","review":"As we can see by this time, I drove all night is successfully going up the charts worldwide. This song is a cover from the old Cindy Lauper and Roy Orbison's versions. However, Céline's IDAN has a new dancing pop rythm and quite good new back vocals. Her voice is at its best and the song suits her completely. Her new album ONE HEART is coming out on March 25th and it is probably going to be Céline¡s best album to date, because she gave up with those catchy pop songs and now she tries rock, acoustic, country and more. You should try thios one, a great one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very Average at best","review":"I respect Her Vocal Range but this Song like so much of Her last Album leaves Me Numb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Cyndi Lauper's instead","review":"This song is not bad.

She sings well but I Drove All Night fits well in the voices of Cyndi Lauper and Roy. Cyndi gave us a ROCKY modern interpretation of it, and Roy gave us a country and sad interpretation of it. Not against Celine, but buy Cyndi Twelve Deadly Cyns because her version it is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE'S BACK FOR MORE!!","review":"If you thought Celine could never sing nothing but love songs, that is totally wrong!!

No comment for the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of the same","review":"Why ruin a good thing? The Roy Orbison version still rocks and sounds better than all of the digital computer chirps of this dance mix. And Cyndi Lauper packs more emotion (and more range) into one phrase than Celine does in an entire CD. Nothing in this version is nuanced. Try as you might, you'll never be able to discern one authentic heart-felt emotion. Just the same old musical breaks to unleash a series of computer enhanced high notes. Even the video is uninspired and tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebrate","review":"This is an amazing album.

I realize that as artists and lead singers rotate, there's a variance in the music sometimes, but this has no \\"orginal\\" Kool & The Gang flavor with the exception of the last original cuts. Some groups can mix the new school flavor with the old school and make it work, unfortunately this doesn't work for Kool & The Gang on this cd, feel the boogie??On the flip side of that, The Bar-Kays' cd \\"House Party\\" maintains it's originality yet fuzes enough hip hop in to make it work without sacrificing that originality. When I first heard the first cut on their cd, I knew it was the Bar-Kays. Question is, would you know this was Kool & The Gang if you heard one of the first 16 cuts? - I wouldn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro book!","review":"If you've never used Quark before, this is the perfect book for you!

It is just page after page of shameless ad hype for InDesign, which if you're buying this book you've already got InDesign so they really don't need to sell it to you. Except that with each page you are going to ask yourself why anyone would ever give up QuarkXpress for this miserable throwback to Pagemaker-- so I guess that's one reason why with every other page they have to try to sell you the idea.Save your money and get the Adobe Classroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible software and customer service","review":"If you want to feel like you're on prehistoric times...just go for the QXpress software.* QXpress would never work* QXpresswould always crash, you would need to do long and endless phone calls to see how you can solve issues, you would need to enter a million numbers and letters on your activation code and even though, it won't work EVER* if you finally get in contact with QXpress customer support they would never help you and when you tell them about all of the issues...they would try to convince you to upgrade and pay $299, and when you explain that no because it did't work, they would be very disrespectful to you and leave the conversation without asking if you need anything else.I was a QXpress user for many years, but the involution of this software is way too much.My recommendation: use InDesign instead, no doubt.Thanks for reading my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a hideous game...","review":"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is bar none the worst game tied to a movie license that I've ever played. The graphics are drab and lifeless, the controls are clunky, and the missions are boring and tedious. The game's only saving grace is the plethora of unlockables (CG in-game movies, theatrical clips, behind the scenes clips, stills, etc.) available to you as you progress through the game as well as a playable demo of a much better, currently unannounced, terminator game called T3: Redemption. There were times when I found myself playing the demo rather than the actual game itself. In it, you play as Arnold from a third person perspective as you blast away cyborgs and HK's on foot or on vehicle through a nuclear-scorched Los Angeles. This was the game that I should have been playing, not the rushed hack job I got instead. For die-hard fans, save you money till T3: Redemption comes out. Rise of the Machines by itself, is just an expensive demo."},{"rating":"1","title":"He will not be back.

After I finshed thought that it was a waste of my time and money. There is no replay value at all. I mean atleast have a multiplayer mode or something intresting. I say that if you really want to play this game rent it or buy it used at a good price.

A fantastic demo starts the game with an extension of the film's storyline; this is a stunning sight, with great energy and amazing graphics, and then you play the game.......The controls are terrible, the action is repetitive and even the sound effects are annoying. Included on the disc is a demo of the next game titled 'Terminator 3: Redemption'. This has all the same flaws, the graphics are brilliant, but the gameplay is missing.

Their music, while often light and fun is also filled with interesting social commentary. So whether its the shallowness of society as represented in High School Never Ends, or the longing for the dreams of youth in 1985, or the musical version of giving the finger to the people who had no faith in their ability in My Hometown, the band is always creating music filled with wit and personality.The DVD manages to capture the fun that Bowling for Soup brings to the stage. This is one band that really seems to enjoy what they do and this enjoyment is infectious.The only problem with the DVD is that it only has 15 tunes. With ten albums to their credit, there were many great songs that didn't make the cut. However, the DVD does supply a solid selection of hits and I love their cover of Ring of Fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and funny!","review":"This band is seriously amazing.

I'm sorry when I have a daughter I do not and would not want her to read a book like this that enourages girls to basically be a stereotype of looking pretty, being obedient to men, etc. I want to enourage pride, cutiousity, intelligence, and strength and not breed the next generation of housewives or the wives and mothers of important men.

And although the distribution maps may be a bit dated, they are helpful to understand the general areas where the plants might be found. Also, included with each section is some basic cultivation advice that I've found very helpful.This isn't a book for a novice grower of carnivorous plants, but rather for someone who's been growing them for a while and wants more information on their native habitats and environments, as well as more technical information on each plant.

After you start the hole it will lock immediately, even if you back off for a split second until the drill achieves full RPM's again, and then ever so gently try to easy your way into the wood, no good, and I was working with regular redwood.My advice is you buy DeWalt better quality bits that will last you for very long time and will not loose their sharpeness, AND you can ease your way into the wood without ever locking.I thought these \\"speedbor\\" bits would be a great addition to my tools but in reality they just frustrated me.One last detail (I really don't like these ones, can you tell?): If you are lucky enough to cut a hole, it will have a very rough surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bits","review":"These self feed auger bits are great for light duty use.

Its sound is straight from the Word of Mouth Big Band, and Jaco is prominent. I think this one song is the only reason to own the album.

The entire game just seems so poorly pieced together that it comes off as a hack job. The graphics are bland with chunky polygons, the controls are clunky, the missions are boring and repetitive, and the game all together is too easy. There are extras to unlock such as CG segments and actual scenes deleted from the film, but nothing here is worth laying down hard earned money for whether it's purchase or a rental.

I couldn't wait to get my hands on Animosity. Was I evey disappointed. This is a terribly written book. It took 100 pages before any suspense took place. The book was so predictable that I knew the villian immediately. The book is simply preposterous and unbelieveable. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a terrible book","review":"I can't believe how lousy,sloppy and improbable this book is. David Lindsey,who brought us the complex,facsinating Stuart Heydon,has apparently decided that he doesn't need him anymore and has been trying to compete with Robert Ludlum for improbable and sophomoric writing. The characters are nothing more than cartoon characters,the plot is artificially convoluted,lacking any focus and credibilty. The dialogues are so forced,ridiculous and childish,I felt embarrassed for the author. I figured out the culprit midway through the book,so it didn't even hold any suspense,forced and artificial as it was. It's is amazing that such a promising author has sunk so low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animosity = What the reader feels","review":"Having read and thorougly enjoyed Lindsay's Absence of Light, I eagerly bought everything else of his that I could find. My second voyage into his writing was this book. IF ONLY I had read the assessment of the first review!! This book is nothing like what Lindsay is capable of. It is boring, predictable and its characters are somewhere in between overdrawn and ridiculous. In an attempt to have a series of twists and turns, the author has the reader spinning - leaving one with a sense of nausea at times. I shall not give up on Lindsay, however. Absense of Light was so brilliant that I'm sure this was just a fluke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy & Nasty","review":"An artist with a roving eye sets up camp in the Texas hill country. He becomes involved with sisters and one has kyphosis or hunchback.The story moves slowly through the playboy artist's work and love life and ends on a very trashy note indeed. This is only just a step above Mark Nykanen's \\"The Bone Parade,\\" which was purely ghoulish and grisly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell Hath No Fury.....","review":"This is a very different suspense novel with a particularly unusual character and relationships based upon scorn, selfishness and lust. Sculptor Ross Marteau meets Celeste,a beautiful woman who hires him to sculpt her sister Leda, in what turns out to be one of his greatest challenges. Leda's body overwhelms him with curiosity and fascination while at the same time feeling aversion and disgust. Once he agrees to work with Leda, the entanglement of the relationships between the characters becomes the heart of the story. In fact, I think the age-old saying, \\"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\\" becomes the underlying plotline that drives the story to a very satisfying conclusion.Although this is not one of Lindsey's best, it still satisfied my requirements for it to be recommended: unique characters, realistic dialogue, and a plot that holds interest, has surprises, and makes me think after I close the book for the last time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I can only reiterate what others have already stated. I have read everything that David Lindsay has written with the utmost admiration. In \\"Animosity\\" he is too cute and too sloppy. I never thought that Lindsay would challenge my credulity this crassly. His primary character is hardly believable in his naivete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animosity","review":"My first mistake was buying this book; the second was to finish it after reading halfway through.

Does he have a ghost writer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely great read!!","review":"Exciting,compelling,a shocking conclusion that you would never predict! The suspense never lets up. I read the entire book in one evening.David Lindsey does it again, showing great versatility in each new offering. Hooray for Lindsy! Keep them coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animosity","review":"One of the most distasteful novels I've read. Not only are the characters one-dimensional, they are odious. I skimmed portions of the book that were upsetting and macabre. Astonishing that Lindsey found a publisher for this mediocre and forgettable work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A confusion of content with subject","review":"The biggest criticism I give Medved is that he confuses the content in popular entertainment with the subject: particularly with movies. Content is what you see in the movie. Subject is what the film is trying to tell you. When you can't tell the difference anymore, you get the wrong idea about movies. And that is just one of many criticisms I give Michael Medved after reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This just isn't very well written...","review":"Medved really dropped the ball on this one. I found his prose style to be bizarrely over- wrought, and his penchant for listing movies by urination scene or vomiting scenes seemed almost fetishistic. He attacks movies such as \\"The Little Mermaid\\" for being anti-family and seems to think that merely describing or depicting an act condones it...if that's true, then he of course approves of everything he disapproves of in this book. I'd pick up one of Ebert's movie guides instead--he seems to genuinely know what he's talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing Hollywood agenda, portrayed brilliantly","review":"As studios and Hollywood producers continue to back projects that have appalling liberal bias, yet little-to-no chance of commercial success (\\"Cradle Will Rock\\" (1999), \\"Cider House Rules\\" (1999) are good examples), it is plain to see there is a larger force at work in American popular culture. Medved does a superb job of documenting the multitudinous examples of filmmakers pushing the envelope in terms of content. As a eager consumer of pop entertainment, it has made me rethink the images that I choose to grant entrance into my mind. I'm not surprised that some readers find this book overwrought or \\"Chicken Little\\". Oftentimes, the truth hurts. The simple truth proven here brilliantly, is that Hollywood has an agenda. They promote it with a force frightening. Sadly, traditional values are under attack, by those who think they \\"know better\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth a look","review":"Medved, does nothing else here other that at least raise some important questions. A fine writer, with an excellent command of the language, Medved confronts (at least in his thesis) Hollywood's blatant disregard for traditional American values.Yes, Medved's thesis is simplistic and yes, he fails to consider the changing times which are indeed reflected in popular culture. And No, I as a reader certainly do not agree with all of Medved's points (Platoon is a far, far superior film to The Sands of Iwo Jima!). And I don't think everyone is supposed to agree with every point Medved desires to make. However, he does pose serious deconstructive questions that lend themselves well toward serious discourse and debate.Popular Culture has now evolved to significance in our society, whether for well or ill, well beyond a relfective product. It does influence us as well. Medved is simply, in this book that's well worth a look, asking us to closely consider what that influence may be."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOLDEN TURKEY AWARD","review":"This book marks \\"film-critic\\" Michael Medved's official move from the word of Bad-Movie insult-maven to \\"big-time\\" right-wing culture-warrior. By taking aim at the preferred target of rightist anti-Semites, \\"Blasphemous\\" (Jewish) Hollywood, the conservative Jewish Medved managed to get himself onto Talk-Shows, from CROSSFIRE to repeated trips to the couch of good friend, PAT ROBERTSON, grabbed a spot on the hate-group lecture circuit, and weedled out a short, grim after-life for his dying PBS movie-review program. The Fate of his SOUL is another matter. We can only speculate on that (or ask Pat, I guess).Already hopelessly dated, impossible to read or to take seriously, this book is not worth the few minutes of my life I am taking to WARN YOU AGAINST IT.

Medved needs to turn in his critic's license because he is far more interested in promoting a right-wing religious agenda than he is objectively reviewing films. Not only is he silly, but he seems to believe that films must meet a moral criteria, otherwise they aren't worth watching. This is a critic? Where is the commitment to open-mindedness? What a tragic waste of pulp this ridiculous book is, and I can't imagine anyone but the most rock-solid fundamentalist enjoying even a page of it.

The book was extremely helpful and served as a key component of our marketing and planning activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly researched and mostly entertaining....","review":"First and foremost, this book is more of a literary and investigative adventure. It's not until the last chapter that the author actually details his own physical search for the fabled treasure in Ecuador of the Incan King Atahualpa. A treasure that by all accounts over the last 500 years may be the most valuable land cache of gold and other precious objects on earth. It provides interesting and entertaining background on the other treasure hunters and explorers who went before him on the search. This leads the reader through labrynthine twists of misinformation, questionable documents/maps and several \\"characters\\" the author encounters who come across as gold-crazed swashbucklers. The book is definitely well-researched, but I expected something more along the lines of an Indiana Jones type of real-life adventure and came away with something more along the lines of a day spent in a musty-smelling library...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept Falls Flat","review":"Valverde's Gold is a first-hand experience of author Mark Honigsbaum's chase after a legend of lost Inca gold.The story includes legend, some myth, lost and partial treasure maps, and jungle exploration.

The first, an Alaskan mountaineering epic, leaves the reader amazed that the lone survivor made it; the second, about Scott Fischer on K2, leaves the reader amazed at Fischer's having survived as long as he did; and the third, Potterfield's own story, spawned much heated discussion and controversy among climbers. Clearly, Potterfield fell because he lost his grip on the rock, but why did he fall to the end of the rope? Did his belayer drop him...? That would certainly explain why he doesn't analyze the accident in more detail. In any case, the last story is the best, not only because it explodes those dearly-held beliefs in fainting before impact, but because it gives a detailed chronicle of a difficult high-angle rescue. Unfortunately, Potterfield does not write very well, but I suspect most readers will hardly notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This books tells the story of three separate mountain climbing rescues. While the subjet matter itself if very exciting and interesting, the style of writing served to make these stories almost boring, if that is possible. In light of the absolutely fabulous books \\"The Climb\\" and \\"Into Thin Air,\\" both about the 1996 Mt. Everest tragedy, this book is a huge disappointment and completely pales in comparison. Don't waste your money on this one. The only reason I give it a \\"4\\" out of 10 is because the stories themselves are compelling . Unfortunately, the writing gets in the way. Also, there are factual inconsistencies in the book which any reader can spot, and any editor should have caught."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exciting, Quick Read!","review":"I was drawn into the world of mountaineering after I read \\"Into Thin Air\\", and have since become quite the armchair mountain climber.

I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Good Reasons To Stay At Sea Level","review":"The first story, that of Colby Coombs on Alaska's Mount Foraker, is the most intense of the three. An avalanch swept Coombs and his two partners off the side of the mountain, incredibly he survived and, dispite injuries and lost equipment, managed to walk out under his own power. Motivated not simply by a desire to live but by the knowledge that if he died too his dead partners' friends and families would never know what had happened to them. Bullheaded persistance in the face of physical pain worked for Scott Fischer on K2 but on Everest in '96 the same trait caused his death. As for Mr. Potterfield's own story, I personally think it's quite reasonable for him to focus on the rescue rather than the cause of the accident. A mistake was made certainly but what's the point in placing blame? Far more important - and more interesting - is the skill and effort that went into rescuing him. I can't say I noticed any problems with his writing style either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"The author includes his own accident but steers well away from the cause, I wonder why!

Much of the book is stats to confirm that ESP is not chance. Gets pretty tedious after the 20th reference.

They held my attention fairly well. But from then until the end is pretty much an outlandish use of statics and number to validate the ESP/TK/PK phenomenon. I mean these scientists need to look at testing these phenomena at an entirely different way. In this book and elsewhere, scientists repeatedly try to validate something we know very little if anything about, with the primitive testing techniques of our normal world. That's why a lot of their data is inconclusive or finds very little. This book (after the 100th page) did not hold my attention at all. In fact I put it down numerous times and in the end had to force myself to read the rest. Definitely not worth the 14 bucks i spent at Books A Million for it.

And, of course, it is wrapped in the usual authoritative pseudoscience package, complete with totally cool and realistic-looking charts and statistics.History has shown time and again that people can easily persuade themselves to believe anything and then, through an impressive feat of mental onanism, produce what they, and many of their gullible readers, believe to be absolute proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another sign of the lack of coming to terms with the modern world","review":"There is nothing remotely resembling \\"strong\\" evidence, theoretical or empirical, for quantum effects at this scale.

I have had a lifetime of dealing with paranormal experiences.

Entangled Minds is filled with bits of new information, follow up research findings, and has been tweaked to answer some of the more egregious critics of The Conscious Universe. However,neither The Conscious Universe nor Entangled Minds is your everyday new age book/psi type of read; in fact it's not even close. Radin finally gives those with a belief in psi, a great look at the subject from a scientific point of view. And while nothing will completely quiet the \\"skeptics\\", these books most certainly arms believers with some pretty good evidence to bring to the conversation. I highly recommend reading both books, in sequential order, to get the most out of what Radin has to say- it will be well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"Interesting book.

If you look for \\"Entangled Minds\\" at Barnes & Noble, you will find it in the New Age section. It would be more appropriately placed in the sciences, as psychology or physics. Author Dean Radin has skillfully blended experiment and theory to take parapsychology out of the realm of sorcery, magic and haunting to put it where it belongs, as a non-normal (paranormal) science, accessible with the scientific method. Quoted significance and confidence numbers on experimental results of precognition and remote viewing are staggeringly large, really beyond the pale of ordinary statistics. While engaging, and accessible to the average open-minded reader, the book introduces quantum mechanics to explain how acts of conscious observation may affect the state of matter, and how quantum entanglement may lead to widespread connectivity of causes and effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entangled Minds","review":"I have read this book three times and every time, it completely amazes me.

If you know what it is, then you know what it does and why you want it. This stuff is bargain priced. I think it has been sitting on the seller's shelf for a while, because the adhesive is a bit more aggressive than it ought to be. It still works well, but when I used it on a white wall once, it pulled some paint. However, it should be noted that there was a slight bubble underneath the paint and no primer had been used. Unlike the other reviewer, I have had no difficulty tearing this tape, across or lengthwise. The tears have been easy and straight. If it was not older stock, I would have given this product five stars, but it probably would also have cost twice as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good and good price","review":"It's pretty good gaffers tape. I'm no expert/connoisseur on gaffers tape, but I have been in the Film and TV business for 15 years. And this tape does the job. There are probably some tapes out there that are better and some that are worse, but I'll leave that to the connoisseur who has a very specific use. Otherwise, this is a good all around tape for shoots. Keep in mind, I don't tape much stuff. Just occasional marks on the floor for talent and labels on slates. I haven't tried it on walls. But pretty good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for labeling things","review":"I bought this primarily to make labels (with a sharpie) on a bunch of storage boxes, and it's working great so far. It sticks to plastic much better than the painter's tape I'd been using, but still peels away smoothly and cleanly if you need to remove it. The roll I got does tend to tear a bit rough and at an angle, but at least it doesn't leave a lot of long threads behind like some other gaffers tape I've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly good gaffer tape.","review":"I picked white gaffer tape to make it easy to distinguish from my gray duct tape.

I had always remembered it, but never really had a need to buy it. I had decided this year to have my high school art students create altered books, and I knew it was time to get it so they had some visual references of how you can transform book pages. I am so glad I bought the book. You don't need to read it as a book, although you can. Every time I open it, I find a new treasure. It's just amazing what Phillips has created from an old book. It's an inspiration and a great piece of artwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really a BC fan, but great looking hat","review":"I grabbed this in a medium. Fits snug, but not too tight.

A grounded tail with no space travel, superpowers or the like. I thought it would be a nice change, and the animation looked good. It did start of good in the first three to four episodes, but then things began to go down hill. Most episodes went no where, other anime did episodes like that. Cowboy Bebop had many, but they were fun and still had meaning behind them. Black Lagoon on the other hand had no point. Then there was the final episodes. What a major disappointment, what were they trying to tell. What was the point of the series. It went no where, the characters weren't interesting, the story wasn't very good.

There's an attitude that certain young bands have, which reflects the passion for what they believe is the heart of their proposal in the musical world. That's the case of The Datsuns. So it's rock, guitar riffs, simple arrangements...with the attitude of bands that, (assuming they can keep those strengths long enough) can reach extraordinary success.

It made my quest for handmade pasta a living hell. 2 out of 4 screws holding the roller mechanism to the base were rattling around inside the machine with no hope of retrieval, the rollers kept opening up thereby not holding the setting, and the cap to the dial kept falling off. I really wanted to give this item a negative star count, but that wasn't an option.As good as homemade pasta is, I think I'll buy it store-made from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes Some Practice","review":"Initially, I was quite frustrated trying to get the roller to work. The dough kept tearing and it was impossible to get strips that were long enough. However, after some experimentation, I found it was easier to make long ropes of dough, flatten them by hand to 1/4 inch thickness, and then put them through the roller, instead of cutting 1/4 inch thick slices as the instructions recommend. As soon as I figured that out, I was quite happy with the results.To reiterate what a previous reviewer said, however: Don't waste your time with the ravioli attachment. It's WAY more trouble than it's worth. A ravioli stamp produces better results, and is much easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good quality","review":"It actually works. It makes pasta. But, I don't see the point in having a separate piece for cutting the spaghettis, it keeps sliding off place. Also, under the pasta maker there are four screws that keep getting loose for some reason and coming off. I already lost one and so the piece that it was supposed to be holding is now loose. I bought this machine less than two months ago and I must have used it about 6 to 8 times so I would say it's not very good since it's falling apart. I had a similar one before, different brand, and I used it for years without any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart immediately","review":"I was very excited to receive this machine, unfortunately that feeling soon faded. As soon as I began to use the cutting attachment, the entire thing fell to pieces. I may have received a faulty machine, but surely it should have lasted longer than ten minutes. Ever the optimist, I requested a replacement in the hopes that the next one I receive is of higher quality. My fingers are crossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I read all the reviews before buying this item.I just got through wrestling with it during my first effort at making pasta for ravioli. The clamp, which is absolutely necessary to use the machine, is poorly designed. If the manufacturer had invested a few pennies more, the clamp would have had rubber contacts, preventing it from coming off as easily as it did with every few turns of the crank.Other than that frustration, the pasta came out perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Pasta Machine!","review":"This pasta maker is exactly what I was searching for: a great pasta machine at a great price. I've already used this twice and am completely convinced that I got my money's worth.

What a terrible disappointment it is! It is an amorphous lump, not a pretty crystalline lamp like my daughter's is. When lit, dark veining that looks like trapped dirt shows up. When not lit, the lamp is simply a multi-colored, irregularly-surfaced blob. The base is terribly crafted of cheap wood with a truly poorly finished surface. The light bulb fitting is very cheaply constructed. The lamp I received looks nothing like the one on the box - it looks like a very cheap imitation. Despite its cost, it just says \\"dollar store\\" to me. Search elsewhere for one of the lamps with a crystalline exterior if you care about the lamp's beauty as well as its benefits. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"McFarlane Toys Jason Sehorn COLLECTIBLE","review":"First off,I dont consider this a \\"TOY\\" because it was ment to be displayed,not played with.

Cheesy lyrics, cheesy production, and Fergie's constant repetition of \\"No, no, no, no, don't phunk with my heart\\" sounds like nails on a chalkboard after about the 20th time she says it.

This game is quite ugly compared to the modern RTS darlings, but you can actually plot and contemplate your moves, which is a benefit that fully overtakes any complaints about graphics. There's a whole slew of scenarios included, and a .zip file on the Battlefront website will give you hundreds more (including some nice non-historical change-ups, like the Axis forces invading a Catholic school in Ottawa)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-Par","review":"This game is no longer state of the art and I doubt it ever was.

B&D was worthless in trying to provide service answers by telling me to drive 3-4 hours to service centers. I live in Springfield, MO which should offer somewhere to service it. Finally found a small appliance shop that was willing to help me out. The switch was blown and one of the batteries dead and you must replace both not just one ($240).

I live on a 70' x 60' property that is mostly taken up by house and concrete driveway, but it takes 4 sessions of mowing to get it mowed. The mower battery is on constant charge, but the mower just can't handle thick spring grass growth. I've even tried it with the bag instead of muching, and that makes the charge last a little longer, but it still leaves grass all over the lawn. I have better things to do. I'd ask for my money back but I know I wouldn't get it.

Even this electric mower needs some energy to make it work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy for a small area","review":"I bought this mower for my 81 year old mother, who had a similar machine that died. She has a half-acre lot that is mostly mowed by a service, but she has a couple areas that she likes to do herself because the guys on the ride-on mowers can be brutal to some the flower borders and such. She was insistent on cordless/rechargeable (so she could get some distance and also not mow the cord) and on mulching capability. That did not leave much choice. She lives in another state so I had it shipped there. She and an elderly neighbor put the handle on, and other setup, easily. And she is happily back in business. She's pretty critical about things and if she says she is happy with it...it's good. I have yet to see it in action myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to Deliver on its Promise","review":"I bought this mower last year in an effort to show a little environmental consciousness and also to spare the neighbors of at least one of the inevitable drones of summertime mowers. What a mistake. I received the mower in broken condition. It took a month to get a new one. That mower broke within 1 1/2 months. I had to drive two hours to the service center to get it fixed. It came back, mowed a few times, and I stored it for the winter (according to its instructions). Spring rolls around and it is time to mow. Guess what? The battery will no longer take a charge.As far as mowing prowess, it suffers from many of the things that the other reviewers have noted. However, I could easily have dealt with those problems-- maintenance problems, however, are a show-stopper.I'm writing Black and Decker and demanding a refund. This is the worst purchase I have made in 31 years.

The start and safety mechanism work well and is appreciated because my son will be using it, as soon as I can find him on lawn cutting day!If I could fault the product it would be with its weight. In summary, it costs a bit more, but it is well worth it to have a powerful and quiet lawn mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I have used my mower three times so far. I mulch the front yard and rear bag the back. Both work fantastic! It's easy to put in the mulcher part and take it out and the rear bag hooks right on. The mowing in fantastic, it starts up immediately and I still have 3/4 of the juice left in the battery when I'm done mowing my 50'x 150' property.

They also tend to be hard to start. So, after trying a non-power, reel mower with little success and lots of back-breaking work, I decided to purchase this Black and Decker. It is a breeze to start-just hold the dead man bar, and push the lever down. It is incredibly quiet, and emits no pollution. The blade height adjustment is really easy too-just one lever to adjust. However, because it is cordless, it is very heavy. I recommend this to someone only if they have a small, very flat yard. And, if you have limited strength, I would not purchase this. I have no problem cutting my yard on one battery charge. But if it were any larger, I might have to recharge for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"The CMM1000 is the perfect mower for those of us with moderate lawns. I can cut my 1/3 acre lot with battery life to spare, even if I've let the grass get pretty long. The mower is much quieter than a gas powered mower and the psycological effect of not running a two or four cycle engine with the associate pollution is nice. Plus there the reduced maintaince (no oil, no gas cans around, etc).The one hand height adjustment is an awesome feature and the easy start (a push lever) is nice, especially for my wife.I only wish I had bought this mower years ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the long-term cost","review":"At first glance, this mower is good, but pricy. You think, \\"Hey, I'll never have to buy gas, and I'm saving the environment.\\"Well, here's where they get you. The warranty on this puppy is 2 years. Black & Decker freely admit (go on, call and ask) that the battery is expected to go bad in 3 to 5 years. The cost of replacing that battery at a Black & Decker service center? About $150.When you add on a $150 maintenance cost every 3 to 5 years, this mower is really not worth what you pay.

This mower is perfect for smaller lawns and give you a sense of being environmentally friendly. It is quiet, no fumes, and no maintenance other than plug it in to charge. Recently, I moved and my new house lawn is much bigger and sloppy. It is a bit of a work out to use this lawn mower and it cannot cut my whole lawn with one charge. This mower is not as powerful as a gas type hence it will not be able to cut through thick or wet grass and lacks the vacuum power as well. However, I think this mower is perfect for urban and houses with flat and smaller lawns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mower","review":"I've been using a corded electric mower for 7 years and loved it except for the cord. I had read good things about the Black and Decker cordless electric mower and ordered one from Amazon.com. The first time I mowed was a little disappointing. Due to the battery it is heavier than my old mower plus, my grass was pretty tall so I had quite a bit of trimmings left behind. But, after that I was in love. I can mow my entire yard and still have battery left. Changing the cutting height is a snap, it's easy to empty the bag and it's a quiet mower. I've adjusted to the weight and don't mind mowing the yard. Plus, it's great in the fall for picking up and mulching leaves. As I watch neighbors struggling to start their gas mowers, lugging gas home and changing spark plugs I just smile and press one little lever and I'm mowing. I highly recommend this mower."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let-down!!","review":"I ordered this mower in May of this year, I used it twice and it stopped working. Not only that but, the two times I used it, it did not cut 1/3 of an acre. I had to charge the battery 1/2 way through each time.

The good, for a small yard, a full charge will be enough, it's really quiet (my neighbors love this, I can cut my grass even when they're having a cook-out without disturbing them) no gas, no oil, no fumes, no spark plugs, no cord, no cranking, other than taking care of the blade, maintenance free. The bad, not good for thick, wet grass, often requires you to go over the same patch twice to get a clean cut, and is not self-propelled. Still, overall, I'm happy and would buy this unit again.I purchased this unit in 2003 and now it's 2010 and it's still running! I really never expected to get this much life out of the same battery but there you go. I learned that if you keep the blade really sharp you'll get much better results.

The battery charge lasts about 45 minutes before it goes into yellow region of charge indicator (time to recharge). When cutting grass, the mower leaves some larger blades of grass partially uncut and you have to go back and recut the grass. This is not a big problem if you have a small yard but with a larger yard it can be very frustrating. This problem may be due to the narrow blade on the cordless mower which is much narrower than my gas mower.

My mower kept shutting off until I discovered the safety bail on the handle was not being pulled back far enough for the on switch to latch. I had to remove some rubber from the handle to allow the safety bail to travel closer to the handle and permit the on switch to latch. This solved the shutting off problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cordless Black & Decker Mower","review":"I was familiar with the cordless mower previously so when I purchased this new one, I already knew what to expect.

It's performance as a bagging mower is poor, especially if the grass is damp, when it picks up almost nothing before it clogs. It performs ok as a mulching mower if the grass is very dry, which means I need to wait until noon to start mowing. The indicator light showing whether it is finished charging or not stays continually on red, making it useless.

It is completely maintenance free and easy to use. The flip of the switch and it is on was well worth the cost. It does a great job in my opinion and I have since thanked my co-worker for suggesting an electric mower numerous times. If you can't read between the lines, I am a 'helpless' girl.

My old one is a 12v and the 24v has a lot more power. It is great not to have to buy gas or do tune-ups. The only negative thing it is heavy is 76 lbs so you get a workout when mowing. For new owners of cordless mowers you must clean the underside after each mowing and keep the blade sharp and balanced. I usually sharpen twice per season. My old mover over 11 years I replaced the charger twice, battery once and the blade once. Also I do not leave the charger plugged in when it is not charging the mower. B&D service person said it could have caused my chargers to fail. It is still working but it needs a new battery. I friend wants it for his townhouse lot. I will never go back to gas!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"Not the best book on the topic but not a total waste.

The next step is you go to the book, where many series of words are listed. You watch yourself in a hand mirror while you practice saying the words.

The last mix -- lasting over 10 minutes -- had so many repeats that it was enough to drive you crazy! And the drum beat is enough to drive you wild after awhile.

Only Sidney Bechet could match his swing and deep feeling of the music. Bechet had much more charisma and thus became much more popular.But for me there is no substitute for Dodds when it comes to playing honest and exciting New Orleans jazz. Armstrong made no mistake when he made him his regular sideman.This is a very good compilation of Johnny Dodds' music. It has a few tracks with Armstrongs, others in a trio format and a balanced spread of blues and rags.

These binocs are light, small enough and bright enough. Plus they are wide-angle, and close focusing. And perfect for use with eye glasses if you wear them. Wrap your hands around these binocs, brace you hands against your forehead, and they offer an incredibly stable view, which makes up for their low magnification. Great for most bird-watching. I just wish i had these years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary Measures","review":"The Amazon reviews prepared me for a good CT/HRT thriller. Sadly, on Page 5 \\"Jaffe checked his Glock 22 as if it were a toy. The click of the twenty-two round clip sliding home...\\" Glocks, like most other modern semiautomatic pistols, have magazines not clips. Barlog should know the difference; most of his readers will. They may also know that the standard Glock Model 22 magazine holds 15 not 22 rounds. Even so, I continued to read, still rich in hope...until Page 9. There, \\"Brax pulled his Glock-clicked the safety off.\\" Glocks don't have manual safeties that are 'clicked off'. One doubts an author who makes 3 significant mistakes about common weapons in the first 9 pages. Will he do better with the more complex technologies of terrorism bound to be encountered later in the book? I will never know. Technical competence is as important as literary skill for thriller writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste","review":"Don't waste your time or your money. Giveaway #1 is that the first several Amazon plugs are the author's own. #2, the publisher. # 3 the critic's \\"quotes\\" on the cover aren't even cited. The plot may have potential, but the author's abysmal writing and absolute lack of research kick the story line to the curb. Technical errors, demeaning military and cultural stereotypes and pedantly loathsome adjectives mire the reader before the action even begins. Stick with Pollock or Marcinko, or even Clancy(if your a technodweeb.)Barlog is fubared."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wonder how close to real this one is?","review":"It's a good book with a different terrorist plot. So many other 'spy' books use the same old hackned plots: 'World domination,' 'I've got a nuclear bomb' 'Oh look, the ebola virus again.' This one at least uses what I feel is a more real world approach to hunting down terrorists. I came away feeling as though the CT team were the real thing rather than the typical 'bang-bang, shoot 'em up, I'm one tough SOB' approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme Thriller","review":"Take a CIA counterterrorist team and turn them loose with the mission to stop the most heinous terrorist on the planet. That's the leaping off point for this book. These guys travel all over the world trying to hunt down the terrorist before he can strike again. The problem is they don't know when and where he's going to strike. You get to follow along as the terrorist puts his diabolic plan together and tag along with the team as they try to corner the terrorist.The pages literally fly by as you read.You, like the team, have to put together the intelligence to outthink the terrorist.

A group of buddies head for a cabin in the woods, their car breaks down and now a killer is picking them off one by one.I was ready to turn this off when I realized we were down to the last girl and still had a half hour to go. There'd been no thrills, a bit of gore, a bit of nudity but really nothing to write home about.But then, with about 30 minutes to go the movie abandoned the formula.

This book is an attempt, on the eve of the sellout of the Ray Gun Empire, to solidify the merit of a magazine built on 2 things: hype, and the desire of the design community and its afficionados to find a voice for the explosion of creativity ignited by the early macintosh design pioneers and their disciple, Ed Fella,while, initially at least, disregarding the need for relevant indie music reporting.

The pictures inside are awesome...there are really cool pics of all the guys on stage, backstage, and all over! This book is especially good to buy if you went to one of their (Amazing) concerts, because you can always remember the show with the pictures of them on tour. The book is made up primarily of pictures with quotes or captions. It doesn't really talk about the guys, but rather what goes on behind the scenes, and all the people that help put on the concert.

The raw materials for a great story are there, but poorly arranged and presented. Footnotes made up most of the bulk, many directly repeating the text. The same quotes were used in different notes. Several dates were obviously wrong. The most interesting nuggets of information and poignant scenes, such as Don Antonio Robidoux getting a warm cup of coffee after the Battle of San Pasqual, were never mentioned in the text, but buried in the mass of footnotes. Although the action took place over great areas of the West, from Chicago, St. Louis, Santa Fe, Ft. Laramie, to southern California, there were no Maps.

By hooking them up to a variable-voltage power supply from Radio Shack, we can vary the flow to get exactly what we want.

Since then I've done a lot of research on it and now have the realization it's mostly fake. The author died before the book even came out. Many facts have been disputed and proven false. The author had some info on Luciano and even talked to him some about doing a possible movie. After Luciano died the author took the info he had and just faked the rest and got away with it. Even today many still believe every word in the book. Shows clearly how people can be fooled so easily. Won't be the last time either.

I published my research in an article in Informer magazine called \\"The Last Word on the Last Testament.\\" There, readers can discover details that are impossible to cover in a short review.In sum, there are facts that the real Lucky Luciano would have known that the book gets wrong. There are a huge number of factual errors. There are references to facts and events that did not exist in 1962 (when Luciano died). And for the record, the New York slang that gives the book a feel of authenticity was created by the coauthor, according to statements he gave in different interviews. The book was rejected by the FBI when it came out and was rejected by journalists who specialized in organized crime. When all is said and done its only value is as a work of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Testament","review":"This book was long ago dismissed by many Mob authorities as a fake. It is a good one, very entertaining, and reads like the typical self-serving memoirs of a notorious criminal, along with the imaginative Hollywood flourishes of Gosch, but is filled with errors the real Luciano would not have made unless he was senile. Credibility is somewhat enhanced for the novice organized crime buff by Hammer's research but unless and until the interviews turn up \\"The Last Testament\\" must be regarded as more fiction than history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but wholly unreliable as history","review":"The atmospherics and gangster's slang in this breezy book come across as pretty convincing. But in terms of historical accuracy these so-called memoirs are absolutely worthless. There is no proof that \\"Lucky\\" Luciano said any of the words attributed to him. Even if he did, there is no reason to believe that he was telling the truth or that his memory was faultless.

I find his description of lucky's first meeting with Lepke suspicious, because of the way Lucky describes \\"his arms were bulging out of his sleeves\\" It has never been written any where that Lepke was physically imposing. I also find it hard to believe that Bugsy Siegal was taken serious at the age of 14, if you figure out the timelines he would have been a young teenager!

Some of the cut outs are correct but many are just a little off. This item will be returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better ones out there","review":"I guess it all depends on what you are used to. I have the complete set of Mozart's piano concertos with Brendel/Marriner and some of the Perahia recordings. Compared with those I found this interpretation lacking finesse and spirit. I missed the differential and almost spiderweb-like lightness of Perahia's and also Bendel's keystroke, and Marriners or Perahias conducting seems for my ears to be more interesting as well. Certainly, this is a fine recording with no technical flaws - however, I found it uninspired and partially even boring (which you might consider a major flaw). As conclusion - I think there are better recordings out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very English Choir","review":"Enormously popular on record and radio in their day, this all-male group can be heard and enjoyed again on this excellent CD. In number, about twice the size of the Comedy Harmonists or the King's Singers, the Kentucky Minstrels performed a repertoire of parlour ballads dating back to Victorian times and songs of their own time which sometimes had a faint aroma of the southern states of the U S A about them such as \\"Carry Me Back to Green Pastures\\" written by the group's London-born founder Harry S Pepper. In fact, the whole outfit was English, and the singing, especially from the soloists, was very plaintive and proper. The arrangements were made by Harry S Pepper's wife, Doris Arnold, the conductor was Leslie Woodgate, and the recordings sound as if they were originally made in London's Kingsway Hall. For sampling, \\"White Wings\\" is recommended, a song from 1884, not perhaps as well-remembered as most of the other songs included in this 70 minute program."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a Pre Study Guide","review":"This is a good book to use if you have never had any experience with security.

I think they are trying to capitalize on the popularity of the Marley movie (even the DVD covers look similar!)Zeus the dog is an ex-police K9 turned pound puppy who gets taken home by a family at Christmas. The dad and kids love the dog but the mom isn't sure she wants one around the house. To make matters worse, they think he might be too friendly to be a good watch dog.But when a pair of bungling burglars set their sights on the family home... Well, you did see Home Alone, right? Kind of predictable.... but overall a harmless family holiday movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"I watched this on TV with my 3 and 5 year old children.

It's cheesy at best- don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Done Family Movie","review":"This one is hard to watch: Hokey, badly photographed, stupid, predictable story, cheap production. I felt sorry for the adults in it. I did not realize that Dean Cain's career had sunk to this? Got this for my young child who loves dogs and Christmas movies. But, this one was really bad. Not charming at all. My child was pretty bored through the whole thing. Also, I did not like the robber acting like he was going to bludgeon the dog with a golf club. Much better dog movies are the Cats & Dogs series, they're amusing and have reasonably good photography and CGI, unlike this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"I don't see how anyone of any age would enjoy this 88 min waste of time.

I am more than a little tired of talking animals.....at least in live action films and this entry just seems a little too tired for me. The kids might enjoy this film, but adults will see this K-9 version of 'Home Alone' for what it is, a silly and boring gimmick film. I suggest a rental before buying this one. To each their own, but you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money on something else","review":"This movie is bad. It's like someone with no experience or talent set out to make a family movie. The cover makes it look like Air Bud or Marley goes to Christmas. I am not a fan of those, but this does not even live up to that standard. I hate that people compare this to other movies in their review. I can't think of anything worse, and I pray I do not see the films that compare to it. (To day something positive) I am happy for the people that made the movie, it helps the economy that they have jobs.My mom bought it for my kids because the dog on the cover looks like our dog. It was sweet of her, but I pray other grandma's read this and save their money. There are plenty of better movies that will actually entertain people. No need to waste time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey... that looks familiar...","review":"I grabbed this for my kids to watch with their cousins while we were visiting family out of state for the holidays. I thought it would be a cute movie that would fit all ages (10-6). I was right! The kids loved it and talked about it off and on for several days afterwards with much laughter. That made it very special. My son told me that it was a lot like Home Alone.Recently, I was able to watch it and... yes, it's like Home alone - with a dog. As an adult, I thought it was just okay, but I'm rating it higher because the kids liked it so much and really, it's about them, ya know?This is good for people that are looking for a holiday film. It's pretty mild, so it would be fine for something for the adults to watch with the kids and everyone enjoy it, it's not too adult or too kid-oriented, so it fits the bill nicely.Worth a watch, but a familiar storyline :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Home Alone with a dog","review":"Just imagine the plot from Home Alone, but with a lovable dog with a painful past playing Macaulay Culkin's part. Yes, we have a couple bumbling burglars, a mysterious neighbor who turns out to be a good person. Now add in poor writing, over-acted parts, and talking dogs, cats, and mice that people can't hear. I wished I couldn't hear them either; the animal voices were no surprises; the French poodle had a fake French accent, the mice had high-pitched voices. The whole movie was predictable, and plodding.Worse yet, there are horrible role models: The father gets a dog from the pound after promising his wife he won't *BUY* a dog, the kids talk back to the parents, don't want to visit grandma on Christmas Eve, and the kids and parents try to sneak out of grandma's house when grandma falls asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"There's Gotta Be Somebody Out There Who Will Take Me Home\\"","review":"Wow, this one may be good intentioned but it's really bad. It's kind of like watching a skit on Saturday Night Live (SNL), you know what I mean, one of those little parodies where everyone is trying their best not to laugh out loud at the absurdity of the storyline. Only in the case of 'The Dog Who Saved Christmas there's absolutely nothing funny to laugh about.Definitely not for adults but maybe something children (5 and under) might enjoy. I hope you don't spend any money on this dog (that's a pun)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Enjoy It","review":"I really wanted to like this movie and it seemed to have stuff that I like. Christmas. Family. A family pet.Unfortunately that was not to be.I didn't care that the premise was already done. As the good king said \\"There is nothing new under the sun\\". What I did care about was that the jokes were not funny - too predictable and *they* were all done a thousand times before in a thousand movies that were better.And because I was bored before the first 15 minutes were up, I never got the connection to the movie, or any of characters that should have had me going \\"awww\\" at the appropriate times - which is all these movies really ask of the audience.So sorry that I didn't like it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dog Who Saved Christmas Review","review":"I enjoyed The Dog Who Saved Christmas very much. It is a great family movie. It holds your attention and is very funny. I would highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This may be THE WORST CHRISTMAS MOVIE EVER!","review":"The writing was terrible, the acting even worse, the production values were cheap and cheesy, and the animal voiceovers were sub-idiotic. This is what I get for letting the wife pick the film for the night, I guess. (She didn't even like it.) The only question I had after the pain was over, aside from wanting the ninety minutes back, was how did such a dead-head family afford that house? The Father didn't act like he could possibly do anything that would put him in that income bracket. Perhaps he earned it the old fashioned way: he inherited it. Yet another argument for family planning."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dog who Saved Christmas??","review":"On many levels this was a crummy movie and just awful. The acting was poor, the story line weak, and not entertaining at all. We thought this would be a cute movie, but even the kids got bored with it and didn't understand this movie. Not worth the bother and not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lousy rip-off of Home Alone","review":"I pre-ordered this movie before it was shown on television. I am so glad that they showed this on tv before my order with Amazon went through because this movie was so lousy that before the movie was even half way through I went to my computer and to Amazon's website and canceled my pre-order. I was not going to pay money for this dribble. I ended up channel surfing back and forth between this movie and other channels because I just couldn't stay with it. The acting is horrible, the lines are cheesey, and the animal voices annoying. And as far as my preview title is concerned regarding a Home Alone rip-off; I like Home Alone. So I am not putting Home Alone down. The only thing this movie has going for it is the very cute dog. However the dogs voice(Mario Lopez) is mind numbing annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do It!!","review":"If you have kids 8 or under, they might like this. They MIGHT like it. Otherwise, this is the corniest, cheesiest, nonfunny comedy I have seen in years. I rented it for a buck, and I feel jipped. We fast forwarded it just to get to the end and say that we watched it. I would hate to see what it cost to produce this movie. I am guessing it was a little more than a home movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tipping Monkey!","review":"We purchased this toy for our 7M old. Like the previous reviews said, it is always on its back from tipping over! Many times the monkey actually moves toward the baby who then grabs it and knocks it over. Great concept but a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this toy!","review":"I bought this for my 9 month old son (preemie adjusted age is 7 months). He just learned how to crawl and I thought this would help him. Either my son is too fast or the toy is too slow. He caught the money everytime and flung it across the floor. Once the monkey is laying on its back it can't move! The toy stayed upright for maybe 15 seconds at a time and then my son either caught it or it ran into something and fell over. Seems like it worked out well for the other reviewers... this was just my experience. One of the only toys in my life that I returned the next day after purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"OOO OOO EEEE AAAH AHHH!","review":"We just got this toy for our son for free at a baby swap meet today. We traded some of his clothes he has outgrown for it. He chose it himself out of the pile of toys there. He is insane for it, and cannot stop laughing. He is APE FOR IT! Has been cracking up laughing all day. He loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waist your money","review":"I thought this would be great for my new crawing baby, but it wouldnt go every time when he tapped it like it was supoessed to do, so he lost interest in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taught my son to crawl","review":"I got this for my son when he was about 5 months old, he loved it from the first day. It taught him to roll over and to crawl. Even when he couldn't chase it, he loved watching our dog chase it. My shepherd seemed to think the monkey was out to get the baby at first and would try to chase it away from him. My son was highly amused by this. I have recommended this toy to all my friends with young babies, and they love it as well. I do agree that the monkey tips over easily, but it doesn't seem to have as many problems on a hardwood floor. On the carpeted areas, I noticed it didn't go as smoothly. Also, when you're done with it, make sure it's turned off. The slightest movement will set it off, and it will make you jump out of bed in the middle of the night wondering what the heck is going on if your cat accidentally walks too close to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for easily frightened children!","review":"I found this in the clearance aisle of a local store and bought it because my 9 month old son loved it in the box and loved the sounds it makes. He likes most toys and even ones that move and sing (unlike my 3 yr old daughter who is frightened if a toy even moves a tiny bit) so I thought he would love it. We got it home and out of the box and I turned it on. The monkey made its cute noises and started moving and my son let out a blood-curdling scream and jumped into my arms trying to get away from the monkey. I'm very disappointed, but we are going to try and get him acclimated to the toy by letting him be around it when it isn't on and maybe he'll enjoy it sometime. OR maybe I'll just be selling it or giving it away very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"top heavy - falls over to easily","review":"I agree with the first reviews - the concept of the monkey is really good but the design unfortunately flawed. Every time my son gets its hands on it it just topples over. So it does not serve its intended function at all. Overall, great concept poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Idea but falls short, literally...","review":"This toy was purchased last Christmas for my 6 mos. old baby. This product has 2 major faults, in addition to its annoying chatter it falls all of the time making it a hassel.

The problem was it broke after two weeks of gentle use. I'm not sure she would have liked it once she was more mobile anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this one!","review":"We were so excited to buy this for our 7 month old daughter who was learning to crawl. She got the monkey quickly and then the monkey would topple over. Not motivating or stimulating enough to keep her attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...don't waste your money","review":"This was a total waste of money. It had such rave reviews I thought it was a must have for my then 9 month old to have to encourage crawling. This thing basically moves a few inches in one direction, turns and moves a few more inches. The only redeeming quality it the cute monkey noises it makes (although some might find those annoying.) It's not very sturdy, and falls over easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a barrel of fun!","review":"My daughter is a little older (21 months), but I just couldn't pass this one up. She absolutely loves this toy. It's rare that we find a toy that the kids play with like they show on the commercials, but this one hit the jackpot!She loves to chase the monkey...it even rolls on thin carpets/playrugs. And the music is soo cute. I only wish I had bought it earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT! Kid loves it","review":"I bought this for my nephew (6 months) and he seems to love it. He keeps staring at it and smiling... simply amazin.."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This was given to my daughter as a birthday gift and even if she was younger than a year old, it still wouldn't be very good. All it did was startle her when it first started up and did nothing but waddle around, stop and turn and go in another direction with the same annoying monkey sound and music. Pretty boring. My daughter was already almost walking so it was too late to assist her in crawling, but it might encourage younger babies to get moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you please stop falling down!!","review":"My daughter who is 9 months old loves this toy, it's me who hates it!!! She loves the music and it moving, but it falls down every single time, that I am the one crawling after it to pick it up! I am now an excellent crawler! My daughter could already crawl when her grandad bought this, but if she couldn't, it would have been no help. If they could figure out the balance on it, it would be a great toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monkey \\"Chase\\"?","review":"This product amused me more than my 8-month old. The music and monkey sounds are funny--however, that's about the only good thing I can say. The monkey moves really slowly and even on wood, doesn't seem to provoke much interest in a \\"chase\\". I am a BIG fan of all things Fisher Price. This, however, was a $15 letdown..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hide your bananas!!!","review":"This is a great toy. I bought it for my newly-crawling 7-month old. At first it scared him witless. He would not go in the room if it was on the floor, but at the end of the first day he would sit in my lap and let me touch it. It giggles and chatters, and if it hits a wall it turns and redirects itself. Soon he would tap it and then scamper back into my lap. It was almost as if he wasn't going to let the monkey get the best of him. For the first week or so he would play with it for HOURS at a time, forsaking all other toys. He even chases it around with a set of squeaky bananas that belong to the dog!!! We haven't had a problem with it tipping over too much, but we have hardwood floors and wide-open spaces. It doesn't really eat batteries too much, which is surprising for a toy of this weight and complexity. I highly recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be \\"Monkey Fall\\"","review":"I bought this for my 8-month old who loves to crawl. She likes the monkey and the noise/music that it makes. The problem is that every time she touches it, it falls over. It spends more time on it's back on the floor than anything else. I gave it one star for the great idea. I cannot believe Fisher-Price would sell a toy that is so obviously flawed. All it needs is a little more stability (4 wheels instead of the three)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF MONEY - VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I THOUGHT THIS TOY WOULD BE PERFECT FOR MY VERY ACTIVE 8 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER. MY LITTLE GIRL LOVES CHASING OUR DOG ALL OVER THE HOUSE SO I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE THE DOG A BREAK AND PURCHASE THIS TOY. RIGHT AWAY SHE LOVED THE NOISES AND MUSIC BUT THE TOY ONLY ROLLED FORWARD A FOOT AND THEN REVERSED ITS DIRECTION FOR ABOUT ANOTHER FOOT. IT DEFINITELY WASN'T A CHALLENGE FOR HER TO CATCH HIM AND ONCE SHE DID SHE JUST KNOCKED HIM ON HIS SIDE AND THE FUN WAS OVER. AT FIRST I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE TOY BUT AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO MAKE IT GO FURTHER THAN A FOOT IN EITHER DIRECTION IT BECAME PAINFULLY CLEAR THIS TOY WAS A TOTAL BUST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scares my baby","review":"My daughter got this at 7 months old. I thought it was absolutly adorable and a great idea. She loved it until it turned directions and ran over her. She didn't get hurt just startled but it is so slow that she is just learning to crawl and catches it and then it runs over her with the wheels and she starts screaming and will have nothing to do with it for a long time. This is a continuos pattern that I have seen with her. She actually hates the toy and is scatred of it because it keeps running over her. I gave it 2 stars thoug because it hasn't hurt her in running her over just scares her. The wheels are made well and don't pinch the baby when it runs over them. I think that is a wonderful thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 months!","review":"My \\"little monkey\\" loved this toy when we first brought it home. She would crawl after it and laugh with delight over it. Unfortunately, she would knock the silly thing over everytime she touched it so we were constantly picking the thing back up again. Well, she loved picking it up by it's arm and now it won't \\"walk\\" anymore! The music stutters and doesn't play like it used to and there is no more movement. My daughter will pick it up and get excited when she hears the music, only to be disappointed when it won't move anymore. This toy stays at the bottom of the toy box now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to move longer","review":"I bought toy for my daughter when she was almost 8 months old and had just started crawling. She was getting bored with all her old \\"stationary\\" toys so I figured get her something she can interact with while she moving around on the floor. Big mistake! The monkey doesnt move far AT ALL and then turns around....where's the chase? It also is only activated when the baby touches it and since it's not very sturdy, usually just falls over and then becomes a chew toy for a minute. I would not recommend this toy for any age, crawling or not (unless your baby likes to throw things, it seems to be durable)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its OK. Falls over and general annoyance","review":"You have to wait till it makes its monkey noise to tap it on the head and get it to walk. By then its been flung around and on its back somewhere with wheels spinning in the air. Also if you have little kids, there are toys laying around. If it hits a toy, it knocks over and your back to my previous point. My 1yr old son does not find it very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting and thought provoking read","review":"The author travels to unlikely western destinantions in search of native cutthroat trout. The difficulty encountered finding pure strains (those unpolluted by stocking) is an eye-opener; there are few places remaining where man's hand has not altered the biology of US streams. The devestating impact of cattle ranching on streams is also explored. You are left with the sad knowledge that many of these populations of wild trout are not far from extinction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, almost Perfect","review":"This is an absolutely beautiful watch, has great timekeeping, and is weighted nicely on your wrist. I traded a Tag New Link Chrono for this watch, and after a year, I'm really glad I did. There are some quirks which should be noted: At the bottom of the dial, it appears as if there is a slight flaw(like a scratch) on it. If you don't wear it for a few days, and the watch needs setting, get a toothpick to set the day(I've been told this so the case isn't scratched), also the crown is VERY hard to pull out. Set the day and date a day before the actual date, and roll the minutes around to the proper date. All this takes about 3 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who was this written for?","review":"As a woman and everyone should know that women make up a large percentage of WWW fans, I can't figure out the intended audience for this book. It had nothing exciting or new in it, my darlin' Arte might as well not have been included, Jim does little more than hang around a railyard buying sodas for a kid...and try to figure out how to get into the villain's hideout. Something the real Jim would have done with no sweat and a lot more panache.This book reads like the author watched maybe one or two first season episodes(By the way, Jim carries his lockpick in his lapel, not his hollow bootheel) and had no idea of its audience or fans.For writers of other novels based on movies or TV shows with fan-followings...DO YOUR RESEARCH!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated photographs!","review":"As a university professor of geology, I received a promo post card raving about the photographs in this book (\\"Probably the best in any book on geology\\" etc.) The reviewers can not have seen a production copy - these photographs are muddy and fuzzy - very disappointing! I feel I have been had!The text is OK, although the author uses terms like \\"geosyncline\\" that most of use discarded years ago because of the changed interpretations that came with the plate tectonics revolution of the 1960s.If you really want coffee-table quality geological photographs, there are a number of text books in physical geology out there that fit the bill (I like Tarbuck and Lutgens, for example) although the prices are double that of this book.

The takes are somewhat loose and free spirited, and like many debut albums of the 70's this one has an echoing, hollow sounding quality to it (best compared, I guess, to Roberta Flack's \\"First Take\\"). Unlike the albums \\"Rhymes and Reasons\\" and \\"Music\\" which have a strong cohesiveness of style, this album has numerous song styles ranging from jazz to country -- all of which are tied together nicely by this hollow sound. The lyrics here are first rate and as memorable as any King has written.

Plus shipping expenses.The Palm operating system is great and the syncing to Outlook and my WORD and Excel files has been reasonably seamless. Occasionally I've had to contact Sony telephone support, maybe 10 times in three years. Overall I'd give Sony technical support a score of 7 with 10 being best.I recommend this unit as a good alternative to buying an all in one phone/pda. Having two units instead of one provides a degree of safety.

I am a \\"twentysomething\\" and I have been reading many books about others in their 20s, quarter-life crisis and such. What turned me off about this book, and what may make others really enjoy this book, is the constant religious and god mentions. I am not a christian so I skipped these parts I was able to get over halfway through the book but then had to put it down and move on to the next.

There is something magical and unique about these performances. The Title song \\"Prisoner of Love\\" which Russ Co-wrote has become a classic american standard recorded by many including Como and Sinatra. Another Columbo collaboration \\"You Call It Madness but I Call it Love\\", again deals with the theme of unrequited love. However, I think the 3 cuts that show the essence of Russ Columbo are \\"Sweet & Lovely\\", \\"Paradise\\", & \\"Auf Weiderseh'n,My Dear\\". In these recordings you will hear traces of Singers that were to come later and were influenced by his style, including Como, Crosby and Jerry Vale. This CD is a must for any Vintage music Fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Crooner","review":"It's difficult to speculate where Russ Columbo would have gone in his career. Many (including my own father) claim that he was copied by Bing Crosby. If you listen to a number of late 1920s solo recordings by Bing, when he was with Paul Whiteman's Rhythm Boys, you may conclude, as I do, that this is not the case. Regardless, there is room for both, and Columbo may have developed into a stronger singer had the tragic event that ended his life not occurred. In a 2-reel short, that I saw him in, Columbo presented a breezy acting style and likeable personality which he probably could have parlayed into a movie career. It's a sad story. Enjoy these wonderful songs evoking the early depression-era 1930s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Latin Magic","review":"Great selections, great sound; hard to believe these weren't original stereo recordings.Buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music from an era gone by....","review":"While on a Desi Arnez binge, I bought this CD not really knowing what to expect. I had read the book on Cugat by his ex-wife, and was curious as to his music. And what music it is. I've had this CD in my car's changer for two weeks now, and I'm listening to it more than the other five CD's combined. The music is superb, the perfect antidote to a long day at work. There's quite a variety of tunes, and the rhythm section has to be heard to be believed. And this is music that's a half century old!

Antarctica is very good, but restates the same themes, plot, characters, and story structure as the Mars books. However, this is not really a bad thing, since it worked so well the first time. And I agree that setting this book on Earth gives a certain immediacy to his social and political themes lacking in the Mars books. I can see this book being useful for a class in nature or ecology writing; not too long, and far better quality science fiction than, say, Ecotopia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old territory","review":"This story covers the same subject matter as the three Mars books Robinson has written. Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well this time. His characters are thin, the plot is very slow to develop, and too much time is spent with characters giving speeches about political correctness and environmental issues. One character literally \\"phones in\\" his part just to give Robinson the excuse to do much of his preaching. Robinson seems obsessed with the idea of co-ops as the ideal living arrangement and they appear here yet again. The resolution of the plot is not convincing. All in all, a pretty dismal book unless you read it for its political message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for a plot","review":"Ok, I'm sorry to say I've given up on this book.

So i am not fully entitled to review it, but, no matter how self-ctitical I can be, I beleive that for someone to put a book down and never pick it up again there must be two guilty parties. So i suppose that the author had something to do with it. This is the second KS Robinson book I tried to read and failed.this, as the mars trilogy before it is a book o great ideas. Great enviromnent, great characters, nut the way they are presented, the style of naration, the whole style of writting seems wrong. very personal oppinion, very biased, but no matter how much I love Robinson's ideas in his books, I cant follow his writting.

As for the rest, thoroughly skippable."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Mars\\"message, brought to earth","review":"Antarctica is a good book. Not great, but good. Readers of the Mars trilogy will, I feel, be disappointed with the repetitive plot and slow storyline. Personally, I feel the biggest problem is with the characterization--the characters remain quite unfinished despite the excrutiatingly long life histories described. But, there are good...no, Great things to be said for the book. First, I must say the description of the landscape is marvelous. Who thought snow & ice could look so good. Secondly, the message is blatant. Robinson's Mars stories had strong (an understatement) environmental themes to them. Great stories, but the trilogy was \\"science fiction.\\" Some (not me, mind you) see this as an excuse to ignore the message. Antarctica, though, is NOT sci-fi. It is here and now--almost. The close proximity in time and space brings the message to the forefront. There is no way to ignore it. Kudos to Robinson on that! Other than that though, ...eh, 's'alright I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unless you are an avid Antarctica buff I don't recommend this one. The main story could have been interesting, but is interrupted with in-depth historical (and other) asides.

The author's Mars Trilogy is by far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, no plot, a lot of descriptions","review":"If you want to know how Antartica is, this book is a must !.

Unfortunately, this turns out to be another story whose focus is on the geology and the environment, instead of a true sci-fi near future story. Though I truly felt as though I were in Antarctica, I did not want to feel this way for 600+ pages. The characters seemed to be secondary compared to the landscape -- and the extended history review of former Antarctic explorers just did not grab me. I wanted this story to wow me, but it just reminded me of Red Mars (the mysterious Asian woman who is leading a group of ferrel explorers who want to get closer to the native livestyle). Don't get me wrong, I'll continue to read Robinson's novels, but maybe geological sci-fi just is not my cup of tea..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political diatribe","review":"The book is a thinly-disguised political/ecological polemic, set slightly in the future so we can see the effects of global warming, pollution, etc. Like historical fiction, this book introduces characters in an effort to engage the reader in following its deeper purpose, but these characters are never really developed and serve just as a device. Descriptions of the land itself and life upon it are magnificent, but the nonstop preaching and the culminating chapter (the author's own \\"to-do\\" list with respect to Antarctica) made it much harder to get through pleasantly - and I AGREE with his political and environmental priorities! The writing at least is excellent, as one might expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless remix of other KSR works, without a plot","review":"What would you would get if you took all the interesting and exciting things out of the Mars Trilogy? You'd get Antarctica, a book with no plot about people who go on hikes and romanticize feral living. Or you'd get the \\"Science In the The Capital\\" trilogy, which is basically the same thing.Kim Stanley Robinson is so frustrating. His Mars Trilogy was so good, so epic, so exactly what I want from hard near-future sci-fi. It was too good, because I keep reading his other works expecting similar genius, and they are all exactly alike, and all terrible in the same ways.After 300 pages I gave up on Antarctica. I am very close to giving up on KSR."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointing effort by the author","review":"This is 2 books, and the first book is ok and the second is unreadable. The first is a story of assorted characters in Antartica in the near future, with lots of geology, weather and exploration history which you should want to read or you should avoid the book altogther. However, it more of a descriptive overview of the area disguised as an novel, and the plot is thin, illogical and filled with subplots that are allowed to wither away without any real development. Then the last third of the book kicks in, and that is the second book. In the guise of various characters speaking, it is a mish-mash of uninteresting political views about assorted environmental topics. Much of it is lioterally in the form of multi-page speeches by the characters, and so isnt even arguably hidden away in an interesting plot line. At that point my close reading accelerated into skim-overdrive and the book became, overall, a failed effort not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"affordable quality, quick installation","review":"I installed a pair of these on my 1995 Nissan Quest GXE. The entire process took me 90 minutes. These are quite heavy-duty shocks and dramatically improved both the ride and the handling of my Quest. No special tools required, but using an impact wrench will speed the installation, which consists of removing the rear wheels, removing two nuts, pulling the old shock off, pressing the new one in place, and replacing the washer and nut. Inexpensive, rapid straightforward installation, and huge improvement to the vehicle. Well worth the low cost and investment of 90 minutes.

It really was satisfying to rack up a 30-hit combo while destroying five or six foot soldiers all at once, just like the old-school TMNT arcade games. And the cel-shaded graphics look awesome.Unfortunately, killing an endless stream of soldiers and robots (who rarely vary) gets old really fast, and the stages are pretty boring despite the colorful graphics. One stage takes place on a subway platform, and I thought trains would be roaring by every now and then, but they don't.As others have mentioned, the sound bites really are annoying, especially Mike's (Eat feet! Eat feet! Eat feet! Eat feet! ad nauseum).The challenge is quite uneven - the stages are incredibly easy, but you'll waste all your lives when you get to the final boss.

It's really old-school in the beat em up sense (but its in 3d). Good cell shading, and gameplay, easy to get nasty against large groups of enemies. Upgrade turtles and unlock new attacks as you complete story mode (Including the four player strength Gembu Turtle Power move which is supposed to vary with different power ups). Vs mode didn't seem to be very good, but 2 player story mode more than makes up for it. The only real letdown, is that they seemed to have made a new Ninja Turtles cartoon, and they based this game off of that. This means annoying repetitve battle speech and wave goodbye to the classic theme music. Worth the buy if your a fan of Turtles in time, and prolly if your a new school turtle fan as well...

The voice samples when attacking are plain annoying, with like 5 saying for each turtle. With the optical technology of the current batch of consoles, this is unforgivable!Also, it's a two player game only, which is lame.

The beat and the guitar of the songs are so much more prominent than the lyrics that it is difficult to understand what most of the singers are saying, and when you do, the lyrics are so vague that it's still not easy to tell that the music is Christian.You might as well just listen to secular music if you are going to buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"It does not taste anything like/close to a real biryani, the rice is not authentic basmati,so are the flavors. the artificial flavors and colors really disturb the palette.

In the vein of \\"Minute Mysteries\\", the stories of the Black Widowers combines interesting character development as the stories conglomerate. Set in the atmosphere of a social gathering of professional gentlemen of varied fields, the story lines unfold as the members of \\"The Black Widowers\\" grill the guest of the month in unraveling a mystery they can attempt to solve. Never of earth shattering import, the mysteries are intriguing and challenging. They are also solvable by anyone with a modicum of knowledge on any number of subjects. Truly a treat you can give yourself, a few short minutes at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT TITLE...","review":"GREAT TITLE...for a movie about dead pirates.

This movie is about that doctor. Then they find a hidden room which contained the actual snuff films. The director watches the film. Soon people start to die, but it is not a who-dun-it.

Next time I guess I will have to spend 100.00 each or more to get the quality that I expect.If I would of know that this was chinese grade I would of just bought a chinese product. No backing on the case. I would not hang this on the wall with nuts and bolts..I guess this product was designed for light items like beads and fly fishing items.

These pieces are probably no more then 1/8 of an inch long and wide. I was sure with regular use, more would break. After giving the rest of the product an inspection I decided it really was no better for the price than what I'd already seen and sent it back. Amazon gave me a full refund and I'll try something else.

I can't believe they can sell it for $40.00 with a straight face.The shell is made of a thin hard plastic which feels like it would crack and guess what , it did. Some of the plastic in the back was cracked when it arrived.The drawers were okay (at best) but you'll have to come up with some more dinero if you want dividers for your drawers.

This is nothing but a hidden cost and I find it deceitful."},{"rating":"1","title":"For lightwieght items only - poor construction","review":"Bought three sets of these because they were the right size for my workbench and the red front looked cool. Unfortunately, these bins just don't hold up in a garage when you fill the drawers with steel nuts, bolts and washers. As the collective weight of all the items in the cabinet goes up, the storage bin literally pulls apart. That cool-looking red front is only press fitted onto the gray backing. Not molded onto it, not glued onto it, not even snapped onto it. As the weight of the parts increases, the gray shelving warps in such a manner that the red front literally pulls away from the gray section. Only happens on the units that I store metal parts. In the unit I store lightweight items like wire nuts, zip ties, and very small screws, the bin is OK. If your needs call for something that will hold drawers full of bolts, screws, washers, etc., avoid this parts bin and spend the extra money on steel storage bins.

It gives you a lot of drawers for organizing all those little items lying around in drawers. I would like the drawers themselves to be longer, as it doesn't really accommodate tubes of things, such as sunscreen, hair gel, etc.My biggest problem with this product is that the shelves do not sit very snugly in the frame. They slide out if the case is tipped even a little bit forward. When pulling them open, they come out completely too easily. The case itself is very lightweight. The overall feeling of the product is flimsy, with drawers half open or falling out and the case in danger of falling over.This is a good, inexpensive option if you have a lot of little items to keep sorted and some way to secure the case and drawers."},{"rating":"2","title":"organized!","review":"The material feels durable and it holds all those screws, nails, washers, and any other random small objects you want to organize. i do wish it was slightly deeper but I filled up all the slots anyway. will be purchasing another!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made poor design","review":"Mine arrived with two of the small plastic drawer stop tabs broken off - these tabs keep the drawers from being pushed too far into the cabinet when closed.

With my eyes closed, I opened one at random, then glanced at the page. I immediately became fascinated. Doubted it would happen again -- after all, who really wants to know about the Crimean War? So I tried the random choice. And again I was fascinated. One more try? And again, fascination. I took all eight volumes home and read them pretty much straight through. Why?

Nonsense of all kinds is attacked; the religious variety, the esoteric, the leftist, the feminist... If you like a good polemic, this is a good place for it.The book should be required reading, but unfortunately the usual effect of such sermons is preaching to the choir. No serious afficionado of astrology will give up on the stars and their impact on us, no hyperfeminist will drop the idea that gravity and DNA are just artifacts of male chauvinism, no cultural relativist will accept stricter concepts of truth, no believer in transsubstantiation will accept the relevance of scientific reasoning, even if they could be co-erced to read this book.Reason does not appeal to un-reason.My favorite 'take away' from the book is the story of the superstitious pigeon in the pattern-less Skinner box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I hate to say it, but after reading The Selfish Gene, this book was a disappointment.Dawkins can be heavy handed at times, and Unweaving the Rainbow really felt more like a personal rant than a well-researched piece of writing. Even for me, someone who agrees with Dawkins at every level, it was too much to stomach at times.To Dawkins credit, there are some interesting chapters in Unweaving the Rainbow about light, sound, and, of course, genes and evolution. However, for me it was not worth wading through the constant criticism of those who condemn science to get to 'the good stuff'.I strongly recommend The Selfish Gene to anyone who has not read it, but I can't recommend Unweaving the Rainbow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Redundancy","review":"Ever since The Selfish Gene, Dawkins has continued to repeat himself over and over again. While The Blind Watchmaker contained some refreshing \\"newness,\\" his latest books (River out of Eden, Climbing Mount Improbable, Unweaving the Rainbow) have been so completely boring they make you want to vomit. Dawkins is a good writer, but he can't seem to come do much more than mix up old ideas. He's turned Darwinism into a religion and it's getting lame.Skip this book. Skip all his books. Let him wallow in his world that he's made for himself. These books have nothing to do with science, but with a man who has set out to prove Darwinism. It's pseudoscientific, it's boring, and it's sad.Save the money and buy Steven Jay Gould's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Shredder","review":"Terrible disappointment. Mr. Dawkins begins the book with chip on his shoulder regarding the dumbing down of science to make it more accessible to the lay person. He then proceeds to dish out watered down, unorganized bits of fact and fancy riddled with \\"witty\\" observations and speculations that more often than not are left hanging in mid air.It was akin to being cornered by your crazy uncle at a holiday gathering and being forced to bear testimony to the latest developments of his \\"theories\\".I rarely if ever put down a book with such distaste, but after being able to digest less and less of each chapter, I was forced to discard it at Chapter 6. Maybe there's a silver lining to the cloud behind this rainbow, but I doubt it's worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete let-down","review":"Dawkins fans like me will be horrified by this book. Roughly speaking , it could be sub-titled 'Why Science isn't boring' but, unlike the thrilling romp of 'The Selfish Gene' or the interest of 'The Blind Watchmaker', here Dawkins bangs wearily on, often on his own hobby horses or things he evidently knows little about.He hectors us about watching the X-Files, he has a predictable go at Stephan Jay Gould, he repeats earlier work almost verbatim. His previous books demonstrated brilliantly how science can be rivetting, enlightening, enthralling and elegant. This is very sad, a little like watching a once-great dancer try his old stunts after drinking to excess. The little flashes of brilliance simply serve to remind you of what has gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"E-book is riddled with typos","review":"Sadly this great writer's work is marred by a sloppy e-version filled with stupid typos. The problem is all too common, and until publishers realize that e-books cost real money and deserve as much attention as the dead-tree versions they so desperately cling to, critics must downgrade books with substandard e-transfers. Apologies to Richard Dawkins, but attention must be paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science or Magic?","review":"Richard Dawkins has the rare gift of turning science talk into poetry. While boasting a wide range of scientific knowledge, he inspires the reader into wonderment at how discoverable the universe just is.

You might be surprised at how discoverable most things are with a little bit of scientific scrutiny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science That Has All the Magic We Need","review":"Like a real sorcerer's spprentice, Richard Dawkins mops away the mindless cobwebs of pseudo-sciences such as parapsychology, astrology, and assorted other pop-culture mumbo-jumbo, so that the reader can see the authentically awe-inspiring wonders of the natural universe. Not only that, but he does so in some of the most beautiful prose (fiction or non-fiction) that I have read recently. His science is pure poetry; I felt invigorated after reading it. A must read for anyone who believes truth is beauty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scatter brain ranting at it finest","review":"I honestly admit I did not finish this book.

In this book Dawkins ironically shows that we are mind machines - not blind machines. Mind machines are created in the image of the Mindful creator. Makes sense really. We created the idea of blind machines and blind Watchmakers and projected that deterministic image onto nature. A statistically harmonious, lawful universe would be a dead Universe; but the Universe is not dead because we are not dead - as Dawkins ironically shows in this book. Bundles of atoms writing poetry about mathematical arcs? Well Dawkins might be right in a certain sense - Dawkins himself is totally blind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Poor quality copies of obsolete gov't manuals.

This is a first Thoene book for me and I will most certainly read more of them. The book so vividly portrays the attitudes toward Christ during his ministry from many different vantage points, from Pharisee to Sadducee to leper to Gentile. It is told through the lives of main characters whose lives have been influenced then changed by the ministry of Christ. It is so very easy to see oneself in each and every one of these characters and draw parallels to your own relationship with Christ today. Very thought provoking and not one to just whip through. A great book for a Christian. Non Christian may or may not like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is GREAT! Kindle version not so much....","review":"I love the book as I have enjoyed the entire A.D.

The book presents information about typical industries that can found near railroads. Details of the operations, procedures, buildings and other structures used by these industries are included. Even though this book is a very good source of information about trackside industries, it does not contain information on how models of these industries can actually be constructed.

I bought it at first for just one number, \\"What a Difference a Day Made\\" from 1935, with beautiful playing from the band and a blase vocal from Ivor Moreton, the band's pianist. It is probably the best song on the CD. Other interesting tunes on this CD are the vocal \\"That's the Way I Like to Hear You Talk\\" which sounds to me like the tune from the American song \\"Pop Goes Your Heart\\", and \\"Where did Robinson Crusoe go with Friday on Saturday Night?\\" Other covers of pop American tunes include La Cucaracha, Lullaby of Broadway, Maple Leaf Rag, King Porter Stomp, and Heigh-Ho from Disney's Snow White.

Knowing that the transfer roller assembly and the four toner cartridges combined would cost twice of a new printer, I am likely to use this for as long as the transfer-roller assembly holds up, then I am likely to just replace the printer.It's sad that color laser manufacturer has taken on the 'sell them the razor and they will come back to buy the blades' business model, as the inkjet manufacturers have done about a decade ago, but I really can't justify spending twice the money just to 'save the environment'.Con: No stochastic screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay printer-- two year review","review":"This printer does fine with black and white printing and is relatively fast and quiet. I am not at all impressed with the color printing and have had streaky lines on my prints many, many times. I already have a Brother black and white, so I really bought this for the color printing. On the upside, the toner lasts a really long time in both of these Brother laser printers. Also, a new problem has developed where the printer will stop working if you put too much paper in the tray. The amount of paper that causes it to stop is really quite small-- maybe a 100 pages. Not sure why this is happening, but it is very annoying.

No matter how I tweaked it, it still remained a blue tree. Researched the solution on their website and it said \\"color of the printout may not match what is on your monitor.\\" My old HP Color Laserjet 3550 hit it right on the nose.

Her inadequate, self-flattering account recalls anecdotes I hear from other English teachers.

The book comes has a CD with an electronic test, but that has just as many mistakes as the book.

Unfortunately, it's just too small for steaming fish: while the diameter of the whole thing is 9.2'', the usable part is only 7'' in diameter.

I was glad to read Theo's sister's response to Charity chastising her for not staying at home after she has the baby.

The fiddle and claw hammer banjo are priceless. the guitar and mandolin are distinctive to their sound. Even the low-fidelity nature of the recordings lends to the timber of this album giving the instrumental breaks and vocals a unique character.

The imagery is nice, the through-her-eyes perspective is interesting, but I kept wanting to smack this girl upside the head and tell her to stand up for herself already. I even tried flipping forward through it and found no real action to keep me interested.If you're looking for suspense, intrigue, and intense, detailed descriptions, and you don't mind waiting 'til maybe even the end of the book for explanations of what's going on, this might be the book for you.

She goes through a mirror to a medieval society where mirrors are used for magical purposes. She goes through various intrigues where she doesn't know who to trust.

Revolting","review":"Heavy-handed vocabulary, women characters you can tell were written by a man (as each of them seem to fall susinctly into stereotypes without any variation at all - the dreamer/romatic, the mannish tomboy, the wanton hussy, the complacent waif), a main charcter dumb enough to make you want to beat your own head in, and a plot slower than molasses - with none of the richness to keep it engaging. The cliffhanger? Not enough to persuade me to buy the next book. Frankly, I can say that I only finished this one as I made the mistake of paying money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audible, Why????","review":"The joy I felt when I found out that Audible had Finally put The Mirror of Her Dreams, was squelched when I saw that Scott Brick was the Narrator. I put up with Mr. Brick on Clive Cussler books. But Donaldson? No. This story deserves more than Mr. Brick's detached, almost fatalistic, style of narration. Don't spoil this story for yourself by listening to this. Read it. Your imagination will do much better than Mr. Brick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Disapointer!!","review":"OMG!! I love this book!! Must read!! The Story,plot,chracters,etc are sooooo out there its just a great story to read.I have to admit that I actually have an audiobook when i read/listen to the book and i wasn't too thrilled reading it becasue the genre i usually read are like horro, vampires, werewolfs,etc. I only read it becasue I was bored, I didn't have anything new to read, and I wasnted to try something new. Im sooooooooo glad I did it!!! When I read it I (almost)cried, I was angery,I was happy,etc. I was very emotional toward the story and the characters and thats when I knew that I was reading a very good book. When ur fustrated that the main chracter is sooo blind to her detined love and u just want to shout out \\" Ur in love with.......!!\\" Thats when u realized thats a terrfic book.I was kinda mad that you have to read the second book to know what happens but I'll gurantee that u wont be dispointed. Please buy and read the book!!! ^.^"},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish it","review":"One of the few books that I couldn't will myself to finish. I waited and waited for something interesting to happen, but it became apparent the author was just setting up for a sequel. At that point I just started skipping long useless passages and concentrated on the dialogue. But the characters are so flat that their conversations were simple back-and-forth affairs that barely register. And finally, the ludicrous attempted seduction of the female protagonist by the bad guy (how stupid is she??) is such a blatant attempt to titillate the young male adolescent audience that it's insulting. Pure hackwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"I read this book back in 1989 and loved it then and still love it now.

I finished first and was overwhelmed with disappointment that the story had ended! Donaldson concludes the book right in the middle of the story; he finishes the saga in the next volume, A Man Rides Through. I immediately bought the hardcover version of A Man Rides Through, and the two books together are perhaps the best story I have ever read. It is a fantasy saga with an amazing original concept that is complex but extremely readable. Recently, I was thrilled to find a used hardcover version of the first book via amazon, so now I have a matching set. I'm a huge Stephen King fan as well, but on this on occasion, Donaldson managed to outshine even King's brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An avid reader rates Mordant's Need an all-time favorite!","review":"I refer to this book as Mordant's Need rather than The Mirror of Her Dreams because the latter absolutely must be read with A Man Rides Through--in actuality, they are one book, one story, and NO ONE could read Book 1 without continuing on to Book 2.In Mordant's Need, Stephen Donaldson weaves an amazing tale of another world, one which is connected to our own in an incredible way. The scope of Donaldson's imagination is without parallel, as he uses an ordinary, inanimate object from our world--a mirror--as an instrument of magic and mystery in Mordant. This complex tale is related in a superb fashion which crescendos to the most masterful conclusion I have ever read. Regardless of the genre you generally enjoy reading, you will walk away from this book with feelings of elation and satisfaction never before produced by a work of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Well ......","review":"Thanks to the USPO my package mailed June 18 arrived July 9.

Robert Anton Wilson always backs up what he says and makes numerous references about many people who have inspired him.

It's the story of a family who adopts a dog, and then takes him to the pound because the parents don't like his normal puppy behavior. He steals food, howls when put outside in a pen, slobbers and scratches, and chews slippers -- just like most puppies. Not one word is mentioned about trying to train the dog. The parents just reach the limit of their tolerance and take him to the pound. THIS IS NOT AN OPTION! A dog is a lifetime commitment, all puppies misbehave, and every dog needs obedience training to become a well-adjusted and beloved member of the family. Shame on writer Steven Kroll and publisher Marshall Cavendish! What could you have been thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Call the SPCA!","review":"In Kroll's biography we are informed that he does not own a dog. This is a good thing since the author obviously thinks that dogs are disposable. When the cute little puppy Kroll's picture book family brings home grows up to be an large, untrained dog the parents bring it back to the pound and return with yet another dog. The children and the dogs aren't happy, but the parents are firm that one dog can be easily replaced with another and the only thing that matters is that the dog not be underfoot. Luckily in Kroll's fantasy world the two abused dogs find their original owners. Unfortunately in the real world they would have both been euthanized.

The only thing that's actually bad about it is some of the acting and the music. James Horner is an excellent compuser, but what the h*ll was he thinking when he wrote this score? It's like some sort of Jamiacan music with a saxaphone and synthesized drum beats. Anyway, it's got some great lines and action scenes.

At times I wonder if this movie actually had a script because some things are so dumb (like when the cops just leave Schwarzenegger's girlfriend alone in a big artilery wharehouse when they take him to jail) it boggles the mind that some one could actually write this.

'Red Sonja' was a backwards step, 'Raw Deal' was forgettable and dull, and between them came 'Commando', a live-action comic strip. It wasn't until 'Predator' that his future was assured. 'Commando' is an extremely enjoyable, very silly action film in the mould of 'The A-Team', but with more violence. Anybody who remembers the old arcade game 'Operation Wolf' (the one with the Uzi on the cabinet) will know this film. It's precisely the kind of thing that kids love - Arnold Schwarzenegger mowing down crowds of the same group of extras with a big machine-gun, essentially - done with a tongue so firmly rammed into its cheek that it's very hard to be offended. Action films nowadays are much more wholesome, and 'Commando' belongs firmly in another era, but it's still good fun, especially if you're slightly drunk and / or with a group of friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll be back, Bennett.","review":"Just how many times did they use that same clip of Arnie side swiping that yellow porsche?

But even then I wouldn't have been silly enough as to interrupt an account of the political troubles of the late Republic with the explanation that Brute in \\"Et tu, Brute?\\" is in the vocative case. Is this history? Shakespearean criticism? Linguistics?The chief lesson I learned from this book is to beware of Oxford U.P. I have bought hundreds, maybe thousands, of books published by OUP. I have been saddened to see Oxford lower its standards on paper and binding. The Oxford Latin Dictionary is one of the few books I've bought lately from OUP that is actually stitched.

I was disappointed Shirley is hardly shown in this movie at all.This movie was one of Shirley's first feature length films-- and it focuses more on the adults than, Shirley's cute dancing and precious nature- despite the fact it has one of Shirley's most well-known scenes \\"Baby Take A Bow\\" in that classic baby-doll poka dot dress. And once again you see Shirley's on screen dad Dunn(Baby Take A Bow).Since Shirley is rarely seen one can hardly call it a \\"Shirley\\" movie- not to mention the storyline is cheesy and over-dramatized.

Go and buy a real Shirley Temple movie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stepin Fetchit Show???","review":"As other reviewers have noted, Shirley Temple appears in only a few scenes. The rest of the movie represents one of the worst productions of this era. The appearance of Fetchit gives us a peek at how bad racial stereotypes were in the 1930s--a foul, slanderous, and contemptuous image that shouldn't be shown to impressionable children.If you want to see Temple's best, then go out and buy \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\", \\"Curly Top\\", or \\"The Littlest Rebel\\" and you'll understand why this little girl captured the hearts of the nation.

I toyed around with a few other pairs of headphones; all of them broke after heavy use. Finally I decided to buy these again. They are very durable and have fairly good sound quality for the price. They have good highs and deep lows and wearing these you can hear the difference between FLAC and MP3. You obviously get better sound quality from more expensive pairs, but I've learned that all headphones break eventually and these are a good balance of price and quality. My only qualm with these is that they are a little small, so after wearing them for a long time your ears start to hurt. I just take them off for ten or fifteen minutes and I'm fine.

I use this type of grater for hard cheese like Parmesan. Some of the more expensive Parmesan cheeses can be as hard as wood.The first problem I encountered with this grater is that there is a lip inside the hopper that the cheese is forced against by the rotation of the cutting blade. A hard cheese will hang up on this lip, and you will end up squeezing the handle very hard without grating any cheese. This problem is relatively easy to solve with a file.After I removed the lip with a file, I ran into the second problem. This grater powders the cheese. It cuts really slowly.Over all, I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"This cheese grater is the biggest piece of junk I've ever purchased.

In addition to the numerous grammatical, punctuation and spelling errors throughout this text, it also contains some pretty glaring factual errors: for example, it says Grand Bahama Island is \\"aproximately 75-80 miles long from the west end to the east end (depending on who you ask). The widest part is the center portion which is about 4 miles from north to south.\\"Well, the island is more like 96 miles long, and it is 17 miles wide at its broadest point. That's a pretty big discrepancy. It's also a flimsy, thin paperback. Given its $25 pricetag, I didn't think it was worth the money.

The cruises companies have a history of dumping (and getting caught).People who cruise, know these things. The revelations have been in numerous news reports.

Horror of horrors, the cruise ship industry is out to make money!!! Shocking facts such as these as well as those that pay for premium suites get extra benefits and perks (shocking) can all be learned from this book. The author did a wonderful job of investigative research by basing most of his facts by talking to a disgruntled waiter over dinner. Thirty cruises is not what I would call extensive experience in the cruise ship industry. One cruise ship had a problem with its' air conditioner so the author assumes that ALL cruise ships have a problem with air conditioning (or they just turn it off to save money).

Well...I was about maybe 2-3 hours into figuring it out the puzzle by twisting the rope in and through the ring and over the peg...etc...etc. Then suddenly the unthinkable happened...which seemed like a solution appeared to be more like an engineering mistake in terms of the puzzle falling apart.

My 4-year old daughter has watched it many times, role-plays the leads with her dolls, and has asked many questions about the plot which has led to some interesting discussions.The Swan Princess III, on the other hand, is dreadful. It is actually painful for me to watch. One character, Rogers, who is otherwise rather dignified in the other movies, becomes a love-struck idiot in this one--it's a cringeable performance, especially since the object of his affection, Zelda, is so morally bankrupt.Therefore, the while I definitely recommend the original Swan Princess, don't waste your money on the third installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once upon a time","review":"I am sure that Garson Kanin's book about Broadway musicals was pretty snappy in its day- I am imagining sometime in the 50's and 60's.

At around $2-3, these headphones were well worth the purchase and gave better sound than I was even expecting. My only problem had to do with sizing. I suppose my ears are too small or something, because they were always sore after a little while with these in. Furthermore, I couldn't get them to stay in my ears while running.

The sound quality is excellent and it is comfortable enough for me to wear for hours at a time.The only downside might be that the material running along the cord feels like it may rip off easily, but it's been fine and I've used multiple pairs for six months to a year each (only reason I replaced them was because of my stupidity).

Yes, it was nice to have so many of the questions, left over from the first book, answered but this book ruined the characters for me.My review of it has nothing against Divakaruni as a writer, she is extremely talented and gifted but I hate where the story ended up.

However, The Vine of Desire simply does not compare to Sister of My Heart. My main complaint is that Divakaruni has taken the utterly loveable and pure characters of Anju and Sudha, and used what I consider gimmicky writing to tell the continuation of their story (among the gimmicks are letters, Anju's essays, baby Dayita's thoughts, and \\"what I said\\" and \\"what I didn't say\\" chapters). The book felt very unnatural to me; the forced styles put too much in the way of the reader and the characters. Reading it reminded me of high school writing assignments where doing something \\"original\\" (like writing a screenplay or poem instead of the assigned essay) was considered \\"cool\\". In The Vine of Desire, however, Divakaruni just couldn't pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I've read about four of Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's books and I have to say this was not an engaging read.

The man had hardly any redeeming qualities like most of the author's Indian male characters so I couldn't understand why Sudha or Anju cared about him either. It read like a silly 3rd rate Bollywood drama begging to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"If you have read My Sister, My Heart and loved it as I did, you will want to read this sequel.

Here he brings us the amazing life of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, the true author of the Shakespeare works, in an historical mystery novel created with stunning clarity and seemingly effortless intensity. The pages keep turning by themselves as we read on and on, to keep pace with this important story. If you're looking for a deeply pleasurable way to learn about Edward de Vere, it's difficult to think of a better place to begin than right here.

This book is perfect for Christians wanting to read something that they already believe. Welch is clearly intelligent within this specific framework, but for someone who isn't already a Christian, well versed in the jargon and dogma, this book would barely make sense.Despite attempts at appearing compassionate and empathetic, the book still comes across as typically \\"holier-than-thou\\". It is more a book on \\"Addiction Theology\\" (that is, what does the bible say about addiction if we interpret with that in mind), but does not offer much real day to day help for a struggling addict.Although this book calls it \\"sub-biblical\\", I think addicts would be better served joining a 12 step group and going from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed me.","review":"There is so much to say of the world today of idol worshiping.

We've been going out to Montana and Wyoming for summer vacations every year for the past 11 years. I knew that this movie would attract my attention, but had no idea that my husband and two sons would actually like it. This is a great movie, all the qualities of Nora Roberts love stories combined with beautiful scenery. Again this movie is like my others where it does not lag or stall out in the middle.

It was unfortunate they were left out of the TV version. They kept the ending from feeling like such a hat trick and added depth to the characters and story. Since they are right where they belong in the DVD it gets a 5 instead of the 4 that the televised movie would have received.My only complaint is that I would have cast the two main characters a bit differently. As much as I enjoy John Corbett, he is a bit old for Ben. Willa is part American Indian and the only mention of it is in one of the deleted scenes mentioned above.

So, make sure you add all of the little buildings especially, the radio tower. By adding the radio tower, a little airplane and hot air balloon will appear.

So the idea now is, just to keep it running, I need to go to my local Apple store and buy a \\"protection\\" package for $ 400 (which is about 30 % of the product !!). Can you imagine if we had to do that when we buy a car ? And Apple is trying to convince us that it is cutting edge, user-friendly, and much better than Microsoft. I don't buy it. Apple is good at design and marketing. The hardware and software is iffy at best. I left my Macbook today with about 60 % battery. I returned and it had 0 % battery left. Where did that power go ??? The battery issue continues to plague Apple. I will never, ever buy an Apple product. I continue to get them as gifts. I got the MacBook.

There is atleast one error in every game i've looked at. I don't know if the errors exist in the original or if the problem was the conversion to algebraic, but it's really a problem.You've almost got to get the games from the internet just to follow the book, since the score in the book is so full of errors.

It's the (somewhat to me) rudiments of positional play, according to him (and being a world-class player - one of the best in the world at the time! - it counts for something). The games are presented with variations (and naturally, before the invention of the modern chess playing PC, some errors, though we can hardly fault him for this), no more, no less, with such well-known players as Portisch, Korchnoi, Spassky, ad infinitum.There are some typos, sadly, but one shouldn't have too many problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not Very Helpful","review":"It is true that Sammy was one of the strongest chess players of the western hemisphere for many, many years, but it is not true that this book has a very helpful format.The book relies too much on sparsely annotated games.

The stories are fantasy and I think that everyone who reads them should be mature enough to know that. J.K. Rowling doesn't talk about casting spells on others for the fun of it or to make others feel bad about themselves. It is part of an interesting story that leads to a great and meaningful ending. None of you are J.K. Rowling so I do not think you should judge her by saying what you think she meant by some portions of her books.

It had a very good story line. I had never seen Timberlake act before and he's not bad at acting. I've always like Jeff Bridges. This is mainly about a father (who is a has been country song writer and singer)and a son who is not very happy with his dad. They are stick together on a road trip to go see Jeff's wife and the kid's mother who may be dying. They have not been close and this trip does not help them but it is a good story. One good thing that the movie produced was Jeff falling for a much younger woman who has a very young son that Jeff falls for. The mother breaks up with Jeff but because of his love for her and the child he cleans up his act. He quits drinking. Starts writting songs again and wins a large prize (I think $100,000). He runs into this young woman on a trip and gives her all his money for the kid when he grows up and for his education.

The sticky residue comes off without effort. It does not irritate my skin. Uni-Solve is appropriate for anyone who routinely uses tape or band-aids.

Back then, I loved the book but thought it was a bit male-bashing. Now, I don't think the male characters are stereotypes at all but real representations of what intense, intelligent men are like. Similarly, the female characters remind me of how far women have come. I wish Marge Piercy would write a 90s novel about such fascinating women and their ongoing struggles to have it all.

Well, it just snagged again after a month's use, and again, the left headphone died.It's finally occurred to me (slow learner, here) that MOST people will probably snag their headphones at least as often as I do, so most people will not get more than a few months use out of these.

As it is, you watch and listen to detectives endlessly sorting through multiple videos of a diamond robbery, to find out if the obvious (to me) suspect really is responsible for what happened. I can't say it's an awful movie, but it's one of those that from about the 10th minute on, I'm regretting having started it, since now I have the choice of watching something else and wondering if maybe some last minute twist would have made it worthwhile, or sticking with it and finding out I've wasted more time. Turns out to be the latter case. There were no reviews warning me not to waste my time. Now there is one for you. Don't bother.

This book provides no answers at all to the problems surrounding strategic airport planning. The forecasting is weak and goes nowhere, the design parts have been done elsewhere and better than this book, the case studies are an exercise in adhocracy. The first rule in airport planning is not to use airport systems in developing countries as examples for they're built with no attention whatsoever to what is appropriate or what is needed. For a book that was supposed to help in planning airports, the authors have not planned this book out well at all, there is no fluidity whatsoever.

If you really want to save money just use some common sense and self-control and DO NOT waste good money on this book. I absolutely refuse to put together a list of what my children will need in terms of clothing for the next 100 years, complete with measurements of sizes and then show up at yard sales at 6am every Saturday in the summer.

Building Bionicles helps builds mechanical intuition as children experience the working of gears and joints. And the books give their readers a sense of legend, heroism, and mystery, which they can then apply to imaginative play or even their own writing. To an adult picking them up at random, the books present a seemingly impenetrable confusion of names and terms, but children readily master this new world.There is a lot of talk about what kinds of books we need to motivate boys to become fluent readers.

It was well-written. Each character has a very distinct personality of its own. [And surely one of them will fit a child's dream hero.] There are balanced mix of excitement, adventure, humor, and values. This book revealed a few facts that was unknown in the previous books, and also provided a glimpse into the upcoming storyline of Metru Nui. Sort of the way the Star Wars episodes were introduced.This whole Bionicle saga can become one of a child's great inspirations in his life. The core value of the whole story -Unity-Duty-Destiny- is very useful in parenting and raising a child.We live inThailand, a seemingly so far away place on earth, but still my son got so obsessed with this theme of Lego.

So many locals get compared to Alice In Chains, Tool and The Cherry Popin' Daddies, and rightfully so - so many locals emulate the style of these greats in hopes of capturing the last 15 minutes of their twylight in stardum. Jolly Mon sets their own rules capturing a melodic, yet hard hitting groove that one may become lost in. The music of \\"Nobody Knows...\\" is mostly of the \\"Acid Rock\\" denomonation which draws long, spacy melodies along side tightly compressed base riffs and vocals so in key that it is as if the voice is just another instrument.

Whereas the band does take on a far more melodic rhythm than on their previous albums, and making similarities between them and the numerous melodic hardcore acts of the mid-90s (Good Riddance, Kid Dynamite, think Jade Tree) wouldn't be wrong, I don't feel that they have completely lost their edge.

This Is Our Revenge doesn't retain a lot of the aggressive aspects of Heart Means Everything but theirs very little to complain about here. It's catchy, heartfelt, and actually has something positive to say. Given the current state of hardcore, this is such a breath of fresh air. There is defintely a bit of a Comeback Kid feel to this album, but some of the other comparisons from Victory are pretty off base (go figure). The only reason it says this album is for fans of Thrice on the sticker is becuase this album dropped on the same day as Vheissu and theres really nothing similar to Rise Against. If you enjoy the likes of Comeback Kid and Bane, then this record is for you. Highlight tracks include \\"Elevens,\\" \\"Closets,\\" \\"You Always Said,\\" and \\"In A Bottle\\" which has an undeniable Boysetsfire feel to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"upsetting","review":"well considering how incredibly awesome with honor used to be this album made me want to cry. pretty much all that im reading on these reviews is excuses. they moved to victory and changed their sound to be more mainstream, i even saw them on a commercial with atreyu, man that pissed me off. buy this album if you want to sit around and listen to some crappy forced guy singing in a watered down version of a hardcore band. if you want to listen to some good hardcore get their first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragonfly Horse","review":"The dragonfly horse was purchased as a gift for my granddaughter.

They love it. It is a great toy conceptually, but there is a major quality/safety problem. All of those characters that you see in the picture are stickers, instead of painted on. They are stickers like you would find at a dollar store. Not special, extra sticky stickers, just plain, cheap stickers. In a word, cheap. My little boy played with this toy for 10 mins before I found a sticker on the couch. These stickers are just the right size for blocking the windpipe of the child for whom this product claims to be appropriate. I had considered trying to glue the stickers or find a way to make them permanent, but there is no way to do that without making the toy toxic to teethers. I am very disappointed in this product. I should have just bought the parents brand one at Target. It's not as neat, but at least they could play with it.

But she didn't seem able to to catch her breath. SO I checked her airway and sure enough there was something in there. I was able to get it out- PRAISE GOD!

I have a 2 year old who loves the wooden activity cubes; though she loves Seasame street I would purchase a differnt brand. There are 3 major fall backs. (1) the decals are stickers that come off so easily they just fall off. (2) the top easily comes off if my 2 year tries to lift it, which became a problem because the top is a heavy piece if it were to fall on her foot.

Nowhere in any of the commercials and nowhere in any of the materials I received from the Circuit City rep did it mention that an existing PC network was required to allow MSNTV2 to utilize broadband/DSL. As a standalone, MSNTV2 is not compatible for broadband. This was very deceptive on MSN's part not to adequately disclose this. In addition to the broadband compatibility issues, the new HP printer I purchased for original MSNTV was no longer compatible, even though it is a relatively new printer.

I haven't read McCarthy's works in chronological order, but I am left wondering what is next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not his best","review":"I've made the mistake of reading Cormac McCarthy in reverse chronological order, having started with \\"No Country for Old Men\\", \\"The Road\\", the Border Trilogy and Blood Meridian before picking up \\"Child of God\\". I enjoyed the book but it makes apparent how McCarthy has grown and evolved as an author and storyteller. Many of the elements I loved in the later books are here only embryonic and not fully realized. McCarthy paints a landscape that is disturbing and dangerous, and made more so being very recognizable to those not caught in the throes of the depicted depravity. This was a satisfactory, but McCarthy has produced better. All the books above are well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not Faulkner","review":"It doesn't even seem like McCarthy. Gone are the finely woven stories of the Border Trilogy. This novel feels like an unfinished work, a mere outline to a real McCarthy novel. I was disappointed in the lack of depth of the characters; I never cared about Lester, nor had any inkling as to why he had turned so rotten. I did notice, every now and then, the beautiful prose that the author's known for, but the story was never fleshed out.Don't start reading McCarthy here as one reviewer suggested, it might turn you off to one of the great story tellers of his generation. Start with the Border Trilogy books, you will get a much better sense of the writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing but Didactic","review":"McCarthy's simple syntax tells the story of Lester Ballard. His tale is very disturbing, but it also provides the insight into the lives of those we'd rather pretend don't exist. McCarthy makes us open our eyes and identify who really is a child of God. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's McCarthy?","review":"Although a fan of McCarthy, this was an overall disappointment. At his best, McCarthy can create a sense of space that almost makes you dread turning the next page. Not so here. Try Blood Meridian, Outer Dark, Border Trilogy for McCarthy at his bes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I just read a book about a necrophiliac?","review":"How could this book have been written by Cormac McCarthy? As a tale of a small-town degenerate hooked on murder, necrophilia, and seemingly random violence, it has no redeeming qualities at all. It sounds like a Mel Gibson movie, for goodness' sake. The principal character, Lester Ballad, sets out to explore the depths of human behaviour after his home property is foreclosed and he is falsely accused of rape. He thereafter leaves no dead woman unscathed by his wanton phallus. There is no moral to this story, the reader does not come to empathise with Ballard, and the story is not entertaining. The only good trait to the book is the solid, well-paced story telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish story","review":"A very simple read but a very simple story also. sort of shocking but not by todays standards"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"A waste of beautiful prose and dialog. Disturbing for the sake of disturbing. Lacking any of the emotion that has made the disturbance in McCarthy's other novels lead to insight and in many cases, redemption."},{"rating":"1","title":"too strange for me...","review":"This book was too weird for me, it was just too graphic. I read it only because it has caused a controversy in an area school. The teacher that allowed his student to read this book has now been fired. I know that I don't want my own kids to read this book. Mr. McCarthy has done much better with his other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Smith hardcover WARNING!!!","review":"If you're considering buying the Peter Smith \\"edition\\" of this book, note that it is NOT a new \\"edition\\" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragmented with no depth","review":"This is the first book I have read by McCarthy.The premise was good but he just does not have the talent to flesh it out.The first half of the book was just a conglomeration of mini one or two page shorts.I guess they were to lay some kind of background for the rest of the story or just to fill pages.The rest of the book that could have been a good gore fest was so poorly written it just scans over what could have been a real gorey thrill ride.I found this book at the library while looking for another book of his called THE ROAD.I sure hope it is better written than this one.I now have The Road If you are interested on my take on it check out its reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book damaged","review":"It is my hope that I can receive an unmangled book. This particualr copy appears to have been in a tractor pull or demo derby."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was my first...","review":"All of the reviews on this book offer a reasonably accurate description of plot and characterso I'll just add this info. When Cormac McCarthy was a young boy, perhaps 5 or 6, his fathermoved from the upper east coast to east Tn to become an attorney with the rapidly expandingTVA system. My romantic side wants to believe that Cormac must have joined his father on manytrips out into the hills of the area around Knoxville and surrounding counties growing up.His descriptions of the countryside and the people in that region are portrayed in a way thatmakes them at once transparent as well as densely opaque. All of his writing has an edge thatis difficult to define but his descriptions of the lay of the land, the light, the texture ofthe seasons, as well as the people themselves always move toward some dark end. It's thecomplexity of paring down his characters that they become multidimensional, all too human, andfinally unexpectedly crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child Of God","review":"Another masterpiece from arguably the best writer of our time. Amazing how gripping Mr. McCarthy can make a relatively short story. Do yourself a favor and read all of his books, if you haven't already done so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissappointing","review":"This CD was not at all what I expected or what the cover portrayed. I thought this would be a collection of fun children's songs in Spanish, maybe some well-known preschool songs translated in Spanish. Instead, these songs sound like traditional old world hispanic music that is not appealing to my kids or myself at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guessing Game","review":"How can you expect people to purchase movies, when you do not even indicate the titles?Is this too much to ask?Absolutley unbelievable to think that people are expected to buy a movie without knowing the title or the major actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factory Reconditioned Singer- FROM A CRACK HOUSE!!","review":"I recently purchased a singer model 6038, for my wife for one her Christmas gifts.I received it today 12-2-03.Wow, it is missing the manual and the instruction book.There was also no power cord inside, or a foot pedal.There was no instructional video.Then when I took a good look at the machine. There was a long yellow melted spot where they must have put a lit cigarette while they were fixing it. Then before putting a bag over the machine it was wiped down with an oily car rag.

Haven't heard discomfort complaints from my daughter. So far they're holding up well and they seem as if they'll last through the school year and/or as long as she can fit them. For me they are worth the buy as she wears them fairly often, at least 3 times a week or more, and they fit her well. I did buy them a half size bigger than she needed at the time. Now her foot probably has grown some since August, but they never fit too loose. Just alittle longer at the toe for extra room to grow, for her medium width feet. For my active girl these are perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"music for chilling out","review":"i dont care about the comparisons to other groups [theivery corp, K&D, etc..] I have heard a LOT of electronic lounge and downbeat, and this, simply put, is one of the most colorful selections of the type. the melodies are thick and the basslines are dope. the album [sans the 3 remixes at the end] has a beautiful arc that takes the listener on a sexy journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality (x2)","review":"I purchased one of these for my wife. When we unpacked it, we found the needle was not aligned to go into the slot on the base plate. Instead it would hit the plate itself. A call to Singer's support line confirmed that this is something that requires service and cannot be fixed by us. However, authorized dealers won't touch machines like this unless they sold it, or unless they have an arrangement to get paid by Singer for warranty work. So, we returned the machine for a replacement. Amazon was very good about getting the replacement sent to us, but the replacement had the same problem! Appears to be poor quality control at the Singer factory. We returned the second machine for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"I ordered this machine and the first one didn't have all of it's parts, the video was missing and the needle throat plate didn't sit in flush due to a casting defect. Amazon sent out another one which I just got today and it doesn't work at all. I've spoken with thier customer service and I am not impressed. I only get well you can return it and get a refund or we will send you another one. Then I am told to request to return online only the system won't let me because it still shows pending. Amazon & Singer obviously don't want my business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Broken","review":"I had the same experience as other reviewers. I received the 5062 because the 5040 was out of stock from the retailer. It arrived broken - the needle and plate were misaligned, so the needle kept hitting the plate. At first, we thought the needle was just bent, so we tried a new needle. Then we realized there was nothing we could do to fix it ourselves. Poor quality control! We returned the 5062 and reordered the 5040. My 5040 just arrived, and there's no misalignment problem! I'm now ready to sew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"missing parts","review":"I haven't even been able to use this machine because it didn't come with all it's parts and it was in a sealed box!!! and I can't call anyone just send emails....I am not at all pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodness, These Are Nice!","review":"This is my introduction to these renowned and oft-recorded pieces. One can certainly feel the Romanticism in Beethoven's writing and also hear how portions of these late quartets might have possibly evolved into another great Beethoven symphony. The playing is superb and the recording, remastered late-'60s/early-'70s analog, is very fine and immediate, though perhaps a tad bass-shy. I'd describe the playing as passionate, precise, and committed; and the soundscape as warm and intimate. Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"small qualification","review":"I've been talking up and writing about this set for 40 years exactly the way most people here do. But I just revisited some of it the other day, after a very long break, and I must point out that in 132 the Marcia opening (immediately following the Song of Thanksgiving) has some really marked intonation problems, mostly (amazingly) Parisot's cello. I was very dismayed to hear it, as the Dankgesang is unsurpassed. I'm surprised they didn't do retakes, for the pitch sounds to me that jarringly off.PS - of course now on listening to other eminent versions I see that this is hardly uncommon. I mean, even the Berg and the Tokyo (whose work I love above all, or thought I did) sound a bit sour and overall imperfect in this little bracing quip of marcia writing. Hmm. Can an experienced string quartet player enlighten us all?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great sets of late quartets","review":"This set is wondrous! It's from the \\"historical series,\\" but the sound is great analogue sound that has been digitally remastered.The sound is comparable to (and IMHO better than) the studio set of the Alban Berg Quartett, but with an interpretation that is unique.This is among my favorite sets of the late quartets. And at the current price it is a MUST HAVE! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded Expectations","review":"There's always a bit of uncertainty in purchasing used products; this one exceeded my expectations. The description stated the condition as \\"good.\\" The only drawback (if it can be considered) is the missing dust jacket. That being said, the condition was nearly new. The pages and binding are in great condition. The service was very prompt and accurate. I received the book just as promised."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent overview of the Process Management wave...","review":"Pritchett doesn't say alot - this is a slim tome - but what he says, he says very well.Process management is the big thing in the corporate world, and with good reason... it gets results. This little book will give you a great overview of the 'process' of process management - how and why it works, what to do, and where to start.Pritchett has a load of great books on the subject but this one is succinct, easy to read, and certainly informative on getting one started into the realm of managing the 'soft' stuff while getting the 'hard' stuff on track and becoming streamlined and efficient.I like this guy. He's wise, successful, and insightful. What he talks about works. I recommend Pritchett's writings.

It being my first car, I knew exactly what theme I wantedTink and lots of it.When I removed it from the backing, I somehow managed to mangle the face beyond recognition. Granted, it wasn't the easiest thing to remove but I did a number on it.Luckily, I managed to reconstruct the face [right down to the eyes and nose] by piecing everything together pefectly. Looking at it now, you'd never know there was ever an 'incident' - tink looks perfect and she has survived Rain, Wind, Sleet, Hail, Snow and Ice and has held up fine.I do wish the process of applying had been easier, but I am happy with the durability thus far. I didn't want to have to go out and buy another one, and since it is my first window decal for a car I really didn't know what to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 2 Weeks","review":"The watch movement failed within a few weeks and Amazon stood behind their product (actually a 3rd party vendor) by giving a full refund. Granted it took about 2 months to get the refund but you live and learn. This watch is an icon and looks great on the wrist.

Having said that, the Omega 3573.50 Speedmaster Professional is simply a terrific watch. I preferred a sapphire crystal, which is why I chose this watch over the \\"actual\\" moonwatch (ref. 3570.50, with a hesalite crystal and solid case back). It keeps great time, looks great, and I love the ritual of winding it every morning. If you're considering a high-quality mechanical Swiss chronograph, take a long hard look at this watch. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic watch","review":"I bought it used for $100 from a watch shop in San Diego in the early 1980s and have owned it for 30 years; it's a valued and unique possession. It keeps fair time (probably needs a cleaning), it is useful for timing with it's build-in timer, but what makes it so cool is it was worn on the moon. This gives it a provenance that is unmatched. In fact, it can be seen in Ron Howard's movie Apollo 13. A acquaintance of mine in Washington, D.C. had one that Neil Armstrong had signed on the back.If you are looking for a watch for life, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Series","review":"I have recently started this series and am having a lot of fun reading it. I like the way the author breaks the chapters up between the main character and her husband, and at times other characters.

I also love the addition of the recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"In reading any fictional murder mystery, I like to come across the dead body by the end of the third chapter. This allows the author to introduce the characters and tell the beginning of the plot with lots of time left to investigate everyone involved and reveal the murderous culprit. If you like your novels like I do, avoid this Nancy Fairbanks book!! I most certainly didn't like reading more than 95% of this book to find out who got killed! And there is no investigation or mystery at all; the murderer is standing among several people, holding the pistol she just fired. If you want to read a mystery in which the dead body appears in the very first sentence, read \\"Dark Tort\\" by Diana Mott Davidson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halarious","review":"Very funny movie.

There are some movies that may not be \\"G\\" rated that express opinions or views that are not so repulsive.We hope that Seth McFarlane will become more creative to consider his audiences and also hope those that find this entertaining will see this as nothing but what it is...junk.

As a child of the 80's, I did enjoy the pop culture references, and it was a bonus to discover that the guy who played Flash Gordon was still alive, but all in all the movie didn't live up to the hype.

It was a pretty thin year for comedies and I thought this was easily one of the best of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"So funny.","review":"The plot is very simple. A boy gets a teddy bear for Christmas, and makes a wish that he can be real, so they can be friends for life. It's a Christmas miracle, Ted becomes a walking, talking Teddy bear. Flash forward to present day, Ted is still real, and still with his friend. That's all I want to say about the plot.Man, this is one funny movie. Mind you, the humor is crass and you have to make sure that the kids are out of the room. There are so many funny scenes. One of my favorite scenes is \\"The Thunder Song.\\" I almost wet myself laughing.Now, the movie has an actual story to it. Honestly, I was impressed by that. It just wasn't crass humor, and that's all. The story is very touching.Rent it, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical","review":"Hysterically funny!! Loved it!!!! It was a funny and touching movie! Seth is a genius!!!! Loved it when Ted's stuffing came out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious--but probably shouldn't watch with kids in the room!","review":"Not that I thought it was appropriate for kiddos, but once we turned it on...wowza! I kept hoping our little guys wouldn't get out of bed while we were watching. Otherwise, we were cracking up almost constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but humor gets old.","review":"Overall, I enjoyed Ted but the humor got to be old. Obviously, a movie about a talking Teddy Bear is a stretch in itself, but there was also a pretty lame attempt at a story line. I could have taken 30 minutes of the humor without a story line, but it got to be too much and too predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"I love family guy but sorry this movie just wasn't funny to me. Guess I'm just not into pot humor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"I can't believe this movie is considered the best comedy of the year. It has very few comedy moments and lots of corny moments.... Very disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly the dumbest show ever","review":"I actually like sophomoric humor, so when I heard this movie was dumb - funny I figured it would an evening of mindless entertainment. It wasn't even funny. We turned it off about 45 minutes into it and didn't even watch the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!!!!","review":"This is not a cute Teddy. He is gross, disgusting and very vulgar. Do not allow your small children to watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucked","review":"We watched the whole thing, but we couldn't wait for it to end. It was a little ridiculous. The narration wasn't funny. The storyline was ADD."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok at best","review":"The movie had a handful of funny parts if you can get past the fact that teds voice is just Peter Griffin with a slight boston accent. The first half was actually kind of funny but the second half was serious and emotional and the jokes were very few and far between.Probably worth a rent from netflix or redbox but not a dvd I'd buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly funny!!!!","review":"Absolutely historical. I f you can not see the humor and wit in this movie then you should truly check to see if you still have a pulse. I cried from laughter! It was funny from start to finish!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute bear, vulger language","review":"The plot is a common one. Boy has toy, toy gets him into trouble, boy saves bear. The movie is'nt even funny. I'm sorry I purchased the movie. Not something I would watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated","review":"I heard such rave reviews but I guess I don't get it. I was bored with the movie. It was a waste of my night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"We had high expectations but this movie fell flat. Same dumb jokes over and over. A few funny parts here and there but overall nothing great."},{"rating":"1","title":"ted","review":"Funny, but not as funny as previews would indicate. Slow at times. Would purchase again. Mildly entertaining. Could have had more"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ted, my friend?","review":"Good premise, could have been much better, lots of funny scenes, some not so much , sure to be a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time was wonderful, Second time was horrible","review":"The very first time I saw this movie I was in the movie theater with my brother. We were in love with the movie and thought everything about it was hilarious. Later when I rented this movie to watch it again, alone, I realized just how stupid and plot-less this movie was. There were still some parts that gave a chuckle but I found myself getting up multiple times to do other things and not really paying attention to the movie. If you are a guy who likes to smoke pot and live your personal fantasies then this movie will be your favorite. But if you are someone who likes more realistic humor then this movie will be a vast disappointment. I believe this movie is only good the first time around ( I wouldn't recommend buying it) or it could have just been funny because of the company I was with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raunchy","review":"This movie should have never even tried to be a comedy. It didn't even come close to a dark comedy I really can't believe that I watched it. Not worth the money to rent even if it was .99c"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't expecting much","review":"and that is what I got. I don't like watching any of Seth Mcfarlane's tv shows, but my bf loves them,so based on that and the few previews I did see made the movie look pretty funny, so what the hey, right? Well, just repeating a lot of what I saw in the other reviews, all the funny parts are in the previews. It was an ok movie, but I think it could've been a lot funnier. The scenes (and I don't wanna spoil it) where they meet the hero of their childhood was pretty good, but other than that, just kinda blah... Btw, the bf who, again, is a huge Seth Mcfarlane fan,also didn't think too highly of it either, if that is worth it to any other SM fan, who is trying to decide whether to buy/rent this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this","review":"I'm a huge fan of Seth McFarlane and the Family Guy show. HUGE fan. Also kind of a Wahlberg fan, ever since being blown away by his performance in Boogie Nights. Finally, I'm from the Boston area, so I always love to watch films set in our town. Unfortunately, Ted was a sort of triple let down.First and foremost, the movie is just not very funny. Certainly there are some good laughs in here, but the plot is thin, the jokes are too obvious and lazy, and the production value is lacking. It seemed more like an overly-long episode of a sitcom than a movie.I usually try to pay close attention to any film, even comedies, to catch some of the nuance of dialog, set design, etc., but I found myself paying more attention to my laptop while watching this. In fact, my wife and I both fell asleep during this movie. Though to be fair we have a three-year-old and a newborn, so perhaps there were other forces working against us at 10:00pm on Saturday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually pretty funny","review":"Spoilers aside, this movie takes the \\"we're just going to punch you in the face with funny\\" approach. Not much subtlety, but they don't need it. There's a plethora of one-liners that they've worked in that you'll miss a few times, so I suggest coming back and watching it again in a few weeks just to pick up on everything you might've missed while crying your eyes out from laughing. Don't feel like writing a long review, so I'm not going to. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned it off","review":"Drugs and bad language start out this film.Nothing enteraining or funny. I could not get past the first ten minutes. I turned it off, the same way it turned me off. Hope it goes up for the Razzys.

Can't I give it a zero rating?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain dumb","review":"I thought the premise interesting, but that damn bear was not cute. He was a force for selfish lack of control that was beyond childish."},{"rating":"1","title":"aweful","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Actually stopped watching it 1/2 way through. So stupid and disgusting. Extremely juvenile and obnoxious, especially towards women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I am not sure what the all they hype was on this movie. We had a few chuckles but definitely would not watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only watched a few minutes of this horrible movie!","review":"This was nothing but profanity and stupidity. So gross as to be not funny at all. Unbelievable that people watch this and rate it okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it was on sale","review":"The movie had funny moments but defiantly not worth the price in theaters.

A horrible script for such a great and handsome actor as Mark W."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"I thought it relied too much on the emphasis of extremely crude humor to be funny. Sorry story line, really bland, dragged on, thought it would be funnier than it was. Followed the structure of Family Guy too close. Could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie WAS GREAT!!! Amazon QUALITY HORRIBLE!!!","review":"The problem was Amazon streaming. it was worse than a pirate movie quality. The movie was extremely funny, Amazon gets 2 thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting--certainly not family entertainment!","review":"Wahlberg needs his brain examined... having accomplished other well-acted roles, to demean himself with the vulgarity of MacFarlane's warped sense of humor has diminished his capabilities in the eyes of our family and the majority of our associates. There is no one iota of social redeeming value in this trashcan flick... avoid like the plague unless you, too, reside in the gutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLY STUPID MOVIE","review":"Don't waste your time or money unless you're stoned and don't have anything better to do but fill your mind with garbage and bad ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie!","review":"Bad in every way, no reason to watch it! We wasted several hours on this piece of trash and it was not even funny, just crude!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Wow! The fact that something so precious to kids would be turned into something so foul mouthed. Yeah granted he grew up and became an adult but Damn! The weed smoking could've been left out! This was entertainment for whom?! I was curious and thought I'd give it a chance. Didn't like it, waste of film, hardly funny. At least superman and Spider-Man still follow goodness. These are adult films but we are influenced by what we see just as well as kids. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmoric, poorly acted comedy","review":"How do you make a teddy bear grotesque? By having Seth Macfarlane power him, that's how. This poorly acted, contrived movie is just plain awful. The humor is what you would expect of the family guy, not a feature length film. Bad jokes about getting high and doing stupid things over and over and over while sexualizing a stuffed bear just makes this dreadful to watch. My wife and I couldn't make it past the half hour mark so buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch only if you are a Seth MacFarlane Fan...","review":"If you are not a Seth MacFarlane Fan, do not watch this. I have watched episodes of the second iteration of Family Guy, American Dad, and Cleveland Show. I find his shows idiotic and formulaic. They are basically shows about randomized crass humor with no story line cohesiveness whatsoever. This movies is basically the same. I don't want to go on how it is basically stupid humor. That is obvious. But I want to point out one issue. Although I am a \\"conservative\\", I am for gay rights. Seth is a major proponent of gay rights but his humor tends to border on gay bashing. It really infuriates me. If you want to watch something crass but with smart and thoughtful humor, just watch an episode of South Park. They are very hit and miss, but a poor episode of theirs has more humor than anything MacFarlane can come up with.[Update 12/27/2012] Changed review title, didn't make sense"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Ted was a waste of $3.99 and a 1 hr 45 min. of my life.

This is a hilarious, laugh out loud movie. I do wish that fewer of the gags had been revealed in the trailer, but even with all that was released, it still had some incredibly funny moments. It is a very heart-warming love story. Not your typical boy meets bear meets girl story, but then what is?

Honestly it's just not that funny or clever. It's a bit of a Wilfred ripoff, but with less complexity in the characters and storyline.

We both laughed (like a real laugh, not the kind where you laugh because you're supposed to) 3 times. Can we please stop with the never-ending 80s references in movies?

Yawn. Then the bear is kiddnapped by a man and a boy who wanted to buy Ted so that his son could have a friend. Yawn.If you really wanna see it I would highly suggest you rent it !

Its one of those movies that hits every few minute sand when it does dont hesitate to laugh till u cant anymore. Its that damm good.

I love Family Guy and his Cavalcade of Comedy. This movie however, missed the mark. I had high expectations of it and it totally let me down. It had its funny moments and I laughed here and there, but the plot was BEYOND boring. I couldn't have cared less about the relationship between Mark Wahlberg & Mila Kunis. Any opportunity to shoehorn in an f-bomb was not missed. I swear more than the average joe, but even I thought it was unnecessary and excessive.

I've watched about 1/2 hour of the movie and I stopped. It's not funny. The language is foul and the jokes are crude. I think it would appeal to some Jr. High students - the kind that laugh at jokes simply because they're laced with a lot of foul language. The premise of the movie is creative, but it's a shame that the writer had to go with the typical, sarcastic \\"comedy\\" with a ton of expletives thrown in. I take my comedy seriously and really admire someone who can make me laugh without depending on foul humor. I paid to rent the movie and lost my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but too much","review":"This movie is fun, but definetily not a family movie.Sometimes it feels like the author did too much trying to make you laugh.

But this is not for a younger audience.","review":"I love Seth McFarlane, and although this movie was very entertaining and very funny, it's really not for younger audiences under 18 - and some over 18. Despite the teddy bear (Seth McFarlane) main character, it is a very adult movie with lots of explicit adult language and situations. I also LOVED Giovanni Ribisi as the Tiffany singer-Ted-obsessed outcast. I give it five stars because it's so original and so entertaining and I would definitely suggest this movie to all my adult friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Family Guy, this is funny","review":"It's a funny movie.

Very limited jokes, not funny, screenplay is boring. Foul language out of an alive teddy bear, a couple of ridiculous fart jokes, promotion of pot and alco.

For kids - way too much drugs, drinks and flame.Yay to cartoons, which are always very nice and stop experimenting with movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT???","review":"I am stunned that my favorite super-actor, Mark Wahlberg would actually make such a ridiculous dud of a movie.

Most of the characters were obnoxious and stupid, and most of the humour revolved around sticking fingers into a55holes, farts, d1cks, bongs, dry humping, and that freaky looking Flash gordon guy. Even Mark Walburgs GF wasnt that hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer Clear Of This Movie If You're Christian","review":"In full honesty, and I don't care what others think, this movie is unnecessarily sinful.

I found it to be more a parochial movie that would be appreciated by people, mostly of the male gender, in their teens and twenties.

There were a few decent gags, but overall the vulgar sophomoric jokes did not impress me. I've always thought one of things holding Family Guy back is the obtuse and unfamiliar pop culture jokes. Seems to be plenty of that in this movie. I think the idea of the teddy bear is one that worked, and the movie did have some heart. I really think Macfarlane needed some help with the jokes though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not funny.","review":"This was a really bad movie. Just not funny at all. I'm not going to waste time telling you what it's about, but I will tell you not to waste your time watching it. Seth MacFarlane has become a lazy writer, or he's just run out of fresh ideas. I would have loved the tribute to Flash Gordon, because that's one of my favorite cheezy movies of all time, but the fact that it was included in such a bad movie ruined it for me. I had to force myself to finish watching this. Twelve year olds might find it amusing, because they will get to hear dirty words and watch a teddy bear smoke pot. Should have been relegated to an SNL skit. Oh, and Marky Mark has the same cardboard charisma he has in all of his movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I love Seth's tv shows. I thought this movie would be pretty great considering the premise and Seth's involvement. His voice alone is hilarious. However this movie isn't very funny and if you're a young man thinking oo it's unrated nudity! no... not the case. It was very lacking. not worth the 3 dollars I spent renting it.

I knew it was a marginal success in the US, but I then read in EW that it had grossed over $500 million world wide! So I figured I was wrong. NOPE!Mark Wahlberg is as hot as ever, Mila is totally beautiful, and Seth McFarlane is as funny as he is on TV - - which is the problem. He can swear in a movie, but he has put his best foot forward on TV. His imagination and creativity is absolutely amazing - but this isn't his forum. You can't force Peter Griffith inside a stuffed bear - well, you can, but that would be porn - So I'll just keep watching the original on TV.

The premise is ridiculous yes but I expected that the script would echo the absurdity of it all. How is that a teddy bear comes alive and NO ONE is fazed by that in the absolutely ridiculous world that is built around it.The bear sounds like Peter from Family Guy, which is understandable as its the same person who wrote and created the characters on the show.The movie played out like some of the Family Guys as of late, the potential to be funny is there, but it misses its mark. Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, one of the original writers of Family Guy, wrote some of the best episodes that I can remember about the show and she should have had her hand in writing this script.The movie was unimaginative and totally predictable in a 80s theme style movie. Down to the childhood hero appearance. What a waste. I got 3 laughs out of the movie and they were just chuckles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"very formulaic and not very funny.

While it was always going to be a comedy, the movie falls into a barrage of crass nonsense almost from the start and never recovers. Clearly as the unrated version it was always going to have below-the-belt humor, but the director lost his way early on. He forgot about the story and tried to make every scene as offensively funny as possible instead. He failed completely. The movie Borat is one of the few movies that (sort of) got away with this type of approach.

The animation was awesome, but the story dragged along at times like Ted's sorry plush derriere and the human acting was mediocre at best.

So I borrowed it from a friend expecting it to be as funny as everyone is making it out to be. There were several parts that were kinda funny but not how funny people are making it out to be. The whole movie is pretty boring and its like watching a live episode of family guy. Does Seth Macfarlane have an original bone in his body? Ted (talking bear), Family Guy (talking dog), Cleveland show (another talking bear) and American Dad (alien). Need I say more? They even do the lame cute scene jokes they do in family guy. There is really no point in the movie other than its about a guy who can't let go of the past. If your into tasteless dick and fart jokes and randomly making fun of people and all they do is smoke pot than this may be a movie for you.

No, seriously. Who thought this was anymore than a one-trick pony joke let alone a full-length movie. After you get over the stuffed bear that tells dirty jokes that fall so flat, I was more fascinated by the fact that apparently Puddy and Ryan Reynolds are a gay couple.Basically, the movie fails not so much in trying to translate \\"Family Guy\\" humor without censorship but the fact it's a run-of-the-mill rom-com when it comes right down to it. Boy has girl. Girl wants boy to grow up. He says he will. He doesn't. They fight. They make up. He sees the world in some new light (thanks to a talking stuffed bear), and they live happily ever after. Snooze and fest.Extras are a total waste. The outtakes are even less funny than the movie itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish Watching","review":"We rented this and found it so boring and UN-funny that we stopped watching it less than a quarter of the way through. It wasn't humorous. It might have worked as a short sketch on SNL or something and been funny that way, but as an entire movie, it just didn't work for me at all. The humor is crass, it was a lot of sex jokes and cursing and drug references, just for the sake of... well, not humor, because it wasn't humorous.There simply wasn't anything redeeming about it that made it worth finishing. My son (who is 18) usually loves watching crass shows like this, and even he found it quite boring and just... dumb. I actually tried to see if I could get my money back on the rental, and I never do that--that's how bad this movie was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-spoiler alert: nothing to spoil","review":"This movie falls flat on all accounts. There are a few good setups/one-liners in the beginning as the story is laid out. The story line is pathetic and every bit of dialogue along the way is just empty cliche. Girl dumps boyfriend because he's carousing with his friends, boy realizes love is more important than booze, tries to get girl back. Not even well acted, I felt no chemistry whatsoever. The narrator concept (nice family narrator who \\"surprises\\" us with an occasional f-bomb or s-pile) is alright but poorly executed. The story is not strong enough even to carry a comedy, and the jokes aren't good enough to overcome the lack of a story. The entire value of this movie was a 10-minute standup routine. Mark Walhberg is an honest, versitile actor but in this movie he is just another one-dimensional hollywood \\"star\\" not Mark Walhberg the actor. This has to be Seth M's worst effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"É o Peter Grifin na forma de ursinho!!!","review":"Muito engraado o filme!! No conseguí parar de rir!! Muito bom!!

Sophmoric, boring attempts at humor, etc., etc. Take Family Guy dad and substitute Teddy Bear for his character and bunch of real humans instead of the other characters, then a script that is too long and brainless for even a Family Guy episode and your mind immediately starts thinking about all the other things you could be doing besides watching this lame movie. You're better of watching a movie you like even if you have seen it 20 times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, we get it, ha ha.","review":"Basically, it's Family Guy with new characters.If you enjoy family guy you won't necessarily love this one. To get laughs, many scenes include alcohol, drugs, and bongs, as if that instantly relates to any audience. Well, to me, it's lame, and not funny when a movie relies a bong to carry it through. Who cares if everyone is a pot head or crack addict. After awhile it is lame, very lame.There were some funny moments; however, The plot was very bland and there was the typical moment where two of the characters break up and then get back together in the end through some nonsensical means.Worth a rental only in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasn't as good as expected","review":"I was expecting a funnier movie.

I admit it: I love family guy. I love that humor that is sometimes cruel, sometimes silly, sometimes very out of place... always improper. But I didn't find much of it in Ted. I was expecting to LMAO watching this movie and, instead, I giggled a couple of times... is that all there is? As a result, I found this movie to be VERY boring. I mean, nobody expects too much out of a comedy: just make me laugh and be done with it.... If you forget the laughing part.. what do you have? There are parts where the film tries to entertain, and it's even more miserable because of that... if it didn't try, at least it wouldn't be as pathetic... Halfway through the film, I looked at my bored wife.. she was falling asleep. I wasn't, but was bored as hell.... I asked: do you want to see what's on tv, instead (for the record, I would NEVER suggest that over watching a movie)?

This movie is about as funny as a woman getting fisted by a lions paw while getting a colonic. I mean it wasn't funny, not even weirdly funny. It's just weird & stupid. The older Seth McFarlane gets, the more stupid he becomes. The first season of family guy was good, but since then he's delivered nothing but FCC approved soft-core pornographic garbage! If I'm gonna see a porno, I want to know it's a porno first. Don't try to surprise the audience with things that should be labeled adult instead of the R rating they've given."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"One of the funniest movies EVER!!

Needless to say, I started it last night and wasn't able to finish it. Listen, I don't mind this type of comedy--that isn't the problem. This is just a bad movie, and I personally did not find it one bit funny. The accents are bad (Wahlberg-bad Boston, Ted-Peter from Family Guy) and honestly, the only real story is a man's boyhood attachment to his teddy bear, which is a washed up celebrity able to talk, move, and think like a human. Everybody is trying too hard (Wahlberg, Seth M., Mila Kunis, and even Joel McHale, who I normally like). Obviously some people enjoyed this movie--I just found it incredibly stupid and 100% not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUFFED....","review":"My cat bit me a few hours before I watched this film.I mention this because half-way through the excruciating90 or so minutes, I had convinced myself that I had adose of tetanus coursing through my body.

Now, I only hear smut.Tetanus would have been a better option than havingto endure more than 15 minutes in the company of thisrubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie is boring. None of the characters are worth spending 2 hours with. The story is your usual rambling Seth McFarlane script with no real plot but lots of empty cultural references that have nothing to do with the story or the scene. No one evolves. Nothing happens. While this works fine for a 22 minute episode, it gets incredibly old starting around minute 23.On the plus side, the animation of the bear is incredible. The texture and integration within the scenes is perfect. Too bad they didn't spend as much time on the story as they did on animating the bear.If you love fart jokes, a rambling plot, one-dimensional characters and a well animated teddy bear, the is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"mystified by the positive reviews","review":"I rented this movie after reading the first 5 or 6 reviews thinking it would be hilarious.

I like Seth McFarland, although even some of his jokes on \\"Family Guy\\" can go a little too far for my taste. McFarland did the voice of Ted, but it sounded like Peter (dad in Family Guy), so that was distracting throughout the whole movie. But it was the crude jokes and language that went way too far for me. I especially didn't appreciate the gay bashing or the \\"retard\\" reference.

The jokes are hackneyed and unfunny. Everything has a been-there-done-that feel to it. Seth MacFarlane doesn't even try to make a new voice for the titular character, it's just Peter Griffin as a bear.Mark Wahlberg strikes little new ground beyond his other recent forays into comedy such as \\"The Other Guys\\". He's proven he's a decent comedic actor (he still rocks way more in dramas), but this clearly wasn't his best choice for another move in that direction.I could go on, but honestly, I don't get why this movie did so well and got such great reviews.

I don't know why I'm always surprised at what Mark Wahlberg can do on screen, but he once again shows he's a pretty good comedic actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEATH TO MING!","review":"There is nothing like a foul mouthed teddy bear to make for a great movie. Personally I think Zach Galifianakis would have made a better Ted, but then again he has played the dysfunctional buddy role before. As a child John (Mark Wahlberg) wishes for and gets a talking teddy bear. Now that they are in their 30's neither one has grown out of their immaturity with Ted becoming an increasing problem.John's girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) demands that either Ted leaves or she goes. The humor is what one would expect from watching \\"Family Guy\\" with a lot of adult language. It spoofs other films and is critical of many aspects of society. It is politically incorrect. Like \\"Family Guy\\" some of the bits work and some don't. If you don't find one bit funny wait a minute and a new one comes along.Excessive f-bombs, sex, heavy drug use, no nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was terrible!","review":"I expected it to be crude...actually I was hoping that it would blow my mind with how crude and funny it was.

It didn't help when discussing how popular Ted made him and if he didn't have Ted he would've ended up like \\"the Asian at Virginia Tech.\\" As a VT grad and extremely proud to be a Hokie, I wish I could have turned off that movie right then and there.

The movie is about a foul mouth teddy bear with the voice of Peter Griffin, so if you love Family guy, you've come to the right place, it also has a bit of romance in it.

If they knocked a Muslim or Islam like that, they'd be hunted down and killed, yet (somehow) it's 'okay' to trash the Christian faith and God. I'm sure this review will go over like a lead-balloon, and if so, that's due to the depravity of the readers' spirit who align themselves with such antisemitism (Jew-hating) and anti-Christ values.Darkness cannot stand the Light, and will strike out against the Light. However, Light wins every time.Sure, the premise of the movie is funny, I mean it's a walking, talking teddy-bear after all. But when you lace a movie with such gutter values (many of which I didn't even address), giving it a 1-star is a few too many.Mark, give me a call.

This movie just had too much profanity and obscenity for my taste. Some jokes were overused and funny at first, got old very fast. As a result, the movie dragged, became boring and a waste of time. I didn't find Ted likable at all. Plus, Seth MacFarlane didn't attempt to give him a voice different from Peter in Family Guy so every time Ted spoke I imagined Peter from Family Guy. That's just lazy on Seth MacFarlane's part. And I find Peter one of the least likable characters on Family Guy which may have played a huge part in my disliking of this movie. The plot is not good. In fact, it feels quite juvenile compared to the writing on Family Guy. There is still much was left to be desired in the story.

As a fan of \\"Family Guy\\" I found that I had a hard time reconciling Ted's voice as it's the same as Peter Griffin's (they even make light of that in the movie). The major plot problems surround whether or not Ted is actually alive.While he drinks and smokes and somehow has sex throughout the movie, he's apparently incapable of just going dormant like the toys in Toy Story and has to get his own place. Considering what happens, he is also not *really* alive and becoming organic on the inside like Chucky was, so the drive to the climax of the story feels totally fabricated and fake when Wahlberg's character decides he wants to grow up and chooses his girl (Kunis) over Ted and mayhem ensues. Still, it was funny at several points and worth exactly the $2 I paid to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"vrry funny","review":"This is a movie that adults will like very funny and lots of action for a movie with a stuffed animal for a main character.

He makes a magical wish that it could talk. The next day, he comes to life. 27 years later, John and Ted are still BFFs. John's girlfriend, Lori wants to Ted to move out so John can have a life with her. Most of the movie consists of getting high and making offensive jokes, but deep down, this movie actually has a heart. If you like MacFarlene's kind of humor, you'll love TED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing. Waste of time and money.","review":"I expected much more from Mark Wahlberg.

Please explain why listening to a stuffed animal swear and have sex with a human female is funny. The lines weren't funny at all. In fact if Ted were human we all would be saying how badly written the film was. I guess some people think that the fact that the lame comedy was coming from a stuffed teddy bear makes the lines funny. Based on all the positive reviews, the American movie going public is easy to please. Not this guy.

At his best he is a subversive and spot on satirist. At his worst (which is often) he is tiresome and boorish. I do not believe that it takes much cleverness or creativity to produce such a movie. There is not 2 hours of material here that constitutes a movie.

The bear is a riot and some of the situations as well as most of the dialogue in this unrated version had me in stitches laughing so hard. Couldn't believe Walberg did this after coming so far in his movie career. I dont mean this to be bad, but just to be something totally unexpected. Kinda like Cher giving a lecture on birth control and a proper social life."},{"rating":"1","title":"For The Undiscriminating Only","review":"Complete and total rubbish. Lame humor depending on crudeness and nothing else. Not clever, just plain dumbed down foolishness. For those of you who like your dialogue inane, your plot silly, and your acting like cardboard cutouts, this should please you immensely. It's actually kind of insulting how bad this is, but the whole premise kind of guarantees one predictable, stupid gag after another. A complete waste of time and money. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Side Splitting Laughter not for the shy of Adult Humor","review":"I have read some reviews that really put this movie down because of its adult content. Seriously if you go to the store and buy fish...its going to taste like fish not taste like chicken. In short this movie was intentionally focused on adult humor and I dont believe that was at all hidden in the trailer. All of that out of the way..for me this was hilarious and non stop laughter.

Ted is with out a doubt the worst movie ever. There was nothing even mildly entertaining in this piece which features a constant barrage of vulgarity, crude sexual innuendo and dope smoking.

After verifying it wasn't my internet connection I tried to watch Ted again and after multiple attempts I still got the same error. It took me almost two days, and the rental period had almost expired, before I was able to successfully watch the movie. The Amazon service was horrible!

I really like Seth McFarland's comedy. That being said, this movie fell really short for me. It's as if he did a rough draft of the script one afternoon and they greenlit the project and never did a rewrite. I'm starting to think that while Mr. McFarland can come up with some great ideas he still needs his room of writers to hash them out for him. Normally I find Marky Mark and Mela Cunis quite funny but they were also very flat in this movie. I don't know what all the hype is about. I like fart jokes but I like good fart jokes. This movie felt like a rough rough draft of what could have been something great. Unfortunately it killed at the box office so we probably see something very similar soon.

One case in point was Family Guy's Christmas special hosted by his dad...not sure why anyone needs such specific references to bodily functions, but you will see the same sickness in Ted. At times it is a very cute movie and some dirty male jokes are fine...but this movie makes you wonder: That wasn't funny....it actually made me heave...why would a sane person put that in a mainstream movie? I have the same issue with many of the more recent comedies done by the SNL crowd and National Lampoon. Some dirt and nudity is fun, but the obsession with detailed bodily functions is disgusting and other movies filled with weird deviant sex often takes the place of a well-developed storyline aimed at entertaining the non-porno folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good!","review":"This movie looked to be funny by the trailer, but it turned out to be a disappointment.

It was awesome seeing Flash Gordon in it too, LoL.Rather funny movie. This one guy and his kid that are after Ted...a little creepy, but added to both the humor and suspense in the movie. Good morale about the value of true friendship. Although there are comedies I like better, this apple certainly doesn't fall far from that tree! If you love comedy and don't mind a bit of crudeness, then I highly recommend giving this movie a watch! It's worthwhile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a long and good episode of Family Guy","review":"The movie was \\"Friggen Sweet\\" - great, dirty humor, with a couple jokes that might be over the top or out of taste, but hey, nothing less should be expected.The effects were also really well done, making it surprisingly believable from a visual stand point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really looking forward to this movie.

I turned this movie off about thirty minutes before it ended. I will never look at teddy bears the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious & Surprisingly Heartwarming","review":"Who would have thought that the combination of Mark Wahlberg and a talking teddy bear would make a winning combination? The jokes and humor in the movie is what you would expect from an R rated comedy, and is crass more often than not, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have heart; quite the opposite in fact. The movie is actually quite heartwarming and a tad emotional. Wahlberg is great as the stoner Bostonian and continues to prove he has a place in comedy. There's quite a few hilarious moments, as well as countless references to pop culture that usually accompany them. Overall this movie is what you might expect from MacFarlane, but adds a slight touch of emotion to make it that much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"If you want to watch a movie to laugh and have a good time, this is what you looking for.

Third grade humor. We wanted a funny movie but this was just silly stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Infantile","review":"The plot and humor are geared toward pre-teens.

Seth Macfarlane isn't funny for most adults though, so if you have a hard time with Pot and fart jokes, I would pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, Funny, but not Great","review":"Very funny movie at times, but not uproariously hilarious. Was enjoyable to watch, but I doubt I would watch it again. Just a fun movie to enjoy with friends, but not a classic you'd want to watch over and over. Also, maybe it was just me, but the voice of Ted was too much like Peter Griffin (there's even a joke about this in the movie) so when I looked away or closed my eyes, it was just weird. Even more weird since Mila Kunis is in the movie (she voices Meg) and the two characters often converse."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of a good date night","review":"My husband thought this would be funny and I was hesitant but finally agreed.

The storyline was fairly predictable, but okay. As a twentysomething, non-Family Guy-fan, female, I am definitely not who this movie was trying to reach. My husband and brother-in-law got a kick out of it. Basically, if you are a male from the late 70s/early 80s, who likes Family Guy and LOVED Flash Gordon...this one is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"You know that episode of southpark that is a parody of The Shining?

I never laughed so hard in my life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny in other movies","review":"I'd say this movie was a homage to other, funnier, movies. Don't get me wrong, this is classified as a comedy so it was definitely supposed to be funny.

Well I really did not like it at all. It was not very funny and was putting me to sleep.I even watched it a second time a few days later to be sure that perhaps my mood that day ruined it for me. But I found it to be the same bore as the first time I watched it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER!!!","review":"This movie is based on a silly premise that has no bearing with reality.

But this is in the top 5 worst movies I have ever watched in my life. I'm hardly a prude and don't mind a little profanity, but holy cow this movie is over the top with bad language, extreme profanity, and piggish remarks and jokes that aren't even funny. It's as if they think a bad or sexual word makes something funny. It doesn't. True humor obviously escapes the writer and the sad people who produced this. As for the plot - oh for pete's sakes a child could do better. I kept watching hoping it would get better. Don't make that mistake - it doesn't. In fact, don't watch it at all, it's a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish it","review":"This low brow humor seems popular. Unfortunately it is not my style.

We lasted about 15 minutes and gave it up realizing it didn't have any real story line.I watch a lot of rated R movies, but this one was ridiculous. The writer obviously was going through an infantile period when he wrote it if he thought that was the only way to get laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely vulgar","review":"could not finish watching, the language was quite repulsive and I'm not a prude!

I liked the fact that the bear existed for everyone to see. In too many movies such a character is seen by only one person, is always being hidden from the public, or is only actually alive in its own circle, i.e. Toy Story. The humor is crude, but for the most part realistic, albeit with a teddy bear playing the stoner friend. Overall, it is a decent buddy movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"It was so funny me and my mom enjoy it very much! I will consider people to watch it and buy it on DVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"The movie was really built up. Everybody said it was better than the hangover. I dont think so. I am glad I saw it but it was not as funny as the hype. And I'm not gonna waste 2 hours watching it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This passes for comedy?","review":"That Seth McFarlane has not one, but multiple series running on TV is surprising. That he was able to get this movie produced and distributed is deplorable.If you find beyond-excessive profanity, bongs and Boston accents funny, you might find this movie mildly amusing. However, I could recommend a number of other films with the same elements which manage to have more than a shallow and annoyingly repetitive shell of a plot. Your time could be equally well spent riding a city bus around with a bunch of juvenile boys. The writing is not intelligent and even the fart jokes are pathetic.It's a shame so many notables made cameo appearances in this film, as they all came off looking like sleazy idiots (yes, even Norah Jones).Ted goes well beyond raunchy humour and is just simply a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it!","review":"Not at all what I expected, vulgar language, unnecessary violence.

Relies on sophmoric humor and grates on my ears with the over over over over over over use of the most vulgar language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned it off after thirty minutes","review":"Would rate this right down there with \\"Date Night\\". Very little funny about constantly seeing a teddy bear with a bong, and the Oriental newscaster striking his female co-anchor. Walhberg's character and acting were so good in \\"The Shooter\\", it's a shame to see him going in this direction. C'mon Hollywood, if you are going to put out this kind of garbage, at least let the consumer watch the first fifteen minutes of the movie before they put out any money for a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid movie","review":"The movie was a waste of money.

The story did nothing to redeem the movie either -- it was very weak and I got the feeling that the narration and the whole father/son thing at the end was just thrown in to add to the run time of the movie. It's rare for me to think a movie is not worth the rental fee but this one falls in that category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and cute ending","review":"Cute story with funny not-so-cute humor mixed in.

His transition into the big screen does not work well, and \\"Ted\\" is a mindless and trite extended sitcom. Actually, it would be entertaining if it were an extended sitcom -- in fact, it's just a childish concept desperately searching for a meaningful plot.If you've watched \\"Family Guy\\" enough times, you'll find the jokes here the same-old same-old. There's a lot of gay jokes, and you'll hear all the familiar voices.

The last two pictures I seen her in has been laced with it. If that is any indication of her 'talent' I'll not buy another movie with her in it.Willik, USAF (Ret)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"If there was an option for 1/2 star that would have been better.

It was slow and the jokes seemed fragmented. I'm a huge Family Guy fan and Seth McFarlane fan. however, the over the top, way too many, shock-humor moments were just way too much. Too many, too often and honestly, just not funny. Wahlberg was terrible.

Maybe it got better after that, but by then I could have cared less about any of the actors, especially Ted.

There was supposed to be a DTS track included, but there is not.

What is unknown to the convicts is that the forest is cursed by wicked magic which leads to a struggle for survival. As the struggle begins, it is evident that their actions dictate what is good and evil, however, sometimes it is a little more ambiguous as to what is evil and what is good. Versus is a film filled with violence and death that keeps repeating itself throughout the film, which gets to the point monotonously. Nevertheless, there is an underlying fundamental idea that the actions make the person which can help clarify the ending of the film. In the end, the film stretches out becoming monotonous and boring which results in a rather mind-numbing cinematic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun ride","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I picked this up, but it had a cool cover, it was in japanese, and it had an unintelligible plot summary on the back cover-- hey, I couldn't resist.

Which made got me some late fees from Blockbuster, but what the hell, I had a lot of fun with this one so I didn't care. This is what moviemaking should be- creative, funny, and most importantly, cool. And man, this movie oozes with coolness, and a sense of humor that isn't so pronounced compared with other asian cinema.

It has almost the perfect blend, action, visuals, complexity and we can't leave out humor.The humor is not overdone in this movie at all, it lends a nice break to the edginess, some things are funny enough to be humorous but not overly so to be comedic.

The extra disc is in a lose paper satchel.With all he hype, I expected a great movie. It was ok, watchable.

I HATE BAD MOVIES! This was more rotten than the zombies crawling out of the ground. I'm sorry but this was the pits. I wish I could give it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly awful.","review":"I rented this, based on the quote on the front cover from Moriarty of Ain't it Cool News. This \\"film\\" is unbelievably bad. There's no plot, and it looks like the efforts of a couple of teenagers with a video camera trying to shoot a \\"cool, violent\\" movie. The characters posture pathetically, and it's about as stylistically interesting as...a bunch of teenagers shooting a home movie. The dubbing is atrocious (and like everything else, sounds like the efforts of...a bunch of teenagers shooting a home movie), but subtitles wouldn't have saved it.After watching it I thought there was no way Moriarty could have liked it, so I searched Ain't it Cool News for that quote. It turns out the quote was from someone writing in to the site. Moriarty prefaced the comment by basically saying he couldn't stand the movie. It might be great as a Mystery Science Theater 3000 film, were that still around, but aside from that, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't anyone dub a voice in this day and age","review":"What the heck is up with the dubbing in this film?

This movie makes absolutely no sense. Who buries their murder victims with their guns? Why can they not be hit by bullets, but everything else seems to be plenty effective? (knives, punches, etc) It's the Superman complex. Bullets will ricochet off, but he'll duck when the empty gun's thrown at him. Don't waste your time with this movie. It's just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggghhhhh...","review":"I can't quite comprehend how anyone, I mean ANYONE... Can actually enjoy this film. I mean gosh... the action wasn't just mediocre, it was HEINOUSLY horrible. Seriously... I have seen better action sequences from an old men swatting mosquitos. And the plot... It was like a bad mix of Pet Cemetery, Highlander, and splashes John Woo and Takeshi Mike elements. I mean come on... How can anyone in their right mind take this movie seriously? The script was litterally conjured up from a bowel movement. And even though I am an avid viewer of asian films and fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Japanese, I couldn't allow myself to give this movie more than an one. Movies like this actually henders the Asian film industry from reaching the upper stratosphere of film making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible....Horrible....Horrible","review":"This movie is simply 2 hours of 10 skinny guys doing silly Kung Fu fighting in a haunted forrest. The worst thing about this movie is that there is absolutely no story!! I repeat, no story!! The viewer is thrown into a forest and watches as a few minor incidents lead to punching and kicking.The zombies in the haunted forest are not even scary. They hardy attack the bad guys, the zombies main purpose is to be used as shooting targets for the bad guys.I recommend you buy \\"The Returner\\" or \\"The One\\". Those are two excellent martial arts movies. Waaaaaay better than Versus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrill Ride of a Film--Big on Fun, Short on Sense","review":"It's over the top. It's somewhat gory. It's fantastic. A good, old-fashioned zombie film. It's true that the main group of zombies have little to do with the convoluted plot. There's no good reason for them, other than to show that there are zombies. But that's reason enough, in a zombie film. And these zombies are tool users. Not limited to shambling around, they. They can use swords and guns and generally just make a huge mess. What more do you want?If you answer that question \\"A satisfying plot,\\" you probably ought to look elsewhere. If you just want to have fun, though, this could well be the zombie movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"I'm confused as to how anyone could possibly mistake this mass of garbage as being a decent film. Poor acting, lousy score, cheesy dialogue, weak special effects... I could go on. The \\"coolest\\" thing about this movie is the cover of the DVD case. If you're interested in foreign sci-fi try The Returner, Casshern or Steamboy. This waste of celluloid isn't even worth a rental let alone a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suckfest!!","review":"This must be the most horrendus movie Ive ever seen.

Judging by the other reviews here, I will add \\"incredibly over-rated\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is as good as it gets?","review":"This movie was worse than battle royale. It should have been a cartoon. Easily one of the worse movies I own. Make children of the living dead look like an oscar nominee. Piss on this burning pile of crap, or not what do I care. BAD! BUT THATS JUST ONE MANS OPINION> YOU BE THE JUDGE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's Bruce","review":"Simply put... if you like Evil Dead you will like this movie. It is basically a Japanese version of Evil Dead with cooler fighting scenes but lacking Bruce and his great one liners. I've heard people complain about the dubbing... If you get a foreign film DO NOT WATCH IT DUBBED.. thats an important rule... it's all about subtitles... Anyways this movie is funny and has great fighting scenes but I kept expecting to see Brucey :(... One of the greatest fight scenes ever is at the end though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheesy!","review":"Did not care for this film. It was very corny and I could not take it seriously at all.

Takes place in well-shot woods2. Gore, gore, gore3. Guns4. Inventive camera work5. Kung-FuWhy 4 stars & not 5?Evil Dead worked because of likeable Ash (he made us laugh, and therefore care for him).

Somehow southerners, jews, nuns, priests, soldiers, & everyone else flow together and become intertwinned. honestly i hate to face to the horrors of the Holocaust, buts its painfuly brought to light, and two pages later your on a beach in the south wrapped up in a totaly differt kind of pain. even the end is bittersweet. i love reading from a mans point of view, of the love for all the women in his life. beach music will be one of those books you always remeber because it touches so many nerves. i loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Beach Music, although parts of the story were hard to handle. I cant imagine being 13 and reading it; at 18, I was terrified to tears in the mountains with AJ Dillard. Still, it was written beautifully, the words themselves flowed like poetry in some places. The story was incredible. I was impressed. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word -- Captivating","review":"This book captured & kept my attention despite the wide of variety of subjects touched. Conroy has utilized his gift of writing to create a story that touches everyone who reads it. If you're looking for history, politics, passion, humor, violence, love, relationships, geography (I think you get the picture), then Beach Music is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowery prose finally gets the best of Conroy","review":"A fan of Conroy's books, including \\"The Prince of Tides\\" and \\"The Water is Wide\\", I found this book to be terribly disappointing. Though I admire his ability in previous works to mold sentences that beautifully tell of his southern homeland and the characters within it, his flowery prose runs wild here. Certain passages, though describing a depressing chain of events, are downright laughable. Gay Talese's editing contributes to a lack of continuity and plausibility, resulting in a work that is maudlin and hackneyed to the fullist. Check out other Conroy...this is definately his worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like visitng an old friend","review":"I read this book in three days when it was first published and loved it. Upon finding it at my library, I pounced and fell in love all over again. My only concern it that the library will get suspicious when I keep renewing it!!! Mr. Conroys turn of phrase and descriptive words remind me how much I love being a southerner and and how very much I loved Rome. Beach Music on audio CD is the only thing on my Christmas list this year"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beach Music","review":"I have read all of Pat Conroy's novels. He is one of my favorite authors. Beach Music is my favorite, with Prince of Tides next. Beach Music is so human, geographically colorful. The characters and emotionally intensity made me wish it would go on and on. I did skip some parts of the chapter re the holocaust as this is always difficult for me to deal with. I am waiting for Pat's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Unrealistic Characters","review":"Conroy's habit of making characters with mental problems into tragic, yet charismatic and magical entities is beyond annoying. From what I know of the families of schizophrenics, caring for afflicted individuals goes a tad beyond the fond headshaking and smiling tolerance that Conroy's characters indulge in when dealing with John Hardin. Totally unrealistic. And speaking of unrealistic, why not make Jack's daughter a REAL 6-year-old (who occasionally whines, has tantrums and spills milk) rather than a beatific, Yoda-type character who is wiser than every adult surrounding her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh, not my cup of tea.","review":"Conroy's a bit too emotional for my taste and he tends to overwrite. I enjoyed The Great Santini a lot, but this one didn't do much for me. There's one chapter, when a few teenagers get stranded at sea on a motorboat, that's great. And his portrayal of southern life is cool, but I wasn't crazy about this one overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time Conroy reader, little disappointed","review":"I am always looking for new authors and tried Pat Conroy upon recommendation. I usually buzz through books, but had to push myself to finish this. The writing style jumped around in this book at some points quite crude and at others having literary text beyond casual reading. The storyline jumped around to the point of not being believable. 4 different characters being sexually assaulted in one book is a little much and really lacks imagination. I will think twice before picking up another Conroy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should I finish the last 20 pages of this trite melodrama?","review":"I shouldn't but I'll hang in there just to find out how this incredibly lame books finally ends. The most interesting thing about this book is the truly dreadful dialog. Otherwise, its just one overtrumped human tragedy after another. I advise anyone who reads more than Harlequinn books to stay clear of this sap"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm going to be ill","review":"Pat Conroy's Beach Music would be a lot shorter if he cut out all of the adjectives and ridiculous similes. With the exception of the descriptions of the Holocaust, I found the story and characters to be unbelievable, over the top, insipid, melodramatic. The book certainly provoked an emotional response - I kept wanting to throw it across the room. Conroy must make himself sick writing all that saccharine prose. BLECH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, breathtaking writing!","review":"Though probably not his greatest story, Conroy's lyrical prose literally sings from beginning to end. With characters that are both pathetic and thoroughly lovable, Beach Music takes each reader on an epic journey back to the roots of his childhood. You'll laugh, cry and hate it for ending. A \\"must read.&quot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Depressing!","review":"Beach Music is one big whine. Bad parents, bad marriage, bad life, except for the daughter. Couldn't finishit. Not enough good to get over all the depressing life stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it?","review":"I've failed to finish two books in my life. This is one of them. I loved Prince of Tides and The great Santini. I closed this mess after 300 pages of diologe.How could this book get 4 or 5 stars? I don't get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach Music may be the worst book that I have ever read.","review":"So much of this book was unbelievable, beginning with the characters' names - Ledare, Shyla, Tee, John Harlan, Dallas - what kind of names ARE those? The scene with the four friends lost at sea for two weeks was completely unbelievable, and became laughable when the boys were rescued by holding on to the antler of a swimming deer that led them home. The scene where Jack was in the hospital bathing his mother and shampooing her hair because she had become violently ill;shouldn't he have called a nurse? It's frightening that such a book could become a best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is terrible","review":"I have read all of Conroy's previous work except \\"The Boo\\" and this takes the cake. He needed a better editor. How he does run on. What DIDN'T happen in this book? Suicide, the Holocaust, the Vietnam War, horrible dysfunctional childhoods, where no one loves their parents... There are so many alternating themes - any ONE of them explored in greater depth and with tighter writing would have made a better story. It was boring. I can't tell you how many pages I skipped over.If you want to read a really great Southern writer, read William Styron, especially \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\". I have always thought Conroy ripped off that plot (certainly elements of it) for \\"Prince of Tides\\". The deal is that Styron did it first and much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best holocaust descriptions ever..","review":"Beach Music would seem an unlikely title for holocaust material, yet this is but one of four intricately woven plotlines in Pat Conroy's terrific book. It takes inordinate skill to combine romance, history, family dissension, and prison camp \\"memories\\" into a cohesive novel. Don't start this book if you have lots of housecleaning to do or a job to show up for. It's very, very hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I found that I couldn't even finish this book. The author has a beautiful narrative style, but I found nothing to like in any of the characters in this book. Jack was a whiner, his mother was a melodramatic pain in the butt, and the daughter was just TOO TOO precocious. The alcoholic father was a caricature. The draft dodger turned priest was just TOO noble. Everyone in this book was some kind of extreme. Enough already... if I want this kind of story, I'll watch for a movie-of-the-week. There are far better writers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat Conroy, Beach Music","review":"Totally captivating! I sat on my couch throughout the last few chapters, unable to put the book down, crying the entire time. Beach Music is the story of every ordinary family and their dirty little secrets. It is a true account of an average family that has the honesty to admit that they are far from the perceived \\"normal.\\"Pat Conroy has managed to blend together events that do not affect many people, with family emotions and betrayals that everyone can relate to on more than one level.Rich or poor, small town or city dwellers, it really doesn't matter. This story will grip your heart with it's honesty about families and what goes on behind closed doors"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best reading I have ever experienced.","review":"The rich language, real characters, and emotional storyline of Beach Music had me so enthralled on a recent trip to Europe that I neglected my exciting and historic surroundings for a full two days, living only for the world of Jack McCall. I was so involved in the story that I've already read the book twice, and will read it again and again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing it only cost me 25 cents at a library sale....","review":"because this book was a huge disappointment from an author like Pat Conroy. It started eloquently, but the dozens of sniping, nasty arguments between family members soon became annoying and I began to skip over those pages. So much of it was improbable: everybody was the most beautiful woman, the most handsome man, the most attractive child - nobody looks ordinary in this town? These characters didn't behave like real people for most of the book, and the worst of all was the totally over-the-top courtroom scene at the end. If it made no sense for these adults to gather in the first place, it made even less sense for them to stay and participate. If I hadn't been on vacation with only this book to read, I would have chucked it after about 200 pages, even though Conroy can be very nicely and evocatively descriptive of places and events. I guess those nuggets were what kept me going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully slow","review":"This is the first book I have read by Pat Conroy, and more than likely it will be the last. Actually I didn't read the whole thing because it was so drawn out and dull. Trying to get into this book was almost painful. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised by the positive reviews","review":"This book was a selection for a book club I am in. I honestly couldn't get past page 152. The dialogue was phony and unrealistic. Conroy tries to set the stage for the revealing of some hidden secrets (allusion to a crime committed by one of his high school friends, causing the friend to flee the U.S., for example), but I just didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful, dull slog thru first 400 pages.","review":"This was my first Conroy book and it will be my last. The only reason that I stuck with the book through he first 400 painful and dull pages was because my sister in law, whom I respect, recommended this book to me. The characters are flat and nasty for the most part - a bad combination. Pat Conroy would have flunked any high school grammer test and I was entirely sick of his clumsy similes. The low point for me was when a female character in the book, who barely escaped the holocaust and retained her European Jewish childhood culture, used the words \\"did me\\" to describe her rape by enemy soldiers.The only reason this deserves any stars is for the final 150 or so pages when the main characters come together to face the truth about their lives and feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"language delicacy to be savored","review":"I am not even 10% into this book and i could not wait to share my felings. This may be the most beautifully written book I have ever read. Conroy is truly a masterful conductor of the English language and i am amazed he has no shortages of adverbs and adjectives. AND its got a lot of wit to make it funny. what a beautiful cocktail of a read. I highly recommend this book whch i found after I used the word music as a search word. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the bookshelf","review":"My favourite of Pat Conroy's novels. I found this book in an airport departure lounge... and after reading the first few lines just had to buy it. It did not disappoint me. I have read it about five times and each time I find more magic in it. I am not sure what or why it holds so much value for me, but it is now an old friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Conroy's best","review":"I was so excited that a new book by Conroy came out that I bought the hardcover edition-- and after I was finished, took it to a second hand bookstore to salvage what I could from it. Especially after reading \\"The Lords of Discipline\\" and \\"The Prince of Tides\\" this novel very disappointing. He needed a good editor to rein him in, and try to contain some of the story lines. In a way I think that Conroy was too ambitious-- there were probably two or three good novels contained within this one rambling plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous melodrama","review":"I read this book after a friend highly recommended it. What a huge disappointment! I didn't find a single character believable, let alone likeable--and Lord knows there is a huge cast of characters in this book. Jack McCall's whiny \\"my family ruined my life and I'm so bitter\\" routine got old after the first couple of chapters. The story line is so wrought with over-the-top tragedy that I just couldn't get drawn into it. Several flashback sequences--particularly the suffering of the Jewish characters in Europe--added absolutely nothing to the story except bulk.I loved The Lords of Discipline and The Great Santini, but Pat Conroy has lost a fan with Beach Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Everything that Pat Conroy writes is good to me.....this kept my attention and I enjoyed the story line. The book shipped fast and I have absolutely no complaints!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ","review":"This is my favorite book in the world. I have read it numerous times, and I never grow tired of Conroy's beautiful writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destined to be a Classic of Southern Literature","review":"Having recently finished Beach Music, I find myself wishing the experience had never ended. Conroy writes some of the finest descriptions I have ever read because of his keen eye and ear for detail combined with his virtuosic control of the language. Therefore, Conroy is able weave a seamless narrative that captures the essence of the South--and Rome for that matter--as few others can. A joy to read and to experience. I give this book my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Prince of Tides","review":"While I consider The Prince of Tides to be the most magnificent, moving, involving book ever written, it has taken me over 2 years to finish Beach Music. The characters are remarkably one-dimensional, borderline comic (just look at all the male characters and see how easily you can describe each in ten words or less). Instead of a novel, the endless monologues and reflections on everything from the Holocaust to Vietnam read more like history, and forced down the reader's throat with only tangential relevance to the plots. The witless putdowns between the many characters (how many hundreds are there, by the way?) were sophomoric. And the endless references to how beautiful and handsome everyone was.. it was just too much. The survivors of wars and horror are merely caricatures that speak in 10-page paragraphs, truly boring the reader with way too much detail. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rich, Compelling Story","review":"I have a problem choosing my favorite book between Pat Conroy's Prince of Tides or Beach Music. Both are rich in incredible story-telling with characters you grow to love and hate. Reading Beach Music drew me into the life and detail of living in the quaintness and cruelty of South Carolina's personae. Then, equally living a whole new life experience in Venice, Italy. As the story continued I became deeply absorbed into the characters' nuances and demons. I found my self sobbing, then bursting into laughter at the turn of a page. No one does it better than Pat Conroy. This book is definitely one of his best! You won't be sorry to add this to your collection! Buy it in hard cover. You'll want to revisit it again and certainly share with others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't bear to finish","review":"I'm on page two hundred and this book is going nowhere very slowly. The characters are one-dimensional cliches and the dialogue is laughable. Conroy spends more words implying and contriving tensions than actually developing believable conflicts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darling of the South","review":"I have read a lot about Pat Conroy, and read a lot BY Pat Conroy, and having met him in person, one of nearly thousands who stood in line for a signature to go along with my copy of Beach Music, I must say, I believe he is the Darling of the South. We have embraced him, and hopefully encouraged him to tell his story intertwined with ours. My only disappointments with each book come as I read the last word on the last page; I always want more. Thank you Mr. Conroy, for your fine writing, for your fabulous personality, for your amazing gift of storytelling, but most of all, for your honesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Messed With My Head!","review":"Beach Music really messed with my head and my heart, and not many books can do that to me. So, I'm giving it a full 5 stars. At first I thought it would take a long time to read the 766 pages of this novel, but since I had a hard time putting it down, and it just kept calling me back to it, I read it much faster than I thought I would. Mystery, betrayal, love, grief, hate, joy, Conroy's special blend of humor in the midst of tragedy--just about every emotion a human can have is evoked in this addictive novel. Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Read","review":"Having just spent a week in the low country I thought Conroy paints a masterful portrait of the South Carolina coast warts and all. The dialogue is fantastic. Perhaps I've tries a bit too hard to achieve redemption for all, but it is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"SELLER AND ITEM REVIEW","review":"REC'D BOOK PROMPTLY AND IN CONDITION STATED. VERY SATISFIED WITH SELLER AND TRANSACTION. THANK YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most enjoyable books I have ever read!","review":"Definately Conroy's best! An excellent story with very good characters. Conroy's ability to convey beautiful sights and smells and emotions is absolutley wonderful! While containing some difficult moments, it's not as wrenching as POT or Great Santini. Great views on life in So. Carolina and Italy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beach Music -- will there be a sequel?","review":"I was actually sad when this fabulous book ended! Please write a sequel so all of us will learn about the continuing lives of the main characters! I found myself wanting to underline a number of items, especially the quote about Republicans and racists -- too funny! This poignant book reached me to the depth of my soul, especially when coming to terms of dealing with a seemingly dysfunctional mother and family. I have read all of Pat Conroy's magical novels and now look forward to reading his newly published cookbook!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. It brings new meaning to the words forever love. The love shown from father to daughter, father to mother and brother to brother is outstanding and heart felt. I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys a good cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"high marks for language and drama","review":"While I am completely taken with Conroys use of language, I am concerned that some readers think this is the best book American literature has to offer. Try some Hemingway and Fitzgerald for comparison. Conroy has a magical gift for metaphors and 'turning a phrase', but characters that seem critical drop out for years (and pages) only to reappear magically a few chapters later. The plot was very complex and dramatic. But the turning points and character motivations were not always clear. The dialog was excellent. The setting of the scene was descriptive and colorful. Overall I think the book is somewhat uneven. Mr. Conroy might consider working with a very strict, but sympathetic, editor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Kindle Edition","review":"Too bad Amazon didn't put any quality control into the Kindle version of this magnificent book. I struggled on every page, with spelling, incorrect punctuation, and wrong words. Took a lot of the joy out of reading the book. This is not my first Kindle book, but by far the most disappointing. Come on, Amazon, you can do better than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This is my favorite book that I have EVER READ!! (and I read a lot) I didn't want it to end. I have recommended to every \\"reader\\" I come across. This is a must read-two or three times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"heartfelt","review":"This book sinks it's teeth into the characters. You get to know them and begin to feel for them like they were part of your life. I was very upset when it was over. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Grief","review":"Even had the ill-conceived and clumsily executed musical choices (inserted for whatever reason) been eliminated, I don't think this book could have been saved. It's difficult for me not to complete a book once begun, but this particular novel was a torture. The word \\"fatuous\\" comes to mind. I wish I'd read reviews before beginning the audio book. Only the fact that I was on the road with nothing better to listen to kept me going. I suggest you not start it; just enjoy the critical reviews, consider them a form of Cliff's Notes, and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book about Love","review":"Beach Music is a book about Love. Love between brothers, children and parents, parents and children, love between friends, love for your childhood, food, love for a life lived intensively. A bridge between the old Europe and the South of the U.S. And a way to tell a prejudiced european that interesting, worthwhile americans do exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"I enjoyed this book, but why did Conroy rename Beaufort SC and call it Waterfort? Is he ashamed of his hometown? Or is he afraid of a lawsuit? The story line tries to justify terrorism in the name of \\"social justice.\\" I suspect Conroy is a left-leaning liberal. Dispite all this, I still enjoyed the book because it catches the feel of the Low Country area of SC. After living here for 10 years, I now understand what Low Country means: low elevations (of course), low expectations, low income, low standards, low test scores, and low intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're crazier than John Hardin if you like this book. . .","review":"Finished the book but grew tired of the flowery prose, idealistic characters and unrealistic plots, the self-indulgence of Jack and the perfect women in his life (Leah, Shyla, Lehare, Lucy), the not-so-witty banter among family and friends, the portrayal of the South as if the people were so unique and from another galaxy...The list can go on, but really, I wasted enough time on this book; I'm eager to move on to something that touches me rather than annoys me."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 pages of promise followed by 700 pages of drivel...","review":"I have to say this must be his worst book in my experience since it was so bad I couldn't finish it...and like an unwanted chore that really had to be done, I really, REALLY tried to finish it...but it finished by being chucked into the garbage...For 100 pages it is the beginning to an excellent book, then gets lost in a vague fog inhabited by two dimensional traumatized characters and a vague theme of meeting the most vile abusers in our lives and kissing them on both cheeks because they are us. If this book were a meal I would stick a finger down my throat and extract every word. This book is poison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Pat Conroy at his very, VERY best.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!!","review":"One minute I was laughing hysterically the next, I was crying. I could not stop listening to the audio version. It is a wonderful example of storytelling. Peter MacNichol captured your attention the entire time you are listening to the audio version. He is an excellent dramatical reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give this a 0 if it were offered.","review":"I started with the book, gave it up after Jack's return home to see his dying mother.With all the whining about their broken childhood, there was nothing believable about this gathering of siblings. Beach Music was selected for our Book Group this year, so I thought I'd try to get through the audio tapes. Now I'm trying to remember what I liked about The Prince of Tides. Was I duped by some masterful storytelling? I'm so disappointed with Beach Music, that I can't bear the thought of trying The Lords of Discipline. Enough of overwrought plot, flowery prose, sacrastic and soul-less characterizations. Turn up the Muzak! It will be more stimulating than finishing Beach Music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who really wrote this?","review":"One of the few Pat Conroy novels I had never read, and the only one in stock in my local library. I sat down and read the prologue. Classic Conroy, beautifully written...I couldn't wait to get home and dig in.200 pages later, I was forcing myself to keep turning the pages, embarrassed for the author's Harlequinesque dialogues and disappointing stereotypical characters. Among other problems, the constant cooking references were overdone and out of place...perhaps he was trying to prime his audience for his upcoming cookbook?I just can't recommend this at all. Apparently he gave his all in the prologue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt like my time was wasted.","review":"Conroy's talents have turned to trying to make a quick buck, trailing on his other great works.

But after 300 pages of rambling with virtually nothing revealed (why the heck DID that one guy flee the country and become a priest? -- If I had to read another allusion to that I was going to throw the book in the fire! Get on with it already and let the reader know what's going on!) I just couldn't face another 500 pages.I found each character more annoying than the last. Why is it, for example, that every woman in this book is such a mythical creature? -- They're all beautiful, headstrong, articulate, slim, sexy -- who are these people?I could go on and on, but this book doesn't deserve such attention.

Every sentence is pure perfection, and Pat Conroy's story is both soothing and enchanting. The people who don't enjoy it are hurried, impatient people who cannot bear an 800 page novel. It is a long read, but only because you don't want it to ever end, and when it does you will never find a book that comes close to touching it. After reading it, I wanted everyone I knew to read it so that they too could share in the magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down, it was great!","review":"This book was just like The Prince of Tides. I couldn't put it down, it cast a spell on me to keep reading. I wanted to just keep going and never stop, and I am glad that it turned out to be such a great book.

It was the selection of the month for my book club, it had come highly recommended by astute friends and most customer reviews were oozing with praise. I did NOT like \\"Beach Music\\" however, not even a eentsy-weentsy bit. Here're but a few of my quibbles with the book:. It's far too long and contains too many sub-plots. \\"Succinct\\" appears not to be an adjective Conroy understands.. The characters all are pulchritudinous. Ah, but to balance that, Conroy makes them all crazy and/or conflicted.. John Hardin, the brother with schizophrenia,is portrayed in the most demeaning, stereotypical manner. Conroy should be hung by his toenails for contributing to the misunderstanding of and stigma surrounding this serious mental illness.. The \\"Purple prose\\" becomes blatantly boring after a very short while. I truly am sorry I wasted so much time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book... first time Conroy reader but never again","review":"syrupy, uninteresting, unbelievable, and stupid, characters are not likeable esp main character.

A great read for men and women alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better things to do with your time than read this!","review":"Reading these reviews makes me sad. This novel is truly bad and about 700 pages too long. It is about one-dimensional characters who are grown adults but cannot stop blaming their parents for being humans. The dialog is downright silly and embarrassing. The writing is honestly so verbose, its like someone vomited words over the pages. The forced silly imagery (he compares the sight of the Carolina marshes to table lines for heaven's sake) is something I would expect from a bad piece of high school writing.

A real yawner.","review":"I am a huge Pat Conroy fan, therefore I was most disappointed in his latest novel. His beautiful way with words is unflagging, but the plot and characters left much to be desired. I kept plugging along, expecting the book to pick up and pull me in, until finally I had to give up. I just lost all interest. None of the characters was remotely likeable, and much of the dialogue was far fetched. Ponderous and dull, this book is a real yawner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!

This book however is the worst in an otherwise stellar group. All of the characters are so far over the top it makes the story terribly unbelievable. This book was not just fiction it was science fiction. The only reason I gave it one star was because I did not find a choice for zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was surprised at the language in this book.","review":"When you read a few pages and enjoy and book, or you go to a movie and get interested in the movie, and then they interject the vulgarity, that ends it for me.

The story resolution couldhave perhaps been a little different and perhaps not so hokkyand pretictable, but nonetheless, the cost and the entertainmentfor the cost was exceptional. A great summer book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing - This is NOT Prince of Tides.","review":"Pat Conroy has written a book with unbelievable characters, story lines, and dialogue. Children do not speak, act, or think the way the 9-year-old character in this book does. Actually no one speaks this way or with this vocabulary. Who uses \\"aplomb\\" in a sentence? Melodramatic characters is putting it mildly. I gave this book a fighting chance, but then gave up on it.

The recipes are simple and provide some good ideas for someone who might be learning how to cook in response to a newly diagnosed corn allergy..... HOWEVER the fact that this book seems to be designed for those who don't already know the basics of cooking it is dangerous in it's lack of thoroughness when discussing lurking corn additives.As an example, cream cheese most often contains a corn derivative and yet is used in some of the recipes. Consumer (of the book and the food) beware!This is a good supplement provided the reader has already done some research and is somewhat well versed in hidden corn.

If you cook, you don't need this book. They are literally just giving you extremely simple recipes that don't include corn which you can do all on your own. On top of that they have mayo in a lot of the recipes (mayo has corn in it) yet they give you a recipe for ketchup (hunts ketchup is corn free).They also don't give practical advice at all.

Forget it. In the first twenty minutes I completely lost interest - the acting was actually well below par for a high school production, and Madsen hardly in it. Apparently the director, Christopher Forbes, is turning out quick and amateurish productions with his buddies in most of the roles and a known name to headline. (See the review here on Amazon for \\"All Hell Broke Loose\\" \\"starring\\" the late David Carradine. I didn't write it, but it sums up this movie too.) The cover for this dog has a 'review' something like \\"3:10 to Yuma rides up against True Grit.\\" If there's a \\"con\\" in getting you to purchase or rent a movie, this package is it.

The really odd and frightening stuff is in the full Bukhari version. One never knows with these collections what hazrat Mohammad really said since they were collected 150-200 yrs after he lived and are subject to the collators preconceptions about what Mohammad would, in fact, have said.

The author himself strictly speaking is not a proponent of Haddith and belonged to a neo-colonial religious movement known as Qadiani which has since the gaining of independence by the Indian sub-continent has been exposed as a non-muslim movement. Inbetween the message, author Muhammad Ali proposed a general shift by Muslims from their adherence to the Haddith of the Holy Prophet to the new social order advanced by the prophet of Qadiani the Mirza Ghulam Ahmedi. -bin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Qadianis are non-muslim","review":"I would be very very careful about buying this book, especially since so many other excellent translations of hadith exist.

As proof that the practice exam in the back of the book is pretty good, I got 87% correct on the practice exam, and I got 85% and 90% correct on the two actual A+ sections. I would consider the practice exam in the back to be a good guide as to whether you're ready to take the actual A+ exam.While I found the book to be an excellent, info-filled guide, there were several points that were unnecessary confusing. For example, throughtout the book the authors refer to conventional memory as the first megabyte of memory, even though every other source will tell you that it's the first 640k of memory. Facts like that should be clear-cut, not left up to the opinions of the authors.

Although, there are MANY, let me repeat that, MANY mistakes in the practice test in the back, as well as a few other errors, but the practice test is a test in itself, while you are correcting the authors! So, if you want a good reading book, and feel like correcting mistakes, and not getting paid for it, this book is for you.

It kept talking about oldtechnologies like the 8086 to 80486. It barely had anything on Pentium chips. There was nothing about Pentium II and Pentium !!! processors or anything from AMD or Cyrix. The memory they talked about was obsolete and I don't think it was even revised for the new test (after summer 1998).

I feel that I would have done much better on the exams if I had studied the A+ Exam Prep book also, which goes into more detail and has hands-on projects for those with no experience. I would highly recommend using both the A+ Exam Cram and Exam Prep, along with the Flash Cards and Practice Tests if you want a high score, but if you are happy with the 70's, then Exam Cram along with its flash cards and practice tests will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Core only?","review":"Although I read this book and must say, it was more than enough info for the core module.

However in their defense it was relevant info for the big picture of computer knowledge. I also studied peter nortons win 98 book and other books. Overall I studied much more than I needed to for the exam. The hardware part was fair. The windows/dos part was more challenging. As others mentioned, know your windows3.1 and 95 well and know how to get around. For me hands on experience was a major factor in me passing/ 84 on both tests.

Home Alone 2 was just as good, maybe even better, since it was the same actors and everything. However this Home Alone, Home Alone 3, is utterly disgusting. Its very upsetting to see a movie that has nothing at all to do with the first two movies have the same name and make the movies a trilogy. This movie and the other two movies are opposites, and they should not have let them call this movie \\"Home Alone 3.\\" This Home Alone has truly tarnished the Home Alone name, and should never have been released. The plot was horrible, and it was a horrible imitation of the first Home Alone. Please do not waste your time buying this movie or even seeing it, since its a waste of 2 hours of your life. I regret seeing this movie, and this movie should be banned in America. The Home Alone name will never be the same, and that is very sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Home Alone","review":"It was better than the first two!

If you are looking forward to the booby traps, don't...they are even faker than the second movie's traps. The way they work is so amazingly unrealistic that you can't suspend disbelief. The villians (four, not two this time) were not funny, and neither was the kid, who sounded like a diseased animal before death and without any acting ability. if I could rate this film differently, here's how it would go:Home Alone 3 (1997)Starring: Cast of unknowns who should have stayed that wayRated: R (Retarded)(Not suitable for any audience)P.S. one can sum up this film in a common film critic clique: total crapP.P.S. Scarlett Johansson should not have chosen to put this turd of a movie to her filmography. Bad choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worthy of the Home Alone Name","review":"I find myself asking myself why this movie was ever made. It has absolutely nothing to do with the previous two magical movies (no Macauley Culkin - or more importantly Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern). The makers of this disaster must have wanted to appeal to those few who were tired of the original movies. No one involved in the first two bothered to show up and for good reason. When Macauley Culkin grew out of the role, no one should have even bothered to resurrect the franchise. The young kid had no life (Mac had more magic in his little toe than Alex does). The three crooks are inane; a woman was also introduced which does not help. The point being: ditch this abomination and stick with the first two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many Home Alone movies","review":"You know, I never really thought the first two were THAT great (McCaulay Culkin can NOT act!) but they were, at least, humorous diversions. This third installment in the series was a total bomb. How many times do they think they can keep making the same movie before people are going to catch on?!? Besides, without the same untalented and annoying kid playing the central role, it just wasn't the same. Don't buy this movie. Buy the first one. Buy the second one, if you must.

I'm not sure if I've ever seen a movie worse than this, to be fair. When you have a lead actor that can't handle a part and brings nothing to the table, you're in for a disastrous 90 min film.

These guys have an 80's vibe and incorporate such seemingly disparate influences as Brian Wilson and Tom Petty and even maybe A-Ha. Very clever lyrics, \\"Mom's In Love Again (With My Girlfriend)\\" is an absolute hoot, I giggle every time I hear this sick lyric (seems like more and more groups are exploring odd pairings like FOW and BC Camplight) with great melody and humor.

I am fairly easy to please in the romance novel dept. so this is difficult for me to say~ but this book did not meet my expectations for it. The cover is beautiful and the historical premise is fascinating and well researched. Where I found fault was the actual writing itself. The opening sentence, \\"The air was cold and damp.\\" is not too far from \\"It was a dark and stormy night.\\" The plot is fine but the descriptions are lacking innovation. There is far too much \\"telling\\" -- a writer's term for not showing enough through the actions of the characters. Instead they used narrative far too much when I would have rather seen the descriptions shown through the actions and dialogue of the characters. If one wants to read about this particular time in the reign of Elizabeth it would be helpful and fun to read for that reason. As a romance however, there are others that are more original in their descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating phones","review":"I would not recommend these phones. They beep and turn off constantly. I can only guess it is because I have wireless internet in my house.

The only reason I have not returned the phones is because my children threw away the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Garbage!!!","review":"I purchased this phone about 1 1/2 years ago and it finds new ways to fail me every couple of months. All batteries are about shot, there is a lot of static in the sound, and the display is faded and no longer provides a legible caller ID. The display looks like foreign symbols of a language from a distant land, maybe Shangri-La. Due to my frustration with this product, I have strongly considered deactivating my home phone service. I usually do not go out of my way to comment on a product unless I am extremely pleased or dissatisfied with its performance. Going out of my way to write a review about this product so that others do not make a similar mistake, is apart of my moral obligation to society. I do have other VTech products that work exceptionally well. This phone should've probably been more thoroughly tested before entering the market for sale. DO NOT PURCHASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm throwing it out","review":"We bought this phone b/c a previous vtech phone served us well. This one, however is just missing too many key features that I took for granted. For instance, there is no speaker phone feature (was great for when I was put on hold) and the ringer volume control only works if you press it WHILE the phone is ringing, and then resets to \\"loud\\" for the next call - in my house the phone keeps waking up the baby and I can't set any handset or the base to silent mode. Also, switching to pick up call waitibg is a crapshoot, you never know if you will disconnect one or both people. If you want a totally stripped down phone, this might work for you. For anyone else, it's a step down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"Very unhappy with item.

I was soooo wrong. These phones should have come with a check paying me to try them. Like the other reviewer - I threw away the box so I couldn't return them. Also, if one phone is dying, you can't just pick up another phone - you have to 'transfer' the call. The worst part came after we owned the phones for three weeks: after about four minutes of talk time the phone goes to complete static. I guess it cuts down on my long-distance calls!Bottom line - I would NOT buy this set again."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible phone","review":"I should have read the reviews before I bought this phone.

There is very little of the obligatory hollywood bs, and your girlfriend will probably fall asleep in the first 20 minutes. Steve McQueen probably would have made this movie for free.As far as the Blu-ray conversion goes, this is definitely a few steps over the DVD (i have both), and probably about as good as you can expect from any movie that wasn't shot in 1080.My only question is, how did CBS wind up with the rights to this one? What was the last show that CBS had that was even marginally watchable???

If they tried to make this film today it wouldn't be as good with phony computer graphics. What you get here is real crashes and true racing, no cheesed out special effects. Mcqueen captures the essence of the International Auto Racer. Mcqueen was an excellent racer in real life who fancied Porshes. -Eduard Scott Bales"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"Great movie. Steve McQueen is great in it. The classic battle between the porsche 917 and ferrari. A treat if you were a race fan or a kid in the 1970's. Also if you are a fan of porsche, you will enjoy this.

Not really. But it is a 5-star racing movie. And the BluRay is a genuine surprise.I was expecting a typical (read: mediocre) catalog transfer, but was pleasantly surprised by what I got.

Reason: there doesn't appear to be anything extra on the DVD. This is one of the greatest racing movies of all time and there isn't any special features, so why would I get rid of my Laser Disc copy? I would like to see a \\"making of\\" documentary or perhaps interviews with the crew 30 years later. Speedchannel had a great documentary on this movie that should be included in the dvd. It had great stories from the film makers and Steve McQueen's son. I'm just a little disappointed in Paramount and the movie's release to DVD. This great movie deserves more than just being on the new format."},{"rating":"2","title":"what we've been waiting for","review":"A great version of the best racing film ever made. The video upgrade is amazing, you can see every detail of every curve on the 917 and ferrari's screeching down the straights. The color is amazing. The sound overall is not great, comparable to the VHS version. The quiet scenes have a great track to them though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discerning Formula","review":"LE MANS is a passionate yet esoteric film about the 24 hours of Le Mans. Racing and the exhilaration of speed are Steve McQueen's passions and these come through in his inimitable screen presence. However, without a genuine story scripted out, the film remains static for some viewers. Yet, visually it has a quixotic and very dynamic approach to its documentary style of filming and subject matter, which is the allure and fascination for the majority of viewers. McQueen's only motivation for anything he does in this film is summed up by his comments that in effect racing is life and everything in between is just waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Le Mans","review":"Very weak plot (none), fantastic car film work.

I'm rating it two stars not because it's bad. It's just because this is almost a doccumentary, not a movie. There is absolutely NO acting, no dialogues. The few times the cast open their mouths arwe for some contrieved and dull dialogues (although they do their best clearly). The movie is an endless line of cars chasing cars and chasing cars. If you're an auto-racing fan (like myself), it's clear you'll enjoy the sequences. But, if you are not biased, you'll notice clearly why this movie bombed at the box office.It's not a bad movie at all!! It's a GREAT Movie. But, unfortunately, it has no actor nor dialogues."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will bore you indefinitely....","review":"The photography is really amazing, but the movie is simply boring. Al least, at the end the victory goes to Larry Wilson, not for Steve \\"Michael Delaney\\" McQueen, what is a good turn to the movie. (The POrsche cars wew driven by pilots such as Jacky Ickx).The idea of this movie was to document the suspense, drama, power and energy of a 24-hour race at Le Mans (the 1970 edition. It accomplished its purpose, but it's not a great movie experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"too boring to watch","review":"Well, so I expected a story with the famous race as a background. Wrong, no plot, and probably less than 5 minutes of dialogue in the entire movie ( if you don't count the background Le Mans announcer, incongruously speaking English). Now, maybe a documentary about the race would be OK; but this movie did not have either the continuity or the information content of a documentary. Just endless clips of cars buzzing around, punctuated by the occasional crash. The only place in the movie I was curious -- when Steve McQueen's character ended up behind a non- racing regular driver going about 30 mph (why was this car on the road?) they did not answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real life","review":"The best racing film made to date. If you are looking for \\"Days of Thunder\\" don't look here. This is a historically correct presentation of the LeMans race during the height of the Sports Car era, starring someone who actually knew how to race. Factory vs. Factory - Porsche vs. Ferrari. Great footage, great effects. The use of slow motion footage forces the viewer to understand the brutality of the crashes and comprehend how dangerous racing in this era truly was. If you've ever spent time in the pits during endurance races, you will immediately feel at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"Awesome film, great acting. Classic.

Trashed by pencil-necked critics at the time of its initial release or condemned with \\"faint\\" praise by others who \\"wanted more of a story line\\" (!?!?), I don't think its ever received its due. If its a complicated tale of moral ambiguity you seek - put on \\"The Wild Bunch.\\" If you're a car person, though, and the sounds and sights of Porsche 917s and Ferrari 512s howling down the Mulsane Straight flat out in excess of 240 MPH doesn't move you - well, check your pulse!!!

I bought this movie and for what I paid, I am content to an high level. McQueen, I think, uses too much drama to try and create rivalry between drivers and establish a good plot (I will never agree that he ever achieves a true plot in the movie, or at least a good one). It's worth buying if you like to see true racing cars, including Porsche and Ferrari, battle it out until the very end. Surprising ending.

Unlike fellow countrymen Jeanloup Sieff and Patrick Demarchelier - both masters in photographing the nude - Jonvelle's images are sophomoric, lacking in sensuality, poetry, originality, and subtlety. The photographs are simply trite, at best. Jonvelle's attempts at titillation or playfulness are far from eliciting a joie de vivre but instead, translate easily into the mundane. There is one positive note in regard to this debacle of derrieres: the book is thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive women almost make up for the poor quality","review":"Most of the women in this book are very attractive. I've nothing more to say of a positive nature.Jonvelle would benefit from a college photography course, because his grainy, washed out photographs are completely lacking of even the most basic technical quality. This is annoying and distracting, and the beautiful women in these pages deserve better.And it appears Jonvelle is striving for sexy pictures, but the harder he tries, the more contived and raunchy the result.

Even though it said to use day or night, I waited until night time. I woke up several times during the night with extreme burining and itching - much worse than the initial yeast infection. It is now mid day and I am completely devestated. The pain is almost umbearable. I showered to try to get relief and am still in pain. I sent my husband to the store for the 7-day treatment.

Inconclusion, a completely useless and painful \\"solution\\" to a yeast infection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liquid fire","review":"I don't know if it's good or bad that I'm not the only one with this horrible reaction. You might as well be inserting liquid fire. It is definitely not worth it and I can't imagine how effective it could be when all you are trying to do to get the medicine OUT. It really causes excruciating pain and it should come with a big warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again!!!","review":"I usually purchase the 3-day treatment and it has definitely worked in the past. This time around I wanted to nip it in the bud and decided to try the one day. Never again. I just had a very subtle irritation which has now turned into severe itching and burning. All I want to do is sit in a bath tub filled with cold water. This is pure torture. I had to purchase Vagisil Wipes extra strength for itching in order to function and that really worked. I hope the itching goes away soon. Ugggggghhhh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"I've never written a review in my life. I had to do this if you try Monistat 1 to take the easy way out.. I can honestly tell you its like dipping your vagina in Satan's water!! You will want to RIP (literally) RIP your vagina out from in between your legs. Its like torture. Although it works it lasts about an hour or two. I tell you first hand please don't try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the pain","review":"If I could give negative stars, I would. I agree with the reviews that say that the 1-day applicator should be taken off the shelves, or at least come with warnings. There were no warnings on the Monistat website, just advice to use 1-day if you don't want to take medicine all week, and to use the ovule if you don't want leaking. Based on that, who wouldn't want to take it??? But now, here I am, a professional manager, debating missing work because the burning and itching that kept me up all night is keeping me from being able to sit on a chair. This product is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remove this from Shelves!!","review":"I am on Fire!!! I am going to have to go to the Dr. because this burning is unbearable!! I regret taking this product, it is so much worse than the infection symtoms itself. I am not sure how long this has been on the market but I hope they are reading all the reviews and forums regarding their product because there are so many uncomfortable women out there. How they passed inspection for this is beyond me. I have had an icepack on me and this is 2 days later and I am bright red and swollen shut. DON\\"T USE THIS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad, don't be scared by other reviews","review":"I have used Monistat in the past, 3 day and 1 day. I think how bad the infection is depends on how much it will burn to use it. I have had prescription cream that burns as much as monistat and I don't think it has anything to do with the brand.I usually use it at night when I go to bed, but today I bought the 1 day treatment for day or night. It stayed in place, it didn't burn and I feel it is working. Slight discharge, a little swollen and red but no itching. Mild mild burning sensation, but not fire and scary like these reviews I'm seeing. I have had that happen before when I have has a very bad infection or didn't take care of the infection immediately.Don't be scared to take Monistat, it works. If not, the doctor is your best place to go. Diflucan pills and cream work better than Monistat, but if you can't get into the doctor it will help."},{"rating":"1","title":"1200 MGs are you kidding me!?","review":"I DID NOT, I repeat DID NOT pay any attention to the fact that this version of the medication has twice the MGs of the 3-day and 7-day treatments! No wonder why we're all feeling like our vaginas are about to collapse! This one day treatment has 1,200MGs in it vs the 3-day having a total of 600MGs and the 7-day 700MGs. What was Monistat thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of crap....","review":"I bought this one time ovule, because I thought it would work and be over with, but I was sadly mistaken. It burns like crazy and the itching is worse than before I inserted the darn thing. The directions say you can use it either night or day, but sitting around with this goop coming out of you is no fun. I have always used it at night, but I thought I could get an early start on some relief. This is crazy! I feel like I've sprinkled hot sauce down in my underwear. It is unbearable! Stick to the five or seven day or even a three day would be better. I wonder if it'll work after all this. I'll let you know if I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NO NO NO NO NO NO","review":"I get regular (2/year) yeast infections and was too lazy to get a diflucan refill for my most recent one since it was so mild. Instead I tried this product since I had always had good experiences with the 3 and 7 day kits. After using it before bed, I woke up at 5am and thought my uterus was going to fall out - the burning was so so so so bad. If only I had read these reviews before using it. After a few hours of tossing and turning close to tears, it finally started to go away at least enough to sit at my desk at work all day. I ended up having to call my doctor for a visit and refill anyway. Bottom line - I wasted $20, lost 4 hours sleep, had to deal with unbearable burning, and had to go to the doctor anyway for a yeast infection that was worse than if I had just plain ignored it. NEVER AGAIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"I am sitting up at 4AM right now because I have such severe burning that is much worse than before I used the Monistat combination 1 pack. I have taken a hot shower to wash out as much as possible and it provided slight relief. I forgot that I had had a similar reaction in college to this stuff. I will not forget again and stick with Vagisil next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT","review":"I usually don't bother writing reviews for products...but I just HAD to for this one. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you want to TORTURE your vagina. I picked up the one day treatment as opposed to a 3 day treatment because I wanted to just take care of the problem and move on. I wish I had gotten the 3 day treatment instead. The itching and burning are worse than the actual infection was! The extra two days of treatment are WELL WORTH the time if you can avoid these sensations. I have never felt this miserable and uncomfortable before and am probably going to have to knock myself out to get to sleep. Not to mention the sensation of this gunk running out of you is unpleasant. Do yourself a favor, take the extra 2 days for treatment, and be kind to your lady business."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],C={key:0},W={key:1};function B(a,e,n,u,r,s){const m=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,c)=>(o(),p(m,{key:c,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,N)):v("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-8c69ebcd"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/18.md","filePath":"quotesmag/18.md"}'),j={name:"quotesmag/18.md"},F=Object.assign(j,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[b(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,F as default};
