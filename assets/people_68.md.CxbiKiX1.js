I'm sorry to say, though I am a fan of Withers and was completely knocked out by the tremendous concert, I feel very let down by this film. I thought it was poorly paced and edited. Though we see Withers in past clips and present events like his high school reunion, a reunion with the guys he served with in the Navy and the concert I mentioned, none of these events last more than a minute, all are cut away from awkwardly and fail to inform us about the man. The musicians who performed at the tribute briefly appear making some comment on his work, but it is so random and unclear, it has little effect. A visit to his home town and other later events, which I will let the viewer see, do begin to reveal Withers, but not enough for me. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"We want more on this DVD!","review":"Very enjoyable film that will indeed rekindle your interest in the man and his music.Its a shame they couldn't touch on his blackballing in the music industry, or his wife, but I assume those were issues that Mr. Withers made off-limits for his own reasons. Something tells me I may have heard this in an NPR interview with the directors a while back.Would be very nice if there was a deluxe DVD edition of this film with all the extras available--in particular performance footage, and any other new music. My biggest desire after seeing the film--and the highlight scene of him playing piano in the hotel, singing with his daughter--was to hear more of the music he has been keeping to himself for past 20 years. Of course, I'm not alone in this hope that it will one day all come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No market research is worth $3,500.00","review":"I have found cheaper market research on POS.

This book has no overt agenda and can be read by many different people, even men. It advocates breaking the silence of this serious issue. I find the interviews to be personally moving. Lightfoot- Klein does a great job at showing the health consequences of infibulation. And explains herself well for why this issue requires gradual change not instant change.

In this first episode, Payback's A Bitch we're introduced to childhood friends Cream, Warren a.k.a War and Drench. Cream is known for hustling hustlers, War is a big time womanizer and poor Drench is a broke weed head. The three friends are all products of their environment and find themselves in \\"the garden\\" preparing to extract revenge on a small time hustler.Just as the conspiracy opens up the readers are introduced to \`the Woman Hood' a sexy hit squad that deals payback instead of dope. The all female militia take a special interest in Cream and War.Payback's A Bitch is a terrific book with an assortment of drugs, sex, lies, betrayal, violence, politics and corruption.I particularly like the way Marcus Spears illustrates a sense of hope and planning to rebuild and restructure the hoods. I cannot wait to read more about the \`Woman Hood', they have me completely open.Reviewed by: Crystal"},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR PERFORMANCE HIGH PRICE","review":"I ORDERED THIS PART NUMBER AND THE ITEM I RECIEVED DOESNT RESEMBLE THE BLADE SHOWN HERE.

It is a shame that most of her music sounds and feels just like most of the rest of her music. There is little variance in the rhythym, harmony or subject matter. I purchase the CD for the rendition of \\"Will You Remember Me?\\" I was not disappointed. It is one of the few tracks that has a unique and piercing quality.

I don't like it. I was expecting (from comparisons) to hear a combination of DMB and ekoostik hookah. They ended being a terribly cheesy pop band. The highlights, musically, come from members who are not even in the band (saxophones). PMB's lyrics have absolutely no depth. It seems like they are trying to say something, but don't have an elegant way of putting it. This band however seems to have great musicianship, nothing special individually though. Too bad - I really wanted to like this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.

Now, we bought this at our local software store because it promised to be much better and faster than the '04 version. Me and my wife found both claims to be somewhat exaggerated. The difference between the '04 version and this '06 version is marginal and negligible at best. The problem of this application being a resource hog still there (taking more than 100Mb physical RAM and north of 20% CPU at times). Definitely not a good buy.

I came very close to returning it as per the 30 day option. In all the previous versions I could copy the clip art to use in other applications. This was one of main reasons for my purchasing a Hallmark product. I love their art---nothing compares to it. The change with this version does not allow you to copy the clip art directly into any other product than a Hallmark product.

The thing is, you really need to hear it LOUD to get the desired effect. Every song consists of, from start to finish, dark pulsing beats with subtle climaxes, breakdowns and a heap of fantastic SFX along the way. Be warned though, as one reviewer found out, this is no melodic trance act such as Astral. Although I think groups such as Astral Projection and Infected Mushroom are great, they create a much more melodic style of trance when compared with this. This stuff is much more minimal - just full-on pulsating drones and beats. The kind of stuff you want to be hearing at any good psi-rave at 4 in the morning.

I checked this out from the library because I have been hearing about Leonard's craft for some time. I don't know if it is the genre or what, but this book never gripped me. It was written well enough, but I had no connection with the characters and no real desire to spend time learning more about them. They seemed flat. I wanted to like this book.

I've read two books by Elmore Leonard, this one and \\"Maximum Bob\\". Neither impressed me. They weren't awful, just not good enough to spend money and time on in my opinion. That is not how I felt after reading Raymond Chandler for instance. One thing I did get a big kick out of in \\"Killshot\\" is the protected witnesses being sent to live in Cape Girardeau, Missouri and hating it.

Where's the Point?","review":"Disappointing effort by Oliver Nelson and Jimmy Smith to make this music come out fresh in a jazz environment. When Jimmy isn't playing and it's just the big band, the bow to the Prokofiev score is perfunctory and uninspired. With Jimmy, things get better, but too often he lapses into his standard riffs and signature hold-the-high-note gee-wizardry. It's Jimmy in his \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff\\" mode, minus anything new to say.It's a tough business, turning the classics into pop or jazz. A few years back Carlos Santana did a cool thing with an unpromising theme from the Brahms Third Symphony. Who knows when it will work? For it surely will, here and there. But it didn't on this Jimmy Smith outing. And at under 33 minutes of music, do you really want to pop for it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A TIMELESS STORY","review":"Mary Renault has vividly recreated the world of the actor in ancient Greece, set against a backdrop of love, betrayal, and war. As a part-time actor, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the similar traits of actors and practices in ancient Greece that still exist today.

A must read for actors, historians, and lovers of good fiction"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really breathes life into the ancient world","review":"This was a beautifully written novel. The pervasiveness of homosexual relationships depicted in the story eloquently exposes our own society's morals as arbitrary. Our customs were not established at the dawn of time nor are they immutable as we might suppose. Also the gods were portrayed as spirtually significant powers that really shaped lives. I have thought of them as entertaining mythical fantasies and assumed that the ancients, at least the educated, did as well. But their gods were as powerful and real to them as our God is to us. The colorful caste of characters- Roman soldiers, Gauls, Sicilians, and a few famous figures - really brought the ancient Mediterrannean world to life in all its variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Greek theatre, history and love","review":"No one has ever written historical novels of ancient Greece as Mary Renault has.

Ms Weems, in her honest sharing, has offered me a new perspective.

Dr. Weems","review":"Thank you! I, too, have experienced periods of \\"God silence\\" and longed to restore the closeness of that relationship. As I read this book I found myself repeatedly saying \\"Thank you for writing this book!\\" It has been balm to my soul. So often lay people expect clergy to be in constant connection to God, as if a clergyperson has some deep, unbreakable connection that laypeople aren't privy to. The truth is that clergy also have their times of doubt and spiritual desert, and it's important to take the time and space necessary to tend to the needs. Church-folk do not often understand this and are more likely to cast out those who are experiencing this painful lack of palpable spiritual connection rather than recognizing that in many cases this is evidence of clergy burn-out and in need of intervention.

There is a good amount of fighting on all these films, just not that great. Honestly, I would skip this set and get Shaolin vs Ninja(Heros of the East), Fist of Legend, Fearles, Ip Man, and all the Bruce Lee and Gordon Liu movies.I certainly do NOT give this a Highly Recommended rating...but it was a nice try..."},{"rating":"1","title":"After seeing Sarah Silverman","review":"and finding her very funny in short clips on other TV channels on South African satellite TV (DStv) these DVDs repulsed me.

I adore this show.In my humble opinion, Sarah Silverman is freaking hilarious. What she says is funny, but it's *how* she says it - subtle inflections and mannerisms - that makes her extraordinarily funny.And if you think that she is spewing vulgarities and bigotry just to get a few shock-giggles, you aren't paying enough attention. She is more morally-serious than you probably realize. She does these things to magnify absurdity--to make them ironic and dumb.And Brian and Steve... oh my, what a pair. Other than Troy and Abed on _Community_, I haven't seen a better dynamic between two characters.You won't find many (any?) shows as hilarious, conceptually interesting, and risky. May you make many more TV shows, Sarah Silverman."},{"rating":"2","title":"70's Classic","review":"This album has to be considered a 70's gem although I don't remember it getting much if any radio play. I used to see this album in record stores and wonder what it sounded like. Then I was at a friend's who had it. After listening to it I decided to buy one for myself. \\"On the Run\\", \\"Timebomb\\", and \\"Chasing Colours\\" are my favorites but there isn't a bad song on here. It's probably a different kind of rock then most people are used to but that's what made rock great--all the variety that you could still classify as rock and roll. This album definitely stands out as one of the better rock albums of the 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"i thought there weren't any difference, at all but when i got the cable and hook it up man was i wrong you hear more details than before is great a cable for $25"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good...","review":"I didn't have high expectations for this saw because it was [low in price] and the bottom of the Hitachi line, but I was pleasently surprised. It seems like Hitachi cut back on the accessories to get the price low, but the basic saw is really nice. It's pretty powerful, accurate and easy to use. It really is more useful with the optional extenders (Hitachi #317542) but you can jerry-rig something together on a table. Really a great value. Note the fact that this is not a compound saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subject to severe paper jams","review":"The 3500/3700 family has a good overall design using a vertical cartridge arrangement instead of the older rotating cartridge unit of the older 4500 family. THis should be a good printer like the excellent 4600 but unlike the 4600 the registration system in this machine is made of thin plastic parts and is subject to difficult to resolve paper jams. I advise you to spend a little more and get 4 times the printer with the HP4600. Its a little noisy but runs on and on. ITs the most reliable color laser ever built by man. Avoid this particular model at all cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Set of Enthralling Remixes","review":"Not much can be said about this groundbreaking set of re-mixed compositions by the Future Sound of London. It must be experienced. The incredible mixture of vocals and music gives each piece an organic feel. Each ambient mix gives the listener a feeling of being in the prescence of a large, moving beast; with many legs and made of several colors.The Lifeforms remix is one of the best examples of electronica. Buying this CD is a must for fans of this genre in particular and lovers of good music in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have addition for any FSOL Lifeforms fan","review":"Although this cd is presented as a single, it's actually a mini album in itself.

But, HUD was just the beginning of wonderful, talented actor. No movie is to short or to long for this actor. I saw HUD morning, noon and night but I did not want to wear the disk out so I'm giving it a rest. I would buy more staring this actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hud","review":"This is the movie that should have won Paul Newman the Oscar, but it was not to be. This is perhaps his most powerful performance, and the story is one of Larry McMurtry's best. The movie follows the book (called \\"Horseman Pass By\\") to the letter, and that is always good to see. I saw the movie when it first came out, and I had to have it for my collection to review over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Character Study","review":"Like him or not you got him. Paul Newman is HUD. He sees things through a world made moral to his own liking. In the modern Western Paul Newman is the anti-hero who we sort of admire yet ignores his motivations at the same time. HUD shows his dead brother's son played by Brandon De Wilde the ropes of life. In today's world of avarice and deceit I just wonder what moral ground HUD would stand on and be perceived. Brandon De Wilde gives a wonderful performance ranging from a nave idol worshiping nephew to that of a seasoned student to the lessons he learned. The choice of his future path is perhaps uncertain but yet perhaps not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who do we admire? That is what shapes us.","review":"Manipulative and unscrupulous, Hud Bannon doesn't care about anybody but himself. In stark contrast is Hud's father Homer, a cattle rancher and paragon of traditional values. Homer cautions his grandson Lonnie, who has come home drunk along with his uncle, not to emulate Hud, saying \\"little by little the look of the country changes because of the men we admire.\\" Lonnie must decide what kind of man he wants to be. He's tempted to emulate his Uncle Hud, a charmer who gets lots of women and is not bound by any moral sensibility, but he loves and respects his grandfather. Superb direction by Martin Ritt, an incredible cast turning out their career best performances, (this is what Paul Newman should have won the Oscar for), a great screenplay by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, and James Wong Howe's brilliant black and white cinematography, combine to make \\"Hud\\" a truly great American movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! This wonderful film on DVD.","review":"HUD, quite simply, has some of the best performances ever put on film by its four leading cast members: Paul Newman, Melvyn Douglas, Patricia Neal and Brandon De Wilde. Equally powerful is the black and white photography, which serves as the perfect background for the story and the performers. (B&W just can't be beat for some types of stories, and this is one of them.) Newman has never been given as much credit as he deserves, in my opinion, and he makes the tactless, self-centered, womanizing Hud come to life spectacularly. Patricia Neal, who won the Oscar for this, is amazing to watch, using her body language and her voice with consummate mastery. This film leaves you with an appreciation of how simple stories, handled by talented professionals, can pack a punch even forty years later. When compared to half of the \\"product\\" that's pumped out these days, HUD towers over most, propelled by character and story. Not a bad thing, if you ask me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Newman's Best Movie","review":"I've watched this movie at least 50 times over the years. I think it is a true classic and Paul Newman's best movie. It should have won best picture and best actor oscars in addition to the 3 it did win. Patricia Neal is outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"criminal intent 7","review":"I'm a big CRIMINAL INTENT fan: I own seasons 1-9 on DVD. I don't have a TV, but TV on DVD is my crack cocaine: it diverts me away from what I should be doing; I watch an episode, then another episode, then another episode, repeat, repeat, repeat, then I notice that I'm exhausted and it's time for bed. So, I know from experience that I don't dare start watching DVDs until I've already done my writing for the day and I'm too burnt-out to get anything else done constructively. I like how in season seven they alternate episodes with the original team of detectives and bring in Chris Noth & partner for the other ones. The only thing I don't like about some of these episodes is the final confession sequence with the ramped-up music (all seasons).

While the science may be more or less sound, the fiction leaves much to be desired.The main problem is that Mercury is essentially a story about betrayal and vengeance that, almost as an afterthought, happens to take place on or around the planet Mercury. The main revenge plot is spelled out for the reader early on, so there's no real mystery and only a minor bit of suspense to keep the story moving.Other reviewers have stated that the book is not Bova's best, and I might be willing to give him another try. Hard sci-fi has been on life support (or maybe suspended animation?) for years. I'm just grateful that, as of this writing, we still have Arthur C.

They do have a few catchy parts here and there, which is why I gave 2 stars, but in general all the songs aren't memorable at all.

On the other hand, this album was very enjoyable because it had no substance and was not at all serious. Songs like Infamous are Soldout are very funny, the band admits how bad they are.

Also worth noting is that the AI enemies are placed in random locations throughout the maps, allowing for more interesting replays of missions (the bad guys aren't always in the same spot!).Another thing that's worth noting is that the game will run on almost any system (Celeron processor? No problem!). I've personally observed it running at fast rates on fairly old computers that have Celeron processors.The only downside to the game is its infamous last mission. The last mission tries to force the player to move quickly through the map (due to a timer), in a failed attempt to delay the time that it takes for someone to complete the game. This only results in the last mission not encouraging the player traits that are so heavily encouraged in previous missions: patience and strategy.Over all, though, it's a great game. I highly recommend that you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea-Flawed Game","review":"If you're looking, as I was, for a Counterstrike substitute, keep looking.

I shoved the CD into my system and installed, no prob. i got into the game, and i began the first mission... there was a realistic voice briefing me and it all was so amazing...until i got to the mission action. the actual action was slow, pixelated, and non-userfriendly. I can understand ther being a multitude of weapons, but having to memorize 12 buttons for equipment alone? also, i found that the levels became disorienting when dark rooms were present. In reality, if you took the mission setup from SWAT and the action from Rainbow 6, you would have yourself the most kickass game ever seen....overall, i don't recommend this game to anyone... it needs better controls, smoother graphics, and a more detailed storyline.and no, it is not my system.... i have a Pentium 3, 128 megs, 8meg vid card, and 800 megahertz packed into my desktop puppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLOSEST YOU WILL GET TO CQB!!!

However, after purchasing and reading this book, I thought it necessary to provide other diabetics with the knowledge that the recipes in this book are primarily low fat, high carbohydrate based. While this may be healthy eating for many people and many of the recipes, indeed, looked good, most of the recipes in the book would be inappropriate for me, an insulin dependent diabetic, who limits (but not eliminates)carbohydrate consumption. I was astonished that the primary focus of this book was to be low-fat with really minimal adaption for lower carbohydrates, merely the substitution of artificial sugar for the real thing. While lower fat is healthy, it it hardly the primary and only goal of a diabetic diet.I love cookbooks, but this was a complete waste of my money and went directly into the trash bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"did i get the kindle version","review":"i cant even get to the pages i want. i have to spend half hour with the next page button to find recipe i want. this is not a kindle version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks ok","review":"I was disappointed when this book arrived.

I used this item almost exlusively to grate Tillamook cheddar and I like how it worked until I noticed pieces of plastic falling off into the grated cheese. I don't own a dishwasher, always washed this by hand with dish soap and a soft brush, so the cracking and ultimate falling apart of the plastic around the plane was not due to chemicals or heat.

While the actual grating surface is microplane quality - it's set inside a plastic frame which doesn't hold up to the flexible strength required. After a few rounds in the kitchen, the plastic has cracked and now gaps open when using. Do yourself a favor - spend a few extra bucks and get the 'Professional' version for a few bucks more.

Over time the crack grew to the point where it finally split. It took two years and about once a week's worth of use before it happened, but last night the handle broke off while grating some parmesan. I knew it was going to happen eventually, so I was always cautious when grating cheeses.

They are so much easier than dragging out the Cuisinart to just grate some cheese and the fine grater is super on lemons peels or whole nutmeg. So why the 4 instead of a 5? I'd like them to grate more coarsely...while these graters are very sharp and compact that say as compared to the size of \\"shreds\\" you get from an old box grater or a Cuisinart this just seems to grate a little too finely.Still I love these microplane graters, highly recommend them for speed, ease of clean up and safety as well as the price, which is GREAT...I'd just like the holes to be larger so I could get a coarser grate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never a greater grater have I seen","review":"You'll wonder how you managed to keep living without this wonderful product from Microplane.

The blade is a classic, high-quality, sharp microplane blade. I love them - and I have 5 of the other \\"stick\\" style professional microplane graters. This, however, was my first microplane, and it would be sturdier if they made the frame out of a high quality dark chocolate. I don't even wash my graters in a dishwasher, and but plastic surround on this design began to crack within weeks - parts of it began falling off within months. Once that happens it becomes too flexible to use - not to mention the bits of clear plastic frame that in your food. Not good.Anyone who rated this highly either did so too soon to know this - or they don't actually use it very often.If you need a sturdy microplane to actually use in the kitchen, try any of the file-shaped metal-only (or all metal with black handle) versions.

We europeans are forced to pay highly inflated prices of more than 120% markup (i.e. more than double) that of the prices on US website, and if you search around to shop in Europe you will find prices much the same.This company is controlling market prices and screwing us europeans with huge markups. It can get away with this because it is treating all european countries the same.Please don't buy this product if being treated fairly matters to you.

As other reviewers have noted, the tripod model frequently leads to injury and is difficult to clean. The older single plane graters are okay, but you end up having to move what you're grating and not the grater. As a result, I would sometimes \\"break\\" hard cheeses in half by applying too much strength.In contrast, the Microplane grater is easy to use, extremely easy to clean, and produces great results. With very little strength, you can grate by moving the grater - and not what you're grating. This produces less mess and eliminates the chance that things like cheese will break in half.Finally, the results are very nice. Grating parmesean produces very light, elegant shavings of cheese, making your dishes look great."},{"rating":"2","title":"mind biscuit","review":"This album fulfills my requirements of ambient music-making you forget time,melt into the tune and feel purified at the end of the experience.So I'd recommend it to those seeking that unique harmonious and relaxed state of mind brought about by a good ambient CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambient at its most unambitious","review":"I don't mind sparse music but there has to be semblance of theme.

The only thing interesting about the film, but even then does not save it, is the gaunt appearance of the depression era characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The scary thing...","review":"is that this film is, with just a little tweaking, just as applicable today as it was then. Mob mentality is mob mentality, even if it's not literal. This is easily one of the best films to illustrate just how imbecilic and lemminglike mobs can be, and how self-righteousness can supposedly cover up for a multitude of sins. Tracy is superb, as are many of the characters, and Lang's direction is near flawless.

Altough quite a different story line to his Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde, Tracy uses a similar technique when he changes his personality in Fury from the young easy going loving man on a journey to visit his fiance, to a bitter twisted vengence seeking man.Although you could not blame him for this"},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic and stupid","review":"As the logic of the title states, you cannot worship Jesus without thinking that he is the Messiah. This is another vain attempt to bring the original lost to the fold.However, as Aryeh Kaplan points out in The Real Messiah -- Jesus was not even a decent human being much less the one promised to bring the world back to its Eden glory. This book should only be read as a historical source for a sad time when there was a religion that blasphemed against Jewish Messianic hopes and dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas and Sarah was excellently done","review":"This series was excellently done. Great characters and wonderful acting. However, one is left with such an unsatisfied feeling, because the ending leaves one hanging and a sequel was never produced (apparently because of a strike). It is definitely worth viewing just for the study of class differences during that period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity at its best","review":"I could not believe that anyone could reduce themselves to this mediocrity after the success of Upstairs Downstairs. What were the producers thinking of? I only watched it because someone had the bright idea to attach it to the Box set of Upstairs Downstairs. After few episodes I quit. It is the same oxymoron. Sarah and Thomas with their shameless and shady antiques which is so far fetched at times that it comes down as an insult to our intelligence rather than entertainment. I found Sarah's overacting, loud and ear scratching cockney diction quite irritating and Thomas' dishonesty and conniving superficial and borderline ridiculous. I strongly recommend that the fans of Upstairs Downstairs stay away from it not to diminish their uplifting enjoyment of UD. The fact that Thomas and Sarah only lasted a few episodes speaks in volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A character flaw","review":"Wnated to continue the fun and tragedy of Upstairs / Downstairs but was dissapointed that the characters did not develop beyond their introductions from the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got what paid for from the west coast","review":"I got what I paid for the product was one-third the catalogue price.

All of the parts are of good quality. My disappointment started when I first used the sweeper. The hopper has a 12 cubic foot capacity. However, as the clippings are swept into the hopper, it begins to spill out of the front when only about 1/3 to less than 1/2 full causing very frequent stops for dumping. Soon after my first use, the wheel that drives the brushes began to \\"lock up\\" unexpectedly, creating big long divots in the yard. I lubricated the wheel, but to no avail. When the item was working, it was OK. But the two or three times I used it behind my ride-on mower, it caused more problems than it solved. The item is too big to disassemble and return easily. I'm not sure what to do at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item, terrible shipping, good value though. It works fine.","review":"Bought this due to the low price, and at the time, free shipping. However, the box was damaged when received, and the grass storage area cracked on the bottom.

If you want a good yard sweeper, buy this one, don't waste your money on name brands.On the damaged parts, contacted Swisher on the web, told them the problem and the part #, and had a new part in 5 days. Great service. It wasn't their fault, it was the storage and/or shippers problem.Works fine, just what I wanted.I gave it 5 stars because it works well and does what it's supposed to, and it was a good value.

Immediately when I got it, I tried it out and thought it was a pretty good product. After using it on a second watch bracelet, the needle (the part used to push out bracelet springs) broke off. It's a good thing I purchased a back up spring bar. If you want this product, then go ahead and purchase it because it's cheap, but be ready when it breaks. I suggest you order at least two to save on shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful tool","review":"I ordered this item to go along with a new watch band on the recommendation of a product review.

It is large, unwieldy and the end bits are brittle and poorly finished. They will either snap off or scratch the watch. If used incorrectly you can damage the shoulders of the watch and this comes with no instructions on how to use it most effectively. The gauge may look useful but you won't use it on a regular basis. This may seem like a simple, inexpensive little hand tool, but it is more trouble than it is worth and you'd be better off spending a little more on a more refined tool if you wish to regularly swap straps at home.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after 2 uses","review":"First time I used the tool on a Citizen Eco-Drive watch band. It worked great when I resized the band. The second time I used it on a Seiko Jubilee watch band. The pins on the Seiko watch band were much tighter than the Citizen watch band. I had to remove two links, which meant 4 pins had to be removed. I bent the tip of the tool on the second pin and it progressively got worse on each subsequent pin until the tip broke off.

Totally disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic degrades in 6mo","review":"This plane is rather expensive for handheld but the blade seemed really nice so I bought one. It also said \\"Made in USA\\" so I figured the quality was superior. I was wrong. Although the plane shreds cheese, chocolate, veg, etc very well, there is a huge flaw in this unit. The blade is held in by clear plastic that degrades over a short period of time (6-months). On my unit all the clear plastic has cracked and the unit is falling apart. The plane is supposed be \\"dishwasher safe\\" but it is not. The heat from the dishwasher is what caused the plastic to crack allover. I always washed it on the top shelf, farthest away from the dryer heating element. But still the unit got ruined. If you get this shredder/plane I suggest washing it by hand only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant !!","review":"I bought this to finely grate ginger for asian dishes - this item exceeded my highest expectations!

The grating action is superb but only buy the professional series or another that is all metal.

There is not a single thing in here I would make or ever wear. From the inside pictures I assumed it was from the 80's, but surprisingly it was published in 2003. There was nothing new or original, and I really, really, dislike the designs. Nothing classic about them either. They look like something your old-lady grandma would make you that you'd be embarrassed to wear. Well, I am that old-lady grandma, and I would never make these for anyone I know.

So therefore, there are only a bend above center as depicted in the photo, but no bends below center that are closest to the center of the bar. I kept the bar anyway thinking I'd use it but it has since fallen from favor and I went back to using the other bar which was of lower quality and lighter weight (about 14 lbs.) with one side larger than the other that had to be turned down on a lathe to get the Olympic plates to slide on.

I couldn't read past the tenth chapter. The heroine is almost hanged for her husband's murder but is spared by an outlaw desiring to suduce her. The flashback consist of the heroine being raped, abused, manhandled and misused, repeatedly by her husband and father-in-law. The violence and hopelessness at the begining left me without desire to read to the next page. Let alone the end of the book. If anything it left me feeling sick to my stomach and questioning if I really ever want to get married. This book isn't about the harder side of life its about one woman's nightmare. In fact, it might give me exactly that. Sorry but I wish I never picked this book up. Needless to say I dont recomend it for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a VERY good buy!","review":"As an owner of a Kirby, its no secret that the \\"Kirby\\" bags are not cheap. These bags are a fraction of the cost, and work just as well. The \\"universal\\" design of these bags to be used in a large number of Kirby Generations makes for only one slight annoyance, but in NO WAY a deal breaker...the notches on the intake inside the bag chamber, within the different Kirby Generations, are in different places. The unique structure of the removable carboard notches to fit the different Kirbys is great in theory, but they are not as easy to manuver. My G-6 fits the bags and I use them, but when initially putting a new bag on, it can be a bit harder to push it over the intake that some may like, but again, not a deal breaker for me. I will continue to buy these in the future and recommend them to my Kirby owning friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

Mr. Newman's work covers a broad range of music types as well as an unexpectedly broad range of emotions. I loved the bio and especially Mr. Newman's one-liners about his music. I was more familiar with Mr. Newman's acerbic pieces than his gentler work. I think the comparisons of his work with that of other artists is right on the money but I guess I would have included Leonard Cohen.One note of warning. People who are very pc may be put off by some of Mr. Newman's lyrics and the faint of heart should not listen to his version of \\"You Can Keep Your Hat On.\\" This is a much steamier version than Tom Jones' ...I feel like a voyeur every time I listen to it (I do keep listening, however)."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars for Randy","review":"This album had many good songs and typical Randy Newman style.

Unfortunately it is not nearly the same quality. The pieces don't seem to fit together as snuggly and the velcro isn't as strong so it is more as if the fruit falls apart instead of the cutting sensation the first set has. Also the wooden food itself doesn't feel as substantial/heavy and it doesn't come in a box with a lid like the older set.

This product works great! I love the fact that we can remove it during the winter easily and only put it up when the bugs come out. My toddler and dogs go in and out easily and the magnet closes up the opening right after so no leaving the screen open. Fantastic design. I added a removable tab to the velcro on the doorframe so I could remove it each winter.

I wish I could say he succeeded. There is little to no correlation to discrete examples (that is a step by step process flow to explain the derivations). The \\"with applications to Signal Processing\\" claim of the title is misleading, since many times the author just mentions them in passing.

My style of studying doesn't mesh well with the book's lack of a useful index and procedural organization within the text. The index is useless because common, major terms refer to pages that almost exclusively off-handedly mention the term with no further explanation. This organization makes it nearly useless as a reference book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice ride, easy installation","review":"I installed these on my 1966 Ford F100 and it was a super easy installation.

The original Crude Clay worked like a charm.Although some people seem to say that Craft Clay is the same as Crude Clay, I'm not finding this true at all.

It works great for my difficult to style fine hair (fine in width). I first discovered it when my roommate was using it.Its just what you need if you want excellent hold without the greasy look most gels and pomades give you. It gives your hair a very natural, organic look while holding it where you want.Being little more than pure clay, it allows you to shape your hair just like a clay sculpture without any globiness or discoloring. Particularly if you have fine hair that is hard to work with, buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same as the ol' stuff","review":"As expressed by many others, this new craft clay does not have the same hold as the old crude clay.

This record is one of those rare gems, and has restored my faith in this thing we call punk rock. As mentioned in the liner notes, Sam and the guys, have not limited themselves musically. Individually, the songs are very eclectic, ranging from thrash metal to emo to old school hardcore to melodic skate punk and back again. This is music for the love of music. I recommend this to anyone who prefers a little more substance to their punk rock. You will not be let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wife Hated IT!","review":"Not too good of a product.

But, if you are looking for a tool to help you do quality work in an efficient fashion, you really should have one of these tools. When working with stained trim, you can pin outside miters together and then fasten the trim to the wall quickly without a split or having to fill holes. Painted trim does require touch up, however smaller holes means less work to conceal and the 23 gauge pinner still has the advantage of being able to pin the actual corners without having to pre-drill holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Absolutely perfect, unless you use a 23guage micropinner to do exterior applications on one of the hardest woods in the world.

However this last chapter in the saga has left me reeling! The glaring plot holes alone were enough to drive me halfway insane (I can't stress this plot hole issue enough). The tired dialogue and increasing lack of explaination or descriptions became a nuisance, leaving the reader with a sense of hurry up and wait. The storyline itself went further into the tangent that took it from merely fantastic deep into the realm of absurd.

You'd be much happier with Pink Floyd's 30th Anniversary Edition of the album \\"Dark SIde Of The Moon\\" or the Eagles \\"Hotel California\\" or Elton John's \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\"; these artists took the time and spent the money to do SACD right. Sure it's a slightly better recording than the original CD but certainly not worth buying again. Also it is not a hybrid CD like many other artists offer - you can only play this one on a SACD player. Peter Gabriel is just trying to suck more money out of your pocket without any value added in return."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best darn pc speakers out there!","review":"These are truly the best pc speakers out there in this price range.

With better songs the album would sound OK. However, I stated before that the message in every song is the same. I would recommend that you use your money to buy a better album because the songs were written very poorly.

I have to say, it was less than expected. While the story line is not all together bad, I found it was difficult to follow at times and I quickly became bored. The acting is poor, the picture and sound quality leave very much to be desired. Overall, it reminded me of a high school film project. And if you are a David Boreanaz fan, this film is not for you. While this is supposedly DB's first credited film role as the \\"vampire victim\\", the statement on the cover (\\"Featuring David Boreanaz before he was on Angel and Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\") and his picture appearing above all other cast members in the ad is all a mislead. All you see of him is his hand. If he appears anywhere else in the film, I must have slept through it. Add to that, the fact that this DVD was nowhere to found prior to DB's recent success in his new TV series should give you a few clues as to its appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Macabre","review":"Sucked!

These recordings, dating from 1935-47, were actually some of the only popular recordings of Gaelic song during the inter- and postwar eras, and although they do have some of the prissy artsong affectations that English tastes imposed on those otherwise unruly Celtic ballads, it must be said that MacEwan had a lovely tenor, and an ease about his singing that transcended the stiltedness picked up from his idol, John McCormack. Not modern in the post folk-boom sense (and not strictly folkloric either, there are several modern tunes on here as well...), but still rather nice. If you want to delve a little further back into the island sound, then this disc might be worth tracking down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zombie Detective Book","review":"I love The Big Nap because Chet Gecko is a detective that solves funny mysteries about zombies and so on.

Another friend of Chet Gecko has also been zombified. Now Chet Gecko is determined to solve this mystery.I would say that the main characters are Chet Gecko and Needles. There are two things that go wrong in the book but it would spoil it for you if I told you. I loved the book so much. It was great for me to read.

I only started listening to NOFX only a couple of weeks ago but they kick arse. All the songs sound great and the lyrics are humurous and sophisticated.

It just doesnt sound like NOFX. NOFX has always done a great job at making catchy ass songs with out falling into the same old pop punk trap that alot of their epitaph brethren have fallen into. Im afraid thats not the case with this one. There are a one or two good songs but when compared to Liberal Animation, S&M Airlines, Heavy Petting Zoo, White Trash, etc... it's a big let down. I first thought maybe it just had to grow on me like Pump up the Valium or So Long had to, but it never did. Its just not a good album. I hope their next one is better but Im enclined to think this one is the begining of the end.

The decline, punk in drublic, white trash..., and so long... are in fact great albums. When I bought and listened to this album, however, I was truly disappointed. How could a band that actually had clever lyrics and a unique sound end up making an album that could only satisfy the stupidest 12 year old? I cannot say that I disagree with the band's opinion of george w. bush but they aren't even good at defaming him. Any moron can say \\"uhhh george bush is stupid\\". Even though it seems to be true, if you're going to make that statement, it wouldn't hurt to justify it. Bottom line is, unfortunately, it seems that nofx's talent is declining, no pun intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest NOFX yet","review":"Didn't even no the new NOFX was coming out until I saw the posters all over Downtown D.C.

They are political and sarcastic, and they won't ever sell out! They really have no potty humor on this one, it's all sarcastic and serious.

Whoops, I OD'd: 7/10Well all i have to say as that the first 6 songs were pretty good but then 7,8,9 were kind of boring especially tracks 7 and 8. Then the rest of the songs were good but not as good as the first 6 songs on the cd.

But punks roots are deeply embeded in politics and anti-establishment views. Most of the punk legends are really educated and have very strong political views for exapmle Jello Biafra, Ian Mcaye, Dwayne Peters, or even the guys of Pennywise. In my book Fat Mike is a punk legend and a smart guy to boot, mix that with some good music and you have NOFX. Teenyboppers have made Fat Mike look like a bad guy for being too preachy. Well I say preach on. You gotta check this album out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst NOFX i've heard","review":"This CD started out with \\"The Separation of Church and Skate.\\" This song was rediculously good.

I normally like NOFX's silly songs like \\"clams have feelings too\\" and \\"liza and louise\\" but \\"shes nubs\\" is annoying and horrible. Aside from the 1st track and a few others this CD isnt too great, don't waste your money. Get \\"Punk in Drublic\\" \\"White Trash...\\" \\"The Decline\\" or \\"Pump up the Valuum\\" instead. Weak Effort. Where's the energy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"while there are several good songs to be found on this record, it is, for the most part, boring. the songs sound like they were all written by different people; it is lacking cohesiveness.i agree with the other fans that its great that they are voicing some political opinions, but this isn't the first time. the decline was excellently crafted and the songwriting was superb. it was twice as political as this. the half-dozen or so political songs here just take their respective issues and hit you over the head with them, crudely and unimaginatively.i am very surprised that so few reviewers have called this nofx's \\"first\\" foray into politics; they must not have heard the decline.it is quite ironic that there is a song called medio-core, which is about how all the mainstream music sounds boring and the same. the irony is soon killed though, when mike sings that the song itself is boring and unimaginative.my advice-don't buy it yet. borrow and listen to it a few times, and then decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preachy Punk","review":"Fat Mike knows how to write a good punk song with great harmonies. But the only thing that bothers me is how one-sided everything is. I mean, that's expected in the genre of punk. But what bothers me the most is how Fat Mike points the finger at the rednecks and calls them ignorant. Now I myself am a democrat, but I think it's equally ignorant to just nod along and agree with everything this band preaches.Besides that, it's a pretty solid album. Key tracks: \\"13 Stitches\\" and \\"Whoops, I Od'd.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ol' NOFX","review":"Classic NOFX with a few songs about current political matters. I always respect someones right to express there opinions...though punk voter almost seems to force there opinions \\"we're not telling kids who to vote for\\" on kids.

I'm not kidding. You can tell they really like punk rock, but they are nowhere near as good as their favorite bands, like Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Youth of Today, etc. If you don't know who these bands are, then please check them out. You simply cannot be considered punk if you don't know who they are. The only reason this album gets two stars instead of one is We got 2 Jealous Agains and 13 Stitches. These two songs really reminice about the glory days of punk. Listen to we got 2... and buy all the albums mentioned. Also buy stuff by the Dead Kennedys, and Bad Brains, who for some reason were never mentioned on those songs, despite them being simply awsome. Nofx is stupid...listen to real punk!!!

Oh, once a guy called Fat Mike told and sung \\"we don't play ska anymore\\", well what's about anarchy camp???? That trumpet seems a sample of Sapore di mare, an italian song from the 60's. Embarassing.

I wish Fat Mike would spend more time writing new songs and less time being an politician. Frankly, I think the only reason most people like this record is because it bashes Bush.

Though I think the live version of Solsbury Hill on the Secret World Live cd is better than the original album track on this disc, the sacd version just hits harder.

I did not notice any earth in the bags so far. I highly recommend store in freezer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, no frills food.","review":"Simply put...these are raw sunflower seeds and nothing else. They dont have the 'organic' tag, so be aware of that if it will be a determining factor for your purchase. However, they are simply just clean, unsalted seeds, that for me, are both a perfect snack and a useful ingredient. Although not on an exclusively plant-based diet, i mostly adhere to that philosophy, and am vegan regardless. So...i look for ways to avoid using oil and such in my foods, and raw sunflower seeds make a great substitute for oil in salad dressings and such. Anyways, four big bags of sunflowere seeds such as you would receive if you order this, will go a long ways in your kitchen.

While Robert Howard's stories can be rightly accused of being somewhat formulated, there is a certain feel to them that either you get or you don't. I'm sure it's a daunting task to carry on another writer's concept and come-up with good orginal stories, but if you're going to take it on, it needs to be done right.This story just didn't fit into a Robert Howard creation.The rest of the Age of the Conan, need to be more like Legend of Kern or I think Howard fans are going to be very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars-A solid read","review":"This book is a solid read. No its not REH, its York. if you want to only read Howard's Conan then read only Howard. But if you want to read a solid action packed story set in Howards world this is a good book for you. The plot is good, and the characters have breath. There are some PG-13 clean sex scenes in it as well that are are quite nice. Its a quick and easy read and wont let you down. I give it a C+ , one thumb up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Robert E Howard's vision of Stygia","review":"I came to this book with some high expectations only to be really dissapointed. The whole time I kept thinking that I was reading a Hardy Boys novel set in a \\"Thieves World\\" version of Stygia. When someone tries writing in the steps of another writer the bar is significantly raised. In Howard's \\"Hour of the Dragon\\" his single chapter in Stygia contained more atmosphere and horror then this novel could do in almost 300 pages. So bad I didn't even waste the time finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"We don't need three of these!!!","review":"This book, like most sci/fi trilogies, doesn't need to be stretched over three books. It's clearly padded with words to stretch it out so consumers will have to shell out extra bucks to get to the conclusion. And what it is padded with is a boring-love-that-can-never-be tale. This is a very boring book with the Conan name tacked on to sell copies. A total waste of time. Why would anyone read this anyway, when there are so many actual Conan books other there and many of them very well done (and none of them are trilogies!). Heck, just read the Robert E. Howard stories. If you've read those, work on John Maddox Robert, Karl Edward Wagner, John C. Hocking, Lin Carter. Even Robert Jordan's Conan stories are not as bad as Anok."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the time of King Conan...","review":"The new Age of Conan series follows up \\"Legends of Kern\\" with a bold new trilogy in a rarely explored setting: Stygia. It is an land of ancient evils, of dark magic and shadowy intrigue.J. Steven York gives us insight into this land, created by American fantasy legend Robert E. Howard, through the eyes of Anok, a young half-stygian warrior. While not a Conan clone, Anok fits into the Hyborian age like a well-worn scabbard. He's young, inexperienced, and thirsty for vengence. And yeah, he swings a mean pair of swords. The perfect mix for a fantasy hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor construction","review":"I bought a King Canopy for my booth at a farmer's market last year. From the very beginning the canopy part was too small for the frame making it very hard to get up each time. It completely broke after only one summer of use. It never had been mishandled or misused in any way. Two of the cross arms just completely snapped. For the cost of this product, it should have lasted longer and the canopy should have fitted properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic Seasonal Low-Key Fun","review":"Holiday Affair certainly does not top most folks' lists of great Christmas movies, but there is something about the sweet plot, the fantastic post-war holiday settings in New York City (including the seal fountain in Central Park), and the deft, comic performances of the leads that makes this one very enjoyable holiday classic.I especially am fond of Wendell Corey's thankless role as Janet Leigh's lawyer suitor. He brings humor and understated charm to what is surely a difficult role, and even manages to generate some audience sympathy.Harry Morgan's wide-eyed, incredulous night clerk, who hears increasingly strained (if true) explanations of the wild goings-on that brings everyone together in his courtroom on Christmas Eve, is also a treat.

I feel obligated, however, to warn viewers about this streaming player: it is the worst I've experienced. Every time you pause (or use the slider) the stream completely stops working. Then when it does come back on, there is only sound, and you have to wait for the picture to catch up. There are no thumbnails when you slide the bar, so guessing where you are at the same time the movie won't play is infuriating. I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for streaming movies, including Hulu, YouTube (which also rents), or Netflix, which offers 30 days free to all new users. There are many other streaming providers on the internet, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet Christmas movie","review":"You know, you never know for sure what you will end up with when you have never actually seen the movie that you purchase.

The sound quality is terrible; I find myself constantly reaching for the remote so I can hear people speaking, and then turning it back down again. This is annoying but not enough to give the low mark.I was watching disk one, and was reviewing the trivia section. The first question was about the Tower of London and how William the Conqueror had his wife Anne Boylen killed, correct or incorrect. I selected incorrect, as Anne Boylen was killed by her husband Henry VIII. Apparantly the producers of these collections know something about history that I don't know, because I was incorrect.

Domhoff shows his command of this material by his use of detailed analysis and careful consideration of possible opposing arguments (i.e. pluralist). He systematically proves that there is an elite group of people in this country that,in order to fit their agenda, can dictate government action. He destroys the idea that public opinion has anything to do with political maneuvering, by proving that it is those who have the money who control primaries, elections, and entire administrations. His manifestation of the working man's personal inadequacy myth, due to the individualistic American ideal, makes this book a must read.

Protruding from the trouser cuff, the tongue exposes the wearer to invasions, such as poison ivy; to cold air; to water; and to other dangers, such as barbed wire. (I tried cutting off the tongue off and sealing the cut with duct tape.) Further, the boot is fitted with laces that are designed for a taller boot and that are made of a cheap material, so neither do they hold a knot, not is it possible to tie the laces safely to prevent tripping.

The metal tabs that snap over the track are fragile and unforgiving. I accidentally bent one trying to install the light, and when I tried to bend it back it flew off. Project ruined.

Didn't have any problem when I went to put it up.I've been using it since last fall and it is still going fine. It lights an enclosed area over my dresser much better than I thought possible. I will say though that I don't leave the lights on for any long amount of time - only as long as I need to have use of that area.

Most systems with Pthreads installed have man pages that already supply this information but with fewer errors (for example, see p. 150).Some of the code examples seem like they were added in a hurry. They are incomplete, not in the sense of omitting implementation details but because they lack basic C++ syntax (e.g., types).

This album, recorded in the same year of Quique, is still beautiful 6 years after its release and stands out in the arena of ethno/techno/ambient/trance/electronica (Banco de Gaia and Spacetime Continuum, I am talking to you!).

Instead of getting a a through, informative summary of his life, especially his wrestling years, I was disappointed to find out that a good portion of the book focuses on Martha Hart's very sad and depressing everyday life following the untimely death of her husband. After reading the book, you would think that a lot of the content could have been written days after the tragic event, judging by the overall tone and all the lashing out. (The book was actually written a few years later).Broken Harts is undoubtably the saddest, most depressing book I've ever read. As a big fan of Owen and Bret, I still feel this book should have never been written, let alone published. I'd much rather read a happy story about Owen's life than hear all the depressing details surrounding his dysfunctional family and his untimely death.Do not read at any cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self centered book","review":"If you are a fan of Owen Hart like i was and thought he was a great guy just by wathching him on T.V, this book isn't really for you. The book completly shattered the idea that every wrestling fans had of him and make Owen look selfish sometime. The problem with this book is the same has it was for the Diana Hart book, she thnik that they were better than anybody else and the could do no wrong. In this book she blame a lot of what happen in their life on the hart family. She also stated that Owen didn't think that Stone Cold Steve Austin was really injured and that why Owen never said talk to Austin about it. So my thinking is that this book is actually written by somebody who still didn't grief the death of her husband and that why this book isn'T worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly motivating.Owen Hart is an true inspiration to people of all ages.","review":"I read this book on the Life and Death of Owen Hart and it is an truly inspirational book.In this book you can explore about the man who grew up as the youngest of 12 children,started wrestling in the WWE,his marriage,his life,and the accident that caused him to lose his life at an WWF/WWE ppv event entitled;Over the Edge after falling 80 something feet to the ring below.Also you can read about Martha(Owens wife)who fought to gain Owen justice by suing the WWF/WWE in like an war you never seen.Owen is truly an motivating man,that could really touch someone's live so R.I.P Owen.And thanks for the many lives you touched.Owen James Hart;May 7,1965-May 23,1999."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hart's Story Connects","review":"This book provided me with information that I have wanted to know for some time now.

It really should be listed under bitter wives trying to make their deceased husband and his family look really bad. In this book she talks about how bad the Harts were and also talks of how Owen never got along with them. She also talks about how bad wrestling is whenever the only reason her kids can go to their private school (which she mentions about 30 times throughout the book) and live their lives is because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I Have Ever Read","review":"To me, this is the best book I have ever read. Why? So many reasons. I was there when Owen died. Martha did a wonderful job on this book. I have never read a book that made me cry, laugh, smile, and mad at the same time. Martha really put her neck out there with this book. Talking about the WWE in a way most would never think about do. She did it and did it with class. The 2 parts of the book that really got me was when Martha talked about seeing Owen for the 1st time at the funeral home. That was real. Then the 2nd part of the book that got me was when Martha was dealing with the Hart Family. Martha is such as strong woman who did so much just so that her husband's death would not be in vain. If you ever read this Martha, just know that this is one book I would NEVER sale on eBay. This is a sure keeper for any WWE, Hart Family, and Owen Hart fan.

There are many options out there for purchasing MMC. Also, SecureDigital (SD) cards are fully compliant with the Palm Pilots for which this memory card is being marketed. At the time of writing this review, this was among the most expensive of comparable cards. In fact, yesterday at a local retailer I saw a 512MB (4x the capacity) for five dollars more.So my advice is that you do purchase expansion cards to take full advantage of the power of your Palm. I have purchased many and am able to use my Palm as an MP3 player (using RealOne), a video player (using Kinoma), an atlas (using Mapopolis) and a video game system (using PalmOne Sega Classic cards and downloaded games) all at the same time. Do buy SD or MMC cards to expand, but I would encourage you to comparison shop, looking for better prices.-Jacob Hantla"},{"rating":"1","title":"PC UNVERSE","review":"PC UNVERSE DECLINED MY RETURN BECAUSE IT WAS OPEN.

It takes some time to figure out, and I find it to be quite intriguing. I think this album stands out from others in the genre in that is doesn't have that \\"Killers-Franz Ferdinand-Strokes\\" sound.

I finally gave in and wow! I'm not easily impressed by new gadgetry and I already had several graters.This grater is incredible! I grate a lot of Parmesano Reggiano, and those that use it a lot know that it's a bear to grate. If it's even slightly old, it gets crumbly and it's tough even when super-fresh.The microplane grater really reduces all hard cheeses to the finest angelhair-like strands with almost no effort at all. I was truly amazed by it.In my opinion, though, it doesn't work well at all for zesting. If you want to zest citrus, stick with a traditional zester. No matter how careful I am, it always takes off too much pith. I found it didn't work well for grating onion, either. Onion isn't easy to grate in any case, but this reduced it to juice..had to use my fine box grater.But as I said, for cheese, this grater is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grater","review":"I was very happy with this grater - easy to use and the results are nice fine pieces.

It's pretty much the same, except the Cuisipro has a little rubber \\"leg\\" at the top of the plane (in addition to the handle at the other end). So you can rest the zester on a cutting board instead of always having to hold it in the air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Parmesan, Romano, Zesting Citrus Fruits and Nutmeg","review":"We have been using this for over a year and are thrilled. After complaining to a friend about my old lemon zester and nutmeg grater she recommended this and I'm glad she did because the MICROPLANE CLASSIC ZESTER is fantastic.We use this for zesting citrus fruits: lemon, lime, and orange. We use it for shaving parmesan and romano cheese for our pasta dishes. We use it to grate nutmeg.This is very sharp which means it is fast to use. The long blade makes it easy to use compared to going back and forth on shorter graters. The handle is easy to hold and it does not slip.This is easy to clean, just don't rub in the wrong direction. Go in one direction \\"with the blade\\" not against it, with a soapy sponge repeatedly while water runs over it.Can't recommend this highly enough for the home cook and baker.I wound up purchasing a larger sized MICROPLANE for chocolate shaving, they sell multiple sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for zesting","review":"Impressed with the technology and particularly good for grating ginger (do the whole piece of ginger and freeze in ice cube tray)and zest from limes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Lemon Zestor","review":"I purchased this product to save time making Lemoncello per recommendation.

I've used this for cheese, chocolate, and citrus (at least) and it has performed beautifully with whatever I throw at it. Its still sharp as the day I bought it even after having gone through the dishwasher a few times (I know, I know).My only complaint is that I wish the sheath was a little better made. If you dont put it on exactly right, the grater can get 'stuck' as the teeth dig into the plastic. I know its my own fault when this happens, but it just seems a bit easy to do if I'm not paying enough attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly one of my favorite kitchen gadgets","review":"I honestly can't remember what I did before I bought this grater. I use it for zesting oranges, lemons and limes, ginger as well as parmesan cheese. It is easy to hold with one hand and grate with the other. I guess my complaint is that it might be too efficient and sharp. Here is the thing, I have grated my fingers several times. One time I even grated off a large chunk of may nail. I'm not sure if it is really the products fault or just user error. While I would encourage anyone to buy this, I recommend that you are careful as you would be handling a knife!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What did I do with out this grater","review":"I use this for everything.

I will never be without this again EVER"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to get excited about","review":"Ever since I read in the NYT last year that the microplane zester is one of the three \\"must haves\\" for serious cooks, I have wanted one, especially since I was thrilled with the other two (the Oxo peeler and Silpat), but so far I'm disappointed with it. It has few advantages over my $3 grocery store small-hole grater for zesting citrus or grating ginger. It's slightly better in that it doesn't release as many liquids from what you are grating, but that may be a disadvantage because you end up needing to grate more for the same flavor. It's worse in that bits of what you are grating build up on the edges, which are slightly folded over, so you have to go at them with a toothpick, which is tedious.It's not that I don't recognize a hierarchy of graters --- once I bought one at a dollar store which was clearly inferior to my $3 grocery grater --- I just don't think this one is much better than the basic type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing in years","review":"This s an efficient piece of equipment which helps the amature as well as the professional save time and improve quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Dulls Blade","review":"Over the course of a month or two the blades on this grater flatten and dull.

Not safe when sharp, and doesnt stay sharp enough to work for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work for me","review":"I purchased this item with the expectation that it could be used on medium hard (or medium soft) food products. It uses a lot of effort to end up with a mushy substance. It is completely disappointing. I just read the description and thought it would work very well with most food items I use. Hardly. It will probably only work on very, very hard food products like a rock solid cheese. I made a big mistake and would not recommend this item to anyone. I did not know that another Grater was available instead of the one I purchased. I might have been happy with that one. At least these are very inexpensive items. Live and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"microplane zester/grater","review":"The microplane will grate from hard nutmegs to fragile lemon zest and/or cheeses. The handle is comfortable to grip.

There's no struggling with this grater, It cuts and zests faster and quicker and you get more volume and quantity with this because of the length and sharpeness of the micro blades. Don't know why I waited so long to get one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works As Expected","review":"I use this mainly to get lemon zest and it does a great job. It's a little hard to clean because of the many individual tiny blades, but that's a fair trade for the fine zest grating.Caution: this thing is insanely sharp. Use it with respect because it will grate you as efficiently as it does lemon zest. Fortunately it comes with a plastic guard to cover the sharp parts when it's not in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Citrus and Hard Cheeses","review":"This excellent tool takes off just the right amount when used to zest citrus, and grates hard cheeses like Parmesan and Cotija so finely that the grated cheese looks almost like a little drift of snow. It does need to be hand washed, but fortunately this can be done quickly. I find using a brush with bristles helps me to get it clean without risk to my fingers--it is very sharp! It comes with a protective sheath that allows you to store it without worrying about grating your fingers when you are rummaging through your cooking tools. I used to try to zest citrus with a regular grater. Now that I have this, I will never go back."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO LONG","review":"With the curved edges and being so long it very hard to get what you zested out.

Expertly designed, it is sharp, precise, grates very finely, easy to grasp and use, and is not hard to clean. Seriously, the best $15 I can remember spending.Funny, I read that this was created for carpentry work and that the inventor of this fabulous tool was irked when it became a runaway sensation in kitchenware. I imagine it's great for woodworking, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool.","review":"I recently purchased this and I am glad I did. It makes grating and zesting a breeze.

A must have in the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I can't believe I lived without this. This product makes zesting citrus and grating spices unbelievably easy. It is super sharp, so be careful. I love that it comes with a well fitting plastic sleeve for safe storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooks love tools! This is no exception!","review":"This has been a great tool in my bag for quite some time. Excellent for garnishes to adding the full fresh flavor of citrus zest without any of the bitter pith. Also great for grating hard cheeses such as parmesan to grinding fresh nutmeg. I haven't had the problem of the handle breaking, and the construction otherwise feels very sturdy for a tool I use to lightly brush a lemon on for dress a salad with cheese to even grating ginger. Another model that is similar to this one has difficulty zesting/grating soft items, this one works as described.Only addition which would be nice is the protective sieve to be reversed into a catch tray. But to be fair, I bought the other model without a handle which acts as a catch tray. Much easier to collect and transfer zest into desired plates or bunch together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I'm not a fancy chef but I really like this grater (caveat, this is the only microplane grater I have owned/used). It makes fast work of grating hard cheeses and zesting fruits. The handle is long enough so that I haven't cut myself while grating and the plastic sheath is helpful for storing. I like it so much, I am buying another one as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"kitchen essential","review":"I should have bought one of these years ago. I'd heard about them, but being a casual cook, I didn't think I needed one. I was wrong. Every kitchen should have one of these. It makes zesting citrus so easy. And fresh lemon, lime, or orange zest adds so much to recipes. Dried is just not the same.Keep the plastic cover it comes with. It's useful to protect the grater in a drawer. If you're having trouble getting it back on, just squeeze the cover slightly, and the grater slides right in."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best gift I've ever received","review":"Works fabulously for all types of citrus zests, grating fresh spices, and I've even used for (very small) chocolate shavings for Tiramisu. I haven't tried this with cheese - for which I generally pull out the old standard grater because I like larger pieces than this product creates. Be careful and pay attention to where your hands are while zesting, like yoiu should with anything sharp. I've filed the occasional nail and knuckle.**UPDATE 12/9/11** It also makes short work of hard cheeses like Parmesean."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll never buy grated Parmesan again","review":"I bought this grater/zester for two reasons. Firstly, I forgot where I put my other grater and feared I'd accidentally gifted it to someone after a dinner party. Secondly, I absolutely needed to drop some finely grated Parmesan onto a plate of spaghetti with a particularly tasty meat sauce. It seems I'd found myself in an unannounced and unspoken meat sauce competition. This little gizmo helped me raise the bar. I'm still waiting to see who out does me and how.Yes, it works for other stuff like lemon/orange/whatever zest too. It cleans up fairly easily. It's a good kitchen tool over all."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kitchen was incomplete without this tool!","review":"I've seen the Microplane graters used by my fave kitchen guy, Alton Brown, as well as a few other FoodTV chefs whom I respect. This tool is wonderful! It is incredibly sharp and works like a charm. I ordered this item after having zested a few oranges for an Orange Dreamsicle cake with a totally inadequate little grater. Immediately upon receiving it, I zested some lemons just for the sake of comparison. The Microplane won hands down! The zest was removed beautiully and effortlessly without a hint of the bitter pith. The only thing that I can say in complaint is that these tools should come with some kind of sheath for storage. Other than that, Microplane graters and zesters rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Microplane Zester","review":"For zesting citrus and grating nutmeg, it can't be beat, but I have to agree with a previous reviewer on the Paremgiano-Reggiano. It destroys the texture and, I believe, some of the flavor, as well as altering recipe quantities (a cup of regularly grated cheese will not be the same as a cup grated with the Microplane). I do believe it is worth having one on hand for zesting as well as nutmeg, but for cheeses I would stick to an old fashioned box grater or food processor...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grates well","review":"This product works great. My only gripe is that the bottom of the greater is shaped like a trapezoid, so it's hard when you're zesting or grating garlic to scrap the stuck product off from the grater.

I'm pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow, what an amazing tool to make lemon zest!","review":"I admit I am a bit scared of using this thing, because it is sharp, but used carefully, it produces incredible amounts of lemon zest.

I will say this, it is sturdy, but that is all this tool has going for it. Perhaps this was a mistake from the factory but it seems that all of the tiny blades were never raised above the surface of the implement therefor making zesting impossible. You can run the back of your hand over it and not even get a scratch. Safe? Yes. effective? No. I will not be buying one of these on line with out being able to feel it in my hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOLES TOO SMALL TO BE A GRATER!!!","review":"This microplane reduces everything to juicy dust.

I used to dread any recipe that called for zesting because it was so hard to get even a small amount of zest with my cheese grater. More zest was stuck to the grater than in my measuring spoon! With the microplane zester I no longer dread zesting anything because it works so well and efficiently. I highly recomend this product to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hit!","review":"My mother loves this grater so much that she actually does a little wiggly dance when she's given the task of grating parmesan cheese or zesting a lemon. It was her purchase, and she congratulates herself out loud every time it once again proves to be the marvelous kitchen aid that it is.

I enjoy using ginger root in my cooking, but do so infrequently enough that I store it in the freezer to keep it from molding. Before, I always had such a hard time trying to cut pieces off the root when I wanted to use it. I tried my Microplane and it grates the rock-hard frozen ginger without batting an eye, and shows no sign of dulling in the least. It's amazing how many uses there are for this gadget in addition to the frequently-cited cheese-grating and zesting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the splurge","review":"I can't believe how long it took me until I finally got one of these! Being an avid Food Network watcher and seeing this used on some of my favorite cooking shows such as Everyday Italian and 30 Minute meals I was hooked.Grated Parmesano Reggiano comes out in lihgt, fluffy pale curls. THey are heaven on you tongue and your taste buds.Grating potatoes, cheeses, nutmeg, bread for homemade bread crumbs, citrus zest and just about anything else that can be pulverized is a pleasure and not a chore with this tool.Now I look forward to the cooking steps such as grating and prepping with pleasure, because I get to use the Microplane zester and not a chore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razor Sharp Grater","review":"I recently bought the microplane fine grater. It is great for little jobs that require fine grating (ginger,citrus peels/zesting,hard cheeses...especially parmesan/romano,etc.,nutmeg....). It really helps break up the fiber in ginger, when you grate with the microplane. It is razor sharp & pretty effortless. I definitely like it much better than the conventional graters that we are all used to; it just cuts so much better. Although, I think there is a time & a place for the old-fashioned \\"Box Grater\\". The microplane gives a very nice shaving. If you want coarser gratings, of course, I'd recommend using their microplane coarse-grater. I actually have the microplane fine-grater that does not have the rubber handle on the end of it.

It does a great job when I want bigger pieces of zest for an accent or a garnish. But when it comes to things like recipes calling for the zest of one lemon to mix into other ingredients, I would have to take all those little strips of zest and chop them up. Now I have microplane and life is wonderful. Zip, zip, zip and I've got a lemon's worth of perfect tiny zest.

I group \\"Romantic Night\\" with no other artist because it's a stand alone. Prepare to be a part of the J. Thomposon era for many years to come! The \\" Romantic Night\\" CD has taken Chicago by storm! J.Thompson gives Jazz a new sound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Night","review":"This CD fills in that section of my collection that is geared toward the romantic side of my life.

I am a fan of contemporary music. I am a huge fan of Vickie. From \\"We shall behold him\\" to \\"Oh What Love\\". But now she has lost me. This project is a \\"gumbo\\" of the same songs manufactured over and over in different ways. It seems to me that Ms Winans was at a loss for the music that her fans have loved her for. The song \\"Superman\\" what was that all about? Even the one song that could have been a strong ministry song \\"We need a word from the Lord\\" lacks conviction. I can't even listen to it. It is by far one of the worst projects I have come across this year. Perhaps her next should be called \\"Back to the Drawing Board\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!!!!","review":"I am a huge fan of traditional gospel music and I am struggling to accept some of today's new contemporary gospel songs. This is quite evident in Vickie Winan new CD, \\"Bring It All Together\\". I am a fan of Vickie Winan but this CD was quite disappointing. Vickie should decide if she wants to sing R&B or continue to produce songs found on her album, \\"Live in Detroit Volume two\\". That's the music I enjoy from Vickie and at almost $16.00 for a CD, you should at least be able to find more than 1 or 2 good songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Love Album Despite Remixes","review":"I really enjoy listening to this album. It has become One of my favorite CDs I listen to it in my walkman. I love all of the songs from tracks 1 to 13. I don't particularly care for the song \\"Amazing Grace Dance\\" which I felt wasn't the type of song for Vickie Winans to sing and the album would had been perfect without the remixes except the remix for \\"Shake Yourself Loose\\". I felt that her son did a wonderful job remixing that particular song. But by remixing the other songs just didn't make sense. All songs don't need to be remixed. Although I love this CD I pray that her next album will be more traditional because she has such a powerful and anointing voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS HORRIBLE!!!

Two or three cuts are primo and the rest leave a lot to be desired. The remixes were the best thing on this album. Vickie's voice and presence is always strong! But the lyrics were terrible in many instances (Superman? How dated is that?). It presented gospel truths without any original artistic flavor. Not much creativity here. Granted maybe her audience was intended to be children, but I don't even think kids will be interested. Vickie has way too much talent to be doing these numbers.

She also mends emotional bridges with her mother. Blah, blah, blah, yadda yadda, plus some hanky scenes and screamfests.I really hated this movie.

Guess she ended up on the cutting room floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's throw in 15 subplots and abandon them all.","review":"Though Geena Davis is a great actress, good at playing particularly strong-willed women, the screenplay for \\"Angie\\" just meanders all over the place, from light comedy to the staunchest of melodramas.I mean, what kind of a movie has a woman go into labor while gyrating in a Santa Claus suit then show her give birth to a one-armed baby, get abandoned by her married lover, watch as her stepmother breast-feeds the one-armed baby, abandons said baby, finds her long-lost mother (who it turns out is a schizophrenic), learns that one-armed baby is in a coma... all in about 15 minutes.This was one of the most uneven films I've ever seen. Turturro's particularly good in it as the best friend, yet her character is left out of the final half hour, though she's a central character, and never returned to.

It takes the zest off very quickly - almost too quickly, if you are not used to it, you can go right down into the pith, but as long as you pay attention it's not an issue.It would possibly be more convenient if it had a handle, but honestly it is not needed. The plastic guard does a great job catching and holding the zest, and then when you're not using it, you can flip it around to guard the blade from accidental zesting of your fingers. Fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Cannot Imagine Life Without This Zester","review":"It reduces a large lemon to a pile of fine, well-flavored zest in mere *seconds*, and it's really easy to clean (I give mine a quick rinse through the reverse side, then into the dishwasher).

Also works great for hard cheeses and ginger!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Microplane for Maxi+results!","review":"I was actually shocked by how well this zester worked when I first tried it because of all of the negative comments about how it will cut your hand off, etc.It works effortlessly and is therefore very easy to hold. Just grip the sides, rub it over the fruit, and the zest practically falls off. The best thing is that it removes only zest, 100% of the pulp is left behind.

I use it to grate citrus peel, chocolate, hard cheeses (note: it yields a very fine grate. If you like a coarser grate, use a traditional grater. The micro plane coarse and extra coarse graters still grate way more finely than a normal grater). Unlike other reviewers, I like the fact that it doesn't have a handle. It gives you more surface area to do your grating and it doesn't feel uncomfortable in the least in my hands. I honestly don't know what they are talking about! I've never came even close to shaving my knuckles. I love the fact that it's dishwasher safe, too. Very convenient. This particular grater is not sharp enough to grate things like ginger and nutmeg, however, so I have a different microplane for that.

A great alternative to a rattle. And, because the wooden pieces are joined by elastic, it's a little less startling/painful when the baby whacks herself in the face with it than other solid toys. Our baby seems over it after six weeks, which is pretty good for her. And who knows, maybe it will revive her interest again.

He absolutely loved it - found it very interesting, and just right for putting in his mouth. That's where the problem lies.Any one of the ends can go right into his mouth. The elastic stings have plenty of give in them and it would be very easy for him to do serious damage to his throat (or worse) if he fell over on the toy or otherwise got it shoved to the back of his throat. It's marketed for 0+, but it's dangerous for the little ones who are putting a lot of things in thier mouth and who may not be completely steady yet. This one's being put away until he's much older - and I'm not sure how fun he'll think it is then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Entertaining","review":"I love the soft swishing sound that the beads make when my baby shakes this and it is really easy for her to hold with her little hands.

I don't think any toybox is complete without this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"My daughter's only three months but she can grab this more easily than other toys. She likes to watch me spinning it, it's like a portable mobile.

But in 2010 Crystal D'arques introduced a lead-free glass they call DIAMAX. It's quite pretty but it's not crystal. It doesn't have the weight or ring of crystal. If you want the heavy crystal glasses that Cristal D'arques used to make then ensure that the word Diamax does not appear anywhere in the name or description -- or on the box. Many times you'll see on Amazon that the product description contradicts itself -- saying on one line that the product is Diamax and in another place that it is 24% lead crystal -- but it's either one or the other. It can't be both. In this case, there is no claim that the glasses are crystal, but it's easy to overlook this detail -- since historically this pattern was made from 24% lead crystal. Just so you know what you're getting...."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT LEAD CRYSTAL BUT CLEAR GLASS","review":"When these were initially offered for sale in the 1980's they were 24% lead crystal, with plenty of sparkle and a nice ring to them, like crystal should ring.

If you want good crystal glasses, expect to pay $ 14.00 per glass and up and don't waste your money on these fakes. People who know crystal glasses know these are not a good buy for the money. Do your homework people don't be taken by misleading advertising, or thinking they are genuine lead crystal glasses !

Ultimately, I felt very comfortable going with the Bose brand. Plus, in my opinion, this is about the sleakest and best-looking unit out there (I went with black; I'm not an Apple-white drone). The sound is very, very good for small to medium size spaces. There are not a lot of features to the unit, which I think is a good thing - it just focuses on the sound and the small footprint.

I was not dissatisfied with it, but decided to get the Bose Sound Dock to see if there was a major improvement. I think the Bose is a little more refined with its sound, but not a lot. The Kicker has treble/bass controls. This give the Kicker a slight edge over the Bose with the treble, but I could not set the bass control on the Kicker much beyond normal without getting distortion. I believe that the Bose is a little better with the bass.The Kicker is heavier and more difficult to move. It has slots for grips which help a bit, but not much. The Bose is much lighter and easier to move.All I use these sound docks for is to play my iPods. If I had to choose between them I would take the Bose, assuming similar prices. There is a fancier Bose unit, but I was informed by Bose that the sound quality is no different than the basic Bose.

After some use, that movement breaks the solder that connects the wires between the speakers and the ipod and the sound stops.What is more incredible is that Bose kept producing this design for many years.

Maria Montessori wrote this almost a century ago, and found that adequate practice printing alphabet letters in pre-school assured success in this area. Incredibly, no one has ever published a study to see if sufficient printing of alphabet letters before first-grade assures this ability. I have such a study but the establishment does not want it published.

It doesn't quite fully cover the mattress and the edges curl up a little. That would be ok, but fussing with all the snaps is a pain and takes way too much time. I can take the mattress out of the crib and put a new mattress pad & sheet on in less time. I never really used bumpers w/my kids as they aren't considered safe once they can move, but when i did I found I only had to untie 2 sides of the crib and lift up the other to get the mattress out - so it was quick to do.I'm still giving it a couple stars because if you have a very heavy mattress you don't want to lift, or use bumpers for a long time this might be a worthwhile product for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Built like a tank, love this pedal","review":"Can't say anything bad about it.

Is the 'demon' just a malevolent and manipulative human being out to destroy Angelique, or is she truly possessed?Although the Angelique series continues after this book, and we are left wanting more, the climatic conclusion ties up at least some of the loose ends and misunderstandings from the preceding books, while opening up new possibilities for the future.Truly the outstanding series of books written this century (or any other)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent analysis of Jung's theory of individuation.","review":"Dr. Edinger explains the Jungian concept of individuation as both a psychological and spiritual phenomenon. Although the author does not explicitly acknowledge the underlying spirituality of Jung's concept of the self/ego relationship, it is apparent that he feels there is a metaphysical and spiritual basis to human development. Edinger, it seems to me, posits that the ego is a temporal construct rooted in a trascendental, timeless Self (soul). The text is filled with insightful accounts of many hermetic and esoteric concepts which appear in the Jungian corpus. Those who have read Jung's works on alchemy will find Edinger's interpretations illuminating. This is a wonderful secondary work on Jungian theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not modern","review":"I have had the chance to use the book while living in Armenia and unfortunately the book uses words that are not modern and really dates itself.

While it is well-written and there are useful insights they're more in the category of finding value from people sharing in AA--not thought/behavior changing/managing tools specifically. And I don't say this pejoratively but is very much within the AA tradition. If you are looking for non-12 step approaches to recovery this isn't it :).The Amazon rating system doesn't serve this category very well. The book isn't a 2 in the sense that it's poorly written or structured. The self-help category really needs a \\"I found this book useful/did not find it useful\\" scale.

The author was very unclear about what her medical regimen was supposed to be, especially in the home envinronment. Some times she can walk or sit up, and other times she is confined to laying on the floor examining the carpet lint, and feeling sorry for herself.

I'll say that the slick direction of Damian Harris to be very good as he kept the vision of Bad Company to be sharp and appealing with enough style. The more time spent watching the story unfold before my eyes, the less I understand what the heck the movie was all about. Ellen Barkin sure can play a very sexy character, but it's too bad that she wasted her talent in this clunker. I actually liked the creation of the characters as the cast seemed suited to play all of them except for Michael Beach who should remain Mr. Clark's btch.

It comes with a travel bag and when collapsed it looks like a Pack-n-Play.The problem we had is in setting it up and breaking it down. The locking system for the horizontal bars did not lock on the first attempt. In fact there were times when I was shaking the device just to get the horizontal bars to lock. Then going to unlock them to collapse the system was even harder. They have labels on the side that tell you where to squeeze to collapse the bars, but that doesn't always work.

The mini co sleeper is perfect on the other hand, and the storage space underneath is also a really great feature (can hold lots of extra diapers, nightgowns, sheets, and blankets). The pockets on the top can fit 10-15 diapers and the bottom pockets can hold one of the big size tubs of Aquaphor plus other essentials. It's easy to assemble and break-down for travel. The only down side I can see to it (particularly for those with a small bedroom like ours) is that once the baby outgrows the bassinet stage you will lose the storage space underneath.

They got outplayed by three pre-teen boys.They should stick to what they do best, and not disgrace further english pop songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind album.","review":"Soul Oddity's Tone Capsule is undoubtably one of my favorite records.

This is it! Fingerlicking Good! An incredible (and sadly undiscovered by mainstream Detroit House/Techno purveyors) CD that includes excellent \\"and I do mean excellent\\" detroit techno by Detroit's underground cult producers. If you like the classic Transmat, UR, KMS style you have to get this CD! The perfect music that will take you to heaven without never ever bringing you back. The opening is by Claude Young (freestyle DJ) who I always thought to be on the leading edge. Claude Young told me that Astralwerks was really picky about the songs....but it resulted in this beautiful gem. Claude Young's opening track spells it out...it would be impolite to refuse this CD! Play this music in your car while driving at a star filled night in Nevada and you will fly to the stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste","review":"This is a waste of time and money. You need the Iomega hardware to get this to work, which with writable CD ROM renders the entire Iomega company basically obsolete.Move on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars is Generous","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I tried to like it. I bought it because of the blips comparing it to \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" (which is absurd) and also because it does have a pretty interesting \\"this looks to be entertaining\\" premise.However, it was a frustrating one to get through. A few reasons: the main character is impossible to like (he spends most of the time whining...it gets old), most of the other characters are equally annoying and stereotypical, the wannabe-witty dialogue is anything but, and, worst of all, you just can't shake the notion that it could be pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Imaginative, colorful, funny. The New Orleans background adds a lot to the story of a hilariously bumbling vampire's escapades. Unique. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a pleasure to read","review":"After years of sexy, glittery vampires novels to the point of despair...Finally a real vampire book! Jules, Maureen and Doodlebug are beautifully written characters. You want Jules to overcome his beliefs and triumph to become a better person... er vampire. Can't wait to get to the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE IT","review":"I really tried to read it, it was like that horrible job you sometimes get and you just keep praying it will end. It was terrible, I began to pray that the main character would be staked I hated him so much. Save the money and use it to light your fireplace or wipe your butt, it would be better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"fat white reader blues","review":"I tried, I really did, I kept looking for the magic that spawned the many five star ratings but I simply couldn't find it, in fact I simply couldn't finish it. The story started off promising enough and the reason for duchon's portliness, well that was just flat out original, hysterical and so timely what with the current obesity 'epidemic', and furthermore the reason it got the two stars. But aside from trashing the big easy in almost every chapter it just didn't go anywhere. I really wanted Malice X, or even....no especially Maureen, to rip Jules' throat out. Who knows maybe I'll try it again but for now it sits in my kindle home page just threatened to be erased. It's a shame because the title was brilliant. A real eye catcher, shame it couldn't hold one once caught."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Anti-Rice of New Orleans Vampires","review":"If you like vampire tales, you just gotta love \\"Fat White Vampire Blues.\\" Andrew Fox has written a fine and funny tale of vampires from the less elite and effete sections of The Big Easy. Not that I dislike Anne Rice's vampire tales, but after a while....\\"Fat White Vampire Blues\\" is a b-movie of a book informed by pulp magazines, comic books, new age spiritualism, and, well, b-movies. The conclusion of the tale is a little unsatisfying, and Fox plays fast and furious with so many concepts of vampirism (both traditional and some his own creations) along the way that he leaves many unexplored in the effort to get his story wrapped up. Maybe that's not a bad thing. Jules could always return in a follow-up, and that wouldn't be a bad thing either. Even so, this book is just so much fun to read it's hard not to like it.As for any charges that the book is racist or homophobic ... give me a break. Methinks the reader doth protest too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife and I both love it!","review":"My wife's tastes run to Jan Karon and mine run to Robert Parker, and both of us love _The Fat White Vampire Blues_. As a near New Orleans resident and aspiring writer, few things fascinate me more than a book that can capture not only the New Orleans scene and characters but somehow the feel of life down here. The intentional similarity to _A Confederacy of Dunces_ resonates well, but the freshness of Fat White Vampire makes it more fun for me. I especially like the way Jules never quite manages to get his shape-changing right. How many books on the supernatural really deal well with this problem in life, the fact that bad things happen when we try something new? I can't wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jules","review":"I swear I've seen Jules driving his cab down Canal several times or someone that closely resembles him. If you enjoy vampire books and New Orleans you will love this one.It's fun going through the book saying: oh I've been there or I know where thats at. The Trolley stop is one of my favorites. This book puts a unique twist on vampires and my only complaint is that I couldn't put it down and finished it way to soon.Do yourself a favor and pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time","review":"The title hooked me; I thought it would be something interesting and new. The idea of playing with standard vampire concepts intrigued me and, if nothing else, should have been intersting. I started this book, got bored and put it down, started it again, got bored, and finally made it through on the third attempt. Every time, I kept thinking \\"this can't get worse\\" and every time it did. That was actually the worst part: I wanted it to be good.I was rooting for Malice to kill him within the first fifty pages.The writing itself is awful. Setting and even metaphores rely on name recognition, not solid description. Even if the reader excuses that, the plot is so twisted that it's not believable. Some coincidence is acceptable, but it can't carry a 334 page novel. A story needs more than just an interesting idea to be good, a concept that was driven home by reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing.","review":"The fact this book was ever published is beyond my comprehension. the only reason I even finished it was the fact that it is this months reading for d.c. sci-fi club.Original material? Maybe. A much better author, my 3 year old nephew for example could have turned this into a much more interesting story. If this author is ever allowed to publish another book I will forever boycott that publisher.Sorry to be crass but the only way I was able to finish this book was by making it the only book availible in the toilet.

Mmm so lovely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite bath product","review":"I love this product. I have tried several bath products for kids and this one is the best. My kids both have sensitive skin and this soap is very gentle but effective and when they get out of the bath they smell so good. I was at first hesitant to use this because I thought that sensitive skin should stick with unscented soap, but this Mustela figured out a way to have the best of both worlds. I have been a devoted customer for 4 years now.I also used the foaming shampoo when my kids were newborns to prevent cradle cap. Worked like a charm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby shampoo","review":"I highly recommend this hair and body wash for babies with sensitive skin. Here's the breakdown of pros and cons:1) Like: the fragrance is not too strong and smells amazing, the formula rinses well and does not lather too much, and we haven't had any allergic reactions2) Don't like: it's one of the more expensive cleansers (but it does last for a while since you only need a little bit to wash the whole baby)There's not much else to say about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best baby product for sensitive skin!!!!!","review":"My son has eczema and this is the only product that keeps it under control!

Only a VERY small amount is needed to get a good, bubbly lather -- a fourth of the amount used to get the same lather from a regular baby shampoo (like Johnson & Johnson's). A single tube of Mustela shampoo would last around 11 months, sometimes longer, for 2 babies. The price is actually quite competitive with the regular brands.Also, it was the only brand of baby shampoo I tried that didn't leave the skin on my hands feeling stripped of its oils."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smell","review":"I love the lotion, but this wash does not smell good at all.

It's priced like a premiere premium A+ top quality product, not a geto self released product.I may return it due to the iffy playback.

Well, I call it my Forrest Gump toaster...you never know what yer gonna git. It does have a dial on it, but to my knowledge the dial has nothing to do with the color or degree of burntness of what's being toasted. You can dial 1 and get coal dust; you can dial 4 and keep your waffle frozen.However, it does have a handy little tray that pulls out so you can clean out the crumbs, instead of having to turn the thing upside down to open it for cleaning (saving the busy homemaker a whole second or two of precious time, I suppose); and it has rescued me from constantly burning my fingers on the element of my electric stove, a daily occurence when I was toasting bread on its broiler setting after my last toaster bit the big one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap-o-matic","review":"I bought the previous model of intellitoast a couple years ago.

Since the second time I used the tool, it has had an exaust leak. I've broken the gun down, checked all of the seals, cleaned everything and the problem temporarily goes away but it always comes back. The more recent problem I've had is the gun stops firing. I have not figured it out but it seems the air releases but the hammer does not. When it happens, I'll repeatedly bump a scrap piece of lumber until it starts nailing again.I've maintained the gun well ... oiled it as instructed and really like the weight, balance and the belt hook.

This book falls far short, however, of being complete, and I am not sure why it was written in the first place. Most insider's in the media world didn't really care for him, as he was as wild, arrogant and disrespectful too many there. Stewart did make some tremendous gestures in giving money away, but it still doesn't mean that this is a book that any non-golfer would need in their library.

The problem is with the camera's image compression algorithm. Instead of evenly dividing up the 2MB of storage space, they thought it might be a good idea to compression each image and cause so much data loss that images show excessive pixilation. I didn't have a problem with the 640x480 resolution or 8-bit color depth just the lousy fuzzy looking images the camera produces.

The protagonist, Louden Swain, is a 17-and 18-year-old who is doing his very best to become the best (the most alive, capable) person he can figure out how to become. It's durned good to see such a life as Louden's promoted in a fine piece of writing instead of the maladjusts we often find in contemporary, \\"cool\\" literature. Although Vision Quest is listed as a young adult title, the writing transcends that genre. This is not so much a book for adolescent readers (although they'll likely enjoy it) as it is a fun read for adults who powerfully connect with good novels. The ending: it's downright perfect. The wrestling match between Louden and his opponent is not the point of the story. The journey of becoming is what matters here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - met Terry from Ms. Olson, the blonde at Shadle","review":"This probably won't go anywhere but I met you Terry when I was a Junior, wrestling for Shadle Park.

Ricci, Jackson, the guy who played the preacher, and the lady from \\"Law and Order\\"), and it was a hoot seeing Jackson perform a really nasty, dirty version of \\"Stagolee\\", but these pluses were far outweighed by things like a fairly incomprehensible story, graphic depictions of Ricci engaging in what I think amounts to bestiality, pretty crappy dialog and sloppy direction.

But this film feels like an outrageous parody of the blues and the culture it comes from. About the first 1/3 of the film was somewhat palatable, then it just kept getting worse and worse, with some of the cheesiest dialogue and situations I've seen in a long time. All the more painful because there's zero irony anywhere to be found. The script and director seem to come from some kind of adolescent romanticism blended with hokey New Age therapy. Even Samuel L.

Black Snake Moan gets the crazy balance between religion and sin that you find everywhere in the Bible belt. It's pretty much a story of redemption and love set against the racial/economic backdrop of the poor, rural south. But, it totally doesn't look like it!

A decidedly underrated poet in the spectrum of literature, Neruda repeatedly evokes and communicates emotion through his musings on himself and the world around him. Pablo Neruda confronts his emotions head on, remaining critical of himself and the way he chooses to love and live. The poet is at his best when pouring his heart out, when describing just how his woman makes him feel, when describing just what makes her so beautiful to him. Any fan of poetry who is unfamiliar with Pablo Neruda owes it to themselves to purchase this collection or one similar to is and marvel at this master poet's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash of VH-1 Legends","review":"Having purchased this CD without a description available, I bought the proverbial \\"pig in a poke\\".

The artists are a surprising who's who of popular music of the past few decades. The sound is as good as can be expected for the varied sources.

Never before have I heard a twangy guitar, a drumset that plays like the apocalypse, and a muddy bass bring so much unhindered calamity to my ears, and so much embarrassing laughter to my self. This album, for all of it's rants and raves about dinosaur claws and bloody feet, is truly a work to be loved; for comic relief, for pure enjoyment, for some modest confusion. I'd never buy a CD like this for the music, but rather for the feeling the music bestows on the listener. A true diamond, in the albeit mightily dirty rough.

The haunting chants, the beautiful melodies, the orchestrations, the effects, the beats...this album can really take you places, opening up your imagination, and even getting you more in touch with your Self."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREGORIAN CHANTS - A FLOYDIAN SLIP?","review":"Caveat emptor - don't buy into the intriguing promise on the cover that herein lie influences of \\"Enigma and Pink Floyd\\". Someone please \\"illuminate\\" me where I can find a trace of Pink Floyd here, thank you.It takes a great deal of musical creativity to cobble together the kind of epic compilations Michael Cretu's Enigma team is known to produce, but Lesiem seems to have picked up on one element thereof -- gregorian chants -- and spun a dozen tracks over what seems to be the same drum beats, hoping at least a few gullible shnooks would lap it up.The curious may be well advised to give \\"La Rose\\" and \\"Roma\\" a listen to get a general idea, but the rest of it is mostly self-same filler sung by your local choir's back row."},{"rating":"2","title":"An aluring mixture of haunting chants and new age music","review":"Lesiem blurs the line between world/new age music. Most of the songs on Illumination focus on vocal chanting, but the music in the backround adds a new age element that keeps you listening. There are also multicultural influences abound...each track seems to have a different theme. For example...the song Africa uses African vocals and instruments, and Brittania carries a distict British atmosphere. I really can't think of a dull track on the album. The sticker on the cover claims Lesiem is \\"for fans of Enigma and Pink Floyd\\". While I can certainly see the Enigma comparison, there is not much to base a Pink Floyd comparison on (perhaps the electric guitar used in the second track?). Aside from that false ploy, Lesiem stands by itself as an intriguing new artist that will surely capture the ears of new age and world music fans alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Bigg Lugg!","review":"This \\"Monster Hook\\" is made mainly of plastic and aluminum, the plastic tends to break too easily.

The compressor is everything I expected it to be. I've used it with my DeWalt brad nailer putting up moldings, and with a rented floor nailer. The compressor worked exceptionally well for both applications. The compressor is not noisey which I was a little concerned with after reading other reviews. I have not used the compressor with a framing nailer but plan to in the near future. I did not realize that there were two types of fittings for compressors and tools, automotive and industrial. You cannot interchange the two so decide which ones to go with and stick with that. I do think one or the other is considered standard and I would probably go with the standard. The rental unit had a standard fitting on it, as I was told."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot hot dog","review":"I returned the DeWalt compresssor because I believe it had been used, probably briefly, returned and reshipped to me. It arrived with considerable oil in the bottom of the carton. When attempting to initiate set up procedure, the owners manual was unclear and necessitated a call to a DeWalt service center. There was a considerable amount of oil in the crankcase, and an ounce (approx) of rusty water drained from the tanks when valves were opened; the service center rep advised that this should not have been the case. Additionally, pressure control valve is difficult to adjust because of location under the handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good compressor, poor design","review":"This compressor does the basics well - compress air. The issues that I have are in the design of the unit.1. The bleed valve location is on the back of the unit next to the compressor motor, which makes it hard to access and there's burn potential for hands.2. The pressure gauge is behind the carry handle so vision is obstructed.3. The output pressure control valve is tight behind the carry handle.4. The hose connection faces the compressor motor rather than the front.It does the basics without complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"DeWalt - What more need I say?","review":"This is a great little compressor for the money!

Half the food would get stuck under the blades. So, I took that one to work for smoothies (mmmm) and decided to try this one.It's been great. Rather to my surprise, it is much easier to empty completely and clean, and the shape of the bowl means that it does a better job of getting all the contents into the blades without help from a spatula. I use it for pureeing fruits and vegetables, for grinding rice, and for making tofu-based smoothies. Because it is so much easier to use than the other, I find that I do more blending.The first few times I used it, I got a little \\"new motor smell\\", but that went away.

There was a really simple recipe for fruit smoothies that came with this blender so we tried it out. We put in the strawberries, bananas, milk, and yogurt and turned it on. Two minutes later, the motor is still spinning but nothing happens. You can smell the motor burning up but nothing is mixing inside the blender. We've tried putting the ingredients in in different orders, but the results are always the same. Nothing will happen until you use the big plastic stick they give you to push things around. That's just irritating. What good is a blender if you have to constantly push the contents around with a stick to get it to blend?Bottom line - we're at Amazon looking for a new blender and the garbage man can have this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon rules!","review":"I am very happy with my new Hamilton Beach Blender.

Well, I think that the manufacturing tolerence on the magazine is a bit off. The 2\\" nails wouldn't slide smoothing in the magazine clip and kept binding. I decided to call DeWalt and spoke to a representive questioning if there was a specific brand of nails I should be using.

The vibration feature is really nice to have when the workshop gets noisy. I had to fine tune it when I first got it, but haven't touched it since (nearly 3 months). It's super sensitive, but when you get it tuned right and move it slowly and thoroughly, I doubt anything metal would get past it.

We had one unit that had a slight problem and not only did the folks at Wizard replace it they did it quickly and did not put us to any amount of the usual torture that most companies put customers through.

Why didn't they just put a plastic knob on the adjustment so I dont have to go looking for a tool everytime I want to tune it??

I couldn't see how decades of hatred could be changed in so short a period of time, it didn't ring true. The characters had no life on the page unless they were fighting with each other, and I found myself skipping paragraphs to get to some plot movement.I did like the location, and many of the author's touches worked regarding the New England location, except for one. In Massachusetts we never go \\"up the Cape,\\" as was stated in the book. We only go \\"down the Cape,\\" no matter where we are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming!","review":"My book club needed something a little light for this month.

This is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really \\"cute\\" book!","review":"This is just a really cute book--creates allegiances with one family or the other. It's a quick read but you don't want to put it down. The author certainly has a well-developed sense of humor, displayed in her characters and plot. Hurry up with the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Perspective","review":"An older characters perspective on love, family and business and not much different from the younger generation's perspectives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flirty and Charming","review":"This book attracted me for a very simple and not very intelligent reason. I liked the cover. I thought it was pretty. I know, not a very thoughtful way to pick out a book but, once I started this sweet tale I was enchanted. I found it to be very likeable and very sexy. It's a wonderful tale of love, the problems that always seem to come up with that and the endearing belief that it will conquer all. The cast of characters add a wonderful sense of adventure, humor and sometimes frustration. But, I completely enjoyed this book. It was a fast and fun read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Read!","review":"FINALLY a novel with a character over age 45! Great plot and felt like I knew Julie and Romeo as friends. Enjoyed the story tremendously. Some parts were laugh-out-loud funny.And...I've also read the sequel, \\"Julie & Romeo Get Lucky\\"....I give that a 5 also.Now I'm patiently waiting for this great author's next book to hit the book stores and find a place on my book shelf. I highly recommend Ray, especially if you're looking for characters beyond the chick lit age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Read","review":"If you like romance then this is the book for you. If you like your heroes to be in the early part of their lives with bodies like Greek Gods then stay away.This is a sensitive and some times funny look at two sixty-year-old people falling in love.Julie and Romeo each own a floundering florist business and due to divorce and death are now single.All the odds are against their romance from the start. For as long as they can remember their families have hated each other; none of them knowing the reason why.Not wishing to upset their children they court each other in secret. The results of which are tender and cheerful.This book was an enjoyable read and one that is absolutely believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"bh cass pd 4","review":"I would say that this book was a quick and easy read. It was hilarious and kept me into the book so I never put it down. Some parts made me laugh and others made me so mad at some of the kids. I never would think that two families could hate each other so much. It kept me wondering why they were in a fued. One of my favorite parts was when Romeo and Julie went to Romeo's flower shop and Romeo's son was sleeping there. I would have been completely humiliated if I was Julie. Although is was a short novel and it was her first, it did have a good deal of content. I always enjoy a book that actually makes you feel like a part of the story. Plus it kept me interested on the modern twist it has from the original Shakespeare story, with a happier ending though! I would reccommend this book to anyone who was looking for a comical short read. I enjoyed this book and would like to see her have some new novels come out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every woman's fantasy!","review":"I can't wait to be in love the way they are.

When I got to my destination I happened by a book store and decided to get the book. What a wonderful treat for me. I started reading the book and could not put it down. I laughed so much. It was wonderful reading about Romero and Julie. The best thing was that they were older, more mature people and they found love. This just goes to show that you are never too old for love. The grandmother was so funny. But by far the funniest scenes were when Romero and Julie were caught naked in the flower shop by Raymond and when Romero and Mort got in a fight. I loved the fact that Tony and Sandy were able to find each other after 15 years.Treat yourself to a wonderful book about finding love when and where you least expect it. This was pure enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fanciful","review":"As more scholarly reviewers have already pointed out, the author has done little more than propose a novel theory and then scour the historical record to prop up her suppositions. An example that sticks in my head is when Winn theorizes that mosquitoes may have been the disease bearers. Her reasoning runs: the Salem girls were mostly affected, right? And girls work in the garden, where there are mosquitoes, and girls do chores in the dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are active. Uhhh...did Puritan men ever get out of the kitchen in Winn's world? Then a page later, she announces that it could have been ticks. After all, men went out into the woods and cut tick-infested lumber for firewood (conveniently not getting bitten). The lumber was then placed in homes where the girls lived, and, well, you do the math. It just doesn't add up to anything more than a fanciful \\"say, what if?....nah.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I am an encephalitis survivor","review":"Being a survivor I could definately understand what Laurie Winn Carlson was saying.

It is acted by the sublime Karine Vanasse and is worth watching many times over again. It is probably a good idea to use in acting classes, actually. I only hope the writers give Karine more chances to shine. She is the reason I watch this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the pilot","review":"For those of you who were nonplussed by the pilot episode -- as I was -- I suggest that you hang on through the season.If you refrain from comparing to Mad Men, you will likely find yourself pleasantly surprised.

Well, if it was, total fail. I can't understand why all the good reviews for this show? Bad script along with some bad acting, made this cool concept a shadow of what could have been a great show. I love Christina Ricci, so I admit I had high hopes going in, but what a waste of her talent. With all the great TV out now (Damages, Homeland, The League, Dexter, Mad Men, Shameless, House of Lies, Boss, etc) Why would anyone bother with this show??? Skip this insepid show and save your hard earned money, as well as the many hours of your life watching this show, that you will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"It was a great idea. It could have been good. Mad Men in the air, right? But the plots are so ridiculous and the stereotypes so indicative of a poorly written script, I don't even blame the actors, who probably gave up their good names for participation. I bought the season, excited to watch as I love Mad Men and sixties Bond movies, and Hitchcock, but didn't even get past episode 4. Think I didn't even finish it. Truly bored. And it could have been so good. Get Nurse Jackie instead. Now there is some good writing about not much of an idea. Proving that the idea is only part of the formula. The writing, plot and characters are the test. Just skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself","review":"Someone told me this was supposed to be the female version of MadMen. No way. It's utterly inferior in every way. For a pilot to be so utterly uninspiring is preposterous, given that pilots are usually the thing which gets you hooked. it was unconvincing, not particularly interesting, and surprisingly not even that good to look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"I met Mr. Blechman at Chino Planes of Fame Corsair Demonstration Day and he enthusiastically signed his book for me! I could hardly wait to get home and read it and I was not let down.

I finally have a good appreciation for just how difficult a machine it was to land aboard an air craft carrier. Well done Mr. Blechman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compilation","review":"Perhaps I should have read the reviews a bit more carefully before I purchased this book. My interest is World War 2 first person acounts, especially those books written by aviators. Although this book was, for the most part, a first person account, it was also very repetitive as if each chapter( by the author) was a magazine article intended for a reader who had not read the previous chapter. For instance, the section of the book relating the author's personal experiences includes at least three seperate \\"chapters\\" wherin he describes his crash during his initial carrier qualification. This book would be more accurately described as a compilation of magazine articles that describe very specific incidents ( sometimes as many as three times) without any depth and with little context. That being said, I admire the author's courage in flying the beast that was the Corsair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for GERD SUFFERERS","review":"Ive had GERD for about 20 years.

It does however teach you the steps for maximizing treatment and avoiding wasted time in controlling heartburn. A must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic to help me","review":"This book is so basic that (at least to me) it was virtually useless. There was not one shred of new information. Anyone who has had heartburn for some time and has done any investigative work will get nothing new from this book. How about some innovative, new, or experimental heartburn management strategies?"},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated","review":"This book seems to be outdated (it mentions vioxx which has since been taken off the market).

I recommend 'No More Heartburn' by Sherry Rogers over this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money & keyword heartburn on the web","review":"This isn't a bad book, but you can get all the same information going on line and keywording GERD or heartburn. I am sceptical of the many anecdotal patients in the book, used entirely to support her topic of the moment. I felt spoken down to in the book. Still, if you MUST have a book about this topic, this one will give you all the basics, but don't expect any revolutionary new ideas to conquer this bothersome syndrome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhh, Very Cute!","review":"This is a great song, very cute just like the tubbies them selves.

When I received the video I watched it (I watch everything before my son sees it so I know what to try to teach him). This movie is EXTREMELY boring and the narrators voice is IRRITATING. She sounds fake. I'd recommend Baby's First Impressions Opposites. The lady's voice is much more palitable and it's alittle more exciting. All of the BumbleBee Kids videos have the same narrator but for some reason THIS video is the worst. ABC's and Colors are alright (it's good to use flashcards too, to reinforce what they've learned). My son adores the numbers and I like the fact that they have 2 discs so once your kid can count upto 5 then you just go to disc 2. I could've saved my money on this video. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great especially for children with autism","review":"Previous reviews indicate too slow moving and boring but if you know about child developement this is a very good tape. Repetition is crucial for autism and other nuerological diseases in kids. My son learned so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author needs to learn how to communicate","review":"I found this book to be very frustrating. Many interesting concepts, but extrememly difficult to read. It seemed like there was a new concept every paragraph, but I was still trying to figure out what the previous paragraph was trying to explain. The APA referencing was also distracting. The author referenced many sources, so just about the time I'd get a flow going in the reading I'd hit a reference that would interrupt my train of thought. Thank goodness we had an excellent teacher in the classroom who could interpret the book for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome vocals and music","review":"A MUST HAVE!!!Finally a beautiful rendition of Sting's hit single as done by the wonderous voice of Rowena Taheny.

It's energetic and fun. It's not an accessible album, it's lo-fi, and full of flaws. When I first got it, I agreed with the reviewer who gave it 1 star. (Nice to have, not to listen to.) A yaer later, I listen to it all the time. It's charmingly old-school, and right at the forefront of the creation of acid house as a genre. This is a fresh sound brewed with cheap, second-hand electronic boxes that, as the liner notes say, wants nothing to do with guitars. Yeah, it's dated, but so's Public Enemy and the Eurythmics and a lot of other stuff from the '80s. Good music can be flagrantly dated but still hold up and impress years later. This album is like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the Kindle Version, get the Paperback!","review":"I purchased the kindle version and it was not worth my money. The problem is that the table of contents breaks down the introduction into sections such as \\"author, place of writing, date, etc...\\" but then the actually commentary is just one section titled \\"commentary\\". This means that on a kindle you have no way of navigating 90% of the book.

The unit is just over warranty -- so goodbye $70 -- and I'm back shopping for a replacement (I got this unit from another store, not Amazon). But I won't get a Sony product this time around, sorry to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"When we purchased this for my daughter, a year and a half ago, there were no reviews for it (ours is actually the Sony CFD-S300 which is no longer offered). I thought Sony was a reliable name brand and that is why I purchased it without any feedback listed...bad mistake.As everyone else here has written, the disc player no longer works. It was great for a little while, then tempermental for a few months and now it is done for good. The cassette player still works and I use it for books on tape, but it's no good for anything my kids have.I'm not sure what I'll buy to replace it but I will certainly do a little more research this time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If Obama Hasn't Read This, He Should...","review":"...to immerse emotionally in a Chicago where black met white and through two little boys got along, long before his time.

I thought I could spot his \\"voice\\" anywhere. But a line or two into this book and I forgot that it doesn't have a life of its own.Please don't tell me the characters of Sass and Steve (or most importantly, Dora) aren't real people. I see no Frank Joseph anywhere; only a living breathing story.Steve has a flat-footed compulsive innocence -- a refusal to let go of the optimistic view. A really cool character. And Dora is so substantive you can feel her hugs or hear the click of her tongue against her teeth as she shakes a finger at you. The way Frank tied the two characters together is wonderful.This is the most engrossing book I've read in ages. You can't overstate my enjoyment. Congratulations on a stupendous achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"It was never my intention to buy this book at all.

It does find metal but only 1/4\\" deep. Any deeper and it won't find steel shot.

But it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. I tried it on a pallet from my bandsaw shipment and it easily found all the nails in it. I also had no problems finding countersunk brads in a bookcase that I built. I then put a 3/4\\" pine board over a smattering of brads on a worktable and this little gadget found them with no problem. I suspect it probabaly won't be able to detect a brad more than an inch deep.

Used according to the directions it finds nails easily, and if your thorough, will even find skinny little upholstery staples.The device seems well made, I expect it will last a long time.I estimate it's already paid for itself in a single project when I compare it's cost to that of planer, router and saw blades that would otherwise have been damaged.If you work with reclaimed wood you probably need one of these (or the more expensive model if you do lot's of reclaimation)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"This was an interesting read though a bit too scholarly at times.

Not only does he not provide adequately provide support for the theme of his book; he almost abandons trying to half way through. The chapter focusing on Mamie Smith's \\"Crazy Blues\\" was refreshing and eye opening, but the rest of the book does not sway one to ackowledge the validity of his point. The constant use of \\"Blues Literature\\" to support his theory of real worl dblue falls short by nature, being that the blues authors quoted wrote fiction where is by its essence prone to exagerationa nd romanticism and can not convincingly back up his point about white oppression and violence being the backbone of almost all blues music and acting as a coded message universally gotten by the black blues audience. The academic nature of this book loses touch with the reality of things."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Mr Adams","review":"I agree strongly with Bashir Adams,who is a great musicain and scholar himself. Shujjhat Khan obviously holds back Tejendra Majumdar not only on this recording but in every performance,which I have personally noticed. Every artist is great in his own way but these two are in different leagues. The previous reviewer has missed out on a lot of jugalbandis if he deems this one greatest in twenty years.I once saw Tejendra play with Shahid Pervez and I felt that these two were more in the same musical and techinical level.I hope that these two will be recorded in the future"},{"rating":"1","title":"so so album","review":"i personally dont like the giving stars option,but have to.The album was good.

Its my opinion that the school or style tejendra comes from is the most advanced in indian classical music.The great Ravi Shankar is from that particular school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel The Love, People","review":"This is deeply spiritual music that, if listened to mindfully and honestly, can open hearts and bring peace and brotherhood to everyone, regardless of ethnicity and opinion and personality. Unlike rap, this is not the kind of music that causes dissension and partisanship and petty, bickering personal resentments. As evidenced by the reviews below, listening to this beautiful, profound music causes one to see things under the aspect of eternity and realize that we are all one within the endless void of being. Fused into one mind through contemplation of these divine melodies and harmonies, we finally grasp that the chains of Maya that seem to bind us to eternal strife are but an illusion and that it's all about the love.THAT'S why everyone reviewing this CD is so mellow and cool with everyone else here.And no need for anyone to \\"get a life\\" because there's no life for anyone to \\"get\\" after all. Life just IS, man.Dig, man?Groovy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Favorite - great classic read-aloud book","review":"My Mom used to read this to us when we were little.

Very enjoyable, but I wish the recordings had been made in the artists' prime. Generally, the vocals detract from the overall appeal of the music. For me the old, orginal records have a sound evocative of the days when the music was popular. Somehow, the modern technology does not capture the \\"feel\\" quite so well. In all, the album is a good starting place to go on looking for the more spontaneous, unselfconscious performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter Planet Chemical","review":"Proof that techno can have soul. This is as much of a rock CD as it is elecronica. If this can't get your energy up see a doctor now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the hooks?","review":"This album plays like a The Crystal Method album but without the hooks. I did not get attached to any of the melodies which doesn't reflect the beats very well, nor the bass lines. The sample work was splendid, however, which has me on a fence whether or not I should continue to buy.Overall, though, a boring listen. I'd probably enjoy it at a local occasion but not for personal use.I purchased this album because I wanted to be introduced to The Chemical Brothers the right way, through their first releases.I've heard somewhere that each album progresses in a different and often more appealing direction so I won't let this album ruin The Chemical Brothers for me. I see potential in their work in Exit Planet Dust. Excellent sample work. I plan to buy another album. I'm a bit interested to see where it might go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Techno Album Ever!!","review":"Okay, maybe that is a little strong to say, but Exit Planet Dust by the Chemical Brothers definitely ranks as one of techno/electronica's greatest CDs ever. I remember that I bought this a month ago and after already having Dig Your Own Hole to go by, I was a little disappointed on first listen. However, I decided to listen to it again and really concentrate on the music. I saw this album in a completely different light and it is in heavy rotation in my Maxima with its Bose system right now. The first 4 tracks are outstanding especially Leave Home and Three Little Birdies Down Beats. Then you have other great tracks like Chemical Beats, Chico's Groove, and Alive Alone sung by Beth Orton which is my favorite track on the album and one of techno/electronica's greatest songs. This CD is a little more focused than DYOH and a little more chill-out and ambient but in a frantic ambient way. Much better than DYOH--I should have gotten EPD first. A must-own album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard, Soft, Squishy, Firm, Funky, Solid, Beautiful","review":"I bought this after hearing \\"Leave Home\\" but \\"In Dust We Trust\\" became my favorite track of this album or any other. Although \\"One Too Many Mornings\\" and \\"Life is Sweet\\" are also too good to even attempt to describe. I hand this album to those who like Prodigy and instantly change their minds. Buy it or not, I dont really care. I hope you dont so they wont become more commercial as Ive seen so far. Flee, let us people with good taste enjoy this. Go Home."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm sorry for what I said before","review":"I'm sorry I gave this CD only 3 stars. I now realize that it is a very good album.

I am also a big picklehead and I want you to e-mail myself and others telling them what a picklehead I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this album!","review":"I've listened to this album on repeat many times, it's probably been in my car for 4 months. There are some standout tracks (Alive Alone), and some not so stand out tracks, as always. Overall the album is very strong, and a great listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Brothers on the decks...","review":"The Chemical Brothers break it down with some old school scratchin' and thumping beats. While not quite the peak of the Brothers' sound, this album offers a glimpse of things to come and the beginnings of the signature Chemical style. \\"Leave Home\\" starts things off with a bang, quickly dropping mad beats with heavy bass guaranteed to make you move. The album really finds its stride midway, beginning with \\"Three Little Birdies Down Beats\\" and transitioning through to \\"Chemical Beats\\". Several lyrical tracks culminating in \\"Alive Alone\\" round out the set. A must for any fans of the big beat U.K. sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked The Little Women...","review":"if you are a fan of well written historical fiction set in the civil war era this book is definitely worth reading.the story is written as a complement to one of the all time classics \\"The Little Women\\" (published in 1869). it takes us through the life of the Little Women's father Rev. March (door-to-door salesman, entrepreneur, teacher, idealistic-abolitionist, real-estate investor, theologist - your regular civil-war-era Forrest Gump without the good luck) before and during the civil war. intertwined in the story are real historic and literary figures like Emerson, Thoreau and Hawthorne and their families.i am not sure if the book deserves to be the best in fiction in the whole year, but it is definitely worth reading and i rate it - 3.5/5. but i guess, i rounded it up here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am not going to create a long rehashing of the novel -- but I do want to voice my feelings about the hazards of anyone other than the author creating a sequel to a well-loved book. My interpretations of the characters of Marmee and Mr. March were and are very different from those of Miss Brooks. I object to her entire concept. In her afterword, the author states that her mother told her that no one could be such a goody-goody as Marmee -- how wrong she is. I have known many people who are not saints or \\" goody-goodies\\" but truly try to live the best lives possible and succeed admirably. Instead of tampereing with characters who are well-loved from a book that many hold dear, why does the author not creat her own story about the Civil War era and not try to capture a ready-made audience of another author?"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"no real character development, main character is self absorbed and boring, did not do justice to the classic Little Women, book dragged on and on and on...only merit to the book was the history itself - was looking forward to a well-rounded book (one that was worthy of its prize) - don't waste your time - if you want to read a good Civil War book read \\"The Widow of the South\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't The Year of Wonders","review":"I read The Year of Wonders and loved it. I bought this book specifically because it's the same author, and with high hopes. Unfortunately, this book is boring and slow moving. It could not hold my attention at all, and I didn't get engrossed with the characters like in her other book. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulitzer's Reliability","review":"As usual, any book selected by the Pulitzer Committee is a reliable horrible read. Too boring to waste my time on. . . Alcott would be mortified!"},{"rating":"1","title":"messy book","review":"Of course, all the words were there, so it served its purpose as a book club choice. However, I was quite disappointed in the condition of the book. Many pages were turned down or wrinkled and a great many had underlinings -- many times through the words that were being underlined, and many pages had comments in the edges. It's the first time I've purchased a book though Amazon that was not 100%."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book","review":"I had bad feelings from the very beginning because I dislike authors 'piggybacking' on other authors' characters, especially when the original author has died and can't defend him or herself. Beyond that, however, whether she had borrowed March from Alcott or not, this book was poorly-written and uninteresting. I equate it to a high school term paper. The characters were not well-developed, I absolutely couldn't stand March, and the whole story line had a such a contrived feeling that I could barely stand to read three pages a day. How could this book, then, win a Pulitzer Prize? The author had a good agent."},{"rating":"1","title":"one more cliched character and i think i'll scream!","review":"what a disappointment. i haven't read such cliched plot/character/voice since 'uncle tom's cabin'.i'm actually embarrassed to be seen with a copy; the only reason i'm giving it one star is because i love waterford, where the author resides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Interest Even Before I Finished the First Review","review":"I can't really rate it because I never read it. But what I read in the review tells me the author (of the book) didn't know her March Family history well at all. The father's name wasn't Peter. In fact, his first name was never given, but one of Jo's sons was named \\"Rob\\" after her father. I can't imagine how you'd get Rob out of Peter.This reminds me of the so-called sequel to Gone With The Wind some years back. The writers of both of these stories have been long gone, and no one can take their places. It's an interesting idea, I suppose, but it kind of rubs me the wrong way. But to each his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!","review":"March is a hypothetical back story to the missing father in Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\". Set a year after \\"Little Women\\" to give historical accuracy to March's involvement in the Civil War, you will marvel at the beauty of Brook's use of language, set in juxtaposition to the horrific events described in brutal detail.March is an imperfect man who desperately attempts to bring out the best in himself, while causing devastating consequences for others.I don't want to give away the details of the book. They are creative and you will be drawn in to the lives and times of all the characters in this gem of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"march","review":"Since I'm not a Civil War enthusiast and didn't really like the person, Mr. March, I didn't enjoy this book much."},{"rating":"2","title":"March by Geraldine Brooks","review":"I read this on my kindle and the first few pages made me think that it would be hard to read because it sounded like the style of Little Women. I was wrong, It really held my interest. I love reading about the Civil War and this combines that with an interesting personal story. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Women's Daddy","review":"A very imaginative tale of the father of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women. Brooks contrasts the apolitical book of Alcott with a strong political message in 'March.' A fast read; very well researched. A good companion read to 'Little Women.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"It took guts to take on an iconic family like the Marchs and great skill to succeed at it","review":"Lyrical and moving, this book did an amazing thing in my opinion, it improved upon the original. By fleshing out an previously 1-dimensional characters of Mr. March and Marmee, this not only stands alone as an excellent read (and a good primer on life as a Union soldier) but it enhances the enjoyment of the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a review of the book itself, but the kindle edition","review":"This is not a review of the book itself, but of the formatting of the book for the Kindle. I was shocked at the number of misspellings and punctuation errors throughout the Kindle edition I read. Two completely misspelled words within the same paragraph, sentences frequently ending with no punctuation whatsoever, commas and dashes dropped into words and sentences at random... I might expect this from one of the \\"free\\" public domain books, since they are formatted by volunteers, but presumably since I paid for this ebook, someone was paid to format it. If Penguin is in need of a proofreader for its ebooks, I'm available!! Interestingly enough, I read People of the Book, also by Geraldine Brooks on my Kindle and found no such errors.Have any other Kindle readers encountered this problem? Is it just this particular book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing..","review":"I liked People of the Book (yet it did have some slow parts) and I did like the beginning chapters of this book but I had to stop in the middle and just skip over the last 100 pages or so. It became pretty boring to me despite the interesting backdrop of a war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum","review":"I'm very drawn to the trancendental period of American history and literature. Emerson, Thoreau and Dickenson are deep, original, and magical philosophers, poets and thinkers. I go back to them for inspiration and to glimpse the seed of how America could have evolved. The civil war and slavery was the dark side of that era. I looked forward to this book to provide some insights to reconcile the odd dichotomy of those times.The author followed the marketable and easily exploitable portrayal of the inhumanity of slavery. Ho-hum. Could have been any time, any place. It was not particularly insightful of the period. The author is an adept, but not evocative writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marching into history","review":"As an historical novel, March is better than the average.

One or two mistakes could easily slip by, but this book is riddled with them. I am not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I learned a lot about the Civil War","review":"From reading this book. It really gave you an idea of what it was like to be there, way more than any history book I've read, and still kept you interested and involved with the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-read Little Women first to better appreciate March","review":"I am glad I re-read \\"Little Women\\" before reading this novel. I think it gave extra poignancy and resonance to \\"March.\\" Which is not to say that \\"March\\" cannot stand on its own, because it definitely can. Wonderful characters fully drawn and realized, and inserted into a harrowing account of one man's experience of the Civil War. A wonderful read that makes me want to pick up other novels by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating historical fiction","review":"March is a compelling account of one man's steps through the Civil War era.March, the absent father of the girls inLouisa May Alcott's Little Women, felt it was too cowardly for him not to par-ticipate in the battle,but his enlistment as a chaplain led him into much danger."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling novel dealing with the forgotten member of Louisa May Alcott's March family--the father","review":"This novel deals with the forgotten member of Louisa May Alcott's March family, the father, who is absent in Alcott's classic novel Little Women due to the Civil War.Geraldine Brooks is a compelling, up-and-coming, well-deserved-Pulizer-Prize-winning historical novelist who has the uncanny ability to make anything as upsetting and complex as the Civil War sound like poetry--her command of the English is that good.Brooks fleshes The Rev. Capt. March out with a personality and a conscience as active and troubled as any fictional protagonist as he calls into question the ideals behind fighting the war, based upon what he observes around him. A New Englander (thus, a Yankee fighting for the Union) spending time on a plantation in the South evokes images and experiences which he never anticipated. Highly recommended, note just for Civil War buffs and/or Alcott fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very thin story.","review":"Glossed over so many subjects that could have been covered in much greater detail. No sense of time in the writing ..it seemed to me the author was in a hurry to finish the book or keep the pages down so as not to scare off a mass audience who will not buy books that are too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - 21st century writing attempting 19th century speech","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I had a very good impression because of the various reviews and the Pulitzer Prize but find this book disappointing. March's actions do not align with the moral of the little women he raised and the high standards he holds in Alcott's Little Women. The language doesn't read like a 19th century speaker. It sounds very modern. Killer Angels is my standard for a well written civil war era book and this doesn't come close. Chamberlain's voice rings true. March's falls short. He rationalizes in a way a 20th or 21st century man would. I cannot recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essentially soft porn, and astonishingly dreadful!","review":"Who knew? The reviews were glowing and the descriptions of the book seemed dull enough to ensure the sort of respectability that clings to serious historical fiction. Oh, but the book is really awful, complete with the beautiful, mixed race house slave (actually the daughter of the plantation owner) stripped bare and publicly lashed because of Mr. March's actions when he was an innocent young peddler. It makes the reader--or this reader--cringe with embarrassment. There's nothing literary about this book; it's along the lines of Robert Penn Warren's terrible novel BAND OF ANGELS. If you're determined to read fiction in this vein go straight to GONE WITH THE WIND, which is, in fact, a serious and pretty successful effort to capture an era. And, while you're at it, pick up a copy of Robert Penn Warren's ALL THE KING'S MEN."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is really a long March...","review":"I have been reading this book forever. I never quit a book in the middle but press on and this one is like a \\"march that will not end\\".Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"March could have been so much more.","review":"Geraldine Brooks has a masterful command of language, however I felt she needed to focus on violent shock-value to keep the reader's interest. I was also irritated with how the protagonist was presented. In the story Mr. March is supposed to be a religious person and while he is gentle and kind, he lacks the spirit of God -- he also lacks integrity in keeping the seventh commandment. The author may have researched about religious people but it seemed obvious to me that she isn't religious herself and therefore Mr. March lacked the depth that comes from knowing God. The last chapter is the only chapter one needs to read in order understand the theme of the narrative. Novels focusing on this difficult time in our history that are truely moving and enlightening would include Uncle Tom's Cabin, Red Badge of Courage and Fire by Night but not March."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW did this book win a Pullitzer Prize?","review":"I am shocked and dismayed that the Pullitzer Prize was awarded to March by Geraldine Brooks. The information about the brutality of the Civil War is impressive and there are beautifully written passages, but the storyline is like a soap opera or made-for-TV movie. Can anyone who ever read \\"Little Women\\" imagine Marmie making love on the shores of Walden Pond, before marriage, with Minister March???? And that's not all. . .I just read this for my book club and there was not one person (out of 20 and a paid leader) who could justify the award given to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I had very high expectations for this book given her other book.

Surrounding each stamp is about two pages devoted to describing the history and background of the stamp and its subject.I do not keep books on my coffee table, but I would assume that this would be a good book for that purpose.

My daughter suggested that if I was serving Irish coffee I could use these to put the liqeur in on the side so guests could use as much as they like in their coffee. That is such a better idea than tooth pick holders at each place setting :) I have also figured out that the company measures the ounces the glass will hold at just under the lip of the glass.

The Dracula accent is just really annoying.For the rest, Ms. Leon seems to have some familiarity with Italian culture, and that's nice, though personally I wish that she had spent more time devising an engaging plot and characters, and less on the proper wine to have with your spaghetti alle vongole.

It was like she kept checking to see if the something was done in the oven and came back and wrote a chapter to a different book. Some chapters seems totally unrelated to the book. Characters get mentioned and when I thumbed back to see who she was talking about, I couldn't find them. How can someone write such a great series of books and then totally bomb?!! It is a limp and tired story involving an environmental problem at a glass factory. Donna needs a vacation...from Venice!PS.

I feel as if I know the family personally by now. This was a bit \\"lower key\\" than most of her offerings, and there wasn't nearly enough about the fabulous meals Brunetti eats, either at home or in good restaurants!Also, I may be dense, but I couldn't really figure out how the murder took place. Good red herrings--I was surprised at the ending, but not as interested in \\"who dunnit\\" as usual, just sorry the book was finished!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another enjoyable Venetian adventure","review":"Once again, Donna Leon brings us to Venice. This time to enjoy the nuances of Murano. I found the book absorbing with Brunetti slowly making sense out of the case as well as sharing his family with us in helping to solve the mystery. I would recommend it to others who enjoy a travelogue along with their crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way under par","review":"I previously read A Noble Radiance by the same author and enjoyed it. I grabbed this book while away on business when I finished the other book I was reading. The only good thing to say is that this novel helped me go sleep quickly.The plot meanders and is not very interesting. Brunetti is basically investigating a threat to someone which gets his foot in the door when something finally happens. Basically, the first half of the book is about something which is only marginally related to the dead body. I struggled to finish the book and will not put it in the pile of books for my wife to read. Instead, it is going in the giveaway pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A social and political polemic not a mystery","review":"Let me start out by saying I have been a huge fan of the Commissario Brunetti mystery series. The earlier works by Ms. Leon have been excellent mysteries and police procedurals with outstanding character development and very good plotting. Her latest works, however, are less about good mystery writing and more about a platform for her political and social views. This latest, and the last few, have been huge disappointments. Hard as it may be for her to believe, I am NOT interested in her opinions on a host of what she considers social and political issues (notwithstanding that I am in agreement with some of them!). If she wants to speak on these subjects, write letters to the editor or opinion pieces in a host of appropriate journals. I very much wish she would get back to her original roots and write more Brunetti books like the first few she penned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it !!

Everything goes together very well. However, the weak point is the fence. The original fence was bowed and cupped so badly that I could not get a good square joint, much less get it to align at 90 over the fence length. When the front of the fence was at 90, the back was not, which made for alignment problems. Tool Crib customer support was first rate at getting this problem resolved. Kudos for Tool Crib! This is a case were customer service kept the sale and resolved manufacturer defects quickly. Would I purchase the jointer again, (knowing Tool Crib customer service)- yes. However, Powermatic should seriously look into quality control for the fence.

However, what happened to one of the reviewers here, happened to me also. when using the jointer I was not able to keep the wood completly against the fence, particularly in the center part of the fence. I did what the other reviewer did and placed a straight edge against the face of the fence and found that it was concave. The center part, was about two 1/16 of an inch away form the stright edge. I contacted amazon.com and they took care of getting me a replacement stright from powermatic.I got my new fence assambly and now the jointer is great.

I have used the unit for several months now. and continue to be impressed with this machine. Fit and finish are excellent, it is a snap to adjust, and the extra long beds are all I was hoping for.

He admits that there is little experimental evidence to justify his conclusions. He may have a master's degree in biochemistry, but many of his conclusions are based on pseudoscience. In other words, my conclusions must be correct because men are basically animals and animals living in the wild act so and so. Blah, blah blah.After you get past the fact that the title is misleading, and much of the book is useless, there is some real scientific explanations of what DHEA is and why we need it.

Books that address any controversy attract attempts to pack the Reader Reviews with negative comments.The quality of reviews here is very uneven. The Kirkus review, for example, refers to Phineas Quimby as Phineas Parkhurst. This is a dead giveaway that the reviewer has not actually read the book.Gardner's accusations against Mrs Eddy are thoroughly researched and documented. Most of them have been made before and remain unchallenged except by evasion and denial. What is new and helpful in this book is the description and commentary on other aspects of the larger New Thought movement.

Misconstrued facts, while presented in a persuasive way, demolish his thesis. Gill's work, (a non-Christian Scientist just like Gardner) is the antithesis of Gardner's. She is fair, evaluative, does not editorialize, and while she tells things that Christian Scientists may or may not appreciate, she is honest to the core. Gardner would have done well to peruse the work of a TRUE writer (Gill) before attempted his own falsified fiction of an American religious figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating subject, but","review":"rather disappointing reading.

Martin Gardner had a chance to research the life of a great Western religious leader who, when she first wrote for the public, did so for all religions, to help people learn the most ancient meanings of the Biblical writings. As the 21st century approaches and scientists (not Christian Scientists necessarily) learn more about physics, the macroworld, the universe, and the like, they are finding her writings to be right on target, unlike others who are finding the exact, material placement of heaven to be perplexing.

First, the story is great, Marv is trying to... redeem himself in a sort of way by avenging the one person who ever showed him kindness (though I'd have to say, his parole officer also is 'on his side'). It's some sort of cross between the real world and the comic book universe. Some elements of both. And the artwork, I tell ya, Miller outdid himself. It's all pen and ink, and what Miller does with just a white page and black ink is magical. This is definitely a comic book must.

When he was placed in the crib half asleep he would open his eyes wide open when he would hear a bird, and would try to look where the sound came from. There is another part that sounds like a whistle (another bird), and is constant through one song. But he got used to it (it may have taken a couple of weeks) and he is quite happy with it now.There are other songs that have night sounds, is not all birds.

This is a really god awful CD that is hugely unfocused and not very listenable. The only saving graces are track 2 'seashell', a gorgeous laidback trip hop ambient ride that sounds like it doesn't belong on this CD at all. And track 13 'exotika' (amazon accidentally omitted track 3 'depart' so there's actually 13 tracks),a ten minute out of body dub experience that makes you feel like you're floating along in outer space. If the rest of the tracks lived up to these two this would be an awesome CD. But they don't and it isn't. Even after repeated listenings it only gets worse. The only reason I'm still hanging on to this is simply for 'seashell'. This is a dull ambient ride that's more irritating than soothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the cover","review":"This cd certainly has an odd atmosphere to it. Perhaps the beginning of track #13 \\"Exotica\\" is a clue as to why, when a voice recites \\"It's hard not to be open minded when you take psychedelics once a week...take psychedelics once a week...take psychedelics once a week...\\". It then fades out into music. The tracks on this cd are rather laid back and odd, as if they were created by very inexperienced musicians messing around on synthesizers. However, it is track #4, \\"Next\\", that has me pull out this cd occasionally. It's nothing spectacular, but has a sort of mellow droopy groove that is somewhat appealing to me. I also heard it on either a television or radio commercial once. Otherwise, this cd is difficult to really like, even after repeated listenings. It's more annoying and boring than appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acapulco Gold","review":"My husband was in this movie. He grades it as a \\"5 star\\" but that his ego.

An old movie with a new cover. There's no atrocities as it states."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive label","review":"This DVD doesnt cover any atrocities. It is just a collection of two old, War Department newsreels. Just a dry history of the prelude to WW2 and the German invasion of the low countries.Nothing graphical here. This isnt an adults only film. Nothing about the concentrations camps, holocaust, or the condition in them. The two newsreels on the DVD are stuff probably shown in high schools during the late 1940s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phony DVD - Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"Only Prelude to War, pirated from Frank Capra's \\"World War II\\" actually did play. Divide and Conquer would not even come up. This is a phony DVD of the worst order. What is on the cover has NOTHING to do with the subjects inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"This has little to do with actual Nazi atrocities. It is merely a WWII propaganda film designed to hearten Allied troops to go to war with the Axis powers. Though it does have some historical value, the information provided is more readibly accessible from other sources. It seems as if this film's target audience is young soldiers, who did not have access to TV/Radio, who are now wondering why they were drafted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived damaged","review":"Needed the item for a special project but it arrived damaged (one of the two leveling bubbles lost it's fluid at some point) and was not useable.

Both the bags had dirt stains on the light blue part and they were very visible. At first I thought it was part of the design, but it wasn't. It was clear that these were either old bags left in a place where they could accumulate dust or they were manufacturing defects. They looked like a good deal since they were cheap but ended up being a big disappointment. I could not return the bags because I only found out the defects after i had left the US and was in India. I could take them back and return them but it's a hell of a painful process to take them back to the US. So, I guess I will just let the seller save some money and get away with poor customer service. :( I only wish the seller had checcked the bags before sending them, this experience has drastically reduced my trust on the quality of products on amazon or atleast by this seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price and good quality","review":"I love this backpack --it is a great backpack for the money and has lots of pockets for everything.

Sadly, for us, it started to lose seams after just a couple days of use. My wife didn't put overly too much stuff in it, but it still didn't hold up.

Things are much more complicated than simply finding a place to live, and deciding how much time you can spend with said loved one.I'm not trying to over simplify, because all decisions dealing with older loved ones are difficult, but I was kind of hoping it would have given me more direction as to when its important to protect yourself as well.

Malcolm is perfection as Dexter, and if only there would be a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CUT ABOVE THE REST","review":"Malcolm McDowall is one of those actors you thought would have had a meteoric rise to fame after his unsettling performance in 1970's CLOCKWORK ORANGE. However, other than a few minor flicks in the seventies, he sort of became one of those actors who pops up in unlikely places, such as ISLAND OF THE DEAD and this dark comedy from Canada.McDowell is this movie's strength, though. With his acerbicly funny narration and his smooth deft performance as Dexter Miles, the barber, he uses the movie to showcase his innate talents.I still have a little trouble in why they decided Vance Corrigan was the killer; that point was never really clarified, so that when the movie comes up with its twisty yet appropriate ending, you're still left with wondering why Vance was suspect.Oh well, this is a combination of TWIN PEAKS and FARGO, and it's highly enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF","review":"This is one of the worst horror movies Ive ever seen, if you can even call it that.

I was pleasantly surprised at the finished product. A solid script with believable characters and thrilling plot that will have you continuously wondering- will they catch him? Malcolm Mcdowell is eerily fantastic. With a simple facial expression, added with his chilling narration, he successfully brings to life, Dexter, a psychopath you love to hate.Can't wait for the sequal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and Unorganized","review":"This is the typical book created by putting together technical papers, proceedings, and working papers without a unifying structure.This is a short list of this book's limitations:1) Fragmented: every chapter is written by a different author.2) Unorganized: Neural Networks are introduced only at chapter 11.3) So badly planned that both chapter 11 and 18 have basically the same content. You can look inside the book yourself to see that.4) Lack of examples: very few implementations of NN are provided or suggested.5) Out of context: many chapters are not related to Neural Networks at all, for example chapter 16 is about Yield curve modelling, and chapter 21 is dedicated to Portfolio Optimization without any contextual reference to NN. Please be aware that after introducing these topics there is NO follow-up whatsoever with NN application examples.6) Misleading: The content about Neural Networks is really minimal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album.","review":"As a fan of Nickel Creek, I have always (shamefully) thought of Sean as \\"second fiddle\\" to the rest of the group. I am pleased to announce my conversion after hearing this album (and seeing them in concert). Surprisingly I found that most of this album, while not the same genre as most of nickel creek's work, is just as beautiful and complex as the trio's material. My girlfriend forced me to listen to this album with her at the first chance we had. She remarked that she absolutely loved it and had never heard anything quite like it. I disagreed and told her that Toad the Wet Sprocket sounded similar. We were both surprised to find that Glenn Phillips (of Toad) had worked on this album. I'll tell you what, buy the cd to hear great vocals, great guitar playing, and great composition. Oh yeah, and look for Mutual Admiration Society from Nickel Creek and Glen Phillips in July '04. I'm expecting to hear something similar to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sean is the Master","review":"Sean Watkins is simply the Master of the Melody. His songs are passionate and deep, and sound simply wonderful.I have two favorites. Locking doors is fabulous with soaring vocals while Chutes and Ladders is an instrumental dream. Of course this is a different style of album, but he continues to grow and change and astound us all with his abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, amazing, amazing...","review":"An absolutely fabulous piece of work. Truly a musical journey, as every song plays as a trip into the muscians heart. My personal favorite is Track 6, 'Through the Spring', I can't say more than it's just a beautiful song that you HAVE to hear to fully appreciate.I got the CD a few months back and it has not left my stereo yet. Yes, it's that good! It cannot be put into a categroty of 'bluegrasss' or 'jazz' or any other musical genre for that matter, it's a little bit of everything and ALL just plain great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Dissapointing!!!","review":"As a fan of Sean's picking and musicianship this CD was one of the biggest dissapointments ever. I was expecting to hear at least a few tight, technical flat pick runs ... instead I got a bunch of tunes that sound like washed up drivel from the latest pop Christian rock CD. Even when Sean did decide to do some good picking most of the time he overdubbed a tenor sax on the run so you couldn't even hear him ... an extremely cheesey sound is what you get. I kept skipping each track hoping to hear something decent, but every song made me want to hurl ... litteraly. You might like this CD if you are into Matchbox 20 and The GooGoo Dolls, but if you're looking for good new acoustic music along the lines of Mike Marshall and Bryan Sutton don't buy this borring, depressing CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone want to buy my copy?","review":"Let me first say I am a Nickel Creek fan and also a fan of jazz and bluegrass. I like Sean's work on the Nickel Creek recordings and feel he is a very talented individual. I don't know what happened when he made this album. The drummer on this CD sounds like a junior high kid that just got his first drum set. Most of the cuts that included instruments without strings were disconnected. Sort of like a high school garage band. Sorry to say, this will be one of the first CDs in a long time that I will be glad to sell.

They have left the world of RCMP stereotypes and shifted to old Nazi stereotypes, taking swipes at the US space program at the same time. The tone is very forced and nothing seems to work right. The good news is that it's a quick read even if most of it is concocted German history.The RCMP spends a good bit of its time spinning its wheels waiting for the killer(s) to make a bad mistake. The profile for the murderers is so patchwork that I occasions felt surprise that they could get anything done.

The book is a muddled mess, and you will need a flow chart to sort out the ending. The authors attempt to resolve the various charaters and explanations for events at the end, but it isn't convincing. The stuff on Nazi quantum-based weaponry is preposterous. Finally, the anti-American stereotypes of U.S. government intelligence-types is laughable. I guess this is \\"Canadian content\\"; i.e., trying to make Canadians look good relative to inept/evil Americans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neo-Canadianism??","review":"While the book is written in a jerky and almost incoherent style, the most surprising thing is it's intentional distortion of war history to make the US look bad.

Throw your textbooks out the window budding young psychologists! The Clarke's have reinvented abnormal psychology!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When Writing Fails","review":"This book is a classic example of what happens when a writer runs out of ideas. You read a few Nazi history books and fill up all the empty spaces with Nazi spook stories, throw in a lot of splish splash slayings, and (yet another standard Slade maneuver) make sure the reader doesn't know exactly how many serial killers there are.I don't know who all the first time reviewers are that gave it 5 stars, but this one's a sham - unless you're idea of an exciting book is a concentration camp inventory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away...stay very far away","review":"This movie does not rock; this isn't even what one might call a movie.

Girls and guys get killed by clowns, supposedly in horrific manners, but because there is nothing horrific about any of it as (obviously for budgetary reasons) there is no horrific things on display.No, I take it back.It is twisted that this thing was made.

How bad is it? They flash the word HORROR on the screen when you are supposed to be scared! I can't figure out why--perhaps because they realized it wasn't scary too, maybe it is intended to distract from the fact that the actors don't look scared, or can't act, or that they shot it with a consumer grade DV camera.

This saw ate through the 2-1/4 inch plaster/masonary walls like butter. I took out two medium sized walls in about 8 hours time, including cleanup.The saw has no balancer in it, so it does get a bit uncomfortable to use after a certain time frame. However, to get the balancer feature, you really have to step up the price.Changing blades is relatively easy with the keyless quick change. Just watch out for the hot blades!Bottom line, I would have no problem recommending this tool to anyone in need of a Sawzall. I plan to use it in several more wall demolition projects.

Decided to get a rotary laser but couldn't rationalize the additional cost for a self leveling model. For a pro, self leveling is the way to go but for occasional use this is fine. It just takes a little time to set the unit up every time you move it. Being able to recharge the battery is a great feature over the old units that used regular batteries. This is especially nice if you own other Dewalt cordless tools as the batteries are interchangable. Tool King is always quick to ship and packages the tools so they arrive in good condition.

When I buy another laser it will be self leveling and it will not be a Dewalt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to DeWALT standards","review":"From the moment you receive the box you start to have doubts about this tool. The first thing you notice is that things are banging around loose in the carrying case and it goes down hill from there. When I opened the case the accessories were out of place and do not stay in place when back in the labeled areas. The thing is huge and heavy. I set it up and it took ten minutes to level with the sloppy adjusting knobs, complete with dead spots as someone else mentioned. The bubbles are very hard to center and the line is almost a quarter of an inch wide. It's not a self leveler and I expected this would be compensated for in DeWALT quality. I was wrong and this thing reminds me more of an old Tonka Toy than a precision instrument. The little Johnson self leveler is a far better tool. I'm keeping it because I will only use it occasionally but If I were a contractor it would be on its way back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imprecise & Drifts Off Level","review":"The levelling knobs have slop or dead zones when adjusting the bubbles. The beam was at least 1/4-inch wide causing a 'hysteresis' affect when approaching opposite sides of the beam, giving two different level-lines (which must be averaged).

I use it mostly for masonry work with foundations. Wouldn't recommend for anything more than a normal size residential job. I personally don't trust the manual leveling nearly as much as self-leveling... but for the price this laser works more than good enough for additions and small concrete pours. Certainly works well enough for shooting fairly long distance grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did What it was supposed to do","review":"This product preformed as advertized.

I have a trailor full of Dewalt tools, so when I saw this laser I had to have one. This is the first Dewalt product I have been dissapointed in. As a home builder I demand accracy. When I tested this laser I found it to be off by 1/2 an inch in 20 feet. I tested it against another laser and by my transit. The vial levels difficult to \\"zero in\\".

Being slightly nervous about a new piece of equiptment and it's accuracy we shot every distance with both the laser and the standard method. It came through with flying colors, and was accurate to less than 1/8\\" at 40'. I took the sensor and started walking away from the work site and it was still picking up reading at 300', I should have kept walking but I ran out of room. I really like it and would recomend it.

While many people may complain that it is a mockery of Chrstianity, Buddism, and Shintoism, that's kinda the point.You get to see 3 students who have a parent who is a head of their religion actually working together, and making it funny.I had only seen the first four episodes on VHS before I bought the DVD. Then I watched all twelve episodes in one night, I just couldn't help it, they were so funny. ^_^If you don't understand that even supposedly pointless anime has a point to it you may not truly enjoy this series, beacause while it does seem to be pointless I assure you that almost every episode has its own morale.

I found the first three tapes and bought them, not knowing a lot about anime or the series itself. I'm glad I did! This series, while not very long, is really funny and entertaining. As some other reviewers have said, it doesn't have a real *ending* but if you're into Japanese humor, or any kind of humor at all, then this is a good set. (The set is most likely not suitable for young children because it contains a good bit of adult humor)."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for the serious at heart","review":"this anime takes a funny look at hauntings centered around a local school. the plot is serious at times but mostly just plain funny. the animation is fair quality and it only comes in subtitles (no english dubbed version) This anime isn't wishy washy, you'll either like it or run screaming away from the TV. it attacks a plot in a FLCL kind of way or maybe dragon-half. Not end-of-the-world with a set agenda like X or even the more serious side of Saiyuki.I would reccomend it if you liked dragon-half, FLCL, Animation Runner Kuromi or Kyo Kara Maoh. It is funny in that wrong kinda way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I've been to Arrowhead a few times & seen the names on the ring of honor.

However, the dictionary in the game is bad -- in particular, it does *not* use the latest Official Dictionary (4th edition). To take one example, the word QI and the plural QIS are not available in this game, and those are important Q-without-U words for serious Scrabble.I wouldn't mind that fault if the software allowed you to add words to the dictionary or to override computer challenges. Alas, neither option is available so it's critical that the dictionary be right. But the dictionary is wrong. So the game is wrong.

The game is not at all pleasant to play, compared to the new versions, and you have to keep the CD in the drive all the time to play it, even after you install the game. I think it is sucking up a massive amount of juice to play it, too. (The reason I got rid of Scrabout).This does NOT come with a jewel case - just a paper sleeve, and there's no paperwork or support for the game, either. The only info provided is on the disk, and that support number is disconnected. Seller claims to have no knowledge of computer games (Despite being primarily a seller of computer games), and just refers you to the disconnected support number.It was cheap, so I'm just eating this one, but I won't be buying anything from this bunch again.

Mine does too. But just for a few seconds while the game initializes. So that wasn't a porblem for me. My problem is that the computer challenges words that I know for a fact are in the dictionary and when it challenges you you have no chance to refute the challenge. It automatically removes your word and you lose your turn. But players are NEVER allowed to challenge the computer. Which I find really stupid. The computer also plays words that are not allowed by the scrabble rules. In other words it cheats. I think that the people who disigned it purposely made it that way.

Honestly before reading this book, I never really had an interest in visiting Venice. This sparked an interest and last year I was fortunate to have an opportunity to briefly visit Venice. The reading of this book greatly enhanced my enjoyment of and appreciation for Venice. Rosalind did her homework extremely well. The historical events she refers to are very accurate as well as the history of the places mentioned. The story take place during a significant time of change in the history in Venice.

In this book she does that, but she lets up no slack on writing vivid details of the life in Venice that brings two friends together, and sometimes apart. The unique setting of the Pieta, where the girls are raised by nuns and taught the arts of music and song, was brought to life by her descriptions. The characters are wonderful and shown with true light revealing greatness in them and flaws as well.

Well the concept of this jig is simple enough, and it would be great if the drill bit was made from stronger material. After drilling about 12 pocket holes through MDF, the 1/8\\" tip broke off the bit. Without the bit this whole thing is useless. I tried to find out if there was any kind of warranty, but from what I could tell, this company doesn't even mention the word \\"Warranty\\". So since I plan on doing many more of these types of projects, I decided to step up to the plate and get the Kreg pro kit. It works great. Get an extra bit just in case though, cause without one your project comes to a screeching hault. So far my Kreg bit has drilled many more pocket holes without any problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming qualities","review":"I bought this tool with the hopes of saving money on what seems to be a straight forward tool. But the clamp is too weak to hold wood in place and the jig twists out of position during use, even on softwood. During the first use on a piece of hardwood maple cabinet facing, the drill bit broke. Not a single pocket hole was successfully made using this tool. Worthless and frustrating. Now I have to ask my wife for an increase in my allowance to get a useful jig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rob","review":"This jig wears very quickly. I drilled 128 pocket holes with this jig. As I assembled my project I noticed that the pocket hole screw heads were beginning to protrude and then the wood pieces I was screwing together were beginning to crack. Why? Because the inside of the jig wears so quickly that the pocket holes become shallower and shallower until they are no good at all. It cost me over $200 in materials and a lot of rework.

I \\"pumped\\" the drill bit in & out to clear the debris like the instructions suggested, but half way into the second hole, \\"Snap!\\", and she was done.

So far, this one has worked okay but I am suspect of the longevity....doesnt seem like it is going to last that long, we'll see.

He starts talking about one thing but then he mentions some property about that and he gives a brief explanation then he says that he will cover it later and then he gives you the same explanation but with a better example.Also, he claims to have a lot of examples but you will find that the examples are just the same, he prefers to write a 50 lines example again and again on the book than just writting the new thing he want to comment.So I really think that the author though that a 1100 pages book would be more attractive to the customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS A BOOK","review":"THIS BOOK HAS PAPER PAGES WITH WORDS ON THEM!!!!

The space should have been put to use covering XML Schemas (or many other topics) in much greater detail.My second complaint is that Mr. Holzner was apparently paid by the word for this one so he repeats examples over and over, just highlighting different lines.

In more of an endeavor for a mass market \\"take-out\\" attempt, the book lacks consistency in reference, narrative and most importantly plot development with no regard for literary techique and voice. It's unfortunate because the Korean-American voice in literature has been so weak.

There's lot more. Of course, complete idiots won't benefit from it, but the book begins from the ground for people not familar with online marketing.It first outlines the importance of visibility, then touches on how Google actually works. No secrets here. Newbies learn a lot, but not the old hands. Then, it goes into great detail on how the website should be set up, presented and maintained. Again, very useful newbie tips on blogs and content generation are given but I doubt the experienced user will learn a lot of new things here.There is also some mention about making money from Adsense and affiliate programs, but personally, I haven't had very good experiences with these programs.The book ends with the future of findability.

This book tells you about the social life on campus, about the localities where the schools are located, about the student body, about the professors... all essential information.

Kate Hepburn and Peter O'Toole (who looks great in a beard) are wonderful together. A young Anthony Hopkins plays the depressive Richard (it's hard to imagine how this Richard became known as the Lion Hearted...), and Nigel Terry as the disgusting John.They whine, they lie, they plot, they zing each other with sarcastic one-liners, they gather private armies and threaten borders. These dysfunctional Royals from the 12th Century make Charles and Diana look like Ward and June."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lion in Winter","review":"Shot on location in France and the British Isles, and based on an excoriating play by Richard Goldman, \\"Lion\\" is a wit-fueled, magnificently acted parable of power-lust and extreme family dysfunction. O'Toole and Oscar winner Hepburn are superb as the grizzled, sarcastic regent and his cunning wife, locked in a never-ending exchange of venomous criticisms. A youthful Anthony Hopkins, in a spirited turn, pops off some of the best insults. Aside from the endless machinations of various family members, Harvey adds period flavor with authentic costumes and gloomy, tone-perfect settings. When this \\"Lion\\" roars, you'll be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most rewarding","review":"Absolutely excellent. The real purpose for the purchase was to have this great film on DVD.

Playwright James Goldman insists on having his characters, especially Henry II and his estranged wife Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, howl at each other like banshees, generally. Problem is, we're so removed from the historical context of the story that we wonder what all the screeching and sobbing is about. The cumulative effect is one of ghastly overacting rather than catharsis. As has been noted elsewhere in these reviews, Katherine Hepburn in particular is a big offender: it seems we're expected to feel sorry for Ms. Hepburn because she's growing old. This is the sort of cheap tactic that secures Oscars. A final thought: the director, Anthony Harvey, might have overcome his fondness for zooming the camera shots in from great distances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"I don't understand how this awful mess got so many rave reviews.

One point, however, that seldom is made is the great acting by Nigel Terry as Prince John. For those of you who don't mind a little legend mixed with your history, this is the prince who becomes King John of Robin Hood fame. Watching this movie, you can really envision Richard (the Lion-Hearted), as portrayed by Anthony Hopkins, riding off to the Crusades, leaving Terry's slimy John to rule. No wonder heroes like Robin Hood sprang up (if indeed he did).Incidentally, Nigel Terry's next big role was as King Arthur in Excalibur.

Essentially, this movie is not about three men vying for the throne; it is about a marriage and its slow failure--it is a character study. And an extremely intriguing one made most effective by the excellent acting and scathing dialogue. It could be that the movie is a bit long, but it's extremely enjoyable nevertheless.

There was no historical or artistic reason to include any of that.So, why? Could it be that Goldman was himself homosexual?

After a brief opening the remainder of the film takes place at one location the Kings winter castle. How many movies do you know of that take place in one set and can keep your interest throughout?

Based upon the stage play by James Goldman, the dialogue translates to the screen with lively and vicious clarity. This is all the more evidenced by O'Toole and Hepburn, whose offscreen love/hate relationship clearly fueled their performances.

Nothing but a bunch of barely memorable, noisy, repetitive 'tunes' that aren't worth a second listening. Prodigy's Fat of the Land is a lot better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never heard anything else like it before or since...","review":"This CD got me into the whole techno/electronica thing. While some of the reviews say EPD is better, I have to disagree - I think DYOH is just as good, if not better. W/ the exception of \\"Setting Sun\\" (just plain noisy) & \\"The Private Psychedelic Reel\\" (too damn long!), I love everything about this CD. It's a great mix of hard rock & dance all in one - I still can't believe these guys actually came up w/ such a great mixture of the two! Rock on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great...","review":"ok, so i bought the album cause it was nominated for a grammy or something, and i thought chemical brothers' \\"surrender\\" was pretty good-- but then i realized this was a mistake.

Still, they can't make an album great alone. There's some other great stuff here, like Setting Sun and Lost in the K-Hole, but there's also a lot of not so great stuff, and a bit of vileness (It Doesn't Matter could've been left off, and it wouldn't have mattered.).The deciding factor here is how much you like the songs in between the hits, not the hits themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get up on it like this","review":"This is great! Before I ever heard of Aphex Twin I had the Chemical Brothers. Every song is great till about song 6 or 7 which are a little rough but ok. Over all this album has enough good songs to be 5 stars.

I'd seen \\"setting sun\\" on MTV and picked up the album. For some reason I didn't listen to it for about two years.

It has plenty of \\"block rockin' beats\\", screetching sirens, complex percussion, well placed vocals, melodious acid sound, and cool scratching; this album's got it all. If you had to buy just one chemical brothers cd, then i would strongly recommend \\"dig your own hole\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to Dig Your Own Hole...","review":"The Chemical Brothers' (formerly known as the Dust Brothers) second offering, Dig Your Own Hole, has established them as major players in the electronica/dance/techno scene.

If you liked Emit Ecaps, you will like this too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thank You Book for Kids","review":"A great big THANK YOU to Ali Spizman for taking the time to remind all of us the importance of saying \\"Thank you\\". Being an elementary school librarian, I originally bought this book as a reference for my students. I soon found, however, that it was a great inspiration to me personally. Ali includes a tremendous variety of clever ways to make the often dull task of writing thank-you notes into an exciting exercise in creativity. This book should be required reading for all ages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbiased Love for the Virgin of Guadalupe","review":"This book was totally biased! For one, the authors are all theologians or participants in the Catholic faith and second, they favor Eurocentric thought. The Virgin cannot be spoken about from a Eurocentric perspective alone for she is a symbol of mixed identity, that of Indigenous and Spanish/European ancestry.My advice to anyone interested in learning about the Virgin from a holistic perspective would be for him/her to read other books in addition to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"People please open your eyes!","review":"The Lady of Guadalupe was a Spanish invention used to calm down the indigenous revolts against the Conquistadores. There are even published letters from the time of the Conquista where the intentions of \\"Creating a local Myth\\" are clearly mentioned.The Conquistadores had noticed that indians were burying their idols beneath temples when they were being used as slaves to build them. The indians would then pretend to be praying to Western gods when in reality they were praying to their own.Sadly a few generations down the burying of aztec idols was forgotten and the Spaniards succeeded in \\"trading religions\\" to the locals.Religion has always been used as a tool to control populations. The comfort you feel in thinking about god comes from within you, not from above. It's sad that my country (Mexico) is known as being proud of having been fooled by the Spaniards."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the scent?","review":"My medicine cabinet is full of Aura Cacia products, and I am especially fond of the Rose oils, so this bath product was irresistible to me.

Was this a last-minute Christmas gift? Without question! Do I understand the volume of packages around Christmas time? Probably only minimally, meaning I can appreciate that there is incredibly high volume of packages floating around at Christmas time, but the option I selected and the service I paid for said I would receive my package before Christmas. Instead, I received it on January 17th.

Kandel does a wonderful job especially with 1,2,5,8,9. His use of various new age, electronics & dance beats makes this album so great.

It is a book that worth reading, many times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gundam Wing = Good Stuff","review":"The entire GW series is great, but I wanted to specifically mention the first video. It does a good job of setting up the series, introducing all the main characters and the basic plot. I definitely recommend this to any fan of anime, sci-fi, or just plain cool videos. For anyone wishing to get into GW, this is the best starting point, but be sure to pick up the other videos as well; there'll be 16 in all, or 10 DVDs. I prefer the uncut versions myself, but parents buying for kids should be advised that blood and swearing are present; if you don't want your kids hearing the word \\"damn\\" 100 times or seeing a pilot choke up blood, then go for the edited stuff. Just note that any time Heero refers to \\"destroying\\" Relena, he means \\"kill.\\" Not that he'd ever really go through with it, of course. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Great, But The Japanese Version.....","review":"I've got to admit, this is one of the great animes if I ever seen one. Gundam Wing is so fresh and new(I mean no one got sick of the reruns)it delivers a punch to you. But I noticed something with the Japanese Version. If you look very closely you can see the genius at Bandai or Sunrise didn't put the subtitles when the charecters were speaking. You hear words first that the charecter speaks, then you see the subtitles. That annoyed me. But hey, no one's perfect. It was nice to hear the original voice for Heero, but before I got the DVD, people said in the Japanese version Quatre's voice sounded a bit like a child's. When the voice came on I was shocked. In the dub they have it so manly. And you finally get the lyrics to \\"Total Communication\\". Note: After The Shooting Star She Saw, the ending theme song looked like Relena was abusing animals. She pulled on a rhino's tail!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I just love this anime! Not only for all the violence and fighting for peace, but also, if you are open-minded enough and read between the lines, the relationships between the gundam pilots. I think it's quite possible for there to be a relationshipe between Heero and Duo, and there must be something between Trowa and Quatre. As for Wufei, as much as he may go on about onnas, I think he might just like Sally Po... But I still see him best with Zechs and Treize. All those couples are so kawaii. On the other hand, I reaaally hate ... Relena, she gets on my nerves. When will she notice that Heero cares for her at most as a friend?"},{"rating":"2","title":"untitled","review":"I think this is probably one of the best animes I've ever watched.My favourite thing about it, is that it's not one of those shows you can just sit there and understand. You have to concentrate.This shows that there has been more thought put into it than one of the run-of-the-mill cartoons you see every day.The pictures are realistic and well drawn, so you can actually beleive it could happen.The characters are all focused on, maybe Heero and Relena the most, but you find out about all the others and their personlities.I would recomend this to anyone who likes a good anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT LOVE IT","review":"I Recomend this without a doubt. The Sole reason I bought a DVD player and I know that My money was'nt waisted I tried and tried to get a hold of the Subtitled and later found out that it was only on DVD and I had to buy it so I could hear my Hee-chan ( Hikaru Midorikawa -san or chan ^_^) talk because there is nothing better then hearing Heero saying I will kill you in Japanese or hearing Duo scream Watashi wa Shinigami ! worth all the money you put in it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gundum is Back! At Long Last!","review":"Gundum Wing is the return of the incredible popular series Gundum. Gundum Wing takes place in the far future where humans have begun making colonies in space. Yet the tryanical earth sphere alliance as been ruthlessly seizing control of one colony after another. The colonies thus send five proto type mobile suits, the key to military power, called Gundums. The gundums are pioleted by five ruthless young men whom will do anything to stop the Earth Sphere Alliance and the sinister corporation known as OZ. This series is a return to classic anime with I must say better character development. The animation is not as advanced as \\"Neon Genisis Evangelion\\" or even \\"Blue Submarine No. 6\\" nor is this video as good as either one of those animes. Yet for a younger audiance this series is perfect. Parents may want to watch this with there children to explain certain thing to them. Warning this video cointains some Violence. Suggested viewing age is seven and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly Loved It!","review":"I recently started Gundam Wing from the cartoon network, and immediatly fell in love with it. This is a very good show, and I recommend it to anyone who loves anime. I consider this a very good introduction to new comers of the anime world aswell. Also to anyone who just plain likes action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Gundam Series","review":"After all these years, they finally brought Gundam over to the states! I fondly remember watching the original Mobil Suit Gundam series back in 1979 - 80 in Japan but ,after my father got transferred over to the states, I've been stuck watching the occasional video sent from Japan and the 'net....until now :)The story is typical Gundam fare, pretty deep, but a bit confusing 'till a bit later on in the series. Characters are good with good development as the series moves on and the quality of the animation is amazing to say the least. I just hope they continue to bring more of the series over to the US. Maybe not air it but at least release them on DVD (I watch it in Japanese so it's nice on DVD).Oh, and finally...in the Japanese version, they pronounce Quatre as Ka-To-Ru....so I wouldn't worry too much on the \\"correct\\" pronounciation. For all we know, they picked that name because the spelling looked cool..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great anime","review":"This is a must own for any anime fan. A few things went censored in the dubbed version (even the midnight run!), so you might want to pick this DVD up for a better dubbed version as well as a Japanese subtitled version (I hear the Japanese track is top-notch!)Note: I also agree with the reviewer that said Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst moblie suit gundam series","review":"I saw this series about 2 years ago all 49 ep's and all 3 oav's and this series isnot oringal its storie is taken from past gundam series.This is one of Yoshiyuki Tomino's worst gundam series if you wan t a good gundma series buy stardust memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gundam Wing Plus","review":"Definitely a good way to use up that extra space on the DVD. The show's on the disc I've already seen at least 3 times, and I would still consider it one of the best show's on air right now. The DVD comes with five episodes instead of the four on the VHS, plus extra information on Heero, his mecha, and Relena. You can watch the english dubs, the original japanese, and you can chose if you want the sub-titles on or off at any time. It also comes with trailers for two other Gundam series, Cowboy Beebop, and Blue Submarine No.62."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"Awsome everything I know that's pretty basic :) but it was here on time shipped nice and tight came as described!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific DVD for an Awesome Show!","review":"This DVD gets you under way in the gundam wing series. Like a lot of anime I have run across, you spend the first two episodes trying to figure out what is what. Once you get an idea of who is bad and who is good, the story really grabs you. It has a good mixture of action (mechas fighting mechas) and drama between the characters (surprisingly, even the 'bad guys' are well developed and offer more than an evil chuckle here and there). Overall I am sure you will be pleased with this purchase if you are an anime fan or are familiar with other gundam series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I was pretty disappointed with Mobile Suit Gundam Wing - Operation 1. The animation was good, but nothing spectacular. The story a major disappointment.

His live act is the best i've ever seen. Polished, rapid-fire, visceral, and relentlessly energetic.

The Bumsteads (Penny Singleton, Arthur Lake) finally get to take a two-week vacation. The vacation isn't exactly trouble-free though. There is much concern for Baby Dumpling (Larry Simms). This film makes a dramatic turn when Baby Dumpling gets caught inside a hotel on fire. The next film in the series is BLONDIE BRINGS UP BABY."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys need some work","review":"I was pretty dissapointed when I heard the Mourning September album. I guess my problem was that my expectations were so high, coming from an album put out on Floodgate, and produced by James Paul Wisner.Wisner did a flawless job, the problem was that he worked on a flawed album. Ultimately by the fourth track, you've heard every song on the album. There aren't really any hooks in the album, and because of that, every song ends up sounding exactly the same.Maybe their sophmore effort will prove me wrong, but for now this is a band you probably shouldn't invest your time and money into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouuch.. I would wait for the next edition","review":"Not well thought through. A bunch of typos and errors in the examples. I would definitely wait for the next edition.

I would have given this book \\"0\\" stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make the same mistake I did!","review":"I was disappointed in this book from the start. I agree with a previous reader's comment of \\"not well written\\" (grammer is awful). It also lacks focus, and juxtoposition of chapters are not well planned. If you are looking for a book to cover XML/Servlets try professional server programming, a fine Wrox book! However, if you are looking for a good overview of XML and how it can be tied into a java application, wait, I believe more are coming. This book will hook you into another programmers framework which, in my estimation, isn't always the best course of action (ie. when your application does not address the same issues as the authors)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not practical","review":"I love the idea of this book. Show the evolution of a framework and show an increasingly complex system evolve. Give the user the code and let them work along.But the execution of the concept is terrible. I have had to tinker with even the examples from chapters 2 and 3 to get them to run at all. I'll admit that the authors picked a daunting task. Just getting the Servlet engine, JSP engine, the personal web server and the ODBC database connections would stop most readers cold. After stuggling with that, I had little patience to debug their code. The Wrox site tells you to see \\"the errata\\", but I can't find this.And one thing I'm still struggling to learn or even find out if it exists - decent debugging tools and techniques for Servlets. I feel like I'm back in the 70's, what with my command line and worrying about environment space and variables. God but I wish I could step through this code rather than sprinkle it with the author's own \\"Logger\\" statements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Professional Java XML Programming with servlets and JSP","review":"If your'e looking to gain insight into integrating XML into Java programing, this is not the book. The authors spend far too much time showing simple code examples and reviewing regular expression syntax. The JSP and servlet info is rudimentary at best and could only be expected to be used as a starting point for this type of programming. As far as XML is concerned, this book teaches only the bare bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title, very little JSP, lots of filler material","review":"I was very dissapointed in this book. It is all over the map and very shallow. This book has over 200 pages of appendicies which reprint, among other things, the XML spec!It looks like the authors just wanted a big fat book with lots of buzzwords on the cover. Do they really expect to adequately cover Servlets, JDBC 2.0, JSP 1.0, XMl 1.0, Namespaces, XSLT 1.0, XHTML 1.0 in the 500 pages that are left? I hope not, because they didn't. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book","review":"I think the author does not need to go into parsing and EBNF to explain a simple idea as XML. There are too many chapters wasted on irrelevant material and a lengthy appendix. The book lacks a good chapter on XML and DTDs. I found the one XML chapter in the Java Server Programming book more useful than this entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Confusing and Misleading","review":"This book disappointed me so much, i thought that i will get the best of it when it comes to Java, XML, and JSP with database. On the other hand, the authours spent so much pages talking about things that are not worthy and only theories. No depth on any of the covered subjects. I agree with the reviewers who said that it makes the reader work hard. i had to pass through many chapters just to get a simple implementation idea. Too wordy for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Confusing Book","review":"I am a professional programmer with a background in C++ Windows programming who started learning JAVA a year ago. I bought this book with the intention of learning how to leverage XML in JAVA apps and servlets. I made it through the first chapter just fine and then all heck broke loose. I could not get the examples to work, the text became as clear as mud and I had to put the book down in disgust because every other chapter in the book lynchpins on knowledge from the previous one. This would not be a good buy in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a bad book, really.","review":"I think this isn't a very good obok. First, it's not written in a very clear way, I simply didn't understand everything in the book. However, the biggest reason not to buy this book, YOU HAVE TO READ ALL/MOST OF THE CHAPTERS TO UNDERSTAND PARTS. Why is that bad? Many people, including me, like to read only relevant chapters. For example, if you already know some of the stuff, you skip directly to the right chapter and read from there. You can't really do it here, since the authors create lots of classes they constantly use in later chapters. Thus, it makes the book terribly inconvenient. Maybe this is only my impression, I didn't read all of the book, but after a few chapters that I found myself reading stuff I *DIDN'T WANT TO READ*, I just abandoned this book and moved to another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Examples Difficult to set up","review":"The book contains a lot of useful information but since everything is very interconnected you can't really read just the parts that are of interest to you. Getting the environment set up to run their examples is also horribly difficult.

If these radical feminist women \\"rabbis\\" are so pretentious and arrogant as to claim that the Holy Torah was the work of some male chauvinist pigs - God forbid - then, I must ask, why bother re-writing it and re-interpreting it at all? Just call it what it is, and let it go! What a pitiful waste of time it was to spend all that time explaining a text that was written by some lowlife male Rabbis who obviously hated women with a passion!The truth is, of course, that those Rabbis were smartly spending all their time explaining a truly Divine document - and all those fanciful \\"interpretations\\" penned by the 50 or so women \\"rabbis\\" were indeed a truly pitiful enterprise and a waste of time and ink.H.K."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars, but...","review":"This book is practical and well written. If you want to write the type of app they cover, you'll find all the nitty-gritty details here. I deducted a star because the book goes into too much detail; it gets boring. They should have assumed a sharper reader and picked up the pace.BUT... Do you really want to build the type of app they spend the most time on? This would be an app that makes heavy use of XML and DOM within IE (no discussion of XML and DOM in other browsers) to simulate a true client/server architecture.

This book expects a reasonable understanding of ASP.NET and cuts straight to the chase in designing and building data driven sites. The annoying thing about ASP.NET books, and the help that comes with it is the lack of information about editing / updating data sources and the intricacies involved.

There is a warm up and cool down and in between a short routine. Very short. I thought I missed something and kept rewinding and forwarding the DVD.

Its not really hard at all. I brought it with me for vacation to have SOME sort of exercise. Other people did it with me and they were a bit winded. For me it was a piece of cake, and I could barely call it exercise, but it was fun and I like it for a change of pace. Or its good if you have a cold or something, where you can't do a super blast workout, this one is good on those types of days. The dance aspect makes it fun. The instructor is very pleasant and you really like her style.You burn some calories, but it's not strenuous. Seems to be great for easy days or beginners or if you want an extra workout added to your other workouts (like, if you want to do 2 videos instead of just 1). Also if you are very overweight, its a fun tape to start getting into exercise.I'm amazed at how long the guys in the background can play their instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun workout","review":"Vanessa Isaac is a good instructor and the others in the video are cute and fun to watch.

Instead of wasting your money on this video run up and down the stairs in your home once. What you see in the trailor is the fastest part of the video. I'm 57, took one zumba class and loved it so much I thought I would try another dance workout video. Well this one was certainly a waste of my money. I should have taken the ten dollars and gone for ice cream. I will say this, she certainly goes over and over and over every step-- no need to rewind, she practices enough that you get it. When it was finished I thought gee that must have been the basic instructional part, now the workout will begin, but no that was it the end of the video. Your best bet is to rent it if possible since you won't need to play it twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good dvd but smells horrid","review":"This may seem silly to some people, but this dvd smells terrible.

I am disappointed and will find very little use for this program. I had a little trouble downloading the program and uninstalling was a nightmare. Had to do manually.

There's no real reason to be frightened; it's just good, fun, dark, 60's style rock music.

Europe was one of the great 80's hair bands, but you need some big hits over the years and off of more than one album. Motley Crue, KISS, Whitesnake, Def Leppard had many albums with chart topping hits. Every hit by Europe came off of Fianl Countdown. There was Final Countdown, Cherokee, Rock The Night, and Carrie.

I would reccoment this to anyone who liked similar-minded bands, as this seems to be the best Europe Compilation there is [excluding the new 1982-2000, which seems to include another version or Final Countdown].

The pants seem sized larger than expected (in both measurements), although it's possible they would shrink to the given size in the wash.Sadly, I forgot to include the basics, like quality of build, in my criteria. The first time I wore these sweatpants, the drawstring disconnected from the back of the waistline. After that, I was able to completely remove the drawstring from the waistband.

The view of the board zooms around in 3D, the little dog wags its tail, and the characters make droll comments. But after those few minutes it will dawn on you--all this cute stuff is getting in the way of playing the game. It takes the patience of a saint to make it all the way through an entire game, and you're unlikely to want to play another. Even if you disable as much of the cutsie stuff as you're allowed to, the view of the board still zooms around in a way that will make your stomach turn (and prevents you from getting any real sense of the location of the pieces).

Time well spent IMHO. I learned a lot about NL teams, which I don't follow as closely as teams in the American League. It's chock-full of historical nuggets, insightful analysis and (sometimes) outright speculation. You certainly won't agree with all of Neyer's choices as to which players belong on a team's \\"All-Time\\" or \\"No. 2\\" squads...and which players do not. As a Mariners fan, I've got to believe that Glenn Abbott, a long-time, original Opening Day Mariner deserves the spot on the \\"No. 2\\" team that Mr. Neyer has given to Brian Holman: talented, but fragile and productive for two seasons.As noted by a previous reviewer, \\"Big Book of Baseball Lineups\\" is a fantastic \\"bathroom\\" book. Expect, however, to absorb only two or three pages per \\"sitting\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little dated, but a lot of good names nonetheless","review":"As a huge fan of baseball, I enjoy reliving the past seasons, teams and players that I may have seen, read or heard at some point in time. Rob Neyer cleverly combines the best and worst of every Major League Baseball team in his \\"Big Book of Baseball Lineups\\".The copyright date is 2003, so of course you're not going to get the last few years. Nevertheless, for those of us who want baseball's past anyway, this is a great book to read. You'll find a few off-the-wall stories and also Neyer's opinions about who the best players were during many eras.As a bonus, the appendix provides year-by-year lineups of every team. True, it doesn't reflect every single player at every single position, but at least you'll get to see the starters of the individual seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"The poor man's Bill James","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Neyer, Bill James' protege, isn't as good a writer as James, but he's still better than most baseball writers. The Big Book is highly enjoyable. Neyer's selections, for the most part, are pretty reasonable. I certainly don't agree with all his choices, but this is an excellent book most baseball fans will find informative and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"Excellent resource. Well researched. Things you didn't already know, but wanted to know about your favorite team(s) and players.A must have for baseball fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but....","review":"Reading this book one see's the tremendous shadow cast by Bill James. Neyer is clearly a disciple and, if you have read James, Neyer's attempt to imitate the wonderfull funny prose is almost embarrasing.

The factory alignment was right on, in terms of right angles, and the tracking needed only minor adjustment, which is easily done. I especially like the end table, for sanding contours. Dust collection seems to work pretty well. The only defect is cosmetic; the paint is peeling from the cast iron table edges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jet's biggest disappointment","review":"I'm a big jet owner but am VERY disappointed in this sander. The table height adjustment is primitive. It takes holding it in place with two hands and tightening two knobs. Very, very poor design. And the table obscures over an inch of the belt, so this sander only has about 4 1/2 inches usable. Very poor.Table angle adjustment is very crude. A single toggle lever in a hard to access place. I don't tilt it much so it's not a big deal, but it is a poor design.I haven't tried/needed to adjust tracking yet but the adjustment looks like it is going to be a hassle, unlike my Delta drum/disk sander.This whole tool feels like one of Jet's first designs that never got improved. This is NOT the quality I expect from Jet. I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-See Movie","review":"This past Friday, a new movie theater opened in Washington, and was showing Ararat, along with the typical Hollywood fare.

It makes me curious about the whole picture and the intention of Ermenians promoting this idea???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made film full of lies","review":"It is interesting how the movie was presented... things completely irrelevant were tied together. The film was purely made to play on American and Canadian public. It touched sensitive issues, presented plenty of opportunities for Armenians to tell their \\"story\\" and solidify it thru non-existent \\"facts and documents\\", and personified Turks as the cruel ones. The film's goal was not to bring ligth to dark sides of Armenian history, but rather to provide a support for the fake story of the genocide for years to come.In the movie, these \\"mythical\\" Americans were used to manipulate the feelings and gain support of the average American. French language is constantly used throughout the movie to sympathize with French and Canadians. Very manupulative plot!!!I would recommend watching the movie keeping in mind that it is full of falsifications and lies.God Bless America."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a BIG DREAM STORY","review":"It is just a dream story.

The whole movie is built on falsified facts that do not have any proofs behind them. Producers have used all possible means to attract attention of American public by using such things as US flag on Armenian side and gave a false sense as if Americans have been attacked by Turks ...It is funny that each year the number of Armenians that \\"have been killed\\" by Turks increases exponentially. According to the movie 1.5 million Armenians have been killed in 1915. However, if this is true, it is not clear who are the people who call themselves Armenians now.The only fact that movie relies on is the diary of a painter and his painting. There is no reliable source in the movie. However, I am pretty sure, in 20 years new generations will use this movie as a reliable source for their more exaggerated story - \\"Armenian genocide\\" that never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the Kurds?","review":"Now one think that makes me really think that this movie is propaganda is the fact, that they don't speak about the Kurdish people in south-east Turkey.How many Turks lived in Van or Ararat at that time? I think not one did. Even today there are no Turks in Van or Ararat.Of course there were Turkish soldiers, but not that much.

First, the Raffi character, granted he is young, is so cloying, lacking in fortitude and animation that someone, namely me should punch this guy. Secondly, the most excruciating part of the movie was when the actor(half-Turkish) playing the Turkish general responsible for the local atrocities, initiates a discussion of the question of Turkish culpability with the director. This shamelessly didactic scene was the equivalent of, and I think I would prefer this, someone beating me upside the head with a baseball bat having the Koran inscribed on it.

I am an average sized girl 5'5 130 pounds and ordered a S/M based on my measurements (34-27-36, size 6) and the size chart. The skirt is not even close to being big enough to fit over my hips. I tried it on and the zipper broke as soon as I touched it. The top is alright, a little too big. If you still want to order this, size up. The top is way easier to adjust than the skirt. Hopefully I can somehow make it work with a broken zipper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"This was the first time I'd ever worn anything role-playing so I wasn't too sure about it when I ordered it.

Image editing has never been faster, virtually no load time adding special effects to pictures. And for all you gamers you cant pass this up. Games that once ran poorly on my system run great, Like - NOX, Half-Life, Half-life Opposing Force, QuakeII, Quake III, The Sims, Plane Scape Torment Just to name a few.

This book was great for me as a beginner, but complete enough to expand upon if you've had llamas for a while. It covers all the basics of care and breeding as well as a great section on creating a business with your llamas like packing, showing, fertilizer, etc. Gale Birutta is a great author that presents everything in a clear and interesting manner.

They would get a five except they are both broken in two weeks time. They are ultra thin glass. One broke the first time it was used.

The problem is that they shatter very easily. I've had several sets break during shipment and very soon after the first use. They can be a hazard when they shatter in your hands! Amazon told me to toss the shattered glasses and they would send me a replacement. I've had to do this a few times and now Amazon has decided to charge me for the broken glasses because I didn't return them... Obviously I've given up on this brand.

Goodbye glass - hello itsy-bitsy pieces of glass along with several shards. The double wall gives an interesting look to the glass, but it also looks like something that one would assume is a clear plastic.

You may even break them by touching the rim with a bottle while pouring, etc.Great idea, worked great too. Just not worth it. I'm going to see if I can get a partial refund.Get yourself some Tervis Tumblers, same idea but in sturdy polycarbonate plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double wall beverage glasses","review":"These mouth blown double wall glasses keep their contents cold to the last drop. I tested them to 2 hours and the contents were still as cold as when poured. The glasses have a smooth, pleasant feel to the lips and are attractive enough for the most discerning guest. They will hold 12 oz of beer, but no room for a head, so pour with care. I am using them for every drink I want to keep hot or cold.

We enjoy Bodum Assam double-wall glassware in a couple of other sizes/shapes, and they are our very favorites. In humid weather they don't sweat, and they are elegant looking, too. Unfortunately, they need to be carefully packed for shipping. The ones I ordered arrived with a boxed set of two beer glasses inside another shipping box, with no bubble wrap.

I will not let him near my iPhone or camera or anything of value.Since he loves beer, I bought him two of the beer glasses.

They have held up really well, and have not developed any cloudiness from the dishwasher. The double-walled construction keeps condensation from forming so you don't need a coaster, and because they are glass, they don't develop off odors. I decided to get some larger ones for the summer, and was somewhat concerned about all the reviews that say they are delicate. I've had this 13 ounce version for about 3 weeks now, and they are doing fine so far. Have held up to ice, both manual washing and dishwasher, the occasional tipping-over in the sink. I wouldn't mind if they were a bit wider - it's a tight squeeze to reach the bottom with your sponge when handwashing.Updated after 3 months of ownership - still going strong..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Good, Fits Well","review":"This is a quality Eastland shoe and is very comfortable. This slip on hugs the foot very well. The nubuck leather brushes out fairly easy with a regular shoe brush.

(e.g.Christopher Hitchensincludes Khayyam's quatrains as essential reading for atheists)Why not just read them yourself and make up your own mind? Several of the best translations are all free, in the public domain, and available online through Project Gutenberg or WikiSource. Look for Fitzgerald, McCarthy, Whinfield, or even Richard Le Gallienne's paraphrase, which attempts to maintain the witiness of Khayyam.Anything is preferable to having someone else tell you \\"for sure\\" what is meant - even if their analysis is correct, isn't it better to figure it out for yourself?"},{"rating":"1","title":"in search of an author","review":"Let it be said that \\"La patografia\\" definitly will be one of the most talked about books in the literature of Puerto Rico. Characteristic of such omissions is Lozada's lack of interest, bordering on outright dismissal, in any considerations derived from what has, somewhat misleadingly, come to be known as the \\"play\\" of literature as allegory, semantic effects and other nessesary isms in the virtual land of the correct. I disapprove. But then again I am not of that inclination and so cannot coment on it authoritatively. In any case, disapprove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You!!","review":"Although not an expert in literature correctness nor a bitter homosexual, I must commend Mr. Lozada for his candid contribution to the Spanish reading world. La Patografia is definitely the voice of courage. The courage to confront what many have suppressed and tried to forget. The courage to expose vulnerabilities without trying to please the \\"academic authorities\\". La Patografia is beyond the already prestigious label \\"GAY NOVEL\\". It is a novel for the whole family and should be read out loud in every family gathering. It's message of love and compassion, sparkled with extraordinary Caribbean humor, has left many of us wanting more from Lozada."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay hype. Literary arrogance.

The sound is overly harsh and droning in some places and empty and cold in others. We Have Explosive, the most well known track, is mindless techno. On a whole the sound is uncoordinated. If you are interested in techno music and thought this CD would be a good intro, think again, this album left no mark in the underground techno community and recieved no praise, it is worthless mainstream techno with only a few redeeming tracks 6 and 10. Accelerator by the Future Sound of London is better album by far and it had a true impact on the underground in its time, get it instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD from The Future Sound of London so far","review":"The Future Sound of London is the best Techno band ever, and Dead Cities is like a walk through the streets of LA on a dark, cloudy day, with no sign of the sun making an appearance. The CD kicks off with the vicious beats of Herd Killing, mellows out with Her Face Forms In Summertime, and kicks back to the beat with We Have Explosive, and finally, becomes dark and scary with Everyone In The World Is Doing Something Without Me. I only wish that all of the songs represented more darkness and had more of a Nightmarish and disturbing Night feel, not a sunny day feel like those in My Kingdom, Max Antique Toy and Vit Drowning. Still, this CD is the best FSOL has released. We want more, FSOL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"Without a doubt, FSOL's best. Dark, haunting, yet shining with hope and imagination, FSOL has once again captured an aural atmosphere and packaged it. Listening to this CD is something which cannot be described. Like \\"LifeForms\\", it demands attention and is not merely background music; coming to the forefront and causing all who listen to it to get lost in the music and their own thoughts. And although rating FSOL tracks on any given CD is difficult, considering each song flows into the next, I'd have so say without doubt that \\"My Kingdom\\" is the best FSOL track ever. If you're going to buy any FSOL, buy \\"Dead Cities\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its really 'strange' music","review":"This album has depth, power and complicated structure.

Everything are talked a little bit, but nothing is discussed in detail.Each chapter is not well connected, this not like a book but like a huge magazine with a bunch of articles -- too many authers can mess up a good name book. They seems never talk to each other before and after writing this book. for examble, in beginning of chapter 9, it says: \\"By now you have learned how Active Server Page (ASP) use components.\\" -- False! I never learned, at least in this book!In chapter 6 -- DHTML Application. The example application is only working in VB IDE even after making the package. It's either the author's problem or Microsoft's problem.As a \\"Professional VB Web programming book\\", it neither explains how to deploy a Web application well in general, nor teach you programming in detail.This book turns me to read other ASP book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over all pretty good but falls short on WebClasses and MTS","review":"This book does covers alot of things that you can do with VB6.

In this refreshing look at man's arrogance gone mad, the action takes a back seat to character development, making an engrossing study of ordinary people under extraordinary stress. The usual scientists vs military or crooked politician vs idealistic crusaders plot gimmicks are ignored, leaving us with a much more realistic and emotionally draining struggle as the citizens of London attempt to deal with their feelings of anger, fear, helplessness and resignation. The ending is thought-provoking if a bit dissatisfying, but subtracts nothing from this disturbing gem of early Science Fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 1950s Story for Our Times","review":"I saw this film as a 15 year old in 1958 living in a west-of-London suburb and, with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmanent movement at its height, it resonated as loudly as a church bell. Not only that I was fascinated by how newspapers operated and this film gave me a, probably eroneous glimpse, inside that world, the film laid out a highly convincing scenario. Yes, the film suffered from a massive lack of budget but the British film industry was in crisis (when isn't it?) and there were no bankers for this type of honest story. And yes, Britsh actors were just coming out of the Noel Coward stereotype and finding their angry young man 'Look Back in Anger' feet, so weren't the hottest acts in town but this film made its own small contribution to honesty in acting as well as story telling. It's as much an anti-nuclear arms/war classic as \\"On The Beach\\". It's brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"smart sf drama...","review":"..that has taken way too long to become available on the market.I originally saw this in a revival theatre some 10 years ago and was literally blown away by the exceptional quality in almost all aspects of the production. It's one of the great sf films of its era, a sadly neglected hammer production that has solid acting, smart and sassy dialogue, and startlingly good special effects. It works not as campy fun (as is the case with most sf movies) but as a solid dramatic effort - rather like the Quatermass films even if it is quite different in approach. All in all, a balanced and exciting mix that entertains you from the beginning to the end, and continues to show it's intelligence in the effective conclusion. First rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite must-see!","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite films, available at long last in widescreen format on DVD! Intelligent and classy, The Day the Earth Caught Fire isn't my usual so-bad-it's-good fare, but a movie you'll actually enjoy watching.Reporter Edward Judd uncovers a nefarious cover-up on the part of the government: the Earth's been knocked out of orbit by atom bombs, but the powers that be want to keep the lid on the news to avoid mass panic...which of course happens anyway. Janet Munro sets the screen on fire as the sexy temp who spills the beans to Judd, doing her first nude scene after leaving Disney. Leo (Rumpole) McKern as Judd's fellow reporter is his excellent, lovably irascible self. Some very effective special effectsThe DVD includes commentary by producer/director/co-writer Val Guest, and features tinted opening and closing scenes as shown in some theaters.Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I now have a new top 3...","review":"in the top 5 WORST DVD TRANSFERS I OWN!!!This set is absolutely the pits, it's awful the quality is unwatchable, Fantasy mission force has not only film errors but also video lines and colourerrors with the picture shifting up and down.

The company does make it very clear that it won't work well in high humidity environments but I would not characterize LA as being that way. With that said, the unit would pump humidified air into our apartment which only added to the heat we were trying to get rid of. People seem to have good luck in VERY low humidity locations, I figured around 50-60% was low enough...apparently not.The unit arrived scratched and damaged but the situation was remedied after a long series of e-mails and phone calls.Final words: if you live in the desert or very very dry conditions it probably works well.

The first two tracks in particular are strongly reminiscent of an insanely breakbeaty take on In Sides-era Orbital, and that's high praise. Unfortunately, the inventiveness is too much to keep up for an entire album and the last few tracks are frankly dull. Still worth four stars for the quality of the start. Mind-expanding, infectious, enjoyable, and full of things to come back to."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible album.","review":"Ever since I've heard Aphex Twin, I've been looking for another artist that is playing something similar. I've found it in u-ziq. u-ziq has a very interesting style that is similar to RDJ in some ways, but totally different in others. I must say I do not particularly like \\"My Little Beautiful\\", \\"Wannabe\\" and \\"London\\". But other than that all the tracks are incredible. ESPECIALLY \\"Brace Yourself\\". Oh my! If you are interested in drum(drill)+bass/experimental electronica, than this is definitely for you. Just incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"post-classical?","review":"the record that makes the break with all previous works by mike paradinas - well-engineered and consistent - as compared to [bluff limbo] and [royal astronomy]. not terribly original when compared to the seminal works of richard james and tom jenkinson (in terms of programming) but [lunatic harness] is more than saved by its beautiful and sublime melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great range.","review":"Consider what was happening in 97.

Some of the most beautiful rhythms and composed beats I've ever heard when this album came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off strong but slowly dies towards the end.","review":"I've always considered this album to be Mike Paradinas' silly attempt at sounding like squarepusher on prozac. It starts off at a decent pace with some fast chopped up breakbeats. Soon after the magic dies however. You end up hearing the same drumbeats sampled on several songs as well as endless repetitions that are so endlessly boring that you have to wonder when/why Mike decided to turn his gear off and call it a song. There are a couple parts of the album that are memorable. Approaching Menace is what I believe to be the album's strongest track. A good effort but not really up to par with most IDM related albums out nowadays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special.","review":"Yet another album that concentrates on those synth-cheese melodies. Mu-Ziq just keeps on kicking the horse, and does so with less beat programming talent than Squarepusher or Venetian Snares, and less charisma than Aphex Twin, or heck, Barry Manilow. Perhaps because i'm taking it from a 2004 perspective, it doesn't measure up to modern electronica in the same vein; perhaps it's an unfair comparison. But as a person currently living in 2004, i'd download 'Hasty Boom Alert' and 'Midwinter Log' and move on to an artist with an idea that's less than 5 years old. A bland, repetitive, unimportant album that you'll barely listen to once."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great electronic album, critical for mu-ziq fans","review":"This is an album with almost as much energy and variety as you can get within the range of electronic music. It gives listeners a new sensation from each piece, hearing musical samples they can't find anywhere else. Just when you get used to the sound within a song, it changes, keeping listeners on-edge. This is not an album for people who want consistency in their music, but those who like the unpredictability of music will be addicted. I love it, though the changing moods at the end of pieces like \\"Midwinter Log\\" and \\"Catkin And Teasel\\" (my favorites) tend to disturb the harmony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for beginners","review":"I had never touched SQL Server, nor was my programming up to par.

It will get you there. It is a bit dry but fairly comprehensive. It will take you through the steps of setting up a connection, performing select queries, updates, deletes. There are a couple of nice chapters on using stored procedures to access SQL Server quickly. This book is also nice in that has lot of hand holding for getting around SQL Server itself, but this book is definitely for beginners. Even for me coming from an Access background and no experience with SQL server found it a little too basic and dry. I don't regret getting it though, I find it's not the book I find my self turning to. But it does spell it out if you're willing to wade through it. I would not get this book as a reference work.

Overall it's a great album that I would highly recomend to anyone who has varied tastes in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Sister With Talent","review":"Natasha Bedingfield is, for lack of a better word: pop. She's that same brand of pop that's been pushed out of the States for the more punk pop sounds of Good Charlotte and Simple Plan. However, unlike some of the pop stars from the past, she has an R&B edge that will propel her to success--the person who made the Pink comparison is right, however, it's the early \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" Pink style Natasha brings out with a less rough edge. Highlights include the title track \\"Unwritten\\" and the single \\"These Words.\\" Natasha Bedingfield has what it takes to revive the squeaky clean pop by infusing pop and R&B.

Closer to the former, I suppose, based as it is on a single track from the Future Sound of London's album \\"Dead Cities\\" (one of my all-time favorites of theirs), and yet it is incredible how they have taken all of the unrealized musical potentialities of that track and explored them here for about half an hour in unexpected and compelling directions--sometimes mutating the original track almost beyond recognition in the process. The first track is the closest to the original, but they have even modified and altered this in subtle ways. Still, the overall ambiance of the music is true to \\"Dead Cities\\" with its haunting and moody mix of electronica and alien musical sounds, ethereal and disturbing at the same time. If you like that album, you'll like this erstwhile CD single, but it's different enough too that you can justify listening to it on its own terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply brilliant","review":"i get into a lot of aphex twin, autechre, b12, square pusher, you know, the warp kind of thing,...I also tend to like fsol. the album is a single, but the single isn't just a song, its a halfhour long symphany, a complete work from beginning to end, almost like your watching a movie, the vocals part reminds me of the operah scene in the movie 'The Fifth Element'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing gets five stars.","review":"Some artists create singles based on favorite tracks from their full-length releases.

After going into great detail showing you how you write a schemea, it all turns out to be pointless because you don't actually need to use one for a .NET Web Service (which is what I thought the book was all about). Similarly the subject of WSDL is covered in great detail - why go to this depth and never explain why. It mentions the passing of credentials as a SOAP header on page 316 and the book ends on page 327.This book is a Microsoft reference lift turned into a book with a scabby example of a \\"real-life\\" example.

The chapters do not follow a clear progression, and techniques discussed in one chapter are ineffectively carried over to the next.The book also has a bizzare and haphazard arrangement of topics (For example: there is a chapter introducing Visual Studio.NET inexplicably placed towards the end of the book)Overall the book tries to cover too many fringe topics without spending enough time on the basics of server controls needed to form a solid foundation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthwhile read","review":"This is probably one of the best recent books from Wrox. Typically, there books have been rehashes of older books or simple a rehash of the Microsoft documentation. Someone once told me the value of the book is inversely proportional to the number of authors, but I can say that is not the case with book. Very good coverage for writing server controls.This book gives good coverage to the creating of server controls, with decent coverage of some very advanced aspects of building server controls.It does suffer however from very simplistic examples that don't have much application in the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Cooks in the Kitchen","review":"Wow. This book is really confusing! I bought this book last year when I started working on a large project using .NET. It's been over 12 months and I'm grown to love .NET---and built-up quite a bag of tools.When I returned to this book recently to build my own custom controls, I thought it would be much more comprehensible than my first attempt. Unfortunately it wasn't. That is, until I read a few articles and an excerpt from Dino Esposito's book! Esposito's explanations were so much more clear and simple--while this book took that same subject and made it so complicated!Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing more than helpful","review":"As it is often the case with WROX books, this one is glued from pieces written by different authors. Reading their books is like having deja vues all the time. The synergy among chapters is quite poor.Compared to Kothari's book this one merely scratches the surface and leaves a lot of important details by the side. If I hadn't read Nikhil Kotari's book first, I would've been completely confused by this piece. Don't get me wrong---the book *does* have valuable information for developing server controls *if you are not a beginner*.Would I recommend this book? Only if you go through Nikhil Kothari's book first and then want to learn a few more tricks. Don't expect to be taught much from this book.Overall, 2 stars for inadequate coverage and a ton of typos and errors in the samples and throughout the text. I really wish WROX quit releasing hodge podge books and did a better job at reviewing them prior to publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Examples are too simple","review":"As the other reviewers state this book has been written by 8 authors and it clearly shows. Some of the examples provided are extremely simple and leave you wondering if building custom controls is worth all the effort whilst other examples seem to take extreme measures to produce very simple results.Chapter 5 (Template Controls) is one of the worse chapters I have ever seen in a Wrox book and left me wondering if the author had ever created a self contained at all.Wrox have listened though to the complaints regarding a lack of JavaScript integration and now provide an extra chapter on-line"},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing Server Controls? - Look Elsewhere.","review":"This is the worst, most overpriced, Wrox book I have ever purchased. If only the entire book had been of the quality of the added chapter \\"JavaScript and Server Controls\\" ...Now that was an excellent read. I can't believe it was the same group of authors.This book attempts to reduce a complex topic to a few lame examples and no real explanation of the concepts. I was very disappointed. I got no more information than I already had in a single chapter of \\"Professional ASP.NET\\"...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Clear","review":"The most complicated parts and most important parts of web server controls are the control builders and interaction with the designer. The examples are incomplete and leave you wondering what the heck you are supposed to do. I bought this book because it was the only one out, but I recommend waiting for another one to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tesla, A man beyond comprehension.","review":"All I can say is that this film mesmerized me not because it is the most polished motion picture film I have ever seen because it is not. What comes through is the absolute marvel of Tesla's inventive mind. This film has done well to possibly give me a lifelong interest in Tesla and leaves me wanting to read and find out so much more. The fact that there are some Hollywood lengends acting in this film makes it all the more curious and desireable to see. If Tesla interests you at all this is a must see film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tesla the Greatest Inventor in History","review":"This movie should be required viewing by all citizens of the USA to show how a great genius can be persecuted by the failing legal system back in 1890 as of today. We owe a huge percentage of our daily comforts, most of which are powered by AC current, as introduced for us by Tesla. Sadly, very few educated folks in the USA have any clue about how much of our lifestyle is based on Tesla's work. The movie is very close to the actual history but can, of course, only scratch the surface on the overall contribution by Tesla. You owe it to yourself to see this to be an educated person."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Secret of Nikola Tesla - The Movie (UFO TV Special Edition)","review":"This DVD was I think the worst grade B movie ever made.

I feel in love with it. There is no smell and with the roll-on there is no mess! The only problem with it was the price and the distance I had to drive to get it. Then I found it on-line at Amazon! Obtaining it was now so much easier! Also, it was cheaper! It was almost $13 at the office. On here it averaged out about $10. This makes a difference in the long run.I love this product so much, that I recommend it to my friends with back pain. I have even givent he little packs that come with the order to them to try. Now they are in love with it and are ordering it.This is an awesome product for muscle pain. It starts off hot and then starts cooling giving you a refreshing feeling in a painful area.

All of the diet, lifestyle, exercise and relationships tips make such good sense, and it's so easy to incorporate these ideas into my life. I like the way Lisa Marie Coffey pairs up the doshas, I just laughed when I recognized how I am with certain people. It's so true! I'm hooked, Baby - and ready for a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not just about Lucia","review":"(...) This is one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. The name is a misnomer. It's not just about sex or relationships- but also about ourselves. There is the light side to each of us that is irresistable, and a darker side that is equally compelling but somewhat sad. The erotic and circumstantial suspense deepens as the movie develops. There is deja vu and foreshadowing. It lacks nothing. Though I loved it from the get-go, my wife found it strange. I was mystified by her response because I was so excited. After some time to reflect, she, too, became a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex and Lucia","review":"The story pushes you to the limit of possibilties. As the story says if you dont like the ending, at the end of the story there is a little whole that takes you back to the middle of the story and you can rewrite the story to change the outcome. Spanish filmakers have always set the example for giving stories a great plot that mingles your mind to the limit. This is the best movie I seen this last year, I would nominated for Best Foreign Movie if I could. I highly recommended especially for the brainy types that like a pictures other that the predictable Hollywood bombs we get here in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Needed A Cigarette After Watching This, and I Don't Smoke","review":"I could make a joke and tell you that I needed a cigarette after watching this (I did, and I don't smoke), but the fact is, it is a beautiful and powerful movie. The sex, and there is a lot of it, is a catalyst for an incredible story. The filmmaking is beautiful, the journey the story takes you on is awesome and takes turns you just don't expect. And everyone is, of course, beautiful to look at. A great watch, but only for for adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left the erotic out of erotica!","review":"If you are looking for decent soft-core erotica, this film is very lame, the only provocative scene was a video playing on a television in the background.

As much as it is bad to compare, Sex and Lucia doesn't even come far second to Y Tu Mama Tambien. The only credit I will have to give this movie is its cinematography and music score. The movie was altogether tiring and the sex scenes were too graphic to start with. I don't understand why the characters have to bare all! (as in everything in many times)Another thing I observed in this movie was that the lighting was too bright that it is very difficult for us foreign enthusiast to read the subtitles. The light was very much glaring to the eyes. I didn't like it.Over-all, I would only recommend this film to people who loves sex scenes inserted in an o-k story.

Maybe it's the foreign atmosphere, who knows.Anyway, the plot rambles, the characters amble, and very little is accomplished.

The cyborg is undergoing a test run in the forrest, before it is sent to America to also seek revenge for Hiroshima and while the test in underway a space ship crashes and apparently causes the dead to rise and then it's super bad special effects and terrible make up for the rest of the film. Poor direction, bad music, elementary effects - I can sometimes deal with all that, but being that this movie was made post 911 and I am American, I didn't appreciate the idea behind this film.

I found the book to be a mixture of biography, history, and motivational parables. While the biography was perhaps a bit too long, it provided a stage for discussing three very important issues. The first was the potentially destructive impact of dogmatic national policies (The Chinese Cultural Revolution) on a family at the very personal level. The second theme presented the difficulties inherent in and evolution of the relationship between Asia-born parents and their westernized children.

I absolutely love these speakers. It rattles the walls and sounds crystal clear. I have been wanting new speakers for about three years now but can't find anything comparable without spending gobs of money. I will run these until they die. After 10 years of use they are starting to have small issues, but nothing I haven't been able to fix by wiggling a wire. The bass is still strong and the satellites are still crystal clear. I prefer these over my home theater system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I got a bad one","review":"Maybe I got a bad one, but mine didnt work properly. had to send it back.

I found it to be very wordy and it did not give specific answers to issues that I was researching. For example; I believe that a divorced man should be able to serve as a Deacon if his divorce followed biblical guidelines. If you are divorced becase of adultery then your divorce is allowed in the teachings of the bible. This study seem to skirt the issue and not truly advise people to what the true teachings are. I found this book missing any commitment toward hard issues. Do your research and buy a good set of commentaries. You'll be glad you did. There are some really good and scholarly commentaries available."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful political thriller.","review":"JUNE,2004 is a compellimg story that meets all the criteria of an excellent novel. It has a brisk pace and includes an array of believable characters. Britt adds to the intensity of the story by moving the reader through a variety of events condensed into a one week time frame. Using a chronological format, the author keeps the readers interest high amidst the fast paced detail essential to the story line. The format employed by Britt to conclude the novel may not please all readers but it provides for a gripping and fascinating conclusion. Overall, this is an important and insightful book that is eminently readible- a real page turner.It also compels the reader forward and forces one to think about issues that constantly need to be considered in a democratic society."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's fiction alright -- but not what I consider alright fiction.","review":"I have to confess that I didn't make it to the half way point through this book before I put it down for keeps. I found it difficult to stay with the story line mostly because of too many too obvious attempts to more than hint at real-life players and circumstances. It becomes tedious and distracting.If you dislike the aforementioned players passionately enough you'll probably enjoy the book -- though why anyone would pay for fiction on such a theme is beyond me to guess when you can get it for free from any of myriad print media and Internet websites. On the other hand, if you're just looking for good fiction, 'June, 2004' is not that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needed an editor.","review":"The book would explain PHP well if there weren't so many grammatical errors. The first few chapters were well worth reading, but about halfway through, stilted sentences and the incorrect use of \\"which\\" and \\"that\\" put me off the treatise entirely. I know that books of this ilk must be written hurriedly so the technology described in the book doesn't get a chance to change substantially before the book goes to market, but this is ridiculous. If I were shopping for a PHP book, I'd look seriously at some others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not happy","review":"The quality of this book was very poor in my opinion... The samples of projects were not very good, and I would recommend that you do not purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Source not tested from the book","review":"The database examples where typed in by a non programmer (probably from the layout department). The php code did not match the sql given previously. So if you want to debug the examples that are supposed to teach you stuff, then have fun and spend some EXTRA TIME with this book. That time multiplied by the number of readers could have been SAVED by a better editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I am a profrssional internet programmer, I've used PHP to design websites for 4 years.

I reccommend Learning Perl with Beginning Perl or Professional Perl. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book and good PHP/MySQL install section","review":"I come from an ASP beackground and found the book to be very approachable. I wanted to learn PHP so that I could start programing dynamic pages on Linux with Apache. I first started out by Using Redhat's RPMs for both PHP and MySQL. Since Redhats dist of PHP did not include support for MySQL I was faced with the task of installing the source PHP dist. I also went ahead and unistalled the MySQL RPM and installed the source MySQL dist by following the instructiions in the book. This process went smoothly for someone used to the point and click MS world. If I had to follow the PHP and/or MySQL documentation I would have been lost. So, if your trying out Linux/MySQL/PHP this book should get you up and started pretty easily.As with any programming book there are some things that take more than one reading, or further investigation into other sources, but if you have any programming experience you will be up and programing in PHP quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is <b>THE</b> Book !","review":"I have bought or looked at the other books, Core PHP, PHP Essentials, and several others.

Although, I would like another page or two explaining how Apache does some of the things it does...but, I guess that is the job of an apache book, not of this already meaty 850 page book.The book is also has a good balance that fits very neatly between the \\"for dummies\\" and the \\"nutshell\\" books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhh, yes!","review":"This has been THE PHP book I've been waiting for. Well written, great analogies, loads of examples. If you want to learn PHP this is the book, esp. for those with a passing understanding of Perl, or shell scripting, or C, C++, etc. I can't praise this book enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction to PHP","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn PHP. This book is well written and most of the examples are practical.This book assumes you have some familarity with programming, although not much. The book is easy to read. The authors have done a good job of making the content interesting and fresh.This book is especially helpful if you are interested in doing e-commerce since one of the main case studies in this book shows you how to construct a shopping cart.There is a handy HTML tag reference in the back of the book.This book is not perfect, few are. Advanced users, as you can see from some of the other reviews, may find it lacking. For beginners and intermediate programmers like myself, it is terrific. It is the best book available on PHP and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great PHP book...","review":"I was looking for a PHP book that wasn't just a reprint of the manual (like most of them are). This book is great for newbies and expirienced programmers alike. This is the book that'll be on your desk 24 a day -- since you'll keep refering back to it.Should be on every serious PHP developer's book shelf. The only thing I didn't like about the book was that the chapter on PHP and XML didn't provide as much details as I was hoping for. But since I got it really cheap using a coupon from UnderTag.com, I can't really complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're better off using the online documentation.","review":"This book has many issues. Such as poor organization and indexing, missing php functions, and lack of in-depth examples with good explanations.If your new to programming and desperately need a reference to get you started, this may be the book for you. Yet the problems I mentioned above would be frustrating for new programmers. Its frustrating enough when you know what your looking for and can't find it. I find myself using the online documentation far more than I use this book.On the other hand, this book does provide various examples on how to use php and may prove to be helpful to some.Please note that this review does not cover chapter 2 \\"Installing and Configuring PHP\\" since I did not need to read this portion of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but obsolete.","review":"This is a great PHP intro book with very nice, step-by-step, clear and straightforward examples. I recommend that you get this book only if you find it necessary to have your programming documentation in a paper form, but it is really unnecessary. This is not an advanced PHP programmer book, but rather beginner to intermediate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for intermediate programmers","review":"Before buying this book I was familar with PERL, C++, ASP, and SQL. I bought this book looking for a quick way to learn the syntax of PHP and how to use it with MySQL. This book proved to do that very well, but I am unsure how well this book would have done had I been without my prior programming experience. Some of the topics go by fairly fast and without some previous knowledge it might be hard for a beginner to grasp some of the ideas. Nonetheless, this is a great book which outlines the basics of PHP extremely well. Though I don't yet consider myself an expert on the topic, this book was perfect as an introduction and a good enough introduction that I feel confident that I can go out an develop my own PHP applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my life, and my sanity!","review":"I've read more PHP books, websites, mailing lists and discussion groups than I care to think about in the last few weeks, and NOTHING has come close to this book. For an almost-complete newbie, it is clear, concise, very easy to navigate and - particularly the section on mySQL - has made easy things I just never thought I'd understand. Thank you so much, Wrox!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hodge Podge","review":"The book is ok for anecdotal reference. The overall quality of the code samples .. simply stinks.. several key examples simply don't work as published. As an owner of several Wrox press books, I was very disappointed with this one. The information available at web sites is much more valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Date","review":"It is out of date and so has some misleading information. Though the title says professional, it is really a beginner book. It is missing, among other things, a solid discussion of objects in PHP and discussion of sessions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book for a real world programming","review":"This book might be worthwhile as a classroom workbook where you go through each and every chapter in order. As a book for somebody who wants to get things done this book is terrible. You have to wade through entire chapters to find what you want and the index is useless.For my real world projects I have never found what I wanted to know in this book. You are better off just looking at online documentation.It is also out of date and lacks coverage of sessions (there is a newer edition of the book that might include this but I am not going to buy it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Spin Up","review":"This book taught me how to program in PHP in just one day. However, I don't think the beginner will spin up that quickly but I do recommend it for someone with some experience in programming that wants to learn what PHP is all about. This book actually had me writing code that would connect and use a MySQL database with ease. To be fair, sometimes the book didn't do a good job explaining some of the concepts but overall it was sufficient. I dont recommend this book to experienced PHP users. But it is great for beginners to intermediate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly, a book for beginners. Get the online docs.","review":"As an experienced programmer, I found this book really frustrating. While it covers lots of other web-related subjects like SQL, LDAP, XML, etc., there's *no* reference manual, and no formal description of the language. If you have a very precise question (e.g.: how do you pass arguments by reference), you have to look at all the examples. Well, some useful information can be found, but you really have to look hard. What's more, the indexing is a joke.No, the title is a con. This is not a book for professionals. A more appropriate title would have been: \\"Building Web-Enabled Applications for Beginners\\" or something like that. It's not a bad book per se, but it is aimed at beginners and the title and the publisher's description fooled me into buying it.Experienced developers, stay away from this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"I have been somewhat nervous about buying Wrox books. They, like the O'Reilly books, are not geared for the beginner. This book follows suit, if you are a newbie to web programming or programming in general, this book won't help you get over that hurdle. However, being familiar with programming, I found the book easy to understand. Note, that you will need to know HTML -- this book does NOT cover HTML.I used Medinets books to give myself an introduction and used this behomoth book to fill in the rest. The book offers a comprehensive coverage. Everything from image processing, SQL database connections, and other things are covered. In addition, Fast Templates are covered (albeit not too clearly). I felt the book could have used more examples -- especially early on.This book is an invaluable resource. If you are planning on using PHP, by all means pick up this book and Medinet's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many holes","review":"While some of this book was helpful as a tutorial for someone new to PHP, there are far too many holes in the book and it is lousy as a reference manual. The index is terrible. To me a book like this must have a strong index or else it is useless. For example, I am working on a project that needs to determine the current date - a fairly common requirement. However, there is no entry in the index for dates or the PHP function getdate! I found the answer at the PHP website but that is what I bought this book for. This is just one example of the poor documentation in this book. There must be better ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for newbies and experts","review":"I would real?y like to recomend this book to everyone interested on learning this potential programming language, and to anyone who already knows it and wants a reference book. And perhaps, if you are a PHP expert, I am sure you'll learn something from this book.Perfect explanations of every PHP function. Includes examples and anything you need to really understand the PHP environment, and not only to understand it, but to enjoy it and get the maximum from it!.Really a must have.Luis R.

Speaking Visual Basic helps, but all the customs and habits you knew have been replaced by something new.I wish I could say this book gets you through the transition, but aside from three or four pages in the beginning, you don't really get a firm grasp of the differences between ASP and ASP.NET. It's more helpful when you start to work with .NET itself, as it has practical examples and the like.

I even submitted code from Chapter 3, page 67 to Microsoft Support, after receiving nothing but a blank page when I ran it. Microsoft noticed that the code was MISSING a required clause! The exercise in question is the FIRST exercise in the book. If the first exercise you attempt fails even though you made no typos, it's frustrating.

So why bother writing all these books using just a Notepad.I would be grateful if anyone that has seen the book on a shelf could let us know if this book does so.

Seven is the coolest theme ever - the one from the WipeoutXL game intro video(the whole reason I got this CD) and the first track is also mixed in there somewhere. Number 4 is just a more or less decent techno track, while 8 is Prodigy's \\"Firestarter\\" without the vocals. Track 2 was a dissapointing dulled-down version of Fluke's \\"Atom Bomb\\"(I'd give the CD 4 stars if they just put the excellent original one). So there you have it, unless you desperatly want the WipeoutXL intro flick music which wasn't included on the game CD - don't bother. Better get the WipeoutXL game itself - it's out for PSX and PC and has the great game and music all in one(skip the first data track).

I'm very disappointed and glad it cost me less than $10 to buy this - I'd return it if I could! The voice on the tape is horrifically monetone and the dancers are not moving to any type of music - there's the same background music playing the whole time so you can't even feel a pattern.

I do not get the opportunity to work out that often, so when I do, I want it to count. This DVD takes it one step up from the first DVD. Having danced when I was younger, I want to keep the ballet legs and posture through my 50's and I believe this tape will help me achieve this. I also noticed my arms ached a little bit during the workout from all the arm movements, so that is a red flag for me to do this workout a little more often. While I did not break a sweat, I feel that the muscle control and coordination are essential for my current needs. I strongly suggest this DVD for anyone who thinks ballet is easy and for those of you that already know it is not, it is a real mood enhancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN THE FIRST NYC BALLET 1!","review":"I would recommend this video over one because it offers more of a challenge.

I recommend this video for anyone toying with the idea of getting in shape using ballet and think this one is probably more ideally suited to a true beginner than its predecessor (due to glossary & more instruction). However if you already own and love the first volume, then by all means buy this! It is very similar, and I think I may enjoy the floor & barre work more on the first one, but the dance sequence from Tarantella is so much fun to learn & will make you feel like a true ballerina!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For completists only","review":"Most of these tracks are available elsewhere...and the main attraction (Setting Sun) isn't one of the Chem's better tracks in my opinion.

One of the reviews on the cover says that this book \\"reads like a love story.\\" If, like I do, you realize that an accurate story about community theatre is inheritly a romance, regardless of the plot, then you must read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply glorious","review":"I have never read a book or seen a film that accurately describes the non-professional theatre world until this one. Totally without the condescending tone of even the better books, this is a completely riveting account of what the experience is like with all its joys and all its craziness. Hats off to the author and to the theater group that allowed itself to put under this microscope. It turned out beautifully for all concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb introduction to digital logic","review":"Having examined numerous books that cover introductory material on digital logic, I must say that this book is a welcome addition. Indeed, I would consider this book the best among the currently avaialabe books on this subject. The treatment emphasizes the fundamentals very well without an emphasis on the tecnhology or on any design language. Thus, the material covered should be helpful in giving the students a strong and lasting foundation which will be independent of changes in technology. The presentation is lucid, and the examples are very good.I believe this should be a serious candidate for the text book of any introductory course in digital logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worse book I've ever seen.","review":"This book was used for my 'Digital Logic and Design' course at Stony Brook University, NY. This book has non-sense, low quality examples and lack of explanation. I had to buy another different(better) book to study.

I was thrilled to find something I could use so dinner time and bedtime were a ways apart. Well, when I got this book, I was very disappointed. I cannot pronounce half of the ingredients and what I can pronounce, I cannot afford to purchase. Aparantly, working parents means doctors and lawyers who have kids.

To me, that's not very kid friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"These speakers are an excellent value.

There is nothing to complain about here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many mistakes","review":"I am a complete newcomer to HTML, and I am very disappointed in this book. The book starts off pretty well, and really captivated me, but then in their own examples, the authors start violating the principles they set forth. For instance, in the chapter on tables, the authors state that the thead, tfoot, and tbody elements have to appear in that order, but then in subsequent examples the authors employ those elements in a different order, and my browser (IE5) didn't seem to mind. When you couple this problem with the numerous typographical errors and poor editing overall, the book becomes confusing as to what is proper form for XHTML, and becomes an ineffective guide. The different sections of the book are obviously written by different people as they do not fit together very well, sometimes repeating things in previous sections, or not illustrating the relevance of the point at hand. I intend to buy another XHTML book and start over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool,and small","review":"I love this thing,it's so cool,and small.I've got it to hold 126 songs, i'm sure it can hold more, but I don't listen to any more then that, and I don't want to put anymore time into it.Very easy to use ,and I change songs easy.The drop songs feature makes it so easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"committed writing is always in style","review":"Brilliant.

GANG OF FOUR are one of the most enduring of bands from Britain's Punk explosion of the late '70's. All of their albums had plenty to offer, to a greater or lesser degree, right up to and including 1995's \\"Shrinkwrapped\\" [which is possibly my fave].From my persepctive their material is represented in proportion to its merit, hence \\"Mall\\" gets only minor exposure whilst tracks from their first and last albums get much greater prominence. I'm not much for remixes or old material that was never considered worthy of release in its time so these offerings do little for me. Their earlier compilation would get my thumbs up except that it does not include tracks from their later work which is easily as good as their original releases. This double CD is a great insight into the strength and power of one of the most influential groups of the modern era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese compressor motor","review":"This should have been a good compressor. However with about 40 hours on it the compressor motor dropped a broken retaining ring into the cylinder damaging a piston and scoring the head and sidewall. Apparently a few years ago the US made compressor motor was replaced with a Chinese one. For the failure of a 15 cent part it cost me over $100 in parts to repair. After fixing the compressor motor the relief valve failed which cost me more money. Thouroughly disatisfied with this Dewalt compressor. Highly unreliable and built using cheap imported parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful if you want to play video poker.","review":"I purchased this book because I saw a TV show that said \\"Video poker can be beat\\". I found this hard to believe but it is apparently true on some machines with perfect play. Ah, there is the rub. Along with the book I bought a computer program that teaches you how to play and shows you each error you make. It isn't real hard to learn how to play perfectly but requires a person that can really keep focused for hours on end. Most folks with the intellect to learn this could make much more money doing something (anything ?) else but if you have to gamble this is your best shot. This book with Frugal Gambler and some real effort will make your Vegas trips more fun.

There is good music here, but I can't recommend buying it at retail price to anyone.

Being raised Roman Catholic myself, I've heard all of the horror stories that have happened in the past. I couldn't imagine being one of those young girls and having your own family disown you because you got pregnant, even if it wasn't your fault.The film follows four women who have been disowned by their families and sent to the Madgalene sisterhoood asylum to correct their more or less sinful behaviour. Crispina and Rose have given birth to a pre-marriage child, Margaret got raped by her cousin and the orphan Bernadette had been repeatedly caught flirting with the boys. All have to work in a laundry under the strict supervision of the nuns, who break their wills through sadistic punishments. It's a very powerful movie that I think should be seen by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Minor Matter, But a Factual One","review":"Although I only bought this movie on my lunch hour, and have had time to view only a couple of scenes on the DVD before returning to lunch, I have one correction to make: Concerning the POISON IVY scene where Crispina shouts out over and over to a priest \\"You are NOT a man of God\\"(...) this scene is VERY POWERFUL in that Crispina (a slow witted girl), who is usually so trustful and who has absolute faith in the infallibility of her superiors, now realizes that indeed FATHER FITZROY is \\"...NOT a man of God!\\" How she realizes this will break your heart because the moviegoer realizes her anguish and torment when this \\"revelation\\" hits her.This film has many parallels to the movie \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\", which in and of itself dictates greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Religion is BAD - maybe the truth will drive it home!!","review":"An excellent movie.

It's an exploration of explosives that remains interesting to listen to years after its release."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good experiment","review":"Considered another experimental Neil Young album by many, I like to think this is a return to his roots.This is a bluesy, swinging album completely unlike any other NY record. As the Amazon reviewer points out the title track is a protest against the cynical commercial exploitation of music. Remember the video for this song, which parodied Michael Jacksons hair being on fire for his Pepsi ad. Aside from getting this message across (not that it made any difference) the album looks back to a multitude of different styles, including Soul, Rhythm and Blues and even some Jazz-like Ballads, all of which he pulls off with great style.I've been listening to this album since it came out in the late 80's and rate it 2nd only to \\"After the Goldrush\\". Off course NY has been very productive over the years and I probably only have 5 or 6 of his albums. No doubt some of these are just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"On A Good Note","review":"After the wretched Life, Neil Young bounced back strong with the blues-based, horn driven, This Note's For You. The album has a nice loose feel and the songs, which in most cases are built around extended riffs, have a strong punch. Mr. Young is in fine form and the horns section wraps nicely around some blistering guitar work. The title track contains some scathing lyrics about the commercialization of rock music and the video won an MTV video award are Video of The Year despite being banned from the station. \\"Life In The City\\", \\"Coupe De Ville\\", \\"Married Man\\" and \\"Sunny Inside\\" are all good songs, but \\"Ten Men Workin'\\" is the standout track on the album. The album has a catchy as hell horn riff and some nifty guitar playing.

However, the selection on this CD does not represent the best live sets of the DJs featured. For instance, DJ Static from Denmark, is excellent at dissing his opponents in DJ battles using his phrasing style but his cut on this CD is no way near his best routines he does at DJ battles such as ITF.Overall, a decent CD, however the selection of DJ tracks could have been more carefully made and why not fill up whole 74 min of the CDs?

The content is deep enough for a University audience and at a reasonable length to link to practical applications as well as leave your mind tinkering.

The shoulder strap seam separated and the strap was not usable. Samsonite would not exchange it or fix it and I was told that they didn't warranty the bag and that I had to send it back to the manufacturer. They did offer to take the bag back if I bought another bag for 20% off. Pay for 2 bags and get 1? I don't think so. I had the bag resewn at a shoe repair store. The bag is poor quality - it has no structure to it. I could buy a similar quality bag for half the price. Stay away from Samsonite bags. Buy from Wilson leather - I have for 20 years.

WPK saw military action, contrary to this arcticle. WPK was in fact appointed Collector of the Port of New Orleans by Lincoln--he signed the commission before heading to Ford's Theater that night.

The description of the main characters thoughts and feelings really helps the reader immerse himself in the story. This book has terrifying implications about life after death and the writing style of Blackwood carries these implications to the reader with a fear that is almost palpable. This book has probably been the best \\"horror\\" book I have read in years. I will agree that the ending was a little anticlimactic but will say that the author is right in his statement that the circumstances leading up to a horrific event are often more frightening than the event itself.

Wishbone is a dog who talks and goes on all sorts of adventures. This DVD includes four Wishbone episodes that deal with the classic stories of Don Quixote, Robin Hood, Journey to the Center of the Earth and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It is cute to see Wishbone dressed up and hear his voice. He is quite the adventurous dog! This is a cute DVD for the whole family to watch as it is not animated but rather a regular show.

All the episodes are good but THE IMPAWSSIBLE DREAM was incredible. I was so impressed with how much of the look and feel and highlights they got into the show that I got DON QUIXOTE from the library and read it!

When I first met this humble author in Dallas at her book signing, I thought her book and the cover was a little too racy for me. I WAS WRONG...Author Stell's writing skills are awesome. Her story Hood Rich is second to none. From the beginning of this novel, I was intrigued with the way she brought DeMarques Prince to life. From chapter one, I rooted for this young man. There were times when he frustrated me to the extent of fussing as I turned from page to page. He was a young man that experienced some real life issues that many of our youth in today's society deal with. This story was so realistic that I cried with Prince and for him.I read this novel in two days because I couldn't put it down.

As the young philosopher who loves her desperately tries to find and rescue her, he encounters treacherous friends and unlikely allies and learns more than he cares to about the despised Roman Christians.This is a mystery, but not a murder mystery. Hambly excels at re-creating the ambience and attitudes of ancient Rome. I didn't like the endless denigratory comments about Christians, but they were probably authentic to the time, as was the infighting. The story itself was fairly predictable, but the lively characters (mostly) kept the plotline moving along.

In fact, when the Pigs are whirling about in the air with their straw or wood houses, the Wolf is waiting on the ground with an open mouth. I don't recall all of this killing and eating in these stories when I was growing up.In Goldilocks, Goldilocks tips over Big Bear's porridge, breaks Baby Bear's chair, and makes an overall mess of things.

So far the book is based on one main example that attemps to cover too many points. Unfortunately the example has typos and doesn't compile - even using the downloaded code.

Sometimes he was very romantic, and other times, particularly when the subject of war came up, it seemed more like \\"Vicky who?\\" I also never understood how the relationship of Billy and Naddy progressed as it did...it just kind of happened. This wasn't a bad book, just not a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"We have four wonderful Wiggles DVDs (we even like the puppets on Yummy Yummy). I borrowed Big Red Car from the library today and it will be going back tomorrow. I once owned Sailing Around the World, but do not have it anymore. Let's just say I did not give it away to anyone else. At least half of the Big Red Car feature is composed of songs and skits by the Captain and his crew, very much like SATW, and those segments are just irritating. This gets 2 stars only because the first few songs actually feature the guys themselves with many songs we don't have already on our other DVDs. I will not rent, borrow, or buy this DVD again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY BAD MOVIE","review":"This movie is horrible. I just saw it the other day and all I have to say is that everyone on here who gave it a bad review is correct. I wish I listened and didn't buy Here Comes the Big Red Car. My kids didn't like it at all, and I can't say I blame them. This is the Wiggles at their worst. Save your money and time and skip this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Kids Hated This Movie","review":"This movie is terrible. We already have Dance Party, and the new video of the Wiggles lipsynching to their older songs did nothing to keep my kids' attention. They are usually glued to the older Wiggle DVDs but had no interest in this one. The extras are not good either. I give it 2 big thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"inferior","review":"These songs and skits lack the energy and artistry of the TV show and some of the other DVDs.

He was so excited when I brought home this DVD and he begged me to put it in the player. After about four songs he wasn't interested in it anymore and asked me to stop playing it.Other reviewers are right when they say it's a rehash of old songs. My son still loves Dance Party, which is basically the same songs on the Big Red Car but it was recorded in their earlier days as the Wiggles.Either the Wiggles are running out of new songs, or they should have renamed this one \\"The Wiggles, their greatest hits\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wiggles Haven't Done it Again!!","review":"The newest video in the Wiggles set \\"Here Comes the Big Red Car\\" is a disappointment. It is largely a rehash of earlier videos. I agree with the other reviews that the Wiggles have lost the originality, creativity, and enthusiasm of the earlier works. My son (2.5 years old) is addicted to the Wiggles so we continue to buy them, but they are going downhill. I fear they will not remain the kids \\"big thing\\" if they don't do some work.I hate it that the latest videos don't have the kids in them that they used to have. After all, this is a kid's video. They provided a fun innocence and way for kids to connect with kids that the grownups just can't provide. Furthermore, I am disappointed that the songs in this video are virtually all old ones. This is just not the same Wiggles that we have come to expect and love. Might want to stick with buying the older ones, less polished yes, better content absolutely."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Videos Ever","review":"We love watching the Wiggles Big Red Car....It is so cool to hear some songs from the Cochroaches from years back, those songs are quickly becoming our favorite!!!!I don't know anyone who would not like this movie!!!

She has been at a constant weight now for 2 years and we are hopeful that she will be able to move on past this disorder. Many of the other books tell you that the anorexic will always be anorexic, only this one gives you hope and helps you fulfull that dream.Don't buy any other books until you have read this one.

The so-called friends who flocked by invitation to her concert to relish an event of mockery were at least as much to blame as the poor woman herself for having encouraged such eccentric egocentricity.The whole matter stinks of making fun of a person afflicted by illness. What a cruel species we were - and still are."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BIOGRAPHY","review":"This book is a good biography of the Dodge City years and Tombstone affairs of both Wyatt and his brothers. I used to read many 'Landmark' editions in junior and senior high school so I assume this book to be primarily for young adults. No matter as it reads well. Can be read in one evening and yet those cow town and silver mining town years are well fleshed out.If you admire what Wyatt did against the cowboy lawless element in Tombstone you will enjoy this book. If as has become somewhat recently fashionable to disregard what Wyatt Earp was and stood for then maybe you will not. For me as always, Wyatt was a man to ride the river with. Doc Holliday got it right when he made his stand with Wyatt and his brothers.See you soon, amigos."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book in the world!","review":"Straight out of Microsoft's manuals, this book was obviously just a ploy for the authors to say \\"Look at me, I am published.\\" Wrox let us down with this one. Horrible index's proved to be as fun as a proctology exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough","review":"This book was a disappointment. Mostly it shows how to create packages using the Enterprise Mgr interface. I don't need a book to do that. Right now I am coding a VB app using DTS, and this book was definitely not enough. This is a beginner book, introductory in nature. There is an Object reference, but I can see that in the Object Browser. The examples are simplistic and not real-world. The examples on the SQL Server 2000 Resource Kit are better. I am moving large amounts of data data and have to deal with permissions, constraints, dependency tables -- none of this is covered. You can manipulate the object model thousands of ways; without any guidance on these advanced topics (not covered by MSDN) you are adrift... and your packages will fail every time.If you are a programmer, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not enough meat...","review":"Every time you think it's about to get good with this book, they cut you off and go on to some other topic.

Enough details of DTS are not supplied. For instance there are a number of annoyances with DTS that must be avoided using workaround that are mentioned nowhere in this book. Also more complicated subjects of DTS are merely skimmed through. This book is not good for beginner nor for professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for SQl power users that want to know about DTS","review":"I have been working on a project involving DTS and needed a firm grash of it. the book far from scaring me with all the technicalities and programming depth at the begining gradually introduced me to DTS and step by step with example showed me how to harness the power of DTS including the programming side it is the perfect book to introduce you to the subject and for self learner like me it succeed at opening your mind and pointing you to the right directionI 'll recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"No rush to judgment","review":"I am new to DTS and VB. This book was a big help in the early chapters. It got me using the basic DTS features. Now I'm up to page 308 and have just spent 1-1/2 hours keying in a VB example. It doesn't work. I went over the code; I've keyed it in as it is shown and it still doesn't work. I do not have the expertise to troubleshoot it. I'm beginning to have my doubts about the next 800 pages. Sorry, guys.

The index is incomplete, making it hard to find information. The examples as given probably won't work: no mention is given to fairly major problems like dealing with ActiveX scripts running in different threads.Very little useful guidance is given, especially to help get round DTS's flaws.And when I went for code it wasn't at the website.

This is one disorganized book. The authors like to jump around a lot.

This is extremely dis-orienting since you are trying to follow along with the wizard.I will post a complete review later."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WISH MICROSOFT WOULD BE AS INFORMATIVE","review":"Other reviewers of this book have stated that this book is informative, but could be improved. The book is too verbose. On the other hand, where are you going to get the very useful information it contains? The other efforts to expose DTS, based on the book reviews, are worse. To make a long story short, if you want to learn most of what DTS can do and how to use DTS, buy this book.

I can't wait until the authors come out with a more advanced version working with Classes and VB. Killer book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I don't understand where these other reviews are coming from. Surely anyone who has read this book knows that the writing is so poor that it takes hours to glean one tidbit of new knowledge.

This is partially true. However there is a group of people looking fror something more readable and illustrated that Microsoft's texts. This book has been addressed to professionals who probably have good access to current MSDN Library. Unfortunately, after comparison of some parts of book with original documentation I must say that the companion's documentation is better to read and complete (by definition). Examples presented in this book are sometimes the same as in library and no more. The style of explanation of some details is even worse than reading dry technical specifications. It is the waiste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is worth reading if you have a lot of time.","review":"This book tries to cover a lot of ground but does not do a decent job of explaining the material. The author does not write very well and sometimes it is easy to get lost between the lines. I often find myself still wondering what the author tries to say after reading (or pondering) a section for an hour. I think the author is very knowledgable (At least it seems) but he is not a good writer. I will say this book is perfect for someone who has a lot of time to waste. I wish I found a better book before I got this one. I also read Pofessional Dcom book by the same author and I still don't feel comfortable with the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one that I always wanted...","review":"This is the book I've been witing for, and finally got it.

I sleep so much better which means I'm full energy during the day but also experience a better sense of calmness, focus and what I call \\"happy peace\\".

The storyline was not as predictable as I thought, but the acting destroyed the movie for me; along with the cheesy special effects. Kane Hodder today's superstar boogeyman, was at least interesting to watch without a hockey mask or distorted makeup. The lead, Alison Brie, just isn't strong enough to carry the movie, particularly a bad one. Veteran Denise Crosby has done better work. Actually, she is the only good performance in the movie next to Hodder.I don't recommend this film. The explicit use of gore is used as a substitute for tension and interest from a shoddy script. The scenes with the heroine talking for the demonic baby are unintentionally campy and hilarious.I'm glad I rented it for only a buck. Otherwise, I would have felt really cheated.I gave it one star because Amazon has nothing lower. A total zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous!","review":"Reading about how a friendly gathering turned into a large gathering and then spun out of control into a massive deluge of people...walking around with toilet paper badges stuck w/ little gold stars is very funny.

I'm a huge fan of Gambale, but this is not his best.The audio isn't good. The guitar's volume is a little bit higher than necessary and irritant in some parts, overlaping details of others instruments. You can't hear all the dynamics from the snare drum, even in a hi-fi HT system like mine (onkyo+jbl).The tab booklet don't include a single solo. Only the boring and ultra easy harmonies.

I purchased this book because I had heard it was \\"funny\\" - well, it is most definitely NOT amusing. It is downright nasty most of the time, mean-spirited and petty the rest of it. It is certainly not the experience of myself and the other expats who I currently know actually live here. I have found the Dutch to be warm, funny, gracious, generous and completely unlike the parsimonious hypocrites depicted in the book. The authors should be ashamed of themselves. Don't buy this book - buy a ticket and get the real story yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like It That Much","review":"Maybe it's a generational thing but I was disappointed in the overly smark alecky approach of this book. It's also a little dated. That said, it IS tremendously informative if you can tolerate the excessive cutseyness and I did learn alot. However, I will be taking it along to my local book buyer because I don't want it and won't recommend it. I've just returned from my first visit so I've still got some very sweet feelings about the green heart of Holland and its wondrous history, courage, and 20 million tulips. Was in Amsterdam too, even for Queen's Day which was uproarious all around. This approach doesn't seem that humorous too me and I think if I were to live there, it might hurt my feelings. As I say, could be a generational thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of rubbish","review":"The authors of this book demonstrate their arrogant Amsterdam way of life. Their image of Dutch culture is as correct as Brooklyn or the Bronx are for the USA. Take one small piece of not so flattering society and compare it to the rest of the country. Of course you can find similarities, but that's all they are. I have lived in Holland for 40 years, so I might say I'm an expert. This book does not reflect an image of our rich Dutch culture, but is simply one large pile of negative rubbish. I invite anyone to visit the Netherlands ( not just Amsterdam) to see for themselves how great a small nation really can be. How resourceful and helpful the Dutch people really are.

It's just a very tongue-in-cheek description of this beautiful country. It reminded me of all the customs/traditions this nice country has.It also reminded me how easily I've accepted their customs/traditions and also their quirks.Only item I would like to comment is that I live in a small town. Some passages in the book apply to the big cities in the Randstad (Amsterdam, Den Haag, Rotterdam and, to a certain extent, to Utrecht) only.A very Dutch \\"doei\\" (bye)."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's much better out there","review":"The authors are so eager to be funny and serious, they end up failing on both counts.

There are many Dutch people who are very kind and open and most of them actually have read this book and think that it is well-written and humoristic. I do not think so.It is very simple to laugh at the Dutch, since they are welcoming, friendly and polite and have their own national pride. Therefore, they will not take it serious. But this is the easiest way to approach their culture. So easy, as perceiving Amsterdam as a city that is dominated by coffee-shops, drugs and legal prostitution and not also the city influenced Anne Frank's diary and Rembrandt's work. Unfortunately, this book continues this superficial (and for even offensive) view on the Dutch culture and society, putting a basis for the Ex-pats favourite behaviour of \\"laugh at the Dutch as much as you can\\", rather than \\"learn from their liberalism, culture and society\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indeed, there's better stuff out there","review":"As a dutch expat, this book was given to me by friends as a joke. I read it, and was severely disappointed. As has been stated before, the authors try so hard to be funny and give an accurate description of the Dutch, that they fail on both accounts. I did laugh on occasion, but all in all I found this book pretty pathetic. I don't mind at all looking at my own country with critical eyes, as long as the information is correct. Unfortunately, in this book, it isn't.The Low Sky (Han van der Horst) is much better at describing the Dutch. So, if you're really interested in Dutch culture, by that book.If you are looking for a book to tell you something about where to go and what to see while in Amsterdam, buy the Lonely Planet.For those among you who read Dutch books: Retourtjes Nederland by Simon Kuper.

It is quite simply another example of the British (authors are Brits) making themselves sound superior to everyone else. While the material may be accurate, the attitude does not lend itself to humor--unless you enjoy humor at the expense of another culture.A much better and infinitely funnier book is, \\"My 'Dam Life\\" by Sean Condon. This memoir by an Australian expat living in Amsterdam covers much of the same material and enlightens about Dutch culture but is well edited. It is rife with imagery that will not soon be forgotten; imagery woven into hilarious narratives on topics such as Queen's Day, housing difficulties, bicycles, and not surprisingly Holland's flat landscape. How flat is it? It is so flat...\\"that when you look toward Belgium you can see a man on a step ladder waving...\\" Now that's funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Don't Know The Dutch?","review":"This is the only good book I've read about Dutch life. No other book has been able to give an insider's view of the Dutch as well as \\"The UnDutchables\\". The authors have both lived in the Netherlands for a considerable amount of time, so they know what they're talking about when it comes to the Dutch. The book covers topics such as: Money, A Dutch Home, Children, the Dutch work ethic, Politics, The Dutch Language and Sex 'N Drugs And Rock \\"n Roll. It gives us a picture of the Dutch as they are; it tells about their odd and peculiar habits as well as their admirable ones. Many of the Dutch people who have read the book found themselves laughing and agreeing with the authors' perceptions. I think the book is great. You will definitely have a great time getting to know those crazy Netherlanders; and you don't have to be in a hash bar to enjoy this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Going to Holland-Think twice","review":"This book presents a view of the Dutch character, behavior and motivations in clear cheerful language.It would be vitally important to anybody visiting Holland for business,study or any length of time.It is specific about many aspects of life,customs and expectations which makes it very useful. After having read many books about people's experiences in France and Italy, this book makes me realize that the peoples of the countries of Europe are very different from each other. This book is also interesting as anthropology.

But, you don't have to agree with me, or even know who he is to enjoy this book. Izzard takes you from his life as a child to his adult life and the hard and funny times being a transvestite entails. He talks about everything, letting you relate to everyday situations that you wouldn't normally think are funny. The writing style makes you think Izzard is right there reading this book to you, as he rambles from idea to idea, skipping back and forth, always ending at a laugh out loud punchline. You will laugh so hard the people around you will ask you what you are reading. Just tell them its the funniest man on the face of this earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dress to Kill only slightly wounds","review":"I was expecting a biography, but in fact the books is a sort of written version of Eddie's onstage ramblings. The chatty, slang-filled and unfocused style makes him seem much less intelligent and more self-indulgent than he really is. The photographs are also a bit of a disappointment, since they make a leap from childhood/adolescence to the period of the Dress to Kill performance, with nothing in between. The most recent photos seem to mostly be casual snapshots of him wandering the streets of New York and San Francisco. Eddie Izzard is a genius in his craft, brilliantly perceptive, and a great humanitarian. Someone of his substance and uniqueness deserves a better record of his life and career. One can only hope that one will come later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This album initiated keak da sneaks fall off.

In fact, my son once decorated cookies and accidentally dropped the tip down the disposal... and it came out scratched but without dents or bends in it! The tips clean out easily with hot water and a little scrub brush, and they stack neatly on their little pegs in the case.

Messy, inconsistent and really difficult to work with. It is unable to handle any impurities in the oil (such as garlic or pepper bits) since they will clog the spray nozzle making it a ($) non-recyclable garbage item.

I had the white one and also a stainless finished one. On both, the black band around the middle began coming off on my hands.Worse, though, on both of mine the chamber cracked around the edge, making it impossible to pressure the spray.

Then pieces fell off. Then it leaked all over my cupboard.Bye-bye, Misto! Into the trash with you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two years and running","review":"This gadget works well if you do not overfill it. The MISTO website says to put no more than 1/3 cup of oil in it. We made the mistake of putting too much oil in at first and it would only \\"stream\\" oil for a month or so. We thought it was a terrible device until the oil got down to the level where it should be. I'm guessing most of the unhappy reviews here are because of this problem. Now that we know this is the issue, it sprays wonderfully! We're going to get another one for canola."},{"rating":"2","title":"See the Misto Website for Detailed Care Information","review":"Several reviewers have complained about performance of the Misto. It does need regular cleaning. The more highly unsaturated the oil you use, the quicker the spray valve will clog with oxidized, polymerized oil.

Well, this morning, my Misto exploded while I was using it to make pancakes (periodically spraying the pan during the process). Luckily, no one was hurt, but there is a dent in my kitchen ceiling where the top hit it, upon being expelled from the base with great force. I would estimate the BANG that accompanied the explosion was 85-90 decibels. I will definitely not buy another Misto based on today's explosion, but even before this, I was rather ho-hum about the product anyway. My advice: save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one star","review":"If I could rate this product less than one star I would. I bought one of these for spraying olive oil for cooking. It doesn't spray so much as it shoots out a stream of oil. I'm considering using it for a self defense device - simply spray a stream of olive oil in the perps face!

First the glue failed where the top part of the pump tube attaches to the metal top.

To my disapointment, I'm sorry to say, MISTO performed much worse. The purported power pump produced only one or two fine sprays at best; but often, there was no spray at all, or only a lame spurt. I was shocked, as my plain plastic bottle, which has no pump per se--only a plain conical pump nozzle--sprays better and better the emptier the bottle gets. I think you can get one at a hair salon products store for less than a buck. I also tried an oil sprayer recycled from a nontoxic suntan oil bottle, but it worked poorly as well, only spurting, not misting.

I remember that my first SERIOUS contact with electronic music was the AMP TV show, via cable television, way back to 1996. In south america, just like in the U.S. the fresh new sound of the AMP TV show captivated a lot of people like me. And just like in the U.S., here in Colombia, finding good quality electronic music was a lot harder than now...So when this CD came out, I ordered it in a music store that worked with imports, and WOW... even now after six years, few discs on my collection have the ammount of quality that this one has. It has the biggest artists in electronic music, as well as some of their most famous tracks. Of course, this cd may not appeal to the \\"bang-bang-boom-boom\\" techno-fans, because every track on this album is pure flowing style. Real quality. Buy it NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old collection....","review":"If you're going to review this disc, you have to look at its release date. Yep, 1997. It came out only one month after the Chem Bros \\"Dig Your Own Hole\\". While the songs on here might be overplayed now, they were brand new when AMP came out. And for us Americans, AMP was just about the best electronic collection out there at the time. Yeah yeah, it's just MTV trying to capitalize on a new trend (at the time) but it's still good music. And it gave people who bought it just for BRB a chance to hear other really good, but not quite as popular, songs. It was the first time I'd heard Aphex Twin, Photek, and Underworld (forgive me, i'm American, and it was 1997) and after this, the Richard D. James Album and Second Toughest in the Infants were the next albums I bought.

Underworld's \\"Pearl's Girl\\" still melts my cortex with its synth line that ebbs like amniotic fluid. The tracks by Photek and Apex Twin are still great abstract electronica(see the Mille Plateaux label for further excursions.) There are also some overproduced misfires like the Chemical Brothers remix of \\"Voodoo People and the Chrystal Method's work that sounds like Musak for future \\"extreme sports\\" commericals(whoops! it did.)Overall, Amp marks a time when MTV had this brief period of innovation before the advent of the Boy Bands and Total Request Live."},{"rating":"2","title":"LONG!","review":"It's a little bigger than what I expected, but the battery lasts for about six hours on my laptop.

It talks about who pays, how to select a band, registering for gifts, and things like having a buffet or sit-down dinner. It didn't give pros or cons or advice on anything, really. Basically, it said to do whatever you want, just read the contract before signing on the dotted line. It also stated that if you want to wear white, do it, and don't let anyone tell you can't.

No way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasing novel with a few small gaps, otherwise terrific","review":"This is my first experience with Mallon, and he doesn't disappoint. Owosso, Michigan is filled with everyday people living lives full of everyday intrigue, brought to a head under the pressure of a historical rush that is anything but everyday. The cocksure hype and buildup to the obvious and perfect conclusion gives way to the hard reality that life doesn't always make sense, and that the simplest choice isn't always the easiest to make. Mallon could have done more to develop the interaction between Anne, the protagonist, and Peter Cox, the \\"psuedo\\"-antagonist.

I don't remember much except that Tyne Daly, despite clear devotion to the role, has a voice that, to my ears, sounds weak, forced and occasionally off-key. Supporting cast members are so-so. This must be a very difficult role to sing, as even Roberta Peters falls flat (despite some exceptionally interesting interpretation). In my opinion, Patty Lupone's rendition is the best of the recent revivals, but Ethel Merman is still \\"The Mama\\" (after all these years)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive \\"Mama Rose\\"","review":"Tyne Daly is absolutely perfect in the role created for the brash belter, Ethel Merman. I personally find Merman's songs empty and hollow. But Tyne's renditions of this powerful and popular score are phenomenal. Her \\"Rose's Turn\\" is simply the best ever. It beats out Bernadette Peters' and Angela Lansbury's versions. Her voice was hoarse and coarse when this CD was recorded because she was very ill at the time. So this album is not a true mirror of what her performance was. But even through her illness, you get the emotion and pain in Rose's songs. Absolutely Perfect! As long as you don't mind the sound of Tyne's \\"sick\\" voice, which is only bad in certain spots, I say get this recording.Gypsy Recordings to Buy:1. Tyne Daly2. Bernadette Peters3. Angela Lansbury4. Ethel Merman5. Bette Midler's TV movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Second Worse \\"Gypsy\\" Recording","review":"Tyne Daly's \\"Gypsy\\" used to be the worst recording of this glorious musical. But records are meant to be broken and the bottom of the barrel was lowered considerably by Bernadette Peters and company. Okay, let's ignore the rare Kay Medford LP because it's a travesty. As long as the perfect Original Broadway Cast recording is still easily available, there is no reason to get another recording of \\"Gypsy\\" unless you want the fun of comparing other stars to the glorious Ethel Merman. That said, I hope there will be a Patti LuPone recording because she has the vocal heft to carry it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"The worst performance of Mama Rose ever recorded. Have seen amatuer productions of Gypsy where the leading lady was better than Daly. Though she is an accomplished and talented actress, this was a huge mistake. She CAN'T sing it.

Get Lansbury's recording for the definitive version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Her!!!","review":"I gave it one star because you can't give things zero stars. Tyne Daly can't sing at all. Who directed this revival they should be shot for cast Tyne Daly. She's nothing compared to Ethel Merman, Angela Lansbury, Bette Midler and Bernadette Peters! She sounds breathy and as if she's forcing the notes out of her mouth. She sings from her nose and throat. Why do some of you people think she can sing? Have you heard no better. This recording makes me ill."},{"rating":"1","title":"whoever told Tye Daly she could sing did it as a joke","review":"and she believed them. It was a tragic year on Broadway when this show opened. It only won awards by default. She doesn't even understand the role as is apparent in Rose's Turn. I saw it live and then heard the disc elsewhere. (Would NEVER have bought it.)

Not predictable and the ending a surprize."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful well-written novel","review":"The Violin Player ranks as a powerful story, well told. John Knoerle creates an atmosphere of dread, anticipation, excitement, panic, and fear... I often found myself having to look up from the book just to catch my breath and assure myself that it was \\"just a story\\". It reads like a grainy, black and white movie where you can see just enough detail to be afraid - but never the whole picture, like the original \\"Nosferatu\\", or Stephen King's \\"Thinner\\". Large amounts of research and the hard work of word selection add to the story, imagery and feel of the novel.I enjoyed how Knoerle made a Jaguar automobile a character as well - but that is a guy thing. Read this to be in on a new author and a story-telling roller-coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed........","review":"The Violin Player was an epic read. The ambiance of Chicago as only a resident can define. Indiana, Kentucky and Wisconsin were refreshing reminders of the great cultural differences yet so close geographically.How many family tragedies and horrible secrets? Knoerle loses no time in captivating the reader with weight of the City and the burden placed on the main character.When the antagonist interjects his twisted reality it is humorous, logical and disturbing. Artfully delivered without the unnecessary girth.Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far The Most Detailed View of the U","review":"This film has it all.

Jeff Berlin is a replacement bass player who is on this CD because the other non-Squire bassist broke his leg. His bass sounds terrible. Seriously, it sounds ridiculous.

It's an action drama with a decent degree of intrigue and some nice comic moments. Rachel Sheppard is a cutie who could be the next darling of the Franco set. Lina Romay looks and acts vicious as the chief female baddie. Even Linnea Quigley is in this. She's looks great and does a fine job in an remarkably straight dramatic role. One Shot Productions delivers a few nice extras on the DVD too with some rough but interesting behind the scenes bits. Even if you hate Franco, and plenty of us do, you could do worse that this interesting potboiler about an ex-patriate writer (Sheppard) returning to her native country on a book tour only to be kidnapped and swept up in a plot of political assassination.

Like, say, being able to ride a horse that refuses anyone but Alec Ramsey, often to the point of attacking them.And, of course, the main character always falls madly in love with her.Pam was a weak device, and even as a girl growing up, hoping I would stop growing so I could be a jockey, I thought she was rather pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great one","review":"If you are a fan of the Black Stallion series, you may notice that this book is different. In all of the others, Alec and The Black have a unique bond that no one understands. In my opinion, it should be kept that way. Here, the girl can ride The Black, and Alec is obsessed with her. I recommend readers to read all of the series except this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome book, nust read!","review":"This book is one of the best of the Black Stallions series. I liked Pam because she relaxed Alec and he really needed it. Pam was also nice because she had a carefree way and nothing scared her.

His knowledge of literature is evident in his satrical look at some of the most well known English literature.

It's also the closest thing most readers will ever get to experiencing what exactly goes on behind the scenes during the reporting of a war. I should know. I've covered 8 wars over the last 20 years. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the media, the egos involved and how the quest for face-time and the love of live shots distorts the news. I'd also recommend this for anyone who wants to be drawn into an intriguing story about a dashing guy looking for love in all the wrong places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gosh, a real writer about the Gulf War!","review":"Considering the amount of propaganda about the first Gulf War, and the current invasion of Iraq, Mr. MacFarquhar's writing is impressive. There's not simply one reporter at a major event, but dozens. His writing gives a real sense of the organized chaos and infighting that occurs; both on the part of the military and the press.Since satellite television provides instant communication, the requirement by the military and the press to provide a balance between adequate reporting and advising the enemy of their successes becomes a real tightrope. The author illustrates this requirement very well.His sideplot concerning Thea is well-intentioned, but misplaced. The author was trying to show that even reporters have personal lives; no question about that, but somehow the balance is not achieved. It may be that the author is more comfortable writing about reporting than personal relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good anecdotes but barely a novel.","review":"This book sounded great but it soon was apparent that the spine of it -- the reporter's romance with a TV babe -- was clumsy and lacking in chemistry. Obvious targets, such as the Pentagon's managing of the press, the press' boorishness and silliness, (especially broadcast talent) and the shallowness of TV coverage versus that of print coverage are thoroughy worked over. The overall story is episodic and repetitve, and beyond an occasional glimpse into oddities of Saudi soicety, and bits that reveal a new angle on the military, this is repetitive and lacking in insight. Relationships tend to be one-note and dry. The prose is often flat-footed. Worth perusing for some nuggets but as a whole it's got almost no story and offers not much beyond what a good news watcher/reader would have absorbed during the first Gulf War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying!!!","review":"This humorous little book, has accurate information - and you'll find a ton of things that are true, but you haven't heard of before!A \\"must read\\" for anyone who has a dog, or is planning to own one.

I use it both to confirm my own observations and to learn about unfamiliar breeds. It has never failed to both educate and entertain. It begins with basic information on how to live successfully with canines. I like that Halliburton gives very accurate insights on negative traits of specific breeds and how to deal with them, including proper training of the Human. Unfortunately, some breeds are unrepresented, like my flat-coated retriever. I was, however, able to obtain a good description from the information on Newfies and Irish setters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Behind the times, and so wrong about many breeds!","review":"The author misquotes so many origins of breeds and misnames so many breeds, her credibility with the reader is immediately suspect.I felt the suggestions were very outdated.

This DVD allows for optional read/sing along, which if used, enhances each of the individual presentations immensely. All of my kids enjoy the DVD, but it's particularly great for patriotic learning occasions (as mentioned by another reviewer). The full length Aretha version of the Star Spangled Banner is alone worth the price! Remember that the read/sing-a-long version must be chosen from \\"extras\\" on the dvd menu since it is not the default mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with this DVD. I was hoping for a fun way to learn about the states, but this DVD is not it. The other stories that accompany it are set to music that is difficult to listen to.

I expected more from a Scholastic product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of Their Best","review":"The first illustrated story about the scrambled states keeps your interest, but the two other illustrations are totally musical, the songs are too long, and get boring. Doesn't hold your interest. Not one of Scholastics' better videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good listening music","review":"Dark, slick and sophisticated drum n bass, Modus Operandi would have made a great accompaniment to the first Dirty Harry movie. A soundtrack of suspense and cool atmospherics. As one would expect from what I presume is called \\"minimalist\\" drum n bass, there are no real songs to speak of; no vocals either for that matter. Just a pitter-patter of snare, hi-hat and bass drum, a bass and the odd synth pad, sketching the scene of a New York City streetscene late at night. . Although this would appear to be low-key enough to qualify as ambient, oddly enough this is music that needs to be listened to. And it is in fact a really splendid record that is receiving heavy rotation at home. Just four or five tracks at a time, mind you. A little of this stuff goes a long way.If you like this then I would recommend Surgeon for more upbeat fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy must have a microchip instead of a brain","review":"I have given this album many many chances and have owned it almost two years, and it pains me to say that it just isn't very impressive. There is a block of tracks in the middle that are just undistinguished, making me agree with one insightful critic who wrote that this album was as exciting as \\"a tofu milkshake.\\" The way Photek makes his own drum sounds and beats is very impressive, but the tracks themselves are so repetitive that if you try to play this in the background or just sit and listen to it, you become very conscious of how boring it is--maddeningly boring. This album sounds like it was made for a computer, by a computer. Someone inject a small spark of life into this! Photek proves he can really do a good job of remixing other people's tracks, but too much of his work is about as exciting as watching bark peel off a tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just BORING!","review":"I hate not to like this CD. No matter how many times I play it I just can't get into the music like I can with Juno Reactor or Orbital. The tracks seem stale and repetative, also not much happens with the music. It's all the same stuff over and over again with nothing new in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark hard minimal jungle","review":"Photek's \\"Modus Operandi\\" is a great experimental, minimal drum and bass. Photek creates dark backgrounds and has deep dark basslines or enormous punding bass drums down low. On top he brings in hard snappy snares and toys around with little rhythmic glitches of the break beat. As is with most minimal electronic, this recording is very exciting when listened to in depth, but appears dull and repetive when not focused on. If you like this look in E Z ROLLERS or another Photek release, Form and Function."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek, black-cold yakuza-style drum-n-bass","review":"Slithering in underneath the tiles of the dancefloor like the shadows of a ninja, Rupert Parkes (aka Photek), constructs every single beat and drum phrase here word for word not using any samples at all as most jungle producers often do. So you can imagine the incredible degree of production quality and skill in creating this masterpiece of technical wizardry. In spite of all this, unlike any other of the Metalheadz producers, Parkes' music is not immediately danceable and not likely to outdo the popularity of Aphrodite or Mickey Finn's jump-up anthems anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very smooth","review":"Although I usually preffer more energetic D&B this album really caught me by surprise. The beats are so precise and well executed. I really enjoyed the amount of control that Photek had over the music. Don't go in thinking this will be dieselboy or DJ DB because it's not. It's an entirely different beast. It's a bit more along the lines of Polygon Window mixed with Amon Tobin's walls of sound. It's a really great album to relax and read to. Some of the tracks can be a bit stale but most of them are pretty great, especially track one (it's my fav)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oliver's Review","review":"A pretty good album overall.

The most basic of human rights is surely the right to control one's own consciousness, and as long as the hypocritical 'war on drugs' continues to be senselessly waged, we need informational resources like this to enlighten the sleepwalking masses. In a truly free society, such a policy clearly has no place. The 'guns' aspect of 'Guns and Weed' is equally enlightening.

Because, in addition to having JT's commonly available hits, like Aqualung, Locomotive Breath, and so forth, this album features lesser known cuts, like Fat Man, Rainbow Blues, and Nothing Is Easy.

Dracula is accidently revived and reeks havoc on two visiting couples. The sets and costumes are vibrant and catching. The biggest problem with the film is that Christopher Lee does not speak, it does not matter who they are or how good he was in the first film, growling and hissing only go so far. By not giving Lee any lines, this film started out as sub-par and could not hope to dig itself out of the hole. The film does have some interesting action scenes leading to the climax, but the conclusion is very flimsy and hokey. This is a film that eventually falls short of it's mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Dracula Sequals","review":"This is a great old fashioned horror film.

This was the last Hammer Dracula I needed to add to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Lee is the best","review":"Thanks to British bloke Christopher Lee, the vampire has never been portrayed more effectively or more frighteningly on film. 'Dracula, Prince of Darkness' is his first to be released on DVD and happily one of his better outings. The script isn't as effective as his previous 'Horror of Dracula', but the atmosphere is more eerie and the pace is more measured. It's a shame that today's fantasy-horror filmmakers rely far more on violence and gory special effects rather than good acting and storytelling to tell a spooky tale. It least we have the great fright classics of the past to look back on. But Lee is what really makes the film special, even if he does have no lines to speak. Great camerawork by Michael Reed and exciting music by James Bernard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, but still the Best","review":"Though many consider \\"Horror of Dracula\\" the best, this film was more richly filmed, Lee's absence of lines made him more inhuman and menacing (as a vampire should be, unlike Ann Rice's lame all-too-human vampires), it had Bernard's rich score, and had very atmospheric directing. If the story seemed very basic, bear in mind that all Hammer films were basically stretched out short stories meant to create an impression rather than tell an intricate story filled with sub-plots. The demise of Dracula in the icewater was rather unspectacular in relation to the film's earlier build-up, however, and Peter Cushing's absence kept this from being the best one of Hammer's Dracula films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dracula Returns","review":"In 1895 two english couples on a trip in the Carpathians find themselves stranded at an eerie castle.

I mean seriously does anyone own a rifle that helped produce this movie? while the print from Anchor Bay is a very good print, one of the better prints in the Hammer Film Library on dvd it's a shame the movie could live up to the print.If your a Hammer Horror Fan you'll muddle through it because it's part of the Hammer Dracula Series however it doesn't hold a candle to Horror of Dracula or Taste the blood Dracula."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH??","review":"I never recieved this product???

Out of this he tries to sort out the \\"why\\" of his \\"Friend the Artist's\\" death.This exploration is carried out with brillant images - images of the emotional content of colors, dream images of three people sharing a continuous costume, and the boy's litany of \\"why's\\".

He brings to these two sonatas much subtlety of inflection and a lovely, balanced tone. His technique is exceptional, but he never goes in for displaying it at the expense of musicality. He never pounds out his Schubert, unlike the always stimulating Mitsuko Uchida, for example. Rather, there is a musical, song-like flow throughout his interpretations. In D. 850, the one pianist on CDs that Goode reminds me of is Emil Gilels. His slow movements bring out the distinction made in an essay by Alfred Brendel, that while Beethoven is an architect, Schubert is a sleepwalker. Again and again, passages of drama or of doubt are resolved in a way that seems totally natural and surprisingly inevitable. The sound engineering on this disc is full if a little dry. No matter whose Schubert you've heard, Richard Goode's is likely to be totally rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great pair","review":"5 stars because of these great 2 sonatas.I had this on tape once so i had to get it again.But it sounds great.The games are my favorites. here.He plays these perfectly.This is another rare CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Popcorn and a Good Overall Value for the Cost","review":"After converting our underground basement into a home theater, one of the final touches to make this project complete was a Antique Popcorn Machine.

The design is an A+. But the materials make it an F. The problem is that the pear-shaped bulb on the top, and the tube that the bulb screws into, are made of a very soft metal. The threads (both the male and female threads) rapidly strip out, leaving the bulb loose in its socket. This is quite bad because the bulb is heavy - about half a pound - and will crack your countertop, hurt your foot, or put a big dent in your oak floor (this last, in my case) when it wobbles off. You can try to postpone this problem by wrapping the threads in tape but the softness of the metal makes failure inevitable. It's a discard. Umbra, if you improve the metal, you could solve the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks better than it is","review":"This towel holder looks nice but it has two fatal flaws.1 - you have to unscrew the top to fit the roll on the stem, and screw it back on. Doesn't sound like much but it is annoying and tedious.2 - it does not hold the roll tightly, so when you go to tear off a piece, it spins.If it wasn't so inconvenient, I'd send it back, but for the price, I'll send it to Goodwill and somebody will at least have an upright spot to put their paper towels.Umbra usually makes good stuff, but I went back and got my old plastic holder out of the trash because while unpretty, it does the ob better on all counts than this one.

His complete control over 3 different bamboo flute sizes, the inscrutable intricacies of South Indian rhythm and melody, and - what I love best - his use of SILENCE between phrases, creates an atmosphere of reflective calm, alternating with emotional intensity.

The only thing I don't like is the storage idea of keeping the \\"flower nails\\" in the plastic container. They are almost impossible to keep in place when you close the lid.Finally I put a piece of tape on each side to hold them in so I could close the storage container. You can either order pastry bags (which you then have to wash) or you can use those resealable bags. They work perfectly. Simply insert a tip in the corner of the plastic and wrap a piece of tape around the top of tip and plastic bag. It will hold in place well and you can toss the bag later.~The Rebecca Review"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"They are very good, but you have to be carefull for not leaving water to them because they get rusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, Good set","review":"This is a great price for this set but I don't think the quality is as good as the Ateco version.

This was the worst, most disappointing season ever. Monica became the shrill, silly and nagging wife-to-be of Chandler, whose face, in this season, looks strangely mechanical. Compare Chandler in # 7 to the character in past seasons: where is the sarcasm, the quick wit, the all-around humor? Is it any wonder that this season was the lowest rated one on TV out of all ten? The plots were boring, the actors seemingly uninterested.Don't throw away your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friends the complete 7th season","review":"Great to watch again, lots of fun, we all enjoy watching a few episodes in the evening, the kids think it's hillarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" Friends \\" will be there for you","review":"I first started watching Friends at the end of the third season and have been hooked ever since. The seventh season is by far one of my favorites, my all time favorite episode is \\" The One With Chandler's Dad.\\" It is the one show that my mother and I can agree to watch. My Thursday nights were booked for watching Friends until its untimely end last season. The charecters are all independant of each other but don't seem to do their best work unless they are all together. The plot lines are not an impossibilty and do to some extent happen to everyday people. So what if some see them as yuppie Manhattenites, someone has to be. In the end Friends is a great show to watch, no matter what you think you will find yourself laughing at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great season","review":"This season of Friends was very funny and entertaining.

It was better than the entire series-run of Fraiser! There was actually a glimmer of hope that Ross and Rachel might get back together but they turned it into a 'false-alarm' One of my most fav episodes will have to be TOW They All Turn 30. It showed a little more mature them (except for Joey. Childish as usual) and flashbacks of Monica, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and Ross' birthdays. Although my most favorite 'SCENE' would have to be from TOW Joey's New Brain where Ross plays his bagpipe to Monica, Chandler, Rachel and Phoebe. It was the funniest, and you could see Jen cracking up while Phoebe sang (or more 'screeched' along) with the bagpipe. And I always like wedding days in sitcoms, because there'll always be problems involved. If you want to laugh your head off, then you just have to buy this season of Friends.A reviewer with the heart to know-Penny (May even become a future critic!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Friends is a classic sitcom","review":"The later seasons might not have quite the same quirky 90s charm, but we still love all of our Friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still funny!","review":"Although the first few seasons can never be matched, the show is still churning out laughs in year seven.

Amazon needs to pay some important attention to detail with this UnBox player. It does not function well on Dell with Windows 7 operating system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited down content","review":"I was disappointed in this download as the episodes are not complete and have been edited for some reason. I've compared episodes downloaded with the DVD-versions. Though comparisons won't be necessary for die hard fans such as myself. A good scene to analyze is 'Joey's New Brain'. In the DVD version, after Ross attributes his romantic dry spell to the winter weather and the fact that there are fewer people on the street, Rachel gives him an exaggerated eye wink. This wink has been cut from the streaming version. This may seem a small issue to most, but friends of Friends know these non-verbal exchanges between characters are a big part of the series.Passive fans may be satisfied with the dumbed down content, but true fans will be left wanting.Other negative points include the facts that there are no 'Extras' as are available on the DVD, nor are you able to play the entire season (each episode must be prompted to play separately)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst season until then...","review":"Fans tend to be totally biased towards their favorite shows. FRIENDS is not differente. To rate this season five stars is a real absurd! This is where something \\"cracked\\": the histories are simply not so good, the plot are sometimes indeed BAD.

It was downright awful. I challenge any Friends fanatic to watch season 7 and not notice a drastic difference in Perry's delivery. Awful. Simply atrocious.

It's simply third-rate pablum masquerading as comedy. The characters are cloying, empty, and hardly funny. The writing is predictable. The stories are dumb. It says a lot about our culture that people actually watch this show in any numbers.

Highly recommended listening for anyone not afraid of the unexpected, or the unknown."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing confrotation of the worlds of hardcore and jazz.","review":"John Zorn is a sort of enigma to most people. Prior to actually finding a Zorn record I had heard of him only in passing. When I did actually plop down my hard earned sheckles I found something that was far more deserving of a full blown holiday than a mention in passing. John Zorn may be one of the greatest improv artists of our time and should certainly be placed in the ranks of Miles, Coletrane, Parker, and Monk. The album Naked City for instance is a Harcore/Grind/Jazz/Movie Theme catastophy of which may very well cause you to not only change the way you listen to music but buy every John Zorn album soon after you listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly The Best Experimental Jazz Record Ever Made.....","review":"There really isn't much you can say but totally unpredictable and absolutely ingenius from start to finish.

Not that large budget films are guarantees of excellence, but they have a much better track record over the last 10 years than their low budget counterparts in the zombie genre. Meat Market is one such example of a bad low budget film. It has a promising enough storyline, but the effects are bad as is the acting. It tries to be a quirky Night of the Living Dead but can't pull it off. At the end of the credits, there is an unbelievable threat against anyone who'd dare illegally copy the film.

On a higher note it stays in tune and sounds better than the $300 Martin and Taylor alternatives which are made froNvery thin wood resulting in dull sounds.

I found myself laughing at some of the dialogue and acting in this. It was just so horribly funny. The weirdest thing I found about this film was the fact that Backstreet Boys star, A.J. McLean is in this. He plays the guy that goes insane when he has flashbacks of when he was a kid. Man, I have no idea what that A.J. mofo was doing with this movie, but I can see why he doesn't act anymore. So now all he has to do is STOP SINGING!

So I actually cancelled my appointment for today and purchased clairol semi permanent color - for the obvious reason - to ensure that I liked the color.Well, the clove color (24) is significantly darker that how it looks on the box. My hair was light brown to start out - now it looks like a fake black/brown color. So, I ran out to the store and bought the light golden brown color (11) - and tried that - same night. But now I have dark dark brown with red highlights. So I washed my hair 4 times and the color is starting to look like dark brown.I still have 7 hours left to sleep, shower again and get ready for work, but I think I am stuck with this color for a few weeks. I really wished I had not tried this color and just gone straight to Loreal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color looks a darker red than on the box","review":"I colored my hair with Natural Instincts Cinnaberry (I usually use Spiced Tea I found later), and though my hair is shiny and healthy, it looks an unnatural red, almost burgundy in color. I did not do a strand test because I thought it was the red color I usually use. Clairol tried to help me by telling me to put NI's Hazelnut over it, but now it's just darker with the ruby red color still showing over all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does exactly the opposite of it's promise","review":"If I could give it zero stars I would. It claims to add shine and brighten but not lighten. I got absolutely no shine or brightness, my hair was actually duller after using this product. And it did lighten my hair considerably. I did not want to change my haircolor, yet I had people asking me why I got it lightened/highlighted. So, what I got rather than the promise was dull lackluster bleached hair the texture of straw. I have been growing it out for almost a year to try to get rid of the damage that one of these treatments did. You can pick out the regrowth line from a mile away and it looks insane in a messy pony or bun since the ends are a completely different color and texture than the hair they are laying against. This might be OK if it were the look you were going for, but it wasn't the look I was going for and it wasn't what the product advertised to do. If you value your hair, I would avoid this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note: positive reviews are NOT for Shine Happy","review":"I don't know why reviews for all Natural Instincts products are grouped together, but I wish I'd looked closely enough to see that the reviews for Shine Happy are overwhelmingly negative--separately, Shine Happy would probably get an average 1-1/2 star at best, and for good reason. Who wouldn't like their hair a little shinier, right? So wishful thinking and misplaced trust persuaded me to try this, even as I was thinking, \\"It contains peroxide. What does peroxide do? Lighten and damage hair.\\" Well...yup. My hair was virgin and seldom even blow-dried so in great condition, medium/light brown with natural dark blond highlights. This lightened my hair half a shade (not what I was looking for, but at least it's not orange) but took all the shine away. In fact, because it's significantly duller now, any color lift is offset so my hair doesn't look blonder, just much unhealthier. Great. Fingers crossed that I won't have a root line. What a terrible product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the \\"new and improved\\" version","review":"I used Roasted Chestnut color for years. It lasted forever and never dried out my hair. I didn't think there would be a difference in the color or how long it last with the new \\"improved\\" version. I was very sadly mistaken. First, the new version did not cover up all my gray, and I don't have that much, yet. The old version did. Second, the new version doesn't even last a week. And even when I use the 2 week touch up, it only lasted a few days. I am so disappointed that Clairol changed the chemistry of their Natural Instincts line. It used to be a great product. I can't find a similar hair color like this one. And I have gone to the salon to get my hair colored and I still like the old Roasted Chestnut color the best. I'm sad that I won't be able to use it anymore, VERY SAD. I just loved that color."},{"rating":"1","title":"eww it sucks..","review":"I saw this stuff at the drug store so many times and walked by because I was skeptical, but today I decided to give it a whirl. It was a lot like \\"dying\\" my hair. Something I don't normally do.. and I have pretty healthy reasonably shiny hair to begin with, but I figured it could always be more shiny, right? So I tried it. My hair felt crunchy and wierd while I was washing it out and I put the conditioner in.. then it felt somewhat better. Well.. my hair is now LESS shiny than it was before!!! I am a natural redhead so if it did add any orange to my hair like the other reviewers, I wouldn't notice. However it took shine AWAY!! I am not happy. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff is awful","review":"My sister (with yellow-blond hair) loved this product, so I tried it expecting the same. I have ashy blonde-brown hair.

My hair had some shine but i would like to have more of course so i picked this off the shelf going WOW this sounds great! WRONG!!!!! I came home all excited(lol) and read the directions as i have never used anything quite like this. Do not use if you have colored in the last 3-4 weeks..well it has been 7 weeks since coloring the last time so i figured i was safe. WRONG AGAIN!!!!!!! I put it on..the smell wasn't too bad and while on it seemed all shiny..i was like yeahhhh. I waited the exact 10 minutes and i washed it out..it automatically felt crunchy. I put the conditioner they give you in and it did help a little. I got out dried it and WHAT A MESS!! My hair is a orangy blob...very lifeless..and even less shiny than before. Now i have to go to a salon to fix the mess. Thanks alot clairol..please pull this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same product you trusted","review":"If you were happy with Natural Instincts for years don't think that this is the same or better product. The color in this new revised edition does NOT last as long and the color is not as rich and vibrant. I believe that the Week 2 refresher was created to compensate for the lack of color in the initial wash. The refresher is a thick pasty cream in a foil packet and if you have very dry hair you won't have enough to distribute throughout your head of hair. Not to mention the color or the refresher is not the same color as the initial wash. I used color #24, medium cool brown (clove) and the refresher left more of an orange, reddish color to my hair. And really, who wants to have to re-apply coloring after two weeks!Unless Clairol decides to go back to their original product, I'll be hunting around for a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied","review":"I thought this product worked pretty well. i have awful hair, its really fried because i have naturally blak hair and i get it bleached to be as white as possible. My hair did feel a little dry after putting the glaze on so i left the conditioner on extra long, mixed it with some watered down gotb crazy sleek (which i also added blue and purple dye to to tone down my yellow)blow dried it and then put on a good deal of argan oil and straightend it. My hair is deffinitly shiner then usual and the glaze lighted up my color a little more which was nice. i might use this product again but i might try a different one too. the results for me are noticable but not drastic. i would recomend this product to someone lik me with dead very light hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Although I'm not proud, I have been using various hair dyes and box treatments for over 15 years. I was really excited about this product; I just dyed my hair a month ago and it was already looking quite drab. My hair is naturally very dark brown (stylists call it a 4), but at the moment, before the shine treatment, it was medium brown with red and orange tones. After following all instructions on the box, as I always do, I rinsed my hair to find it lighter than before. Not to mention, especially in the sunlight, it appeared almost orange at the top! I was already unhappy with the reddish tones carried in my hair and to accentuate those tones with bright orange only made it worse. I could understand how those with naturally cool hair colors could use this product and essentially benefit, but unfortunately, I feel as if anyone with naturally warm hair might be unhappy with their results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hair is Softer, a little shinier and more golden toned.","review":"I figured when I bought this product that it would be just a gloss of some sort, I was wrong. It contains peroxide and I didn't realize this until i had already torn the box open. What the heck lets do this! My hair is actually much softer than usual and there is a little more shine. Although its hard to tell if its really shine or my medium ashy blond hair with now golden highlights. Considering how unpredictable this product is on different hair types I don't recommend it. Hopefully in a few weeks I wont be able to see roots growing out. Buyer beware--get a shine serum instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"why didn't I read these reviews first??","review":"This was an impulse buy while shopping for hair coloring for my daughter. I thought, what the heck I'll be happy if I can add some extra shine to my otherwise long and attractive hair. Well that didn't really happen. For the first several days I felt like my hair was reflecting sunlight better but after just a few washings I found my hair had less shine than before the Shine Happy treatment. Then I come to find out that people have reported unsatisfactory results for years and Clairol apparently has done nothing to improve this product. Pretty disappointing Clairol."},{"rating":"1","title":"did nothing","review":"There was a slight shine but sadly this product lightened my hair. not happy! i got to figue if it is safe to recolor my hair yet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt cover grays","review":"I followed the instructions to blend away grays: I applied product to the root and let it sit for 15 minutes instead of 10, as instructed. But after I rinsed and blowed dry, the grays were still gray. I'm very frustrated that this product did nothing to cover my grays, as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do anything","review":"This product is definitely not worth the money or effort to try. My hair is already red and it didn't change my hair's color unlike other reviewers, but it didn't really do anything. My hair is no shinier as the package promised. It didn't do any visible damage to my hair, but I'd rather have spent the money on a better product. Try something different if you want smoother and shinier hair - this one's a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I have medium brown, undyed, healthy hair. I bought this hoping for a little extra shine. It was a kit similar to a hair dye. I used it exactly as instructed. My hair is no shinier, and seems a little more coarse than before. It may have lightened my hair one shade but it's hard to tell. This product was a disappointment and I will never buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better, Clairol","review":"I LOVE Clairol Natural Instincts so naturally I was excited to see this product on the market promising to take the dull out of my hair the 40's have seem to bring. While I don't have a horror story about a color change, I am disappointed it did absolutely nothing. I had my hair highlighted a month ago and wanted to give it a little boost. When I use Natural Instincts to color my hair it does a great job and gives me GREAT shine so I expected the same from this product, just without the color but I got nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains peroxide and will alter your existing color","review":"This is NOT a treatment that will make your hair healthier! It contains peroxide, which will lift your natural color! DEFINITELY stay away from this if you want your virgin hair to remain undamaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller sent old hair color","review":"I cannot rate that actual product, but I can warn people not to purchase it from Impossible Discounts, because they sent me Clairol Natural Instincts 24 medium cool brown which was manufactured in 2003 (it has a shelf life of only 3 years and it is November of 2011 now). The only reason I found out about its age is because of a manufacturer's coupon that was inside the box that had an expiration date of 12/31/04, so I called Clairol customer service and provided them with a number on the bottom of the hair color box, they advised me that it was manufactures in 2003. After numerous emails to the seller where he first suggested I try the hair color and if it doesn't work, then he will refund me for it, I sent it back for a refund but was not refunded for return shipping, so I paid $9.49 for the hair color and and $4.04 to send it back, great deal don't you think? My advice is to get your hair color from somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prettiest color ever","review":"Light golden reddish brown and I mean LIGHT perfect color! Gentle and it lasts.

I *did* notice the new color refresher and some slight changes in the instructions. The biggest difference? My hair is a mess after using Natural Insticts!! I actually used the reformulation twice and tried two different colors. Both times, the color barely touched my moderate gray and left my hair coarse, frizzy, and brittle. Previous versions of Natural Instincts have easily covered the gray and left my hair soft, silky and shiny. The first time I used the reformulated version, I tried the refresher, which left a brassy orange cast to my hair. I skipped the refresher the second time and will be skipping Natural Instincts completely from now on. It's THAT bad!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Back the Old Formula!!","review":"I see this review is listed under Medium Auburn Brown, even though I specified Linen, but since they changed the formula across the board I'll go ahead and write a general review. I have used Natural Instincts Linen for many years and have always loved it because it looked so natural. Not any more! The new formula is terrible! It doesn't cover as well as the old formula and looks fake. And the special solution you put on after a couple of weeks makes it even worse!! For the first time ever, friends asked me what I did to my hair! I hate trying other brands because I've been so pleased before, but it looks like I'm going to be looking for a new company. Please, Clairol, bring back the old formula! It can be the \\"New, Improved\\" solution!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be red, now eggplant","review":"Under the old name, Cinnaberry, the Medium Auburn was my perfect color.

Boo hiss."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!","review":"I read about this product in Allure magazine. In the hot new product section. I have very dark brown hair naturally, without any color product on my hair. I really wanted a glossy shine to my hair and decided to try this. While rinsing it out after the allotted time on my hair per the directions, my hair felt strange, not sure how to describe it. Almost like I had put alcohol on my hair. I used the condition that comes in the box, and my hair felt slightly better. After towel drying, my hair felt straw-like. I air dry my hair normally, so that is what I did after the application of this product. After my hair dried, IT WAS A STRANGE ORANGE COLOR!!! A lighter version of my hair with a orange tint! It's been 2 months since my experience with Shine happy crap, and you can see a 1 inch part of my natural hair that is growing in. I am planning on going to a salon soon to have my hair colored all the same.

I have naturally dark blonde straight fine hair and have been getting it highlighted professionally for years at $90 a pop. I don't have gray hair and love my natural color, I mainly just get it done because I just like how it feels right after lightening it, like it has a little extra body and softness, so I thought I would give shine happy a try. The results for me were exactly as advertised, although it may have lightened my hair a tiny bit but not enough to be sure. I followed instructions exactly and finished with the conditioner and now my hair is shiny with a little extra body and lift at the roots. It is soft and slinky, just like after going to the salon, at a fraction of the cost. Now I know why my stylist always vehemently warns against using boxed color - because she didn't want to lose the $500 a year I was spending with her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it negative stars I would","review":"I curse this product every time I look in the mirror. I loved my natural hair color but thought I would give it a little pampering just for the heck of it. My hair lightened about 2 shades and has a gross orange hue to it and I feel like my hair is weaker now. This was almost a year ago and I'm still trying to grow it out (it's long) and it will take me a long time. I've thought of dying it back to my natural color but I'm scared since all the dyes I see have peroxide (which is what this product has that ruined my hair) so I don't know what to do.

I'll probably be buying this product again, since it's cheap for how much you get of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"taste GREAT!!!","review":"best tasting oat bran ive had.. even my daughter loves it and shes a picky eater highly recommended especally for dukan dieters"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum!","review":"I am surprised how much I like this oat bran.

I don't like hot cereals.I mix this one with my favorite yogurt, eat it in the morning and love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthful quality fiber every day","review":"I add flax seeds to foods regularly and have been enjoying oat bran for years. Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Hot Cereal is my preferred brand, so it's great to find it offered at Amazon. Known to add fiber and help reduce cholesterol levels, having this every day in one form or another is beneficial and can be very tasty, too. The package contains a great muffin recipe and the Bob's Red Mill website offers additional recipes. I'm currently reading the Dukan Diet book and see that one of the requirements for that program is to consume a tablespoon and a half of oat bran on a daily basis which sounds good to me. He provides a little recipe for an oat bran pancake which I'll try. I imagine that with the publication of this book in the USA, the interest in this product will skyrocket and that's a good thing. Oat bran makes a great addition to bread doughs as well and you might even consider it in your next home made pizza. This is much more than a hot cereal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delish!!!","review":"This oat bran has a fresh taste that I love. I instantly got hooked on the stuff and now eat it everyday. I feel so much better (and more regular :-) since I started eating it. My favorite way to prepare it is to make healthy pancakes or desert crepes with it. I will order again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good eats for good cholesterol!","review":"I use oat bran to help control my cholesterol.It is an effective tool for good health.Oat bran is a little sweeter than regular oatmeal.So, I eat it with no added sugar.Bob's Red Mill brand is one of the best I have used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bobs red organic oatbrand","review":"I recently moved to okc and was unable to find this product.This oatbrand is really good and a fantastic price.Will definately order again.Shipment was fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flavor, nice texture, great breakfast!","review":"Bought this when it was on sale and have been eating it for breakfast at the office.

I originally intended to buyMcCANN'S Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, 28-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4). During my search I found this and saw all the stellar reviews for it. Those reviews, along ith a great price, and a personal history of always being satisfied with countless Bob's Red Mill products over the years led me to buy this. It arrived yesterday and I was anxious to try it so I made it for lunch. I can assure you, all the great reviews for this cereal are warranted. It's absolutely delicious, and very satisfying.Serve it to yourself and others just as you would oatmeal (e.g., with raisins, butter, honey, maple syrup, milk, etc., whatever tickles your fancy). If you like Scottish type oatmeal - it's not as thick as the Irish steel cut, I'm confident you'll like this. You'll probably like it even if you're accustomed the thicker steel cut oats.Buy with confidence and enjoy this hot delicious cereal."},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperor has no music","review":"A dreadful experience.

I was very disappointed to find I had to air it up by blowing into a straw then sticking a plug it. I would fear giving it to young children because the plug would be a choking hazard. Trying to plug it while the air is releasing is a big disappointment and I had to leave the straw inside. No instructions whatsoever as how to air up the ball or whether to leave the straw in or out. There was just a photo of a woman blowing into the straw on the back of the package. I had to try several times and still did not get enough air inside of it. Save your money it is not worth it. It comes with two plugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is on the level.","review":"I really like the size of the Wilton cake levelor. Since it is 18\\", it will cut a much larger cake than the smaller version. It also seems to be very sturdy. This is going to be a very well used decorating tool in the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"The blade is plenty sharp--I keep slicing my thumbs open. But it's also very flimsy. The tension isn't strong enough to keep the blade flat as you cut through thicker cakes--like the other reviewer said, it rides up as you go along. So, if you don't bake dense cakes, you might be ok. The smaller the cake, the better it works. But what's the point of buying a large leveler if I can only use it on cakes that I could cut with my bread knife anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"This leveler is a joke for professionals and novices a like. The blade moves, flips to the side and digs into the cake. I would absolutely recommend NOT buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't spend your money!","review":"The blade is too flimsy. Did not cut layers level and was difficult to use. Don't waste your money on this item. You can do a better job with a piece of fishing line or a knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cake Leveler","review":"Only used the leveler once or twice.

Why?Because m.n. likes to cast its net wider that folk-tales,not just into fiction, but also into the way we tell stories in 'fact' -in our everyday life (including law). The real attraction ofthis book, though, is not just its exegesis of Russian folk art,but its steely, unsentimental discipline, its awareness of what itsets aside to reveal deep structures, and its sensitivity to thecrossing of categories. It is concise, easy to read, and the folk-talesPropp examines are also available in translation in p/back.Propp is not like Genette: he doesn't need youto read the whole of Proust first. But he is essential,not least for those who plunge into the turbulentwaters of comparative literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance & Customer Support","review":"I purchased an Ultra Hub 4 from Circuit City, connected it to my PII and it worked for about 3 min.

However, the constant moaning,humming,heavy breathing,or whatever it is that Moravec does is very distracting...\\"Through my system this was actually so distracting that I can not even listen to the album.

That can be heard on the compilationBad Words and Evil People: The Transatlantic Anthology 1972-73.But in 1969--look at the cover, could it be from any other period-they kicked off with this album. This is strictly keyboard prog, but it works. The tracks are well written, basic songs that foray into organ solos and turn corners with interesting interludes. This is not quite the invention within self-contained songs of some early Vertigo Porg like Cressida and Coliseum, but Skin Alley does not over pour with side long essays either.The audio here is pretty muddy, and there is not a lot of clarity or good separation. But if you like music that fits into that '69 wedge right between psych and progressive, the music makes this worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just noting two little quirks.","review":"In general I agree with the other reviers so I won't repeat their statements here. I'd just like to note two tiny quirks: The Cover design has the wrong runes (obviously the designers looked up the numbers Tolkien gives in the Appendix of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" in the wrong table) and secondly the earth of the world maps is much too small, only half as large as the real earth, which is strange since Tolkien clearly does not describe another planet but an imaginary past of our own planet. So much for Tolkien purism... otherwise it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"This book was required for a college class; however, I have greatly enjoyed it and find this book is a great read on its own. If you are a fan of such books as \\"The Hobbit,\\" you will greatly enjoy this book. It's a wonderful companion book for your other Middle-Earth reads and helps you to understand some pieces of the stories that you may have earlier ignored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointing","review":"I ordered this book based on not only my love of the Tolkien Universe but on the recommendations of those who have seen it. I am very disappointed with the book. The drawings and text bring nothing of the flavor of Tolkien's World to the page and serve only to remove the beauty of his language from the stories. As a research tool, this book is useless and as a hobbyist's edition, it is not worth the paper it iss printed on. If you are looking for a description of Tolkien's world, head to The History of Middle-Earth as edited by Christopher Tolkien. These provide as much information as the atlas does, and in a way that makes it much more interesting and keeps the imagination alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book for Tolkien fanatics","review":"The Atlas of Middle Earth is a good book for anyone who is obsessed with The Lord of the Rings. And I do mean obsessed. If you just watched the movies, this probably isn't for you. I would recommend this for anyone who is seriously interested in the history and cartography of Middle Earth. The author goes over each of the ages of Middle Earth, providing a history along with maps of the land. The maps are impressive, with one exception: they can be a bit confusing. There is a lot going on in the maps, and they really need to be studied in order to make sense of them. That being said, the concept of an atlas of such a well-loved and well developed world as Middle Earth, is great, and i commend the author on doing such a great job with it. Highly recommended for any serious Tolkienite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Detail","review":"When I recieved this atlas as a gift last year I was ecstatic. No more rellying on torn, bent, and small front page maps any more.This is an incredibly comprehensive work. Not only is there a wonderfully clear and easy to read map on nearly every page, but also commentary on how that map relates to the text.I definetely recommend this to any true Tolkien fan. Lots of detailed building layout maps are also included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlas of the Tolkien-made world of Middle-Earth with more!","review":"If someone think this is an illustrated account stretching from Mordor in the east to Hobbitun and the sea in the west, think again. This is an extensive atlas featuring maps and backgroundstory for everything Tolkien wrote!Its put chronologically from the first age until the third age and also chronologically following the events in the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.All in all a \\"must have\\" for Lord of the Rings-fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"great companion","review":"Great companion book to one of the best series of all time.

K.W. Fonstad draw almost all the places where took place the Lord of the Rings, woth the entire traveling path of Frodo and the companion.But that's not all, cause she also darws the Midle Earth before the big changes, so if you're reading the Silmarillion or any 1st or 2nd age ambiented book, you can have now the perfect tool to iamgine all those land transitions and all those changes that you just couldn't imaginate.Also a nice tool for those who play rol games, cuase you can counter with a faithful testimony of the geography of the Midle Earth, so now you can make the game even more realistic.I must have for all Tolkien and ME fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Gift for a Tolkin-ite","review":"I specifically ordered this book for a friend of mine who is REALLY in not only Lord of the Rings but everything that has to do with that series. He can talk small pieces of information like a skilled essayist and will deftly argue minutae (sp?) with cliff notes as it were to back it up.When I found out he lost this book in a house fire, I knew he'd appreciate it back. He was.Hope that helps...spelling/grammar not with standing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference book to have on any part of LotR","review":"I have read all of the books tolkien has written on middle earth, not only lord of the rings but the silmarillion and the tolkien reader. I was always confused on things like where beleriand was, what the world looked like in the first + second ages, and where the valar lived in relation with middle earth. This book answered nearly every one of my questions, along with providing great diagrams of the various battles fought. If you liked tolkien, get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly useful resource for Tolkien Fans","review":"As most printings of the Trilogy include a map, this book may seem unnecessary. In my opinion, the converse is true. The small map printed in the Trilogy is nothing but an appetizer compared this atlas. While the book was printed in only two colors, it has excellent detail. I found the maps of the battles quite useful, giving a better idea of how the battles progressed. The book also details the times covered only slightly in the books, as well as the era of the Silmarillion.In addition, this book is highly recommended as a supplement for those watching the movie. Tolkien created a universe so vast that it is easy to get lost, especially in Peter Jackson's excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete and Interesting","review":"This is incredible. Not only is the book full of beautiful maps, but they are very accurate and tell the stories through mapping out the routes that bilbo, the dwarves, frodo, gandalf, and even gollum........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Middle Earth Atlas Available","review":"I used this book to chart my way thru The Silmarillion, The Hobbit and the LOR books. To be honest, I am not sure I could have pieced together what happens after the War of Wrath geographically when at the end of the 1st age, Beleriand drops off into the ocean of Belegaer. While this book is not perfect it was certainly helpful. One of the most irritating and confusing aspects of this book was the muted color pallet. The color pallet is definitely not user friendly. One gets lost in the haze of muted colors. While the section cuts are helpful, they are not keyed to the maps leaving one trying to figure out where the sections are cut. All in all, if you are looking for an atlas to help you along thru the JRR Tolkien masterpieces, this did the job. A bit of warning, reading the text ahead of the books will spoil the plots! Look at the maps first, then after reading the applicable Tolkien chapters, read the Atlas text afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent reference!","review":"I bought this atlas based on reviews and am very happy I did. Excellent reference companion to Tolkien's \\"Silmarillion\\", \\"The Hobbit\\", and \\"Lord of the Rings\\". Great maps, informative descriptions, nice layout. The only thing I'm not pleased with is the center binding cuts off parts of the maps which would be an issue with the publisher and not the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bindings may waylay your journey through ME","review":"My feedback to the author/publisher would be this: please format the (2-page) maps layout so that the binding does not inhibit the reading of the maps. Just as printed text has margins/gutters, so should maps in a case like this. I often found myself wrestling with the book to see what was being swallowed up by the binding.Otherwise, I have found the content to be a great companion while reading through Tolkeins works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Supplement to Trilogy","review":"For fans of Middle Earth (and who isn't?), this is a fun book.

I started watching movies, reading books, and listening to the music. Once I started listening I couldn't put it down, It's kind of funny because usually the music I listen to is Pop and hip hop and R & B and here I am listening to Civil War music over and over and over again. So trust me no matter what music you listen to you will love this cd!!! Some of my favorite songs would be: Ashokan Farewell, Dixie, Johnny has gone for a soldier, Hail Columbia, Kingdom Coming, Yankee Doodle(of coarse), Both versions of: When Johnny comes Marching home, and Ashokan Farewell/Sullivan Ballou Letter(that one always makes me cry!). O.k. Thats all for my reveiw!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great peice of Civil War history.","review":"This CD is a good buy for any Civil War buff. Even though it was intended for use as a soundtrack I would recomend it. It has many of the time honored songs that we associate with the period and the sound quality is great.
