If you have any one who wants to know what fighting in a war is like - have them read this book. A book I will read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way it was","review":"Eugene Sledge's account of his service with the 1st Marine Division on Peleliu and Okinawa is simultaneously inspiring and heart-wrenching. To read of what these young men endured and accomplished in the faithful service of their country, with the perspective of 60 years of hindsight, is occasionally overwhelming in its poignancy and intensity.Sledge served his country well, both as a Marine in WWII and subsequently, with the publication of this classic account of men at war. It is an account that will endure and will remain indelible in the minds of all who have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"E.B. Sledge's \\"With the Old Breed\\" is an outstanding and unforgettable book. Sledge writes in such a unique style that is so easy to read and keeps you turning the pages. The descriptions of his experiences are utterly vivid and give the reader a glimpse into the horror, fear and confusion that war actually is. The dedication and bravery of these many veterans is truly unbelievable. These guys are genuine heroes. Any reader who has never endured combat will develop a different opinion of what war is really like and will discover in themselves a new found honor and respect for those that served this country in such an unselfish way. \\"With the Old Breed\\" made it clear to me that there is no way to ever fairly repay these veterans for the sacrifices that they personally made in maintaining the liberties and freedoms we so casually enjoy in the United States.I cannot recommend this book highly enough!! Read it and you will understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"AZ READER","review":"This is a wonderful book written by an extraordinary man who fought in WWII for our freedom. This book was used is some part to make the HBO miniseries \\"The Pacific\\", which I also highly recommend.

It was very reasonably priced and was delivered to me very quickly by Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Eugene Sledge's memoirs is everything you want to know about the battles at Peleliu and Okinawa - and more. He gives such insight and detailed information from a first-hand point of view that you literally FEEL that you're on those islands with him, fighting by his side and seeing all the death and gore and blood with your own eyes. That's how great his narrative is, that's how real the book feels. He doesn't over romantise or sugar-coat his battles, he delivers them as raw as possible as a person who's been there and done that. It feels raw, and it feels real.This is truly an astounding book and everyone interested should read it! You'll even feel bonded to the men of K/3/5 and have a sense of esprit de corps, which is so often emphasised by Sledge in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Memoir - Gripping and Moving","review":"This is the best memoir I've ever read. Highly recommended for those who want an honest insight into combat and a perspective that may alter how you view life in general. \\"China Marine\\" complements this book and is also highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Marine","review":"E.B. Sledge tells what it's like to fight, day after day, not knowing if you'll be wounded, maimed, killed at any moment, just going on and doing the worst job in the world -- because it has to be done, because your country needs you. I second the notion that this should be required reading in every high school, to let our youth know how evil war can be -- and how sometimes it's necessary.I've never had to experience anything like the horrors Sledge and his comrades endured. My thanks to and prayers for the veterans of the most terrible war in history. You will not be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only W.E.B.

This is just an outstanding book about the courage and will of this generation of men and this country. RIP, Mr. Sledge....... Job Well Done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fighting the Japanese","review":"This is a rivetting read and an insight into the mind of a good young American marine who was very lucky to have survived the war. It confirms my view that the US Army is far more complacent about throwing men into battle regardless of the cost in life. This is in comtrast to the British who, with a fifth of the US population, can't afford to waste humans.The book also makes one question - more earnestly than does the author - the necessity, after the summer of 1945, of invading the islands (and suffering horrendous losses). Some islands could well have been bypassed and blockaded - especially as, by then, the American government knew it was about to unleash the ultimate weapon.I give it four stars bcs it tended to be repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Brutally Honest","review":"Listen, there isn't a whole lot more to be said about this book. It's value is that Sledge just lays it out, more like he's talking to you than writing for you. That intimacy will hold you from the first page and make you take a little more jaundiced view, perhaps, of rah-rah military books. Worth ever minute you will put into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"Title says it all. Buy this book now and you will not regret it!

The identity of the murderer is known from the beginning which in this case only adds to the suspense. The reader knows about the danger the main character is in while she is totally oblivious. After reading a couple of Mary Higgins Clark's novels it gets rather easy to guess the perpetrator, so this is a nice change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!!","review":"This was my first Mary Higgins Clark book and I must say it was an absolute page-turner! Clark writes with such detail and keeps you wondering from the beginning of the book all the way to the end.However, I did have to get used to the style she chose in writing this book. (each chapter was told from a different character's point of view)Nevertheless, it was an outstanding book :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the 25 cents I Paid for It","review":"I hated this. The heroine was weak and pathetic. The mystery could have been solved in five minutes if all the people involved had simply talked to each other and the police. It was very annoying watching all the characters stumble through their activities, the people running the investigation clumsily missing obvious clues and botching every interrogation. The concept of the doctor's experiments was far-fetched and of course everything was neatly tied up in the end in a very unrealistic fashion. I never liked Mary Higgins Clark and I don't know what possessed me to pick up this one except that I got it for $.25 at a used book sale. It wasn't worth the price"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is one of the best books she has written.","review":"This book is exceptionally good and in my opinion oneof the best MHC has written.

Good thing though, since it had been so long, I couldn't remember the details of the story & still enjoyed reading the rest of the book.This is one of the rare stories where we already know who the culprit is from the very start. We know that this doctor is experimenting on his patients, but with what & how, that we don't know.

While it does cover the basics it does not go into advanced topic such as games or FS. If you are new to Flash or just haven't got much from the tutorials, this book might prove valuable to you. I does not go into complex animations and its animated button section could go into more depth. The Lessons on the CD seem as if they just threw them toghther in order to get the book out. Darrel Plant could have spent much more time writing this one. Why didn't he start writing this while FLASH3 was in production? I mean we had to wait months for this guide to come out and then they kept postponing it. One last thing, on the back of the book it says that Sound Edit 16 trial is included on the CD. I couldn't find it on mine.

It starts out good and explains the tools very good. But after page 123 (Animation)I started getting confused and didnt understand why. I think the author was put under pressure by the editors from this point because you really notice that the explanations get poor and the examples get complicated without you knowing what and why you are doing certain actions. I read the reviews and bought this book, even knowing about the bad credits it got. I thought: well learning a software is not everyones thing. some people have the logical side and some have the creativ side and so on. I am a webdesigner and owe a company with 15 webdesigners.

I reread it many, many times. In the story, virtue (including courage, industriousness, and resourcefulness) is rewarded, which gives it an uplifting message. I recommend the book highly: not only does it have a good story, but the author had researched the ancient Romans extensively and it goes a wonderful job of presenting history and Roman life in a palatable fashion.Fortunately, this is but one book of a series!

Mandorix is a credible hero, and as the first-person narrator he weaves a tale at once compelling and educational. Along with the companion volumes in Anderson's Roman Life and Times series, this book motivated me to study Latin, a pursuit I still enjoy some 50 years after I first read of Gaius Iulius Caesar and Dumnorix, of Quintus Rufus and Carnifex, of the foppish Quintus Cicero and his magnificent stand against Ambiorix.Hmm, I think it's probably about time for me to read it again.

Boy those movie studios sure know how to keep getting that money out of our pockets. It is sad that the movie studios are slowly destroying the DVD format.And colorizing the film is silly.

It ran for about three months (!) at my local cinema. It was a comedy masterpiece in its era. So _why_ did Disney mess it up by not presenting it in its original widescreen format, and not in its original (Academy Award-winning) black-&-white photography?This release is truly a disgrace. The present Disney Company is, in my opinion, likewise a disgrace to Walt Disney and his high standards.I cannot recommend this film in its present version. I suggest that Disney fans and general buyers wait for a release that is true to the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU DON'T LIKE \\"COLORIZED\\" MOVIES","review":"This is the \\"COLORIZED\\" version of this Disney film that they butchered by in the 1980's for the Disney TV channel. Disney must think that all their customers are adolescents and kids who don't know the difference, WRONG!I picked this up to buy in the store, saw that it was colorized, and immediately put it down. I will NOT support butchering of films. If Disney wants to release the COLORIZED version, fine, do it, but release the BLACK AND WHITE one as well for us purists who want them as originally intended.BAD, BAD, BAD, HOUSE OF MOUSE choice here.

I am writing this review in defence of this the colorized version of a classic, black & white movie. The colors are rich, vibrant and above all natural looking - forget the colorization of the early 80s, this is digital colorization and if you didn't already know the film was originally black & white you wouldn't be able to tell!The only mistake Disney made was releasing this before the original black & white version, however with dvd technology they should have brought out both versions on a double sided dvd like \\"A Christmas Carol\\" was. However, the black & white movie is now available in a widescreen dvd version.This is a wonderful, color version of a great family movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been done so much better.......","review":"I agree whole heartedly with the other reviewers. This movie is a minor classic for the Disney Studios and they treat it like this? Why would you bother to colourize this movie...it is a B&W; movie...keep it is such. Please scrap this release and re-do it. A suggestion is a double DVD package with both this movie and its sequel, Son of Flubber. Each DVD should have some archive extras as well as a newly produced retrospective look back at these movies. How about including Donald Duck's \\"Modern Inventions\\" short? Disney did brilliant work with, Old Yeller, Pollyanna, The Parent Trap and Swiss Family Robinson DVD releases...but treats this movie in such a second rate manor?The live Disney pictures are adored by millions around the world.

In any case, it was definitely an interesting read. The book though doesn't really offer any advice or guidance to students like me who want to get into Ivy League schools. It's much more of a history or sociological account than it is a college guidebook.

Next time, try using a markup language on your source content that allows for multi-channel publishing. Put the tables out as text, not graphics.

So I was very disappointed to find that neither tool was enabled for this book. Turning the Kindle to make the book wider only makes the print smaller, so that doesn't work either.Again, the content of this book is good and very helpful, but the Kindle version is a waste of time unless the reader has eagle eyes and enjoys flipping pages to find specific items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and informative","review":"I bought this book to look up cholesterol counts, and discovered that it is a thorough nutritional profile of each food.

The beginning of the story does not seem to have any connection to the end where some of the ideas begin to make sense. It takes place mostly at the Whispering Glades cemetery where employees are required to refer to the corpses as loved ones. A man who works there is in love with a cosmetican and shows how he thinks of the relationship by making the corpses smile and look sad before she works on them. And another man who is in love with her also lies about his identity and claims he is a poet by copying love poems and sending them to her. At the end she gets confused and the writer of a local column tells her to kill her self and she does which shows utter stupidity in her character. This book is merely lies and I give it two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was pretty boring","review":"Well the book was pretty boring to me. It was about two guys after a girl.

A sick story about a sensetive topic, death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic from the English satirists","review":"The Loved One is a tale of great hilarity, serving mainly as anecdotal work to the body of Waugh's satirical efforts. It is not as polished or well targeted as some of his other works, particularly \\"Brideshead\\" or \\"A Handful of Dust\\", though this is largely due to the fact that he is writing about Hollywood rather than the English society with which he was eminently more familiar.

I read this entire book in one sitting- the complexity of the story forced me to turn the pages. The first few pages are a little hard to follow, but the book grabs your attention with its odd subject matter of pet cemetarys and beuticians for the dead. This book is truly a work that must be read by anyone who wants to understand satire from all angles. I recommend it to you, but beware of its perverted absurdity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pungent Piece of Satire","review":"I really don't know what else to say except that The Loved One is cover-to-cover the sharpest satire I have ever read, filled with tongue-in-cheek plot lines and caricatures rather than characters. That anyone could take the death industry and make it seem so self-important and as normal as something like the automobile industry is sheer brilliance. At less than 200 pages, it's a one day read and a very funny one at that.

Also, what kind of guy puts smiles on other people's loved ones in order to express his feelings to the beautician.

Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, uninteresting","review":"\\"The Loved One\\" tries to be so outrageous and outlandish that it would become enjoyable, but is instead very un-involved and dull.

Personally I didn't like it. At the beginning before the book/strory starts, there is a Warning. The Warning states that in some parts it gets gruesome. It wasn't that bad but it did talk about dead bodies in the funeral home, and a persons death. I thought the plot of the story was pretty weird and dumb. I felt the characters didn't belong in that story. Its about cemeteries and then these weird characters come in and their problems don't have anything to do with the book. I'm not sure what the author was thinking about when he wrote this. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you want to waist your time and read something really strange. I say one thumb down no thumbs up because it had it's moments. But I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wagging Tails All Round","review":"Quite brilliant satire.

It contained no action, suspense, nor thrill. What made me lose interest in this book was the fact that they talked about the deceased, how they died, and how their appearance were greatly transfigured. If I wanted to read about dead bodies I would have read a horror novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was neither interesting nor humorous","review":"The book, while amusing at times, could not keep my interest very long. The characters had no depth which kept me from getting to involved in the novel. To bring more definition to the characters the author should have developed more physical attributes to enhance their lifeness of their personalities. Another flaw in the novel was the lack of importance and care, for that matter, that I felt about the story line. I am not interested in the events that go on in a funeral home."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was an over all boring book.","review":"I thought that The Loved One was a fairly good book. Although, I felt the events in the book were very reaccuring. I also didn't fancy making fun of death and the people who have to deal with death. I do feel that some of the people in the burial industry are a little odd, and I got the impression that some of the characters the book, that worked in the burial industry, were also a little strange. I liked how the writer put bits and peices of poetry in the novel, but I didn't like how so many people committed suicide. The writer had good ideas, but the author could have used the ideas in a more presentable way. I thought the book needed to be more graphic. Evelyn Waugh must not have studied the burial industry before Waugh wrote about it, more occupational terms were needed. Evelyn Waugh needed to spend more time writing this novel before it was published."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt that the story was very dull.","review":"In felt that the story was very boring and that I would lose interest in the book very fast. And the love triangle in the story between Denise, Amy and Mr. Joy Boy was very confusing. And at different times in the book the pace would change and I would totally get lost and I would get frustrated. At first I thought that the book was about death then it turned out to be about love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on my top ten list","review":"I liked certain parts of the book and disliked certain parts. It was very hard to understand at times because of the British humor.I liked it when Mr. Barlow was asked to write about Sir Francis and the man didn't read it first and it was a joke instead of serious. Whispering Glades seemed like a very nice place. Otherwise, there was too much sadness. Like when Sir Francis hung himself, Mr. Joyboy being jealous that Miss Thanatogenos likes Mr. Barlow, and when Miss Thanatogenos kills herself. It is also weird that Mr. Barlow and Mr. Joyboy cremate her body and Mr. Barlow takes money from Mr. Joyboy and goes back to England."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY DRAMATIC AND FUNNY","review":"The prolific Waugh has done it again!

It was hard to sit and read any large number of pages at a time. The humor was very subtle most of the time and the jokes usually flew right over my head. It was very descriptive about the time and place but very vague about most of the names and characters. Towards the end of the novel things started picking up and everything was clearer and made more sense. The plot of this book was very odd and peculiar."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the book was a little slow but had a good plot.","review":"I liked the concept the book was trying to get across. The author did not do to good of a job at grabbing my attention. I only finished the book because I had to for school. Overall I did not think the book was that exciting.

Without giving too much of the book away let me just say that the dark humor was unattractive to me, and that I was looking for a more light and facetious comedy. But as I had no choice I read the entire book.

Then, slowly, it started to get interesting. It was very well written. I think that it is for advanced readers who can read it and understand it. The storyline gets more challenging as you continue to read it. The storyline and characters' names add irony and make this book the satire that it is. Evelyn Waugh is a very talented writer I think. My congrats go to him. So I suggest that everyone read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all around well written story of life and death","review":"The Loved One is an iteligently written story with plenty of comedy, tragedy, and drama. It is an excellent story for anyone. The characters portrayed in this book are realistic and can be related to easily. This book gave me a new perception of life and death and after reading it I fell I have a better understanding of the two. I recommend this book to anyone. It will give you like it did me a new perception of life. The book talks about death in such a way as to make you feel as if death is nothing at all.

I did not enjoy reading it. This is the most boring book I've ever read. i think there should've been a stronger conflict between Mr. Joyboy and Mr. Barlow. If Evelyn Waugh would've changed some parts it would've been better. For example, Ms. Thanatogenos shouldn't have killed herself. Instead, she should've ditched the Joyboy and left to Europe with Mr. Barlow. Mr. joyboy should've been the one to commit suicide. I seriously do not recommend this novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was OK.","review":"I never really read a book by Evelyn Waugh.

It's also tragic because it's about relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Thumbs down for Evelyn Waugh.","review":"The book was extremely dull to my point of view. The characters seem very dull and foolish. Mr. Joyboy and Mr. Slump Prove my point. The book was said to be a comic novel of the commercialization of death itself. I do not believe of that fact. This book was very boring and i do not recommend it to the any readers of any age. As i said this book recieves two thumbs down.4"},{"rating":"1","title":"A hard book to understand","review":"This book did not interest me. I found this book somewhat difficult to understand. When Mr. Joyboy and Mr. Barlow ask Miss Thanatogenos to marry her you would expect them to clash against each other. Since there was no hostility between the two gentlemen there was a lack of action in the book which made the novel very dull. What I found very unappealing in this book was the gruesome parts such as the dead bodies which were disfigured. This is what I would look for in a horror novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book full of rich humor.","review":"The Loved One is full of commedy and drama.

This book is a definite 4 out of 5 stars and a MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought the book was good","review":"I thought that the book was good. It is kind of hard to read because the writer uses a lot of adjectives. That also makes the book more interesting because you have to pay attention more.

I think that enyone who reads it will enjoy it, young or old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in Hollywood can really change someones life.","review":"I enjoyed reading this interesting book by Evelyn Waugh. She did an excellent job on the words that she used describing the characters and their moods. At first it was sort of difficult for me to understand but then I started to catch up on what was going on.All of the characters in which Waugh created did an excellent job of making this novel start to smooth out and make it easier to understand.In my opinion Hollywood is a place where there are a lot of movie stars and tourists who go visit there and have a good time.I never heard of it being like some haunted place that many terrible things happen there such as many great people dying.I would recommend this novel to many other people out there who enjoy the type of plot that Evelyn Waugh had set it to be.I myself enjoyed it and I was thrilled to have a chance to write a report on this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept but not well executed.","review":"\\"Fragments\\" offers an interesting concept, the fusing of the minds of several savants in a collective intelligence. However, a concept is not enough to sustain a book.In my opinion, the problem with \\"Fragments\\" is a basic one. The reader never really gets to know, or care about, the characters in the story. Part of the problem may be that there are too many characters to keep track of. In any case, the people we meet in this book are never really fleshed out.I think James David has some potential as a horror/thriller author. I think he just needs to refine his writing a bit first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fragments is Truly Original!","review":"This is one of the most original stories I've read in a long time. The characters are likable (and unlikable) and the premise is really interesting. Perhaps a bit more info on the supernatural presence of \\"Frankie\\" would have been nice. I highly recommend this. I read it quickly because I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Read this book...then go get a Slurpee.

Blumental's interpretation is romantic, dramatic and technically wonderful. I understand at some point critics decided that emotion in interpretation was to be shunned. Well, pooh on them.

I'm on Skype a large portion of the day and had to revert back to my old headset after just 1 call.

After I'd gotten a few pages into the book, I couldn't stop reading and finished it at 3:00 a. m. It is truly a 'can't put it down' book! Using an interest-holding balance of her own personal experiences and the experiences of her students, former students, and friends, the author enhances and supports the book's main idea that all of us can have joy if we're willing to look inside ourselves. I believe that anyone who takes the time to read this book will agree that the author shared her inner self and her soul with the reader. Doing so, she gives hope to people who feel trapped in a meaningless life and offers encouragement to people who are climbing out of a tough time or a crisis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading product","review":"I purchased this with the understanding that it was in fact an opal.

Two episodes filmed in the U.S. in the same season? Isn't this a British series?

I would only recommend it to Madonna fanatics."},{"rating":"2","title":"VIVA MADONNA's BONDing!!!","review":"This track is excellent!!!

Secondly, how about a song that is interesting to listen too?Madonna is slumming it on this one. Her voice sounds terrible and the song has none of the Bond-ish flavor of past 007 pop songs.The remixes are a bit better but not worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"What can I say it's a great song to dance to.

Totally different from other James Bond songs in that it is VERY techno-dazzled and rapid. A magnificent song that many will say as one of the best James Bond songs ever! Also on the Cd are 5 other remixs. The Threelecto Retro mix is the best, but all the others are great too. The soundtrack for the movie comes out November 12th, and be sure to buy it the second you can!! I know I will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bond Song Ever","review":"A poorly done song, totally out of sync with the Bond mythos. When I saw the movie in the theater the audience was grumbling and muttering all through the song. The song was forced on the movie by producers, who hoped to bring in the youth market with a Madonna song and a cameo by her. Composer David Arnold has been very public about how much he hated the song and refused to use any riffs or themes from it in his soundtrack. The song is just not right for a Bond movie.This song is widely regarded as the worst James Bond theme since \\"The Man with the Golden Gun.\\" Of appeal solely to Madonna fans and fans of electronica. Those looking for a vintage-style Bond song should stay away.And congratulations to \\"Die Another Day\\" and Madonna for their Razzie nomination for Worst Original Song!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great instrumentation and poor song writing","review":"This song would rank with Madonna's best if it wasn't for the cheesy and lazy songwriting. It could have been a classic but the no talent lyrics ruin the tune."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP!!!","review":"If you've heard \\"Die Another Day\\" from the music video, then you'll be disappointed not to find it here on this cd single. Instead you get the shortened \\"radio edit\\" which sounds like it ends prematurely, especially after hearing the longer version. In addition there are a series of really monotonous dance versions which aren't in the spirit of the original; they're certainly not as good.The one aspect I've learned about Madonna's music is you can't improve upon perfection. Perhaps the original extended version is on the soundtrack?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world","review":"I wish that she had done better but no. This is a disaster. Hopes for the movie go done abit hearing this joke of a bond song.

However, this song is a Bond theme, and since I am a fan of the Bond series, I feel I must comment. This song does not work at all as a Bond theme. When I first heard it, the first 2 seconds or so sounded very good, I thought, hey, maybe Madonna really has done a good Bond theme. Then, the song got going and I saw to my horror that the song was even worse then I had originally feared. I suppose this little number will be paving the way for others such as Spears, N'Sync, and so on. Perhaps one of them will then take the title of worst Bond theme ever. Until then, this one has it, easily. I'm sorry, but these are my opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is it, she might as well die today","review":"This song does not totally [bad]. The lyrics are catchy and it's fun to dance to at a club. But it's the kind of song that I would expect from Britney Spears or some other disposable music- in-a-box type of act. Not from Madonna who has written some pretty good songs(lyrics and music).Another thing, Madonna does not have a multi-octave voice like Cyndi Lauper's or other pop icons but her voice is very nice and sexy. In this track what you'll hear could have been song by anybody. It's just an overprocessed computer voice. You would never know it's her. Much worse than what they did with \\"Music\\". Very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful!","review":"I just listened to this track, and considering the past pedigree of Bond title songs I can't believe this awful synth pop rubbish will now be placed alongside such classics as \\"Goldfinger\\" or \\"The man with the golden Gun, Live and let die or View to a Kill to name but a few!!I for one will not be buying this tripe! Madonna should be ashamed of herself!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hum Hum","review":"Sure there are some nice remixed but hey isn't this a James Bond track. I'm sorry but Madonna has probably gone one step to far. Forget about the sex book, forget about Justify my love, all her trashy outfits in the 80's all the lovelives and scandals. nothing can beat this one. The worst bond theme song in history and one of the worst movie songs of all time. She doesn't even sing. A Computer sings for her. The video is boring and not original and this song sounds like a song that is used in a cocoa cola commercial. This is not a bond track and I am no fan of James Bond but I Know great songs when I hear one and this is not it.

It looks ok on the outside but inside it is very obviously third grade quality at best. It has black dirt spots in the glaze on the inside as well as the glaze has a very large (about 1/3 of the inside) spot where the glaze ran down inside.

I was fantastic; why should we expect anything less from volume II? And it should be no surprise when Harrington delivers.In Volume I, we learned about early- and middle-stage play. Volume II covers the endgame-- short tables, short stacks, getting blinded out, that sort of thing. If the book does have a weakness, it's that most of Harrington's scads of examples put the player on a medium or high stack; one would expect a book aimed at teaching players to reflect more of where they're likely to be, which is at the bottom of the barrel. While Harrington does address this situation on occasion, it's not terribly often.Volume III, a workbook, is poised and ready to drop as I write this.

But it wasn't until reading these books that I realized I had some control over my game. Harrington combines theory with practicality. He puts you at numerous tables, the make-up of each one different than the others, and challenges you to decide how much you'd bet and why you would bet in each situation. Then he gives his opinion. As in a real game, not all hands are won, not all hands are played as he would play them, and he factors in the element of luck. This is a book for serious players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harrington on Hold 'Em Volume II, The Quintessitial Book on How Play To Play Tournaments","review":"For a player that frequents sit and go online tournaments (such as myself), this book is a must have.

Foremost among these is the persistence of memory, which is the theme of \\"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch.\\"The tale revolves around a Punch n' Judy show at a seaside carnival and how it acts as a trigger for a young boys memories of his family. As with much of Gaiman's work, there are tales within tales here, and the real story he tells is more implied than elucidated upon.Dave McKean's art underscores this theme beautifully, with the \\"real\\" characters in the story as cartoon caricatures while the puppets look like photographs, exactly the focus with which young children would concentrate their memories. Can we not all remember a favorite toy more easily than our parents faces when we were little?A marvelous and poignant tale well worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quietly brilliant","review":"Mr. Punch is a difficult piece to review. It may be Neil Gaiman's finest work, but it is certainly his darkest. It is hard to describe the plot of Mr. Punch without giving anything away; suffice to say it is not the kind of work you would expect in a comic, and not what you would simply be able to put down and go on with your life once you have finished.Dave McKean's always innovative artwork enhances the nightmarish quality of the piece, and Neil Gaiman's prose is captivating as always. Mr. Punch is at the very least worth a read, and will likely find itself on your bookshelf next to all the other books that quietly changed the way you look at things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly exciting, moody and interesting","review":"I was ready for anything, not having read any Gaiman/McKein work for a very long time now, and picking this up made me feel bad for waiting so long. I was (and still am) amazed at the talent and magistry that Gaiman is able to reflect in eyes of a child, and how the story unfolds wonderfully with the sometimes beautiful, sometimes twisted and dark artwork found within. The pictures alone could tell an an amazing story, and the novella itself is told in the eyes of a child, and you know exactly whose voice the narrative is taking, from Mr Punch, to the Grandfather, to the child. I am a devoted fan, and this has only increased my hopes and chances of picking up more of his work. What are you doing still reading this?

I did need to losen the other 2 bolts holding the bumper so I could remove the speed nuts clipped to the frame for the 2 bolts removed. You may need to use a breaker bar to loosen the bolts. I held the receiver up and my nephew started the nuts on the bolts. After that I installed the other 2 bolts that fit perfectly through holes already in the frame. All holes on the receiver mathced up with the ones on my truck. The hardware kit included a set of spacers to make up for the bumper braket.

Mine were rusted into the special Ford clip style nuts requiring cutting the bolt off and cutting the clip. It wasn't much of an issue for me since I have a well equipped garage but others may not be as fortunate.

Mark and June are rather alike in that they are both looking unsuccessfully for love. Being gay in the late 1920s is terribly difficult, and Mark struggles with self-hatred instilled in him by society. Even though it portrays society's many prejudices and negative expectations for gays at the time, and the standard-for-the-era tragic ending for the homosexual character, \\"Strange Brother\\" reaches for compassion, understanding, and acceptance. It does somewhat succeed through the character of June who realizes her commonalities with Mark, and chooses to embrace life fully, even after the death of the object of her own affection (not Mark, by the way). \\"Strange Brother\\" is a wonderful story giving readers a glimpse into the early days of moving towards acceptance of gays and lesbians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check These Books Immediately","review":"This set of books has the Potential to be SUPER.

When I put this on her and she barked she shook her head at first and continued to bark through it. It did not have enough power to actually cause her enough discomfort to stop. I put it away after it stopped working, I thought perhaps the batteries were dead and replaced them, it still did not work. I tried to return it to the store to exchange it, but the company demands that you ship it back directly to them. It was bad enough that my dog was annoying with her barking, it was even more annoying to spend $120 on a product that didn't work, and then broke, and then I couldn't even exchange it. Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful! Does your dog suffer from Separation Anxiety?","review":"Although this product may work with certain barking behaviours (for example: territorial barking, attention seeking etc), it can't be stressed enough that this is not a solution if your dog is suffering from Separation Anxiety. It does not deal with the reasons behind the barking. Instead, it just makes your pet even more anxious whilst you are gone and eventually intensifies the problem.

I put it on him for the first time and took him outside to try it out. He started barking at my neighbor and nothing happened. He barked about five times and then all of a sudden he cried and jumped straight into the air. I guess it had worked. However, that's the ONLY time! I have had it on him for a week and he will start barking and I will wait for the collar to work, and eventually have to quiet him myself since I don't want him to continue annoying people.I contacted Amazon to return the product since this was a COMPLETE waste of money, and they won't let me since I opened the packaging!!!

I thought that it had been working okay. It was certainly stopping her from barking most of the time (she's very territorial and barks at every moving thing around). Note that I say it only stopped her most of the time. The collar didn't pick up on every bark. Recently, however, the collar has had some serious sensor malfunctions. She'll bark for a solid minute before she gets a correction (this is on a new battery). More serious, however, is that she gets a correction seemingly at random. I was concerned that in the year I've been using this collar, Bubbles never ever got the hint that barking caused the correction, and now I'm seriously worried that it's because of this random shocking.I wish I could take it back, but the best I can do right now is hope you read this and decided to spend a little more on a collar that you won't have to use forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"The first problem I had was that the box must stay directly over their vocal cords or it wouldn't work at all.

It did not work at all! The battery is fine, as we can rub it against a VERY rough surface and it will beep and work but it does not respond to our dog's bark at all. It is no where near sensitive enough. Given the other reviews, I think it must be defective and we are contacting the company for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this collar.... worst investment","review":"I would like to warn those who would like to buy this collar. I bought the collar brand new, and was warned by others about the longevity of the battery. I wanted to prove the reviewers wrong.. but guess what, I was the one who came out as a loser. I lost over $40 dollars on this collar. THE REASON: The battery didn't even last for 2 days. The battery went dead the following day. The battery is exclusively made by Petsafe, so you will have to buy the battery at the store, well I am not going to bother to buy another battery which will just last for a day, and costs $10 each. I now understand why others who have bought this same collar have bought 10 batteries along with the purchase of it. I feel so cheated and disappointed by this product. I hope Petsafe will make changes quick to this collar. I'd hate to say it but its basically a r i p off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best investment, restored sanity!","review":"I hated to have to resort to this method, but I was about to give up on this dog due to its incessant barking. We rescued her several years ago, and love everything about her, except the constant high pitched barking. Nothing else worked, and at times, I thought I was losing my mind and vowed to get rid of her. I read all of the reviews on Amazon about this product and decided to give it a try. It only took a few times wearing the collar, and she learned not to bark. Now she quietly whines to go out or be let in, and if a week or more goes by and she starts to bark again, I put it on for a few minutes, and she quickly re-learns. I actually am falling in love with this dog, rather than just tolerating her. If you are in the same boat, try this collar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad we still have the receipt","review":"We bought one of these to curb the barking of our 45 pound Pharaoh Hound.

Her barking bothered neighbors when we left for any period of time and the outdoor barking also interrupted an afternoon Veterans Day meeting.

The first few times he had it on, he was a bit confused, but now I have a quiet household! This product literally helps me sleep at night!

She was barking at anything in the house and outside. She'd also bark just to get attention. We have an invisible fence and were nervous to add another collar system as we thought it might confuse her. She has done VERY well with the collar and most barking has disappeared.

It gradually vibrated as a warning before buzzing him. He used to be very aggressive at the park and would chase the big dogs while yelping the whole time. Now he plays nice with everyone andour comes when called. A very good investment. It's been a few weeks and the batteries are still good.

During the first few uses, it seemed effective, and the dog quickly learned not to bark. Now,with additional of another dog, she has started barking again along with the new dog. I went back to this collar, replaced the batteries, and tested it to make sure the vibration sensor still worked. Unfortunately, it's now so insensitive to vibration that the dogs cannot trigger it. I'm not exactly sure how the product went defective since it was in a well isolated drawer space during its down time, but the long short of the story is that I'm now back looking for a better quality substitute for this device a year later, even though the device was rarely used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog bark collar","review":"After spending hundreds of $$$s this is IT!!

Thanks so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for small dogs","review":"The amount of vibration needed to cause the collar to \\"correct\\" your dog is set too high. The instruction manual tells you to rub it along carpet to see if it's working properly. In order to get it to work I had to do this excessively. I couldn't see how that much friction to get it to go off would be anything close to a dogs bark. Good idea in theory to rely on vibration rather than sound, but without a way to change the sensitivity this would probably only work for large dogs. Long story short, 90% of the time it never worked. BIG waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great price!","review":"I went to a locally owned pet store as well as PetCo and this product was $99.00!!!

My wife and I purchased one of those birdhouse looking things that gives off the sound when your dog barks and that did nothing. We spent 63 bucks on that and quickly returned it to get our money back. I bought this collar for my min-pin and he hasn't barked but once since we put it on him. The first time he barked he jumped and then whined for a few seconds and that was the last of it. I was slightly concerned about using something like this and traumatizing the little guy, but it has worked out wonderfully.

This collar has significantly reduced his barking; even without wearing the collar, he now barks extremely infrequently. Before the collar, his barking was out of control.Dangers: it did go off once while he was vigorously scratching his neck.

He knows that it shocks him and when he has it on he is a little quieter, but I wish it went off every time he barked, not just once in a while because he is afraid of the collar and I don't think he associates it with barking."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it is working?","review":"I bought this with really high hopes, but so far it only works every so often.

He wore the collar a total of five minutes and I will regret those five minutes the rest of my life. DO NOT USE these collars. He didn't bark for a week and also lost a great deal of his energy and enjoyment. Before this collar he would chase and retrieve balls, giving an excited bark at the beginning.

We noticed some wetness around her neck and found a HUGE wound under the collar where the contacts touch her skin. We had to clip away her hair and treat her burn. TERRIBLE! As much as the silence of a non-excessive barking dog seems great, the thought of what it did to her just makes me sick to my stomach. :( Don't buy this product. IT IS NOT SAFE!

My daughter in USA had recommended it as working on one of her 2 dogs, but when she mailed it to me in Australia, of course, it never reached me, (so much for \\"Pet Safe\\".)

After only a day of using this collar he has stopped any type of howling or barking when he wants in, and only scratches at the door. The only issue that I have with this product is that sometimes he is able to continue barking loudly if he is persistent enough. I don't know if he is just enduring the zaps he is getting from the collar or if it is shutting off. The package comes with limited instructions as to how to troubleshoot any problems that arise.

This is not just an opinion but a fact. I understand having one or two in a bad batch but I read further reviews back and it seems this often happens after a longer period of use. And if your not home your dog could be damaged or even killed by the continual stress of the continuing shock.

The collar definitely shocks when she barks, so it does work- HOWEVER, it only senses the vibrations on the throat, not an actual bark. So after the dog barked, it shocked her so she whimpered and it shocked her again stronger so she cried again and it was just an awful, horrible circle until I was able to take it off her. It also will shock if the dog just sneezes. I understand that sometimes with heavy barkers, they need to be helped and trained not to bark as often as they do, but this is certainly not a helper. The collar is now in the garbage and I will be buying them the spraying one instead. And just a side thought, if it was as harmless of a shock as it says, most things don't cry or whimper unless their being hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"One star is too high of a rating for this.This thing worked once when I first got it.

Put it up to your neck, make a barking noise and you get a jolt, certainly not a static shock as they claim. That was their marketing department. I called the company about their claim to be able to lower the shock amount and was told go to radio shack and they will have a resister. I went to radio shack and they laughed. It is one piece plastic and the idea of soldering a resister in is foolish. While the product works, the comanies lack of honesty makes me give an overall D-.

Plus, even if it did, I wouldn't have liked the concept... it's not the dog's bark that signals the collar to work, it's just movement.

REALLY bad idea - even though the directions say for 8 lbs and up, a 15 lb poodle is not big enough. She totally freaked out and wouldn't stop barking, which meant the collar didn't stop either. I finally got it off her and sent it back immediately. For bigger dogs, in my experience the collar has worked well but I wouldn't recommend this for a dog under at least 20 lbs, maybe 30. I ended up using Rescue Remedy, an herbal formula that you put on food and a pheromone diffuser with great success that cured her barking when we were gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"bark collar","review":"I purchased 2 automatic zap collars, 1 for each dog. 1 collar seemed to work ok, but the other was overly sensitive and activated when my dog was not barking.

I think I may try the remote collars next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately wouldn't reccomend for a small dog AT ALL","review":"Got this for my miniature dachshund who tends to bark like crazy. Thought this might be a good solution, since I have tried many types of training and such. The vet actually recommended one, so I decided to try it. I used the product twice before I returned it. The first time he had it on he barked a few times before it even when off, then a small yelp followed. He barked again and got shocked so severely he freaked out and started going nuts barking and yelping in pain. Same result the second time around. I immediately returned this product. I do not recommend this for small dogs at all and am very disappointed in the product. Half the time it did go off (unless he barked very loud) and when it did go off it hurt my dog and made him go nuts. And yes I followed all the fitting instructions given. Not highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"This was bought for a chihuahua. The biggest problem with the anti bark collar was that it went off all the time unpredictably. If we drove over rumble strips it usually went off. It went off when the car door was shut, when Pablo shook himself, sometimes - but not always - when he barked (!) and sometimes for no reason that anyone could figure out. It had a high pitched sound which we could hear all the time however low we set it. In the end Pablo himself seemed to ignore it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work.","review":"I followed the directions and it simply didn't work. It states: To activate it turn the battery in the proper position and slide it across a semi rough surface and it will beep. It does beep, however when I put it on my dog, which has short/little hair on his neck, with a proper tightness, it does not initiate a shock at all. He has a very loud bark and I am severely disappointed in this product. Buyers beware, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Worthless","review":"This worked effectively for about an hour. Then when our dog started barking again, the red warning light didn't even come on. We tightened the collar, followed the instructions in the trouble-shooting guide, and even rushed out to purchase a new replacement battery (for a product that had been opened that day fyi - the battery shouldn't need replacement).

We have tested it, per the instructions, and it says it is working (the light flashes and it emits a beep) but it does nothing when on the dog. The first two times, we saw the light flash, and heard the beep, when the dog barked, but not since then. We have tried tightening it, but if we adjust it so it is any tighter, the dog won't be able to breathe. We loosened it, and it moved out of position on her neck when she got into her bed.

This collar worked right away and 2 months later still no barks. Would have given 4 stars if the battery life was a little better.

It worked mostly - sometimes she would bark for a whole minute or two and THEN get shocked.In order to give the sores some time to heal, we decided to put it on her only during neighborhood quiet hours (we both work the midnight shift). Well, she's not stupid and quickly discovered that she could bark all she wanted as long as she wasn't wearing the collar (which was during the day, when shift-workers are trying to sleep).I wouldn't recommend it, unless you're into hearing your dog scream in pain while electrical contacts drill into her neck. Not to mention that by the looks of it, the dog would have to wear it forever, which in my mind is unacceptable as a training method. If you do buy this product, make sure you try it out on yourself first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the collar and the company","review":"\\"PetSafe\\" goes out of its way to avoid calling this collar what it is: a painful shock-delivery system. Words like \\"static correction\\" and \\"tingle\\" are carefully chosen to give the impression that something other than outright electrical shock is involved. I tested the contacts on my own skin before putting it on my dog and leapt away in astonishment at the level of the shock delivered by the electrodes.The company failed to respond to two email requests for product return information. When at last we contacted them by phone, my wife was rudely informed that no return would be considered for an opened product.Unless you are interested in torturing your pet and supporting an unethical company, I recommend looking elsewhere for bark-correction solutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allie's Mom","review":"After putting this collar on my Pug/Beagle mix who very much has A LOT of Beagle in her (she cries and whines constantly), it seems to have done the trick.

But we also have a small Chihuahua mix who we think tugging on it during play making it tighter. His skin got really infected and it required surgery. Our dog is a brat, he still barks up a storm, but we found a solution. A mesh muzzle we found at Petsmart. We first bought it according to the size chart on the back of the packaging but it is best to try it on your pet, keep your receipt in case it fits too tight.

We couldn't believe how well it worked for about a week until the collar actually ripped and was lost. We found it in the yard tried to tape it back on and it ripped again. It comes on the cheapest kind of thin nylon collar that no one actually would buy for their cat, let alone their dog, because it is obviously flimsy and can't last. And we can't figure out a way to put the device onto another collar. It's so disturbing because otherwise, the collar seemed like a dream come true and worked almost immediately!!!!!!!! BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best money spent","review":"I have a yorkie that barks constantly at any noise he hears. His barking was so bad that my neighbor complained of him barking all night. I tried everything from \\"sonic\\" bark inhibitors (that everyone could hear) to citronella spray collars and nothing worked. The sonic noise didn't bother him, and he realized that the citronella would run out, so he barked till it didn't spray anymore. I bought this bark collar with no hopes of it actually working and was pleasantly surprised. It stopped him from barking and kept him from barking even when I took it off of him. Now he knows when the collar goes on, no barking. I have never been so pleased. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Awsome. Cured the anoying barks in 1 day!","review":"This works. Within 1 day of wearing the collar, 99% of unwarranted barks have ended. Alert barks still happen as a dog is supposed to. My 2 dogs - one Lhasa Apso, one Labrador type mutt - both responded favorably. Also good for the bigger dog who has a bit of apprehension around strangers, and likes to bolt to them and bark! My wife and I are gone 6-8 hours every day, and the dogs have access to 1/2 the house, and the porch (townhouse type environment). We were receiving complaints from neighbors about the dogs barking. One day later, they are quiet.Also this unit is very well made - rubber coated - , and waterproof - not cheap plastic and breakable. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Experience","review":"My dog barks whenever we leave. We recently moved into an apartment and I want to correct the behavior. Bought the collar, did everything the directions said and left the room. He barked, then two seconds later (when the device activates) he started yelping and screeching like he was injured. I read they may react like this at first, so I waited to see if he would work it out. The screeching got worse and worse. I went to check on him and he had lost control of his bowels and bladder due to the shocks.I feel like the worst pet owner ever for trying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"rooster500","review":"Hoped it would work on a small dog (12 lbs). It sounded good based on the reviews and online manual but it only works 10% of the time. The unit itself is too big and easily slides to the side of the neck and so it won't get activated when the dog barks because it is not directly on the animal's voice box. Instructions emphasize that the contact points have to touch the skin but the prongs are too long so it doesn't fit right. The unit itself is literally bolted onto the strap. Instructions say to cut the excess strap to fit the dog. Once you cut the strap you can't move the unit up or down the strap so it's awkward placing it on the animal. It probably works better on a bigger dog but definitely not on a small one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pet safe PBC-102 No bark Collor","review":"I would not recommend this collor for dogs with long hair. I used it on a 9 month old Malamute with no undercoat yet but the prongs still had a problem making contact with the skin (which is necessary to work effectively). To remedy this I tried to tighten the collor to create closer contact but this resulted in my dog constantly hacking and throwing up on the carpet. I next shaved my dogs neck and loosened the collar, but the shock this created for this size of dog was only slightly irratating and the barking continued. I believe this collar would be an effective tool on small shorter hair breeds, but I would avoid attemping to expect positive results on larger breeds. I'd rate it a 2 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Really WORKS!!","review":"I bought this for my terrier dog, and to my amazement, it really does work! I reccomend this for anyone who wants to control that annoying 'bark'. We tried the sonic one, and it was a joke! It actually had my dogs barking even more. Thanks Petsafe for this awsome device which allows us to keep our dog!!PSSo, my husband did remind me to let you guys know that the 1st time the collar was put on, it came as a real shock to her. She cried and made it go off even more, which initially scared me, but after that 1st time, she was OK. She has only barked a few times since, but mainly that '1st initial shock' really did it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I'm pleased with these bark collars and I recommend them to anyone who needs one. It's not easy to see your pet get hurt but it wasn't so bad with this. As a matter of fact, for me it worked the first time. My dogs do not bark when they have these collars on since the first time I used them. Now, everyone once in a while they forget but they get a subtle reminder with the first level of warning. They don't wear them all the time and they hardly ever bark now. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace and quiet,,,,,,,,,,finally !","review":"I can't say long term how well this product will do, because I have only had it a couple of hours, but my Jack Russell Terrier has only barked twice since I put it on him. At least for the moment, my house is quiet and I love it.Now I can give my dog positve loving attention instead of the negative attention I was giving him because of his incessant yapping.I bought replacement batteries after a year, and the collar didn't seem to work as well as it did right out of the box. I figured the batteries weren't charged so I check them with my volt meter and they showed the correct voltage, so I don't know what the problem wasI turned around and bought a second identical collar and it didn't work as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible experience","review":"I bought this item based on all the positive reviews it received hoping to help with my 3 year old Australian shepherds barking issue. I followed the instructions and put the collar on him. He barked at someone he saw and the collar beeped then shocked him, he jumped into the air let out a very loud cry, then it shocked him again when he cried and it repeated this over and over. He ran about the house screaming in pain like he was being skinned alive, until i could get it off of him. I feel horrible for putting this on him, buyer beware, it may just be too much for some dogs, i would recommend a remote collar so you can control the correction and not worry about this sort of thing happening. I would never buy something like this again, or recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"Either this came with a dead battery, it doesn't work or my dog is immune to it.

Very disappointing to receive broken product."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't last","review":"This collar initially was a huge help controlling the barking of my large mixed breed chronic yapper. It didn't distress her, but she didn't sit in the front yard barking just to hear herself bark. However, after 6 months, the batteries wore out, and the company's replacement batteries only last a day. I've tried six batteries from two different sources, and they each work for less than a day. The collar must some how be draining them, because I can't believe ALL the batteries are bad. An expensive disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with it.","review":"It worked the first time I put it on my dog. You could hear it working. She figured it out within about 3 barks and got the message, so I thought it was a success, but then it never really worked after that. I certainly never heard it again. I tried replacing the batteries twice, but nada. My dog still barks less but is slowly figuring it out that it's not working. I don't know if it's the batteries or the collar (but if I have to replace the batteries after every use it's certainly not worth it.) Anyways I've gone ahead and ordered http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00173CWDW/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 mostly because it's rechargable! Hopefully it last longer than this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya callate perra...","review":"My non stop barking dog was getting on my last nerve. I couldn't sleep with all the barking at night.

Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So thankful... Not anymore!","review":"After trying multiple ways to stop our beloved dog from his almost constant barking, and none of them working, we finally gave in to this static collar. Not only is our family more at peace, but our dog is more peaceful and calm. He is definitely much happier since he isn't consumed with his barking. At first it was odd not having him bark, like he lost his voice, but it is so much better not having him bark at EVERYTHING!!! For anyone skeptical...give it a try. You will enjoy your dog so much more!UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW~ we are sending the bark collar back. For some reason, it has stopped working completely. When we replace the battery it works for a few days, then nothing. I wish it would've continued on with it's original success with our dog, as his barking is once more a disruption to his peace and calm. I'm very disappointed that it didn't work. Loved the results when it was functioning properly though! Off to find something else to help. Good luck to you all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Perfectly","review":"I have a 5 month old lab mix and it worked perfectly on her. She would bark for hours on end when I was gone, and I put this on her one day and she's not barked since. Will not work on small dogs (she's over 30 lbs.) and sometimes when she shakes, it will move so that it won't work anymore.Overall, it's been wonderful. I only had to use it a couple times and she learned very quickly not to bark.

When I lost it, I replaced it with this one. I don't like it because you cannot control the degree of the shock. The other one I could put it on high when I was in situations where I knew my dog would bark and my dog would stop immediately. This one takes a longer time and the dog can be almost in a barking frenzy before it begins to go off and then it really shocks him.The more expensive one is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"works well but runs out of battery very fast, after about 3 batteries we learned to take the battery out when the collar is not being worn to help lenghthen battery life, its annoying (because we only put it on when we are not home), but a new battery every few days is too expensive.

The Doberman loves to bark 24/7, we tried everything and were getting complaints from neighbors. We tried this bark collar. It reduced her barking for awhile, but I think she's become immune to it. When we put it on her (with new batteries placed properly on her neck) she still barks and doesn't really have any reaction as to being shocked. My son got the bright idea that he'd test it on himself....it works. I can't fault the product and not sure I'd want something with a stronger shock because I don't want to hurt her."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not perfect","review":"I felt bad puting one of these on my dog to begin with but his barking was out if controll.

We still use it if we know there is going to be a situation where he is goin to bark but for the most part keep it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT safe...","review":"I put the collar on my beagle this weekend to help with nuisance barking. I thought it would be okay to give her a little shock when she barked. The first time she wore it it was just for a few minutes, and she barked twice and then we took it off. The second time I went to the bathroom and she started barking, and it shocked her and then she yelped, then it shocked her again, and yelped, etc. It was SO STRONG that she started spewing vomit, and was very panicked. I tried to calm her down, but I couldn't because she kept yelping. The only way to get the product to stop was to get it off of her, so I had to get her to stand near me for long enough to undo the buckle, which was very hard to do. It would have been nice if there was a remote included as well for situations like this when you just need it to shut off. I will never use this product again and am returning it as I do not feel it is safe to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This is the most horrible product ever.

I bought this collar because of its price and hoped it would solve the problem. What i did not realize is that my dog is sensitive to pain. He barked and it shocked him, and he started yelping and it kept shocking him only getting more intense. My dog ended up pooping all over my house as I was trying to take the collar off.

However, a battery a day is just ridicules. I bought this collar for my puppy because he barked non-stop any time he was left alone. He would seriously bark for hours on end. This collar (along with 6 consecutive batteries/days of use) put a quick stop to that before it became a habit. I am just reluctant to buy more batteries for it because the last battery I had was installed but the collar never even went on the puppy and the next day the battery was blinking indicating it was almost dead after sitting idle!

Just in case it was the dog and not the hair, I tried it on a Samoyed, with much less of a ruff, but it didn't work on her either.

Battery dead in 24 hours. Replaced battery twice again and the same thing happened both times. The dog only barked a few times in each case, so it wasn't activity that killed the batteries. Both collars are sitting on a shelf now.I did notice at least one other reviewer with a similar \\"24 hour battery life\\" problem.

I paid to sweat not listen to testimonials.Richard assumes you know the meaning of the steps he yells out. I didn't. He's got a large group of folks sweatin with him.The camera pans them so often and badly I might add that you can't follow the routine. Not all of them are doing thesame thing and when the camera does go to Richard it's his face/body and nothing of his feet.Very, very poorly instructed and filmed. Don't waste your time or money. I sent mine back. Amazon gladly refunded my money.I found a great way to exercise at home with Leslie Sansone. You get a great cardio/aerobic workout and you can find her online at Exercise TV. Not only do you get a great work out, she's free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formatted to not play on DVD-R","review":"These DVDs have been formatted so that they will not even play on a DVD-R to avoid any chance of bootleg copies. I have a DVD-R because my VCR finally broke and I like to tape televised sporting events. I have not and will not ever copy a DVD but Richard Simmons has assumed that someone will and has prevented me from even using the DVDs. I am extremely disappointed. I have Sweated to the Oldies for many years and do love the routines and work-outs but now I can not. Anyone who has watched the tapes (VHS or otherwise) knows that he even threatens to arrest his own mother for copyright infringement..well I'm not laughing now. It's ridiculous. It should clearly state on the DVD case or product information that the DVDs will not play on DVD-R. He has lost a customer and a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Simmons","review":"I have all these on tape and wanted to upgrade to CD's, good exercise to work out.

I was sure that Richard would be completely unbearable and annoying, but surprisingly... these workouts are FUN! He doesn't do a lot of coaching and encouraging throughout the workout like some other workout DVDs I have tried, which I appreicate because I find that to be a very annoying characteristic of other home workout instructors. Not only did I find it to be enjoyable, but I was actually breaking a sweat! This has been a great purchase for me and will be for you, too if you are looking for a way to workout in the morning before work, but can't quite make it to the gym that early."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like the orginal!","review":"I had these in tapes back in the early late 80's or early 90's...

Who would have thought that exercise could be so much fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, not fun","review":"Thought this was going to be a good way to excercise, was wrong. Music not as great as expected. You have to see the introduction, which is a do-not make copies video of him and his mother... the same in every dvd, annoying and boring... and dvd does not allow fast forward. He changes his movements constantly... Did not like at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much fun","review":"I hoped for the best but this is my least favorite dance-exercise video and wish I had not bought it. The music is redone by a band, no songs are by the original artists and even if the music was the original, the tunes chosen do not inspire exercising. As well, after each dance, the workout stops while all the dancers clap & give thanks to the band. This doesn't help.I realize the choice of tunes for the beginning must be meant as a warm-up, but who can get inspired to dance listening to 'On Broadway' and 'Beyond the Sea'? Granted, there is 'Great Balls of Fire' but the choices of 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' and 'Peggy Sue' just don't cut it. There are far better tunes that could have been chosen & the original artists paid for the use of those tunes. Save your money, this one is a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed AT ALL!!","review":"I purchased this because I am an exercise beginner.

And when he says sweat yes you do & it's easy & fun! I switch the video's around because he works on all different routines.#2 he even tricked you & through in some floor exercises & used weights. He used pop bottles I used real weights but they really wore me out! I hope Richard keeps making these video's he really inspires me to workout with him. Thank You!! I'm 60 years old & it doesn't matter how old you are you just do what you can & it does get easier if you think any of them are hard.Each workout is 1 hour long & that's perfect. When you are working out you think to yourself this isn't going to do anything but you eat your words by the time your done because you feel good that you did it & your sweatin.

One thing that is true is that there is not a lot of cuing. But the moves are so simple that I don't feel like I missed out on them at all. I absolutely love it, because it feels more like fun/natural dancing than any other cardio dance dvd I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still rockin after all these years","review":"I had all these video's on VHS tapes, but haven't had a VHS Player for several years now. My weight has begun to increase and I decided it's time to reverse the trend. This workout was always perfect for me, low impact on my knee's is a huge consideration. They are just as I remember, fun with a great warm up and cool down. Richard get's my heart pumping. I can increase or decrease the intensity by small adjustments and get a quality workout. The hardest part is my 12 year old daughter laughs at me while I work out, but she's starting to join me so we will both benifit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor DVD quality unfortunately","review":"My mother used to workout to Richard Simmons and I just couldn't remember which tape she liked.Well we got the DVDs and it turns out to be Sweatin to the Oldies Vol. 3 that she loves. The other ones she said the music was terrible that she had to shut off.Also the DVD quality was poor. It's supposed to get better when converting from tape to DVD but maybe it was just the set i got.Returning the item was super simple through amazon.So now, I will find Sweatin to the Oldies 2 & 3, and Disco sweat which she loved.My mother is very heavy set and I think these are the best workouts for her body. She's not intimidated at all with the people in the workout because they're all different sizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one I use very much","review":"If I feel like taking it easy I'll put in this DVD, otherwise, the routines are pretty lame-o. But great if you're more than 50 lbs. overweight since it's low impact. Simmons is self-indulgent and seems to be doing the steps as they come to him. We're not given any warning or heads up when he suddenly goes into the next bit. The live band is a distraction (as good as they are) because Simmons bounces and squeals like a school girl after every song. I just want a challenging, no-nonsense workout, please. If you're a Richard Simmons uber fan, then this one's for you! If not, I would try Hip Hop Abs by Beachbody. Now THAT's a fun energetic workout with a host who's engaging, fun, instructive and...of course, great to look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to do!!","review":"I found it was easy to follow and I could definetly go at my own pace,,,,the product was a described,,,I have no complaints and would buy from this seller again...!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"My 2-year old granddaughter and I are having a lot of fun dancing to the Oldies with Richard Simmons.

Whether you like Richard Simmon's or not, you will enjoy these workouts. I bought the complete collection so that we could have some variety in our workouts. The kids have a great time and so do I because I exercise right along with them. Because of the music and the dance-like moves, the time goes by quickly and yet when you are done, you are sweating and know you have done aerobics. There are also strength and flexibility exercises that are fun and effective. You should try them out for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exercise tape","review":"As usual, Richard is his great self in this remake to dvd of Sweatin to the Oldies.

I've heard him read from his next collection, and it is some good work. But the poems in _The Nerve_ are weak and not very spectacular. They are too quiet for lack of a better word. Maxwell can do better than this. Let's just hope he does."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Vig","review":"The movie was not the greatest, ending sort of weird, but I love Vig Mortensen in anything.

Good acting and a good plot, though I felt Naomi Watts was understated and under used. The feel of the movie is not overly dark as it may seem, but there definitely is a fair share of gore. It is also definitely not a movie for younger viewers. My greatest complaint would be it felt the movie ended with only two thirds of the story told, but that does not take away from the quality of the movie itself. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prmises to Keep You on the Edge of Your Seat","review":"Combine wonderful actors with a world-class director and the result is a great little thriller that is surprisingly tense in a slow-moving sort of way.

AA+ One of Viggo Mortensen's best movies. Best fight scene in the spa that I have ever seen. The story is full of twists and turns and will surprise you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth Your Time","review":"A taut, intelligent and well-acted thriller all about identity and how far you're willing to go. Very well shot and directed with no padding, and action sequences that actually serve the plot instead of the other way around. Wonderful casting, and Armin Mueller-Stahl especially is simply fantastic as a far too helpful restaurant owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar Worthy","review":"I thought The History of Violence was as good as it gets for Viggo Mortensen, but this was truly an Oscar Worthy performance. The story and characters are fresh and original, no copies here, and although Naomi Watt's character seemed a tad naive, she still was convincing and endearing. This was a seriously suspenseful movie with excellent characters for you to love and hate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cronenberg gone soft??","review":"Yup...this is about as \\"enjoyable\\" as a Cronenberg film is likely to get, complete with a (relatively) happy ending. Of course there is still the obsession with graphic violence, blood, etc....but it is not done here simply to gross out the audience or to shock the viewer and it comes in very limited portions. The performances are solid with none truly standing out over another--just believable all around. The story is tight and kept short...Cronenberg doesn't let the story dwell too long in any one place and keepts things moving---something more modern directors should learn from...All in all a great piece of entertainment..."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAVID CRONENBERG, OPUS 17","review":"**** 2007. Directed by David Cronenberg. One nomination for the Oscars (Viggo Mortensen) and three nominations for the Golden Globes. A nurse discovers the world of the Russian mob in London when she starts to read the diary of a dead 14 years old prostitute. The description of the peculiar world of the Russian mobsters and the characters played by Viggo Mortensen and Vincent Cassel should lead you to see this very violent film of the Canadian master. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect gangster movie","review":"It's such a simple, nearly cliched, mob story. But it's told here with a frankness and brutality that is something to behold. Not an uplifting tale, but a gritty tale that seems, as much as these things can to a random middle class American, realistic. The tattoos are remarkable as is the look at a very different (Russian) mafia."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gaping hole","review":"At the end of this fascinating story, just before the finish, there is a huge jump in the story. The character jumps from B to E. You wonder how did he get here? If only the director had shared with us some of the detail. It's as if we flipped to the last page of the book. It's good, but could have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"vig","review":"I just like Vig Mortensen. Especially in Hidalgo. This movie was a little different but he was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jason Statham movie","review":"This movie was okay. Viggo Mortensen was fantastic as usual, but mis-/under-utilized. Without his performance, this would essentially have been a \\"Jason Statham\\" action movie. There were a number of cringe-worthy dialogue moments, as well as general heavy-handedness; the music in scenes telling you \\"this is an important scene,\\" for example. This was a decidedly NOT deep movie, which was too bad since it seemed to think it was. History of Violence was a much much better movie, though it seems not so much due to Cronenberg. This one reminds me of the final showdown scene in HOV (the worst, most dumb action movie part of the movie - \\"brohim\\" indeed!) but for a whole film. I enjoy good action scenes, and there were one or two in this one, but that is about all there was to it. It was mercifully short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie on HD-DVD. However... Subtitle Problems Exist!","review":"GREAT movie by David Cronenberg with an absolutely riveting performance by Viggo Mortensen (a career high on all counts,)Picture quality on HD-DVD is stunning, with the gloomy dark exteriors of modern-day London perfectly captured, along with food-rich, colorful Russian festivities.My one complaint is that about 1/4 of my English subtitles were \\"cut off\\" on the left side of the screen. I'm playing my HD-DVDs on a Toshiba HD-2 player that has never presented that problem with other HD-DVDs.It was annoying to not be able to read the entire subtitle, but for the most part, not difficult to figure out what was missing. Anyone else have this problem with this title? Please post."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent on Every Level","review":"This is one of my two favorite films of 2007 (tied with \\"Into the Wild\\") and offers exceptional performances, especially by multi-award-nominated Viggo Mortensen. Cronenberg skillfully uses the brutal violence to tell the story, but without being gratuitious. It's fast paced, compelling, emotional and will surely stay with you long after the closing credits.The special features are minimal, but it's still a must-own for modern film collectors and fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Eastern Promises\\" Doesn't Quite Deliver!!","review":"Alright, I originally saw the previews for this movie while watching another movie in the theater.... \\"Eastern Promises\\" plot/storyline sounded intriguing to say the least.I recently saw this movie on dvd rental and it was awful!! It is slow, incredibly, heart-wrenchingly slooooow to watch!! Several times I wanted to stop this movie and just return it. I kept watching \\"Eastern Promises\\" as I figured it must have a good ending but it didn't. There were lots of loose ends that weren't adequately answered at the end of the movie. Lots of themes/topics were superficially touched upon, but never quite explored in the kind of detail that could have made this a movie an all around great one.Naomi Watts & Viggo Mortensen were the only shining stars in this movie as their acting was the best part of the entire film."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT CAST & PERFORMANCES, BUT SERIOUSLY FLAWED!","review":"This film while having a good story and cast is really hard to follow. The thick accent and mumbling of characters had me straining and backing my TiVo up too many times! I also felt that some scenes were excruciatingly long and slow! I almost wanted to fast forward, which is never a good sign. This has got to be one of Cronenberg's worst films! Some viewers may like it more than I did, I will never sit through this a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as suspenseful and thrilling as \\"A History of Violence\\"","review":"This movie is not as suspenseful and thrilling as \\"A History of Violence\\". Viggo Mortensen's acting is good but he can't save the film. It's worth seeing for curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this movie but...","review":"I am very disappointed. The actors give it their best but how could you possibly save an ill-constructed story line????? It looks as if David Cronenberg wanted different kind of scenes (violence, sex etc...) and sort of patched them up together. I felt bad for Vincent Cassel, his script was soooo silly. The story is filled with loopholes. One more thing : inserting violence and sex for no other reason than for the wow factor is pathetic. I really wanted to like the movie, I mean, I love Viggo Mortensen, I could forgive him practically anything but geez!!! this movie is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"good fights; should have had more fights","review":"I was kinda bored. Expected more fights. The fights that were there were good. Should have more fights and better ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable and fascinating film, but also violent!","review":"OK, if you read reviews about this film, you will find the comments range from \\"first class\\" to \\"terrible\\", so what is the truth.Art is personal. IMO, all are true.IMO, this is a flawed film, with remarkable elements, definitely a film to be viewed, for those interested in film, interested in fine acting, interested in experiencing another social / criminal world, interested in a triller.This film is not for the faint of heart. It is very violent. The strange thing is though, no guns, no chase scenes, no explosions, actually only several deaths, but with acting, filming, situations which make these scenes so memorable and frightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I purchased a DVD from the seller and when I opened the package there was a sticky tag on one side of the DVD and upon removal it ruined the disk. It was obviously repackaged. It was only $5 but when you can only use it as a coaster, it's $5 too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously implausible script","review":"Apart from Viggo Mortensen, this movie is a waste of time. If they had acted it just a bit more over the top, it would have been a fine dark comedy. As it is, it's just dull and unrealistic. The violence is graphic and lurid, but doesn't add much to theme or plot. I felt it was gratuitous. If you want to see a much better movie about Russian mob life, try either \\"Brat\\" (Brother), \\"Brat II\\", or \\"Friend of the Deceased\\" (Ukrainian film). These three films have a lot more to say about life in the criminal trades, and just being human, than \\"Eastern Promises\\".

Actually, he's one of the most important filmakers ever.Mortessen perform a incredible, perfect work. I guess I was clear, the movie is great.The BIG problem here is that this combo edition (HD DVD & standard DVD) deliver a horrible idea: discrimination.Can you believe that the standard DVD has spanish subtitles and the High definition (on the other side) HAS NOT?I think it's time to listen some person from Focus who explain if this company think that the population who speaks spanish hasn't the sources or the gift to enjoy High defnition. Probabily they think we are dumbs, and watch in standard definition is the same thing to watch HD. And without the capacity to value HD.Incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva Viggo and Cronenberg","review":"Saw the trailer to this movie and I must say I was hooked. I went to see it the other day and I was not disappointed in the least. Viggo Mortenson was just tremendous. His portrayal of the Russian Mafia godfathers sons driver was powerful, menacing and dead on. Vincent Cassel was also perfect in the role of the son of the Russian mobster. Naomi Watts was aslo great as usual. The only thing I can say that some might be turned off by is the VERY graphic violence but it goes right along with the subject though it is a bit hard to watch sometimes.I will buy this when it comes out on DVD. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie.","review":"So many bad movies out there but have seen this one several times now.

I would recommend because it is entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"Based on the mafia involvement of a Russian family in the majestic city of London, Eastern Promises is packed with some strong performances by it's frontline actors. Naomi Watts has proved herself in this particular role. She doesn't look as good as she acts and that's a compliment. The film had just the right amount of tenacity to hold the viewer's interest. There is an action scene in which a man fights like a warrior in the nude. This may not be as good as American Gangster but I can imagine Eastern Promises to win many awards this year. Better than History of Violence and more brutal, Eastern Promises is something you will take seriously. An absolutely vital recommendation for fans of crime/thriller drama genre. Newage Godfather that doesn't seem to try hard at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"fully-drawn, nuanced performances by Mortensen and Watts","review":"If the BBC produced a drama pulling back the veil on the Russian mob in London (which they did), Eastern Promises would be that movie (which it is). A few scenes of extreme graphic violence aside, 'Promises' is built of more subtle dramatic ingredients than what most American audiences have come to expect from an Action Flick. Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts, and the supporting cast turn in fully drawn, nuanced performances. Speaking personally, this is the movie that has me take notice of Watts as a dramatic actress in a way I hadn't before. All of the research that went into the making of this film pays off, giving us a rich, detailed look at a real-life underworld uncomfortably close to home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but very good!","review":"The David Murray Octet (which at the time consisted of the leader on tenor and bass clarinet, trumpeters Baikida Carroll and Hugh Ragin, trombonist Craig Harris, altoist John Purcell, pianist Steve Colson, bassist Wilbur Morris and drummer Ralph Peterson) plays very well on four of their leaders lengthy originals. Each composition is memorable in its own respect, with very strong themes, typical of David Murray's pieces. The octet features a good combination of adventurous soloing and colorful writing.

Good quality; and very practical (you can just stick them to the fridge for storing). They finally broke after almost 8 years. I ordered these, believing they would be identical. Big disappointment! According to the description and the photo the cover is magnetic but, beware, it is NOT. Just an ordinary pair of kitchen scissors in a non-magnetic cover. Completely unusable to us. I had to return them.UPDATE: the review is for the scissors by the way, NOT the seller, MV Trading. They have been very responsive handling my return and could not have been more apologetic about the erroneous posting."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but NOT magnetic!","review":"I was disappointed with these scissors. I guess they are as good as average kitchen scissors, but I wish now I had purchased some that came apart for cleaning. I really wanted these because they were advertised as magnetic and my drawer space is very limited. That's not the case. I went back to look on Amazon and the picture is very different than what I received. Mine have no magnetic buttons on the sheath.

Back in the 80's, The Police were given such a loving pat on the head by critics. I could only come to one conclusion. As with new wave, the mainstream were hoping the Police's brand of inoffensive music would put a more acceptable image on punk rock. The reality was their gutless music was generally just a cut above soft rock and lyrically they were irrelevant compared to many REAL punk bands.Lo and behold the masses ate it up and went a step further putting a phony like Sting on a pedestal, as a spokesperson for indigenous populations of South America.If commercially intended wimpy soft rock is your thing, then any Police CD will go well with your boring middle class friends, cheap beer and colored sweaters.

The Police's rhythmic interplay between just three guys is the standard to be measured by. Stewart Copeland's drumming is so rhythmic, it sound like he's got three rhythms going on at one time. He is truly one of the greatest drummers in rock history. Sting is also one of the all-time great singers.

What's missing in the whole is emotional maturity one hears from Kyung Wha Chung, Ida Haendel and yes, Yehudi Menuhin and Nigel Kennedy's first recording as well as the acceptance that despite words to the contrary, the English are some of the most emotional people on the planet - which explains the rich and overwhelming orchestration of this work, which should always be showcased in \\"epic proportions\\".No, this is not to say that the Hahn/Davis/LSO effort was wasted, but secret love is not to be kept lightly or, in this case, \\"taken lightly\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillary is not a true violinist","review":"seriously people, please LISTEN to this recording and any other hillary's CD's, she is horrible at the violin. as a professional vioinist, I hate to admit that I see a decline in younge violinists and classical music standard.

By the second time listening to it I got more & more of a feeling for the musical lines. It's a recording I could listen to a bunch of times.

CK Express is about the desire of men and women to connect with each other and the loneliness that everyone goes through in the process. Faye Wang, who plays the counter girl at the food shop, is very funny and gives a genuinely affecting performance. Please don't be discouraged in the beginning by the less than conventional \\"plot\\" or other quirkiness in the film. It will reward those who stay with it.

Offbeat, different, funny and magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the \\"Madonna of Mandarin\\"","review":"Great film, but I believe \\"somebody nobody\\" is incorrect to call Faye Wong the \\"Madonna of Mandarin\\". Perhaps he confuses Faye with the late Anita Mui? Though Anita was primarily a Cantonese singer, not a Mandarin one, she - at least - had been occasionally compared to Madonna, given her wild onstage fashions and manner. Faye Wong, on the other hand, shares nothing with Madonna that I recognize. Instead, she has frequently been compared to Bjork and that gal from The Cranberry's (both of whom Faye has covered), though I think these comparisons pretty much begin and end with the covers (especially in Bjork's case).Otherwise, \\"somebody nobody\\"'s review is on target. The only thing I can add is... if you don't absolutely LOVE the song California Dreamin' (as I do), then - as wonderful as this film is - you are not likely to enjoy it, given that this song is repeated over and over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie!","review":"Just watched this movie, and omg, it's so wonderful.

It should have been a 30 minute movie. So for the next hour or so we get to watch Tony Leung Chiu Wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs. Wow, what a movie.

The language switches from Mandarin to Cantonese to English and sometimes Japanese. The first story made absolutely no sense, while the second story was slightly more interesting but downright weird.Both stories seem to have been filmed with a handheld camera making the shots very shakey. Also, both stories seem centered on repeating a single song for a character. Also, the timelines shift so suddenly back and forth that it's hard for anyone to follow.Some people may like this movie, but it made no sense to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different? Yes. Good? Well...","review":"This overrated film by hip oriental director Wong Kar-Wai manages to be mildly intriguing and interesting at times but for the most part it just misses its target. Yes, there is some stylish and neat directing to find here, as well as some weird and offbeat scenes once in a while, yet the movie is ultimately too long and it seems to lack a point. What begins as an appealing story (or stories) about urban alienation and the isolation of some japanese youngsters soon turns into a repetitive, tiresome and, at parts, irritating cinematic experience (\\"California Dreaming\\", anyone??). The characters range from frustrated daydreamers to annoying and erratic losers who can\`t seem to find a goal for their lives. \\"Chungking Express\\" is quircky and kind of amusing here and there, still overall it fails to convince.Average."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best foreign language romantic comedies ever!","review":"What can you say, Wong Kar Wai is a genius and this is his most light hearted and funniest movie. It may seem a little dated but the characters are classic and the situations in which they meet all seem so plausible minus the whole drug connection thing. Leaves you with a smile long after the movie is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camera case review","review":"It's an expensive camera accessory, but well worth the investment.

I appreciate the theological perspectives showing Cranmer's position in comparison with other Reformers of the age. The author also does a great job of showing how Cranmer's theology developped over time. However, the book can be a bit dry, and I find myself skimming a few pages here and there that seem irrelevant (TMI!). Overall a good portrayal of a complex person in a complex time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterful biography","review":"Many Anglican history books have an axe to grind. But not this masterful biography. The Thomas Cranmer of MacCulloch is very human, but no villian nor an unblemished hero.We see his theological evolution from a fairly orthodox Catholic to a stauch Protestant who went to the stake in defiance of Bloody Mary and the \\"Antichrist\\" Pope.MacCulloch also takes the reader into the historical sources and their reliability. These, along with his extensive footnotes will be of interest to any serious student of Anglican history.Yet this longish book is very readable and rarely gets bogged down, again unlike some other Anglican histories.If you want to learn about Thomas Cranmer or about early Anglicanism, this book is a must read.Mark Marshall is the author of God Knows What It's Like to be a Teenager."},{"rating":"2","title":"MacCulloch on Thomas Cranmer is a masterpiece","review":"Exquisely researched and engagingly written, Diarmaid MacCulloch brought to life a figure who played a substantial role in both English and church history during the Reformation, and whose legacy lives on. I feel that for the first time in more than 30 years of bumping into Henry VIII's Archbishop of Canterbury, and of regularly using the Book of Common Prayer that he master-minded, I have properly met the man. MacCulloch obviously adores Cranmer, but is not blind to his shortcomings. He also shows the cost to Cranmer of bringing about fundamental change in the English Church -- ultimately losing his life. I came away from the book marveling at the richness and stature of the Anglican way of believing, and the part Cranmer played in making it happen. I have been heralding it from the housetops!

It doesn't even have an indicator to tell whether it is on or off. It must be very tight around the dog's neck to make the proper contact.

The last one was a must, since I have 2 water dogs - lab and weimaraner - and planned to use it on my lab (who runs off and ceases to listen to me at all). I tried it on in the yard, worked fine I guess, but might have been inconsistent (she sometimes reacted to the buzz, sometimes not, and it was on the same setting... faulty collar or selective dog?). We went out on a walk, and they of course went for a swim, and then of course she ran off. Ready, set - buzz! Nothing. At all. Whenever she did decide to wander back my way I readjusted and tried the tone - nothing. Got home, took the batteries out and had to dry them off! Not sure if the unit will work once it dries out, but regardless I'm returning it. It says waterproof, I expect it to be waterproof. Guess I'll have to get a more reliable model, even if it is more expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delay in shock make this product useless","review":"Product seems to be fairly well made, but there is about a 2 second delay, and sometimes longer, from the time you hit the remote button until the time the dog receives the shock. This is unacceptable. We purchased this unit because we have a new dog being introduced to our 3 cats. We don't want to have to wait a few seconds before the dog is corrected; he can chase and catch a cat in that amount of time. We need instant results when we push the button, and we're not sure why this product doesn't provide that. Unfortunately, we waited too long before we discovered this problem, so we cannot sent this back. We would return it if we could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third time won't be a charm...","review":"Bought one unit about 7 months ago. Didn't keep the warranty info...my problem.

I've decided that I've learned and do not want this unreliable model even if it is replaced under warranty.

I would let her run without a leash and everytime no matter what I did she would not come, even treats and such wouldnt work. After putting the collar on her and after saying come I gave her a mild shock. That didnt work, but I could tell it only pissed her off a little. So I turned it up to maybe 5 and did it again with repeating COME. After just 2-3 times of doing this, I never had to use it again, but well worth the money.

When it came to her jumping, I would have to use the \\"SHOCK\\" button and I say shock because I had to set it so high - 7 or 8 - for it to make any impact and at that point, it hurt her, causing her great pain.

However, it often doesn't work. I changed batteries and it still has very sporadic performance. You cannot expect it to work at a distance of over 10 yards. Most times is works 50-75% of the time. The quality of the remote is cheap plastic. After a few months of use, the remote started to fall apart and made it difficult to press the buttons. Also the dial for the level of shock doesn't seem very accurate.Generally, I wouldn't recommend this device. Find a better more reliable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked","review":"This was a last resort. But it worked. I was going to have abdominal surgery and could not have my 50 pound \\"puppy\\" jumping up and/or getting into things he shouldn't (trash, litter box, etc.) so a month before my surgery I started his training and by the time I was home from the hospital my furbaby was MUCH better disciplined and did not have to be crated the entire time.

When people come in, he jumps all over them, whether they are 80 or 2 years old. He even knocked people down. We just can't have that. We really didn't want to result to a shock collar, but we had to get control. We use the sound alert mostly. It gets his attention & works most of the time. Then we go to the shock on low settings until he responds. It seems like he is getting better. Now if he hears the sound, he calms down much quicker. He still get jumpy, but not nearly as bad. I think it will continue to get better as he learns. He actually likes to put it on! (I think because he know company is coming)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal performance","review":"This item worked well when it worked. The sound and shocker didn't always work. I had to press the buttons several times to get to activate. Battery performance, as noted in other reviews, was also unimpressive. The extra batteries that I bought from Amazon were not the correct ones, so that was another $7 lost. Also, the clip on the collar broke, so now it's safety pinned. For nearly $100 I feel they could use decent material. It did improve my dog's behavior, but the hassle in it's use only gets it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for the long haul","review":"We really liked this trainer at first. It did help to get our dog's attention and he nicely became more cooperative. However, it has never worked for a distance. It only works for about 10 feet. We've had it for over a year and have dealt with increasing problems. The batteries need replacing every two weeks, the shock works sporatically, and a couple of times the stimulation (shock) button stuck, which was not at all what we would ever want to happen. I would suggest you look for a collar with rechargable batteries and one for longer distances."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is unsafe","review":"We purchased this item to help train a very enthusiastic yellow lab. The controller was setting on a table. The dog was wearing the collar. Suddenly, it went off for no reason.(there was no one near the unit and there are no children in my home to wonder about.) The poor dog ran thru the house \\"screaming.\\" The thing would not shut off. My husband turned it all the way down, finally caught the dog, and yanked the collar off of him. I have contacted the seller twice to get a return authorization. They will not return my calls. What a waste of almost $100.00 after shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Grades for Quality and Performance","review":"I bought this training collar to train a hard-headed German Shepherd puppy, but the collar does not trigger every time I press the button on the remote.For maximum effectiveness I would expect 100 percent reliability and I would rate this one at 60-75 percent reliable. I would not recomment it to the serious dog trainer.It does not seem to be the battery hog as others have indicated, but the inconsistencies noted in its failure to function every time lead me to give it a low rating for quality, performance and reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"product doesn't work","review":"I read all of the reviews before I purchased this and knew that batteries might be an issue, so when my collar didn't work properly, I bought new batteries hoping that was the problem. The collar never worked below a setting of 5, and rarely worked above that setting. When it did work, it was inconsistent in its power. Additionally, its range was less than 15 feet--not much help when your dog is racing around the backyard or throughout the house in a barking frenzy. This is a product that needs to be consistent if it is to be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple to use and works great.","review":"After owning other training collars, I can say that the Petsafe PDBDT-305 easily tops anything in this price range. It's extremely easy to set up and to use. Simply insert the batteries and go! No paring up like other trainers. Having the correction level on a dial on the remote is a wonderful feature. Another collar I owned had it under the battery cover, and had to be adjusted with a series of switches. But perhaps the best feature of this unit is that it uses standard batteries. No more searching pet stores for specialty batteries that cost $10 each!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Training collar","review":"Initial collar I ordered stopped working after about a week. I believe it was possibly defective. However, Amazon quickly sent me a replacement free of charge. Second collar seems to be working fine. I was very happy with the service I received for the replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Sometimes","review":"The collar only works sometimes. I checked the connections with the neon lamp and it is lighting up but my dog is not feeling a charge 80-90% of the time even when it's set at 8 or 9. I switched to the longer probs and it still isn't working as promised. My next option is to shave his neck and try to improve contact that way. I noticed that the button sometimes sticks in the charge position and if it happens to be the time that the dog is actually feeling the charge he jumps several times becasue of the continued shock before I realize the button is stuck. If shaving his neck works and I can \\"zap\\" him using a 5 or 6 I will say the collar is worth it but if I must crank it up to 8 or 9 and really cause considerable discomfort I won't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETE JUNK - DON'T ORDER!!!!","review":"My wife and I purchased this product several months ago to help us keep our young Labrador Retriever under control and have been nothing but disappointed with this product. The customer service department was very responsive in replacing the product the first time, but the second unit behaves the same as the first. When the units were brand new, they would correct the dog as long as he was within ten feet of you. The specs say it has a range of 100 yards, but that is completely false. After about a month, the collar will no longer shock, but it will continue to beep when pressed. We are sick due to the fact that we threw away almost $100 on a piece of cheaply made garbage. Please save yourself some frustration - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"This collar started working with the third press of the remote button! I have just started using these types of pet behavior modification devices in the last month or so and so far am very, very happy with their effectiveness. Behaviorists all state that in order for an undesired behavior to decrease, punishment must be delivered consistently and immediately. This shock collar does both and in so doing, delivers the punishment (the shock) without my very stubborn yellow lab associating the punishment with me. She has been a barker for years and I have tried everything I knew how to do without success. In 5 minutes, my lab got the \\"point\\" and has been silent. I heartily recommend this device for large dogs - even the most stubborn (which mine is! ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"The dog trainer collar did not work... the sound alarm worked but the shock option did not.

Within a couple of months of very light use (I have two dogs who only need a \\"reminder\\" once in a while), the buttons cracked open on the transmitter. This essentially bars its use in a wet environment. Not good. My other beef is that it is truly a pain to change batteries.

Setting the dial to a lower shock number is helpful, and it only takes a couple warning sounds followed by a short zap to get the point across. After which, sound warnings will do the job. But, even after only using sound to warn your dog, the batteries run down quite quickly and will need to be replaced every 6-10 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work on Great Dane","review":"We have an 8 month old great dane. We followed the instructions, and used the training guide it came with. We have a pretty obedient dog, except when we're at the park and she decides to chase someone riding past her on a bike. She only wants to play, but the terrified bike rider just sees a 110+ lb dog ready to kill them. :) We hoped that this would get her attention at a distance. Unfortunately the collar didn't do anything for her. She doesn't care that its on her, no matter what setting we put it at. She still chases bikes and dogs. Also, unless you are pointing it directly at the receiver, it doesn't work. So when the dog is running away from you it didn't work. We tried changing the batteries, and troubleshooting with the company, but nothing has worked. Basically, we're still working on training and have done much better without the use of the collar. If anything, the collar just aggravated her more because it was bulky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Tried the Innotech version first and it was horrible.

At first we were skeptical thinking it would take her cheerful personality away; however, she is still our ornery loving little girl! This collar helped a lot! I believe our dog was only shocked twice, and then the beep button seemed to work great! 1 thing I can say is be consistent! We backed off for a while and she started jumping again, but not nearly like she was! That was error on our part. I know feel much more comfortable bringing our little boy home :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst quality I have ever seen, not reliable","review":"Does not work on long hair dogs. If your dogs has long hair, do not even bother! Secondly it just falls apart. Within a week the metal pins had fallen off so I needed to order more. After a month, the collar completely broke and it wont do any stimulation, it will only beep. It does not work 100 yards, It's lucky if it worked 4 feet. And if you live in a cold climate (anything under 30 F) the collar will stop working after being outside for 10 minutes. I was VERY disappointed.

My first impression was that the remote is large and cumbersome, but I figured it would only be a minor irritation. I took my dog to the park, where I dropped by accident the remote on the grass, and the backing popped off. I figured maybe I didn't have it on right, so I put the remote back together... Next time it fell the remote came apart again, and this time I lost the backing and couldnt find it at all. Needless to say I returned the collar the next day and bought the next most expensive model (also by petsafe) which I have not had any problems with. This one however is a waste of good money.

First, the collar is huge, there has to be a good foot of extra collar - what size dog this is for, I don't know. I am afraid to cut off the excess - afraid the collar will unravel. He chews on the excess. Second, when it is activated he simply turns his head and continues his behavior. By the size it appears to be made for a large dog, but does not give enough oomph for a big dog. I consider this to be a huge waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, Maybe for Chihuahuas","review":"This did not work on my American Bulldog. It DID manage to get his attention on walks for the first time I used it, but after that he no longer cared.

Waste of money, better spent on a trainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this one!","review":"I purchased an older model, new from Petsafe and it requires CR 2032 batteries. It is very inefficient. They put small batteries in the collar that require them to be changed often. A cost of $4.50 to change the batteries every few weeks makes the PetSafe collars far too expensive to operate. They should have put rechargeable AA or AAA batteries in the collar instead. I will never buy one again. Now, it's time to buy again and it looks like they are still using batteries that are too small."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfied","review":"I have used the product very little, goes through batteries fast and now it does not work at all.

At 85 lbs he can knock even the biggest of guys off their feet when he jumps to greet them. He thinks everyone loves him and he loves everyone. The day it arrived we had it on him and functioning within about 10 minutes. Within the next 2 hrs we used it on him 3 times and by then I was wondering where my dog was. He wasn't the same dog I had 2 hrs prior. He was 90% more lovable, if that's possible then he was before. I've read reviews about the battery life and all I can say is \\"turn it off when you're not using it\\". We've had it for almost a month now and still have yet to replace the batteries. Hershey's to the point now that if he sees the collor coming out of the drawer he knows it's time to behave. In the month we've owned it we've used the \\"zap\\" button only 5 times. Usually the tone is all it takes.

She listens well when nobody is around but the instant someone is walking their dog or the neighbor comes out she goes shooting over there. She's not aggressive but thinks everyone is a long-lost friend. I live in the country on a flat lot with no obstructions. This collar works up to about 6ft and beyond that nothing. If the dog is facing a direction where the internal collar antenna is facing straight at me it seems to work to about 30-40ft. When the dog changes directions it's not until I'm within arm's reach that it decides to work. Waste of $125."},{"rating":"2","title":"If it worked on Isaac, it can work on ANY dog!!","review":"I have a 1 and a half year old bull boxer named Isaac that is very hard headed!

He tried a few times, but I hit the buzzer sound and if he still tried, I shocked him and he whined and ran to me. (Isaac is a pit of a wimp) Now all I have to do is hit the buzzer and he immediately runs to me.He got out of the house yesterday, without the collar on, and my husband took the collar and the remote out to get him and when he got close to Isaac, he hit the buzzer sound and Isaac immediately came to him with his head bowed.

It seems to have a mind of it's own on if it will work or not. Just testing before even putting the collar on my dog, 6 time out of 10 it wouldn't work (testing the tone)The push button for the on/off could have been designed better, and the buttons on the remote are kind of sensitive.

I read the reviews and thought this would work but instead it made things WORSE! It is spotty in working first off! The low setting did nothing and when I went up to 6 or 7 my dog freaked! I only used it three or four times and maybe shouldn't have jumped up the level so high but she was confused, certainly in pain and lunged at me!

When he received a shock he stopped and looked confused. I think the shock collar is similar to electrical shock therapy. It may destroy brain tissue.Before I used it on my dog I touched the terminals with the fingers of one hand and pressed the shock button. It was painful and my forearm still feels a little strange, even days later.We wanted the collar to stop our dog from running away. We will try using a long cord to catch him when he takes off and then will yell at him when we pull him in. Hope that works better.Amazon.com is nice anyway, they took the shock collar back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shock did not consistently work","review":"I have two mad barkers. I tried this on the smaller of our two dogs first and noticed he had no reaction. So, I took the collar off of him and tried it on my own arm. Sometimes the shock came when I pushed the remote control button and sometimes it didn't, regardless of what new batteries I used. I took it to the store where I bought it (Pet Smart) and exchanged it. The 2nd model did the same thing. You can't train/teach a dog without reliable consistency. Therefore, I give this aide one star. It is too expensive to be unreliable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I purchased the collar in November 2009, it worked on and off, with very limited range.

The problem that I had was that the device only worked intermittently. Sometimes it would only beep, or would not operate until the collar unit was reset by powering ON/OFF. After power cycling, it would work for a couple of presses, then intermittently again. Not sure what the problem was.One of the reasons I got the unit was to stop the dog from barking at night, so I had to have the unit ON through the night. This causes the unit to eat through batteries pretty fast (two to three days), and the button type batteries are not cheap. Combining that with the unreliable operation, this thing is junk. The power switch is unnecessarily complex. Overall, I tried to use this for about ten days and gave up. It now sits in the junk drawer. Good idea, but the unit I got is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well, when it decides to work....","review":"I purchased this \\"waterproof collar\\" to assist in training my dog. He learned quickly that the tone was immediately followed by a shock if whatever behavior he was exhibiting did not stop. Sadly, I have a dog that enjoys the sprinkler system....and I found out that the collar was not waterproof. I now found myself out $130.00 for a training collar that only lived about two months.I contacted PetSafe and braced myself for a fight while attempting to get them to honor their \\"Lifetime Warrantee,\\" but was pleasantly surprised that they were both responsive and courteous. The support employee on the phone immediately stated that he was not comfortable with trying to repair a unit that had been wet on the interior, and he immediately shipped a new unit with a return postage label for the broken unit.While I do not think this product is everything it could be, the warrantee and the support from PetSafe motivated me to change my initial rating from 2 stars to four."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This product really works! I have a six-month-old German Shepherd puppy that likes to run a little more rampant than I would like her to do. Her listening skills are coming along, but with this Dog Trainer she is responding more quickly as commanded. I like that it has the tone sound button and also the shock button. She responds to the tone when needing corrected because she knows that the shock will follow if she does not listen. She has made great strides with her commands. One thing though, I had to call Customer Service and order the longer shock prongs because she has so much long hair under her neck in order to get her attention with the shock maneuver. The company charges you an additional $9.99 plus shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"you get what you pay for... and a little more","review":"I bought this training collar for my 2 yr old queensland heeler. We had issues with him coming on command. He is a very submissive dog but very difficult to train due to this. The only purpose I had in mind with this collar was to get his attention in any situation. Within minutes of acclimating him to the concept he was showing remarkable progress; I only shocked him once on the 6 setting and he started realizing that the beep sound meant \\"pay attention to me!\\"The only issue I had with this product was with the batteries in the collar itself. They have a very short life, and you can't just run down to the corner store to get new ones. Definitely a good value considering the top shelf collars run nearly $300 or more. It gets the basic job done for a fraction of the price..I say, no question, its a buy! Just make sure you have spare batteries handy or your training session could just be over until you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasts","review":"This was the best thing when we first got it. Our lab mix puppy was like a new dog. And then it stopped working, and then it worked, and then it stopped working and that kind of defeated the purpose. Although some of her behaviors were somewhat corrected (only need to say \\"no\\" once, as opposed to over and over), without the consistency, some behaviors have reverted back. I had amazon replace the original and the second one did the same thing. I'm afraid when it comes to these training collars, you get what you pay for. I am now ordering a Dogtra training collar as I have friends with personal experience on how great they are, but am paying a much higher price tag. It will be worth it to have our puppy become the pup we know she can be. I wouldn't recommend this training collar, but do recommend training collars in theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit on dog turns off, and need to be very close to dog.","review":"I was very excited to receive this based on reviews, but I am more than disappointed. In fact, I am returning the unit.When the unit works as designed, it is wonderful for training. Please note I said WHEN.There are two problems.First, the on/off switch is attached to the collar, which is just a little rubber button that you push in, as opposed to a switch that you would put into an on position. The unit is constantly turned off. The only thing I can imagine is that when our dog is playing (she is a big dog) that her toys are pushing the button in and turning it off. It is not a problem with the batteries.Secondly, once I have made sure that the collar unit is on, when I try to correct the dog, i need to be very close to her. I would say less than 10 feet. This does not work very well since by the time I approach her with the remote, she starts to approach me, tail wagging. Hence, I am not able to correct the bad behavior at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatified","review":"We have an old english bulldog and it didn't work on him.

By this i mean the plot fit the personality of the characters from the original show and one would have no problem visualizing the characters in these situations. However this was the only good point. The dialogue written between characters was awful. The dialogue was very choppy and throught the entire book made the characters sound awkward. The dialogue certainly failed to portray the characters from the show. In my opinion it was something i would have expected to find on a fan fiction site and definitely not something that should have been printed and sold. The dialogue was just that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandfather's Review","review":"Through the youth's encounter with a metaphysical being, Mikels examines man's inhumanity to man and concludes that life, after all, is simple.\\"Quite joy and fulfillment are derived from inherent simplicity.

You will take part to a stunning musical representation, melodically, rhythmically and harmonically multifarious, made of tradition, bebop, free, avant-garde, and something else not well-defined. All is wisely elaborated with rigorous compositional carefulness and recourse to wealthy instrumentation. In this regard, a very special mention deserves Joel Brandon, whose whistle is an unexpectedly phenomenal instrument: a sound between a piccolo and a recorder, and an array of inventive solos that leave open-mouthed (but the other musicians are no less than grade A).

The Last Kingdom did that for me. So much so, that I read all 5 in the series in less than 3 weeks and am waiting for the next to be published. I thought it was well written. There was just enough detail and backstory to make you care about the characters but not enough to bog down the pace of the story. The dialog could have been hokey & difficult given that the characters are 9th century Vikings but the author used enough old english to give the story authenticity but not so much that is was difficult to read and I often found myself smiling at Uthred's sarcasm.

The main character is a Northumbrian who is captured by the Danes and is raised in the ways of a \\"Pagan\\". The characterization is very well done. I can just imagine the dark times of this saga as I read it - war was definitely a disgusting thing in this time period and it is written as such. Religion was such a powerful tool in both the Danes and the Saxons that it essentially was the driving force between both sides.

When I first started reading this book I wasn't very impressed to begin with. I have read some of Catherine Coulter's other books and found them very enjoyable. Imagine my surprise and disgust when after I read that horrible rape scene I turn to the back of the book and-viola!- the VILIAN has his own romance staring HIM as the hero??? Just knowing this made me unable to finish the book. I realize that the plot is set hundreds of years ago and although this might have happened then I certainly don't want it happening in my reading. What ever happened to the hero having integrity? Honor? Courage? Did the author hope to make this look like a \\"nice\\" rape? It ruined the entire book for me and I doubt I will be reading the other books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"appalled in alaska","review":"In reading a preview for this book, I found that this was a rewrite from a previous novel and was used to 'fit' into the 'Song Series'. It didn't fit very well from my perspective. Within the first few pages of this book, a woman is raped by a (supposed) leading character in a future novel by Ms. Coulter. It is beyond my thinking that this would equate to a \\"good romance\\". I found nothing of value in this book and would not recommend it to another. If I had wanted to read a gruesome true to life novel, I certainly would not have thought to find it located in the romance section. This book was not a romance or very well written. The characters were not well developed and were somewhat shallow and narrow. I am sorry that I purchased this book and will not purchase anything by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book for me....","review":"When I first read the rape scene in the beginning of the book, my biggest fear was that the rapist would turn out to be the hero, because of his attitude in approaching it: i.e. the \\"I don't want to do this but you're forcing me to\\" attitude. I have to say, though, that my relief was short-lived.The hero himself does an inexplicable about-face immediately following their wedding. He goes on to reinforce all Chandra's fears about losing her identity to a man, trying to destroy all the qualities in her that he adored before the wedding. This, I think, is the most insidious part of the whole novel. It could be an excellent story of a woman whose identity deteriorates under the pressure of her husband's expectations and demands, but in the way it's presented makes it clear that we're supposed to find it romantic and that aspect really doesn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Awful!","review":"What an awful book! There was no 'romance' at all! There was barely even any sex. Jerval boasts that he gives Chandra her \\"woman's pleasure\\", but that's about it. Sure, he lusts after her, but while he appreciated her warrior side at first, he really disapproved of it after they were married, and it seemed that the only reason she had any affection for him was because he reminded her of her father! There was definitely some strange sort of attraction going on there. And what kind of name is 'Jerval' anyway? It kept making me think of hamsters. This was my first Coulter book, and it will probably be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T BE SO HARD ON COULTER","review":"I must agree that the story lacks in Jerval's character, which he should have been a little more interesting. Jerval really could have been sexy!! Graleam is an awsome character in the fact that he is a warrior and is used to getting what he wants.

Enough is enough. Yes, the rape scene was completely unnecessary; it had nothing really to do with the overall point of the story, so why put it in there? Just for the sake of writing about rape?

I read it all the way through hoping that at some point there would be a rainbow lining...nope.I honestly don't know what Coulter was thinking when she wrote this book.

I wish I could recommend another book in its stead, but I'm afraid I'm not very familiar with this genre in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Purchased item to power my laptop over 22 hours of air travel between Alaska and North Carolina and back. Unfortunately, none of the three different types of planes that I flew on had outlets on the seat arms so the unit stayed in my backpack. While camping over a weekend on that trip I did find the adapter handy for use with an air mattress that needed to be plugged in in order to inflate. I was however disappointed that it would not power a 4 cup coffee maker that I brought with me.I have tested the adapter with my laptop and find that it works as designed. In airplanes that actually have power points in the arms of the seats, this product would be indispensable for laptop users on long trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn more about CD-Recording Software by Adaptec","review":"Recordable CD Bible introduces you to recordable CD technology, from hardware to software to media.

He and his cast of characters (Josie and Lester) provide the most interesting way to understand many different principles of science. Most of the lessons teach you how to do it yourself ...most beneficial for those people who need to learn in a \\"hands-on\\" environment.It is so entertaining that I often find myself watching it again, and again, because I missed some of the jokes the first or second time that I watched it. Bill Nye is too dry, and his explanations, although correct and accurate, can be hard to follow or keep my interest. Beakman has a blend of both good science articulation, as well as, humorous entertainment that gets me through the boring detail. I actually WANT to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"relive the best of 90s Saturday mornings","review":"My husband and I used to love watching Beakman's world on Saturday mornings (as well as Parker Lewis Can't Lose), so this show obviously has a broad base. It is irreverant, and shows a more \\"urban\\" feel than Bill Nye The Science Guy but they are both cut from the same cloth. Quick cut edits, weird sound effects, snappy dialog, fun science. Toddlers wouldn't like or appreciate this or Bill Nye, but my kids (9.5, 8 and 5) all love both, and after watching this DVD, immediately ran outside to try out some of the experiments he showed them. Gotta love that! It is slightly dated (I think they talk about records or cassette tapes in the start of the DVD), but the science still holds, and there's nothing quite like Beakman and his friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it back in the day, but not today!","review":"I remember watching this show as a kid on weekend mornings and loving it.

I mean, the reviews and awards are positive and plentiful. But, a few minutes more was all we could stand. \\"Beakman\\" was obnoxious and the hand gestures just wouldn't stop (not rude gestures, just the \\"lead singer of a rap group\\" kind).

We bought two, one for our king bed and one for our daughter's twin bed, and they both ripped when we tried placing them over the mattresses. We were extrememly careful putting the cover on our bed since the one on our daughter's bed ripped the first time. Moreover, when we were zipping it around our king mattress the zipper just broke. It came off the track without provocation and rendered the cover worthless. Both covers are now repaired with duct tape and I am disgusted with the quality (or lack there of) of these products.

Phil Collins had just received critical acclaim for his solo album 'Face Value'. His influence is obvious on this album and Tony Banks takes a back seat for a change letting Phil loose with his love of rhythm and blues horns. The end result is different and refreshing. It certainly pulls Genesis out of the wet and windy 70's onto a radio platform eager to receive their new sound. The overall feel is rockier, with less multi-layered synth pads creating a wall of sound to a more percussive/jazzy affair. There are still songs in there that hark back to the old style and the way this mixes with the 'new' sound is quite exciting! It's Genesis, but not as we knew them!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always There","review":"I got the cassette in an Xmas grab-bag in 1981 back when I was a dishwasher in NY.

This is a very talented trio of musicians making awesome music, after the departure of two important musicians that made Genesis goes to the charts like one of the greatest progressive band of all time. Then, as a trio in \\"And then there were three\\" and the excellent \\"Duke\\", they slowly show to us the path they pretend to follow and I think they succeded! There are a lot of great songs here, like Abacab, No Reply At All, Dodo/Lurker, Man On The Corner and Like it Or Not. Personally I didn't like Who Dunnit, but it doesn't make the album a bad one. It's a band looking for a new identity. Phil Collins is a pop genius, and a great composer, and I can't wait to see him on tour this year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album from Genesis ever","review":"The songs contained in this album are both catchy, and entertaining. It's not like those other songs in the 80's where you get sick of listening to them after about 4-5 times. This one is a keeper. Phil has a great voice, and songs like man on the corner, and abacab can't be beat. This is the best genesis album yet.... The remastered cd makes it even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"AbAcAb","review":"This CD is absolutely amazing, like almost every Genesis album. This is the album where Genesis shed most of their prog-rock sounds of the 70s and goes into the pop arena and it works. I have no idea why so many ppl hate this album or the ones since then because Abacab is a work of art. Who Dunnit gets too much criticism as it's absolutely a chaotically fun experience of comical humor and loud music. Man On The Corner is a beautiful song with Phils excellent vocals. The title track is a bit repetitive especially after the first three minutes but it's still a great song.Don't listen to these so called fans who have nothing to do but throw negative talk about Phil Collins as he is just as good as Peter Gabriel was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Band on the corner","review":"With this album, Genesis breaks from their art-rock past and plows into New Wave and then mainstream pop. In addition, the band hired producer Hugh Padgham, noted for his work with the Police, resulting in the band's best sounding studio album to date - a move which will be noticed immediately in the full drum sound.Some of the album works very well - the title track, Dodo/Lurker, and the ethereal beauty of Me And Sarah Jane are the standouts. The spareness of Man On The Corner and horn-infused R&B stylings of No Reply At All hint at the rise of Phil Collins, about to become a star in his own right. Abacab suffers, however, from trite lyrics and some filler songs that detract from it's justified strengths. In particular, the presence of the vile and wretched Who Dunnit? (perhaps one of the worst pieces of junk ever committed to tape by a major act) indicates the depths to which the trio is capable of descending. Docked one star for Who Dunnit?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad cd.... very bad!!!!!!!!!","review":"This moron has enough nerve to call us poser fans when these posers Phil Collins fans weren't there were'nt there to support Genesis when \\"Calling All Stations\\" came out. They actually tried to go back to progressive rock with REAL DRUMS and new members. Do not listen to poser fans as they have no identities. They are just lost souls that only know the hits and Phil Collins. At least I am a progressive rock fan(Genesis is included here since they are a progressive rock band). Yes, King Crimson, and Steve Hackett are still playing, in full force, and enjoying fanfare, but where is the band formerly known as Genesis???? Thats right, broken up. Why? Because they went the wrong direction. They could have gotten new members they could have changed the name, but they didn't. Phil Collins is retiring, and Tony Banks quit rock all together. What does that say? Prog-rock lives on and so does the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway! Abacrap sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Genesis album","review":"This album is really boring, you can find here some of the worst compositon of the band, all on the same album, so it deserve well\\"The worst of genesis\\" tag.

How about offering the remastered CD?

So in reviewing the track listing, I remember that there is only one song on the CD and that is the title track Abacab. Incredible song with long instrumental stretches.However, the remainder of this disc compels me to look for a used copy somewhere. Who Dunnit? Yuck. Phil Collins is tolerable as a solo artist, but he pretty much dominates this band by this time. His so called \\"r&b\\" infusion in to Genesis has no place. Leave the horn section to some light jazz band. Notice Collins has some irritating song on every one of his solo recordings?Find a used copy if you want this cd, too many weak songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not cut it","review":"Abacab was the second album of the Genesis late period and it is horrible with the exception of the mostly instrumental title track and the psuedo reggae melody changing Dodo/Lurker. It is only on these songs that Genesis reaches back into their Prog Rock past and come up with strong material."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album is still great","review":"I hadn't listened to this album for over 20 years but I've been listening to a lot more music since buying my iPod. It's amazing how well this album holds up, and even knowing the direction Genesis went after Abacab (Illegal Alien, anyone?) did not spoil it for me. I loved Duke and Abacab, and boy does this CD sound great! A very clean sound, I forgot how hard Phil hit the drums but I think Mike Rutherford sounds a lot better on CD. Every track is great, with the exception for Man on the Corner which I never really liked. I bought the CD remembering Abacab and No Reply and I was pleasantly surprised to hear again and remember how much I liked Keep It Dark, Me and Sarah Jane and Another Record. I'm very happy I bought this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinnacle of pop-art in the 80s","review":"Genesis evolved from an ornate art-rock band to something of a sleek pop outfit right around the break of the 1980s. This album was kind of a turning point for them, simplifying the sound and upping the drums in the mix to create something both edgier and more accessible than some of their earlier work. Here we have one of the catchiest songs I have heard in \\"No Reply At All,\\" a bizarre stab at incorporating a punk influence in \\"Who Dunnit?,\\" the relentless \\"Keep It Dark,\\" the touching \\"Another Record,\\" and of course the fantastic title track. Really there are no mis-steps in this eclectic bunch of songs. The 2007 remaster sounds great, clarifying and cleaning up the sound. For anyone interested in the artier side of 80s pop-rock, this album really is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"What if you like Pete AND Phil?","review":"There seems to be some kind of negative polarity between lovers of the Pete band, and admirers of the Phil band. I fall right in between, because I like 'em both. Things change. Pete fans still have the legacy of the Pete albums. Nobody can take those away. If you don't like Phil, just don't listen to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG DIRECTION","review":"I bought this album because of the great tune \\" NO REPLY AT ALL \\". I was also a fan of Peter Gabriel's phase. But, other than the song i quoted above, this CD in an unbeliavably bad collection of synthesized garbage, it has nothing to do with the real Genesis. A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELL OUT","review":"Free from Peter Gabriel and now led by Phil Collins, Genesis suddenly decided to go for the big money in ABACAB. And they succeeded. The album went platinum. But the songs, they're just rubbish, pop, clean, texturized, syntesized pop songs with no heart. But, since the musicians in Genesis are all of them amazing professionals, they could make some of them work, even being totally devoid of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful considering what they once were...","review":"Just another example of the horrible thing Genesis turned into after both Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett abandoned ship. Perhaps they both had a premonition. The fact that this album went platinum (when albums of such genius as The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Selling England by the Pound, Foxtrot and Nursery Crymes languish in obscurity) is just another example of the mediocrity of the general record buying public. Utter pablum for the philistines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable staying power","review":"It's amazing to me that this album was released 30 years ago. To me, it's one of the only good fusions of prog and pop Genesis (Geneses)? There's a simplicity to the songs tinged with elements of a more radio-friendly vibe. Dodo / Lurker has a spooky feel that has haunted me for years. Fantastic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart of stone","review":"So Genesis went pop. You know how in scripture things written often relate to events that happen many years later. Perhaps 'pop' goes the weasel was an historic 'prophecy' of this album; I'm sure there are some Genesis fans out there who would try to argue the trio version of the band really was 'the weasel', (and while were at it perhaps 'Abacab' is really an evil robot who took over from Phil Collins on the drums).But don't let the pop VS prog war distract you from the great and varied songs on the album, such as the dreamy, pumping 'Keep it dark', the stadium ready title track, the gentle, lilting 'Like it or not' or the heavily syncopated 'Another record', an ode to forgotten rock n rollers.

On this recording, Curtis Fowlkes is on Trombone, later on Threadgill uses french horn.If the music sounds too thick, here is a guide that may help you make sense of it:Listen to the sound demos. There is quite a layered labyrinth of quickly changing textures.Where is the music is at? The answer, it is how the like instruments are paired with each others, often doing something that is the opposite of its counterpart.a) listen to how the one tuba plays with the other. If one is high, the other may very well be low.b) How the different length rhythmic patterns in the guitar fit with the other guitar.This how the textures keep from getting cluttered.But where they really take it up is in the next recording TOO MUCH SUGAR FOR A DIME."},{"rating":"2","title":"What fustrating hateful delight of a movie","review":"I saw this film when I was in law school one night.

I, however, will bask in the pure anger and wit that is In The Company of Men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty, raw, original, and dark","review":"To start, this is one of my all time favorite movies. The subject matter is gritty, raw, original, and dark. The script and acting are very strong. Best of all, the movie doesn't follow the traditional and trite storyline of creating conflict and then providing a solution and happy ending. The movie tends to ask more questions than it does provide answers.I read a review that gave this film a bad review because it wasn't a comedy and that one \\"can't help but feel sorrow for the sweet, young girl; the end, in which Chad finally drops the bomb on her is very heartbreaking\\".I would agree that the movie is not a traditional comedy; rather it is a very dark comedy and drama. And, if one feels sorrow and heartbreak for Stacy Edwards's character, the movie has succeeded. It is in this vein - eliciting a wide range of emotions and thoughts from its audience - that the movie is an original success."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true face of evil...","review":"One of the most brutally subversive films of the 90s, and since its debut, I can still watch it time and time again. THAT'S the testament of a truly great film. Other people will say I'm nuts, but when you've been stuck watching 'Charlie's Angels\\" or \\"Armageddon\\" for the upteenth time, and a film of substance comes along, you grab it with both hands, and don't let go.The production values are basically nil. It's a talky film with a mind to skewer both traditional roles of the antagonist/protagonist, and corporate America, and it succeeds brilliantly on both levels. Aaron Eckhart got an unbelieveable amount of hate mail following the release of this film, and I'm not suprised. Why this film didn't get the recognition it deserved is beyond me.Neil Labute's subsequent film \\"Your Friends & Neighbours\\" is almost as good, and certainly worth owning, but this is the one the get. Absolutely essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Company Of Men","review":"They say the sign of a great movie is if it makes you think about it the day after seeing it. You'll be thinking about this movie for a couple days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Evil","review":"This movie has the feel of a kind of corporate hell. It's not just the demonic Chad and his high testosterone levels, mysogeny, and \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" attitude toward amusement at the office. Howard, the \\"almost\\" good guy with the decency to feel guilty about his participation in Chad's scheme to break a co-worker's heart, is so pathetic in his own way that he too seems right at home in this version of hell. Visually, the office is dim, artificially lit, windowless, occasionally cave-like, contributing to the general sense of petty, officey evil.Without giving away the end, I can only say that I loved the movie for its seeming indifference, its refusal to sympathesize, and the slightly stunned, \\"wow\\" kind of feeling that it left me with. It's an exploration of human nature along the lines of De Sade, and leaves you wondering about the strong and weak, and the relative value of virtue in corporate America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated","review":"This film is an interesting study of how low people can sink and use and abuse an innocent person, but beyond that there is nothing about it that screams out \\"THIS IS GREAT FILM ART!\\" There is nothing about it that makes you want to watch it ever again. Technically dull, it will ultimately be forgotten just as Paul Schraider's early films such as \\"Blue Collar\\" and \\"Hardcore\\" have almost been completely forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible DVD Quality","review":"This is a great movie, but the DVD transfer is the worst I've ever seen.

Some say his style is minimalistic but I think it appears this way by default. With the same logic he could film a child being hit by a car as he passed by with his camera and people would call it realistic. But it only appears this way. LaBute has NO idea how to direct films and should never be given the chance to direct again."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the company of losers","review":"I gave this farce one star - to be shared by the acters who actually had the guts to be in the film and the producers who who were foolish enough to pay the screenwriter for the script.

For example, the office set was very drab and unintersting and just put me to sleep more. There was nothing intersting going on. And the ending? Talk about twisted! Thankfully, I did not rent this stinker, so I did not waste any money. Highly overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repugnant and unbelievable","review":"Words fail me in attempting to describe just how poor a movie In the Company of Men is. Aside from obvious flaws like the lack of a single compelling or sympathetic character, Men suffers from amateurish acting, a painfully bad script devoid of any wit or insight, and a frighteningly shallow and stilted portrait of men and male behavior. As bad a movie as you are likely to find anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Company of Men - Really Bad","review":"This is my new WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER TRIED TO WATCH!

I turned it off very quickly. This should not even be called a movie. It is poorly made (I can make better quality home movies than this), poorly written, poorly directed... It was not only disturbing to watch, but after the idiot made fun of a deaf person, that did it for me. It made me angry to know that there are such morons who would make stupid comments like this. This is how angry this movie made me, enough to warn others about the offensive jokes (if you can call them jokes since they aren't funny enough to be considered jokes).. In short, this movie has the worst of everything. The worst, most boring actors I had ever seen, poor direction, dull and not in the least funny at all! Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good video, but it's hard to watch the cruelty","review":"Cruelty takes many forms. This film is about the emotional kind. Two young corporate men, on a six-week company assignment in a small city, plot to seduce and then dump an vulnerable deaf young woman. The idea is to hurt someone and some of this is hard to watch, especially when the more vicscious of the two makes sick jokes about her handicap. The actors are unknowns but they do an outstanding job, and the screenplay is well written, although a bit long. Some interesting concepts are raised, particularly about the one-upmanship and power plays that hurt and destroy. At the end of the movie, one of the men deeply regrets what he has done and realizes he has also be duped by his supposed friend. \\"Why?\\" he asks. \\"Because I could,\\" is the answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"The Coby CVH79 Lightweight Super Bass HP headphones has no bass to them what so ever. After having them for a little over a month they started to sound distorted and started to crack while listening to them. The only thing good I can say about them is that they are comfortable to wear. I know they were not expensive at all, but I also own a pair of the CobyCV-110. They were around the same price and they sound great and are very durable. In conclusion I do not reccomend the CVH79's at all. They are not worth the few dollars plus shipping you have to pay.

I had to move the jaws left-right-left back and forth in order to move the clamp up and down on my 3/4 inch pipe. (2) The clamp handle used to tighten the whole thing is attached to the top jaw by a tiny explandible pin. Well I bought 2 of these to try and the pin pops out on one my clamps making it useless. Rather than spend money shipping back for a return I decided to eat the cost for 1 clamp. If I tried these clamps out sooner upon receiving them I would have sent them back to the seller.

I have no problem listening to Music or to my language lessons for 2+ hours with these. The other nice thing is the cord is quite a bit longer than my old maxell earbuds, making it easier to use with my PC (which sits on the floor).

If you are wearing a cap or if your hair is straight I dont think it will be a problem.I wear them everyday for at least an hour or so and they also sit in my large shoulder bag that is filled with stuff and so far have held up very well.

However, they are not at all suitable for classical music, most folk, and a lot of country music, because while the bass is very enhanced, the high end is diminished somewhat. Classical music suffered a lot whenver a high-pitched instrument [flute, oboe, etc.] took the center, as these ear cans didn't reproduce those tones very well, or just dropped them if the volume was low.If the music that you enjoy listening to is bass-heavy, then these headphones are a very good bargain.

The songs are simple and complex at the same time, and I must admit even simplistic at some level, BUT THEY WORK! Nobody will ever claim that Justin Hayward has a great singing voice or that he is a great poet, in fact, when you look at the lyrics by themselves they are really insipid. What happens when they are put into the context of the music is awesome, though. Those lyrics are transformed into yearnings that can only be answered by letting your soul make a journey into the unknown.

The original version of Legend of A Mind is more melodic than the later version in the box-set (which I also heard during a concert in New Haven, Ct. a few years ago), and Legend of a Mind and OM have always helped me to climb-down from the workday and become human again.

The music sounds enchanting most of the time, the lyrics are pretty solid (even when compared to lyrics from DOFP), and the sound quality from this 2008 reissue is really nice (the bonus tracks are essential for those who consider The Moody Blues to be their favorite). In Search of a Lost Chord isn't at all that bad; it's just that it's not the most endearing album created from the band.

And pages and pages of rambling, aimless, academic debate. It may be a good book for Con Law professors and others who have already read all of the cases discussed. For someone trying to learn con law, it is useless. It is also organized very poorly. Any class organized around this book is doomed from the start.

The editing makes simple concepts seem way too complicated as it constantly presents circular arguments that lead to nowhere. If you are using this casebook for class, I suggest you get a good commercial study aide like Chemerinsky's Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies or the Examples & Explainations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible Casebook","review":"This is the WORST casebook I've had in law school so far (though the Torts Aspen casebook is pretty bad, as well). Explanations and background information are included AFTER the case, which makes little sense, and when you add in the swampy structure and paragraph-long cites this is incredibly hard to wade through. Reading the \\"Notes\\" is generally a waste of time--the author brings up many theories but skims them all, rather than explaining anything in depth, and is a little too fond of asking questions rather than providing answers about the concepts. Definitely order a supplement along with this casebook, because you won't be grasping the law on your own without an amazing teacher or a truly advanced form of intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst.

If you are a first year law student stuck with this book, beware! My suggestion is to find a good treatise like Chemerinsky's \\"Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies\\" to help you discern what you need to know. Otherwise, be prepared to spend endless frustrating hours trying to make some sense of it all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Very unclear. The book spews out note cases like no other. The authors somehow believe that putting a number in front of a note is a good substitute for a)providing simple transitions (\\"however,\\" \\"in contrast\\" \\"likewise or b)relating the notes back to the principles. Even worse, having to carry this thing around will constitute a tort. You won't learn ConLaw from this hot mess.

It tended to irrirate my skin so I took the advice of another reviewer and also tried WendyLou's and happy to say that her products are great and now my skin is soft.

Good, solid rack. Nice finish. It is aluminum so surprisingly light. I have it set on concrete floor which is not smooth. I have it loaded at the top with a 1U TOR switch and a rackmount power strip/surge supressor. Slightly above waist level I have installed a shelf and placed a flatscreen monitor on the shelf. A couple of inches below that (approx 45\\" off the floor) I have a server on rails (which I'm using for my keyboard tray :-) and directly underneath that another 1U switch. Finally, sitting on the base I have a couple of PCs. The rack wobbles due to the rough floor, but it exhibits adequate stability. I highly recommend this for SMB or home. And, as others have stated, the pack of screws taht comes with it is handy, especially rackmount screws that I've used on job sites did not fit well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really cool","review":"I've owned the quad LP of \\"Touch\\" since it was in stores, and this recording in discreet surround sound is a truly worthy reissue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of MP3 download only","review":"I wish more reviews were centered around the quality (or lack thereof) of the individual offerings/recordings.

If you are a Moody Blues fan, and you have a good surround sound system which can play SACD Multi-channel, this album will make you think you have died and gone to heaven. If you don't have a disc player that can play SACD Multi-channel (as well as DVD-Audio) just go get one. No need for me to talk about the songs as they have been around for almost forty years. The surround mix and the astonishing clarity of the sound are the new breakthroughs here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly good remaster","review":"I used to listen to this and other Moody Blues albums on both vinyl and 8-track endlessly in. I *finally* got around to getting the CDs recently and the remaster of this album is STUNNING. I'm always a bit afraid of remastering because often the mix changes to suit the engineers or the artists as they think \\"it should have been\\". My opinion of this remaster is that it's a beautiful technology update that doesn't disturb the original music from the 1960's. The master tapes must have been in great shape, this is nearly flawless.If you liked the Moody Blues back then, the remasters will blow you away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blank Disc","review":"I'm sure I would like this CD had their been anything recorded on it. But by the time I got around to listening to it, I was past the 30 day return window and it wasn't worth the cost of shipping to send it back. This was the first time I ever received a blank music CD and I will certainly open and test immediately any I order from Amazon again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock that sounded like opera","review":"I first heard this album when my brothers came back from boarding school in Wisconsin at Xmas '69. In the late '60's this sound from the Moody Blues was extremely \\"cutting edge\\". The Beach Boys, Beatles, and even Stones had albums that mixed rock and avant guard \\"sounds\\". But this album from the Moody Blues seemed to make classical music \\"cool\\". The big sound of the orchestra behind their band was very different not only to a 11yr old, but for listeners in general. Lovely To See You Again & Have You Heard had nothing to do with what was being played on AM radio...and that made it all the more cool. This album still holds up well. Take a listen and try to visualize the last year of the '60's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"Like my other reviews of the Moody Blues so called remastered SACD releases, this one again has no center channel and insignificant subwoofer action. When it says 5.1, that's what i think i should get. Apparently not. Some stoned hippie from the sixties decided he would just take the original quad mix and slap it on a sacd. The old Elton John mixes are really remixed and fabulous. Shame on you Moody Blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical/Spiritual Journey That Remains Valid Today","review":"Totally captivating on vinyl in 1969. Refreshing and enlightening on cassette in 1984 while still holding some \\"Future Shock\\". Still a valid and commanding work in 1999 remastered on CD.

This is no different. Roosevelts account of his Rough Riders days jump off the page like a great fiction book. He discribes how he left the Navy Department and volunteered to serve in the Spanish American War. He discribes all of the charactors who served in the famed regiments that made up the Rough Riders. Some we College Graduate, some were cattle rustlers, farmers, etc. A real bunch of misfits.I like his attention to detail and all the researchable facts. There is a list of all the men who served as Rough Riders.This is recomended for anyone who likes history, the Spanish American War, and Theodore Roosevelt. I happen to like all three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate account of Rough Riders by one of them!","review":"My grandfather was a member of Troop A of the Rough Riders and wrote a series of articles for our local newspaper (Champaign, IL) on his experiences. After reading his comments and then reading the book written by Roosevelt I know first hand that Col. Roosevelt told it like it was. \\"Rough\\" was putting it mildly. My grandfather survived but had re-occurring bouts of maleria throughout his life. I transcribed his accounts into a family album for my children and grandchildren so he would not be forgotten. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone wanting to learn about our history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rough read","review":"My expectations were high but this is just a poorly written book. About half the narrative is about the characters who joined the Rough Riders. Very little of the book deals with the battles in Cuba and the sections that do make the exploits of the Rough Riders seem grossly over rated. Roosevelt seems to write withh the intent on securing his place in history. And, if that wasn't enough, he includes self-serving appendices that laud his conduct on the battlefield and support his yearning for the medal of honor. I found his writing style tedious and often repetitious--you'll encounter countless references to the smokeless ammunition used by the Spanish. Enough already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ","review":"WOW... A great american story and extremely well written. This book has changed my life by motivating me to be a better person and citizen. I only wish we had men in elected positions that were half as intelligent and half as concerned for the average american as Teddy. Rough Riders is a must read for any young man trying to find his calling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have just reissued the original","review":"I love \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\\" and so was completely disappointed by this paperback book edition of the story.The \\"By Charles M. Schulz\\" on the cover and in the listing hides the fact that the text is not by Schulz, but is \\"adapted\\" by other people. The text adaptation is painfully bad -- I could barely force myself to read it to my child the other night. The text is way too wordy, which contradicts the whole style of Schulz's comic strip, and changes key dialog of characters.The illustrations are okay, but why not just use the original drawings by Schulz himself?A book version of A Charlie Brown Christmas was printed in the 1960's; the publishers would have been smarter to reissue the original book rather than create this new version.If you want to have a book version of A Charlie Brown Christmas, I highly recommend that you spend a bit more money and buy the hardcover book, \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas: the Making of a Tradition\\". You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas book","review":"This book is just like the TV version in so many ways. I love this book.

Children of all ages love this book and it is sure to be a family holiday favorite to read every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic","review":"Love this story! A great addition to any child's library.

I love the story and thought it would be perfect. One thing I didn't notice (and it's my fault if I would have read closer) but this is a miniature version of the book. It is about 3\\" by 3\\". There are not pictures on every page, so your kids need to be able to pay attention to the words while you are reading until you get to a page with pictures. All in all though, it's a very cute story, the illustrations are cute and it will make a nice little decoration to put on the mantle for anyone to pick up and read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic SF Reader","review":"Charlie Brown is being a xmas grump. For some reason he doesn't get it, at this particular point in time. Luckily, the rest of the Peanuts gang have a bit more of a clue, and then there is the faithful dog Snoopy, to help pull him through the midsummer morass of melancholy he is meandering his mug through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the TV Show","review":"\\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\\" is one of the greatest television shows of all time, thanks to a classic script by one of the greatest cartoonists of all time.But this book just does not capture its flavor. The art is not by Schulz, and though loyal to his style, does not FEEL like Schulz. Couldn't they have used images from the actual show?Worse, important moments are lost, probably due to space constraints. For instance, Linus's stirring soliloquy, performed solo in the show, here takes place in a crowded room for storytelling purposes.I got this book for an office mate because she loves Schulz and because it was the only color Peanuts book I could find that was in the $5-10 price range dictated by our office Christmas pool.People may well love this book because they love the TV show (and there's nothing wrong with that), but I don't think anyone would ever love it for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Match for the Real Christmas Special","review":"Pay attention to the reviews on this book - it is not the real thing and fails to capture the magic of the special you saw on TV as a kid. It does clearly state on the title page that this is adapted from the special. I failed to comprehend what that meant. It means the story is abrigded - incredibly abrigded. Unfortunately at the same time it is also wordy. Nothing along the lines of reading the Peanut comic strips. The drawings also look off. Again nothing like the comic strip. A true adaptation of this special would be appropriate for children and adults. This book may work for kids but if you plan to give it to an adult friend to capture the magic of Christmas(as was my intention) don't bother. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlie Brown Christmas Miniature","review":"This book had a great cover and good quality paper for the pages, however the binding was not sturdy. One had to open the book wide to see all of the wording, but doing that created the string-binding to be stretched too much. I could tell that the pages would fall out after just a few readings.

The overview also deals concisely with most of the critical controversies that have arisen. The commentary frankly acknowledges a Christian woldview, but still argues from a standard, scholarly perspective. Anderson writes well, but the writing is at a scholarly level and uses quite a few two-dollar words, so I had to make a few runs to the dictionary (not a bad thing, really).

That's not necessarily a bad thing, because I was tired of reading about the Ringworld at this point. I should have put a buffer between Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers by reading another book, perhaps something from the Ender Wiggin series.

Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but only a slight one. There is a plot, but it's strung together and ultimately overshadowed by Louis running from place to place in order to have sex with aliens.Disappointing and somewhat sad to see an author run his most well-known creation into the ground like this, presumably just to make a few extra bucks.

But neither humans nor kzin make good slaves.This was a great sequel to Ringworld! With more fun technology mixed with fantastic evolutionary possibilities.

So I can't tell you if this book can help you stop drinking. I can tell you that the 11 of the 12 steps that don't directly address alcohol strike me as little short of a godsend in the struggle against whatever particular thing is screwing up your life.Now, it's a statistically demonstrable fact that AA doesn't work for everyone.

The hidden (and usually not talked-about in meetings) problem, though, is that more than 80% of A.A.'ers go home to a still-drinking spouse/child/elderly parent. Learning how to deal with all that is often critical to helping to maintain a sober and more sane daily life. The million-sellingGetting Them Sober: You Can Help!

It was written against the advice of one of our co-founders (and after his death.) Furthermore, it was never designed to be a textbook on the steps. It is an interpretive commentary on the steps and traditions. Unfortunately, it is given to people as a textbook. There are no directions given in this book.

Alcohol was my life. Alcohol destroyed me and left me with nothing. By the grace of God I was put into the rooms of AA. In the rooms I found a sponsor who bought me a Big Book and a 12x12. The program in the 12x12 saved my life. It taught me a way of life which I had never dreamed possible. By reading this book and attending meetings, working with other alcoholics--I am able to live life sober. I am truly happy, joys and free. I owe it all to my higher power, the program and people in AA.

Are they seconds or did I get a dud pair?? Also, I got blisters on each foot the first time I wore them, which was extremely painful walking back to my car 1.5 km away after work! I didn't think I need to wear socks. I'm keeping them as they've been worn otherwise I would return them.

Cost too high for my amount of wear. I like this style of shoe for work. I had found the brown version at Payless Shoes three years ago; that's how long it took to wear that pair out.

I had only heard raving reviews from friends about these shoes, hence why I bought them. I can't stand them.First of all, I had to get inserts for arch support. Then I had to deal with them rubbing on my heals. I think I even bled one day. I just thought I had to keep wearing them to break them in. Then I got smart. I now wear socks with them and that helps. It's the only way I can justify keeping them. I knew that I waited too long to return them to the store and I hate to think I wasted money.I still have to deal with the velcro coming undone so I can only wear them on easy going days. Every time I drive my stick shift the velcro breaks apart. Highly annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay...if they stayed on!","review":"These shoes are really cute, however there are two very big problems with them. The biggest problem is that the velcro on the thin little straps is simply not strong enough to withstand more than a few minutes of walking without pulling loose. I've cleaned the velcro repeatedly to make it more sticky, but with no success -- the velcro just doesn't stay stuck and I'm left readjusting my shoes every five minutes! The second problem is that these shoes don't let enough air flow through... because I don't wear socks with them and there is no air flow, they became smelly very quickly. Given these problems, I would not recommend these shoes -- regardless of how cute they are!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky and damaged my big toenails","review":"I gave these shoes one star because it looks cute. It has the look of dress shoes with somewhat of a sneaker-feel. I'm sure there are other shoes out there that can accomplish this without having to deal with the rancid smell. The material is not breathable and make your feet stink! I've never had smelly feet issues and they smell only when I wear these shoes.

Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"can you say \\"overpronation?\\"","review":"My shoes are fantastically comfy, and surprisingly easy to run in, but for the life of me I can't walk in them without my feet turning inwards.

The heel counter was really stiff and took wearing a few times with different socks to soften up a bit. I like them with tights and skirts and with black socks and jeans or slacks. Versatile.

These are for my work and don't seem to be bothering anyone else but me. The way the mary jane style cuts across your foot in the front rests right on the bone of your foot. They absolutely kill my feet to the point that I can't wear them. I've tried thick socks as a cushion but it doesn't help. Standing or sitting they are fine but I can't walk without them hurting.They are not very sturdy either. If you tend to turn your feet at all they won't support your foot. I normally love Sketchers but these were not what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"This is still and always my go-to shoe--cute enough to wear at work, comfortable enough for casual wear.

Great shoe, good for walking."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET OUT YOUR DRILL.","review":"I have a Jet cabinet tablesaw with router cabinet and Exacta II 50 inch fence. As I assembled the base I thought this can't get much easier. With the cabinets 485 lbs, I thought I might be pushing the mobile base limit. I blocked up the saw and got the base under it. I was not pleased with the extra space between the cabinet and the base. I calculated where the extra hole should be and drilled all four pieces. When assembled I had a nice tight fit. I attached the extension and set my router cabinet legs on the platform. The saw rolls around great. The extension did manage to swing from under the legs of the router table so a little rubber pad or zip ties to secure them in place should do the trick. The rollers managed to cross the expansion joints in my garage floor with no trouble. I am quite pleased with the mobile base."},{"rating":"1","title":"jet universal tool momil base","review":"it stinks it rolls very hard it turns very hard it is very very hard to control it is nothing like the htc models"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jet Mobil Base","review":"I had purchased the Jet Mobil Base with the Jet Jointer. In order to make the Jointer fit this base I added a piece of 3/4 plywood. Still not being satisfied with this match up I replaced the Mobil Base with the HTC base made for this Jointer. The Jet Jointer and Jet Mobil Base is a bad match up. It's a good quality Universal Mobil Base and I will find a use for it with some other equipment. Just not with the Jet Jointer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid base, easy to assemble, good design.","review":"Easy to assemble, very solid. I own both the htc2000 and this jet base, and I think the jet mobile base is better designed and MUCH easier to assemble. This can be adjusted down to closely fit (approx 18 or 19 inches square) around the base of my delta enclosed bandsaw. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Set-up -- Not perfect though!","review":"This took literally 10 minutes to assemble and another 10 to get my fully assembled Jet contractor tablesaw on it. The snap-lock springloaded pins made it very easy to adjust to width by holding it next to the legs of my saw and just sliding the pieces together. I did this solo, which was a little more difficult since the saw was pretty awkward to tip up in place.My complaint is that the two swivel casters have cheesy, weak step-on locks. I found better ones at Lowes for $6/per. The tabs are small and hard to get a sure toe-hold on with work boots. Fortunately, the other two casters have excellent locks, and if you mount them perpendicular to the direction you apply force to the tool, it will not cause problems. I have had no problems with movement from my saw, even when cutting full panels of 3/4 ply.A good choice for roughly the same price of some other kits that require you to supply wood to complete them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very maneuverable","review":"The fixed rear wheels on this base make it difficult to move in any direction except straight. Also, it does not fit a 6\\" closed based jointer such as the Jet very well (even though it is listed as an accessory for that jointer). I had to do some cutting and drilling to make it workable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple yet highly effective","review":"I was amazed at how few parts were in the box when this arrived. Assembly took just minutes and required no tools. It's solid and does exactly what I need it to do. I also have a Shop Fox mobile base that I'm using on a Grizzly bandsaw, but I prefer this one. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stable and easy to assemble.","review":"Purchased the base to go along with a Jet 17\\" drill press. I needed a mobile base that was stable, and would allow the press to be moved about my crowded garage. Assembly took ten minutes. I then glued together two 24\\"x26\\" 3/4\\" pieces of plywood. Attached them to the base, and then bolted the press to the base. Very slick solution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JET Heavy duty universal mobile base","review":"The base is well made, assembles VERY easily and quickly but has a major flaw - the LOCKING wheels do not lock well enough to prevent the saw from moving when you cut heavy material. This is dangerous and makes accurate cuts of larger material impossible. The rotating casters are the worst offenders.I'm disappointed because it is a well made unit and Jet usually produces good quality products. As an engineer I view this as a design flaw rather than a quality control issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheels move when locked","review":"I've been using this base under a jet contractor's saw with cast iron top for a few months now. The base is very sturdy, strongly made, and rolls smoothly. The big problem is that the wheels don't lock solidly, and I can't trust the saw to stay in place when I cut a large piece of plywood, etc. I'll probably buy a different base for the saw and use this one on something else like a drill press that only needs vertical support. Bottom line is it doesn't do the job for a table saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I waited!","review":"This is a very well designed mobile base and clearly the best quality adjustable base I've seen. It was easy to assemble in about five minutes without tools. To provide better weight distribution I fitted a 3/4\\" plywood floor insert and bolted my 400lb industrial drill press to this floor. I can now conveniently store my drill press against the back wall of my shop and easily pull it into my work area when needed. The base is stronger than it appears in the Amazon.com photo. This base was back ordered more than two months but I'm glad I didn't settle for one of the other models that were available off the shelf. I rate this a \\"best buy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"yukon","review":"Received on time. Too easy to assemble. Study, built well. Fits Shop Fox W1819 table saw. Casters function well.

And those stupid costumes! And the hands! The hands! True, this production is not as idiotic as most Rings, and the overall presentation is ALMOST somewhat reminiscent of ye olde Gaza. But the overall effect was annoying enough to wreck the entire concept.I have never heard the Met orchestra sound more lethargic and uninterested. And the staging was as clumsy as could be. For example, the Israelite's rebellion--or whatever it was in Act I--couldn't have been any cornier if the dragon from \\"Siegfried\\" dropped in for a cameo, and the bacchanal could have used a massive injection of Viagra.

It is a compelling contemporary, interpretive look at some truly old favorites. The sound engineering is good, the vocal singing is top notch, the arrangements are fabulous (reflective of Rand's great musical gifts and creative genius) and the disc compares favorably with anything of its kind. Mr. Rand's musical skills continue to be razor sharp. I last heard him perform in the early 1960's, and \\"Old Dogs\\" proves that he still has the goods; he should be on a oldies tour with the likes of Simon and Garfunkel, although his songs aren't oldies. He has produced newbies in old wine skins. I hope the musical world rediscovers his nectar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"It is difficult to imagine a Nina Simone cd that I wouldn't like, but here is one.

If you want to get to know not only the music but the personalities of Rob Thomas and the supporting cast of matchbox20 then this video will do that as it provides backstage footage of the guys which is interesting and hilarious.

It does little to relate the significance of various capabilities for producing quality pictures and the trade-offs that occur. Some of the points are well developed for the novice, whereas others are treated supeficially and assume that the reader already has familiarity with the subject (e.g. the coverage on color). It major strength is an interesting chronology of the evolution of photography to where it is today. My main concern with the book is that it is far from the 'comprehensive, step-by-step guide' that it's title claims it to be. Anyone looking for a book that helps in taking and processing digital pictures will find very little of use here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"If you want a book that will give you a basic understanding of what digital photography is, then this is your best bet. It starts out with a brief history of digital photography, and gives some background on how it differs from film.

If you see that your dad's head is bleeding for no apparent reason, wouldn't you immediately assume that something is terribly wrong?3.

Most bothersome of them is the reanimation of Frank from his brother's blood. No explanation of how or why this might have happened, it's simply happens. I understand that this is a film dealing with a non-physical realm but really, why would the filmmaker refuse to give me some explanation as to why these things happen? Oh, and somehow, demons who seem to have a rubber fetish just don't scare me that much. All in all, the appearance of the demons seemed laughably non-frightening to me.

I haven't checked out the special features yet, but this release is worth the price for picture quality alone. Anchor Bay have really set the bar. Now I wish they'd announce release dates for Hellraiser 2, Creepshow 2, The Hills Have Eyes ('77), the Phantasm films, Sleepaway Camp and Masters of Horror Season 2, not to mention Near Dark (which I think might now be licensed to Lionsgate). Thanks for a great job AB!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Latest Release = ZERO Special Features","review":"The most recent release of Hellraiser on Blu-Ray has NO special features. Do NOT purchase the Midnight Madness Series version. This is just another ploy to make another buck with no effort whatsoever in time for Halloween sales. I love the movie, but this is total B.S. There is no excuse to release Blu-Rays with ZERO special features, ESPECIALLY when previous versions had them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DIFFERENT STYLE OF HORROR!","review":"I HAVE SEEN HORROR MOVIES BEFORE, IE: FRIDAY THE 13TH, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, ETC. BUT NONE OF THEM COME EVEN CLOSE TO THE STYLE OF HELLRAISER. THE MOVIE'S PLOT IS SCARY TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS DISTURBING, BOTH IN THE BLOOD AND GORE, BUT EVEN MORE IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SENSE. IT JUST FREAKS YOU OUT! BRADLEY'S ROAL AS PINHEAD IS ONE OF THE CREEPIEST THINGS I HAVE EVER SEEN. ADD TO THAT A DISTURBING PLOT, CREEPY MUSIC, AND THE INGENIUS IMAGINATION OF CLIVE BARKER, AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING TRUELY AUTHENTIC. NOTE: NOT FOR THE WEAK OF HEART! RATED R FOR: EXTREME VIOLENCE, LANGUAGE, AND A SEX SCENE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellraiser: Blu-Ray DVD","review":"I waited for this to come out in HD for a long time as this was going to be part of my collection if it did - so here I am writing about it now. I ordered it from Amazon for a really reasonable price along with another title that finally came to BD. I am happy and so is my better half (for the other title;) This movie made my skin crawl the first time I saw it and whenever I watch Hellraiser again, I get the same chills. If I'd seen the movie at the theater I would have been on the edge of my seat. There aren't many movies that \\"edge\\" me like that but Hellraiser is surely one of them! I hope the rest of the Hellraiser sequels come to HD too - you know I'll be there for those also!Hellraiser [Blu-ray]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated.","review":"Clive Barker's Hellraiser is on of the most overrated movies ever. I saw this movie when I was young and did not like it, but about twelve years later I gave it a second chance. I liked it even less.A silly, foolish, sadistic movie that plays like a bad independent film. More of the blood and guts that we have all seen over and over agian but with some real sick elements thrown in.The monster Pinhead was a real good force in the movie but the other monsters are just silly looking.If he wanted to show us the horrors of hell (and why would anyone want to do that?)he ended up just grossing me out instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood and guts but that's about it","review":"To answer the reviewer below me, there is scene of very brief nudity with Claire Higgins. As to how good the movie is, it's not much. There are some dark and grisly scenes but most of the time it's too slow moving to maintain interest. Instead of making the Cenobites creatures of wonder and terrror Barker just has them torture people with chains that seem to come out of nowhere. As for the sequel, Hellbound is actually a pretty good movie. It's slow, but a lot more interesting than Hellraiser.The best Clive Barker adaptation out there is definitely Candyman which is probably the best horror film of the decade so I suggest you watch that instead of Hellraiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pinhead for President","review":"This original Hellraiser was showing commercial free in HD last night for Halloween. It's one of the few well known horror movies that I had somehow missed and frankly, I'm still wondering what's to like? A magic box and strange creatures sounds like it should be a lot of fun. I enjoy horror movies with suspense and surprises. In regard to gore, I can take it or leave it. It's just that I didn't notice anything imaginative or creative, and the conclusion was quite predictable and uninspired. Maggots, rotten flesh and bones, and literally, a sadistic bloodsucker upstairs are the order of the day! I guess jealousy can be a real obstacle in achieving one's goals in life. Honestly, I was bored to death, and even Jason dressed in button-up pajamas, and ready to be tucked in, seemed like a potential oscar nomination in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Hell","review":"This film, along with the others(Part 3 is the only one I can stand), are cold, lifeless pieces of tripe. There is no entertainment value in any frame of this film. Not one single enjoyable moment. Pinhead is an interesting creation, but there is not enough of him to be seen in any of the movies to make him scary or to have a lasting impact. This movie is pure slime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why again the R Version","review":"Two decades ago i bought Hellraiser on Laserdisc with a R rating, but on special features they had the two cutted scenes in it.On DVD i guess where 3 different releases, but all with the R rating.I\`d hoped on Blue comes the Unrated version.Now i see it is hopeless,I like the movie very much but they dont get any money from me, for a R RATED version. I am sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll have the bloodiest ride of your life!","review":"No video collection is complete without a copy of this masterpiece.

It is a new for horror genres. A must see as is its sequels none of which were let downs! A++++!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surely an exceptional horror flick.","review":"I am a fan of horror films. Good horror films, and when I watched 'Hellraiser', I know that it is simply different than the typical ones that I have been watching all my life. Barker certainly have the talent in writing and directing his work, but though some people may argue that the films have some human interest on it, I think that the storyline of the film is a bit weak, though interesting. It is the whole concept of the Cenobites that really strikes me in the film: Truly unique as well as disturbing. If only these Cenobites are being let out into the reality of the film, the film would have scored a perfect five from me. A gory, satisfying horror film."},{"rating":"2","title":"About as Scary as Horror Can Be","review":"As we all know, most horror movies are sufficient to scare you up until about age 10. After that, most horror is cliche-ridden gorefest shot full of plot holes. Hellraiser, however, is a story that can still scare the [life] out of you no matter what you've seen.The movie is a masochistic nightmare wrapped around lust, innocence, evil, and bravery, with some inter-dimensional exploration on the side.The FX are a bit dated for the 21st century, but since they add to the story instead of replacing it you can forgive them. Makeup art on the Cenobites, however, is fantastic. Almost any movie fan has to recognize Pinhead, who was made an instant horror icon by this great film.If you don't mind blood and like a good scare, grab Hellraiser before anything else on the horror shelf at you DVD rental store. Thanks Clive Barker! Good job.-- JJ Timmins"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the uncut version??!!? Uncut Version: 5 stars!!!","review":"I first saw this DVD at my friend's place. I was instantly blown away by this movie. In fact, i consider this one of the best horror movies ever made! But my friend's dvd was completly uncut (he owns the american DVD edition). I wanted to have the same totally uncut version my friend owns,but this new cut version is missing great parts like the full shot of the \\"Ripped to shreds\\" scene. Who the hell thought of cutting essential parts of an otherwise awesome movie??? Seems like i must search hardly now for the first UNCUT edition print of this DVD in other areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror at its best!","review":"'Hellraiser' is one of the greatest horror movies ever made, EVER!! Clive Barker's vision is so dark, so appalling and so disgusting, yet at the same time it can be so appealling and desirable. Aren't we all (or haven't we at some time) searching for the ultimate in pleasure? That's what makes the Lament configuration (the puzzle box) so appealling to so many. And, that's what makes this movie so much more than your typical horror, gore-fest, it contains the most base feelings that we all have: desire. The storyline, writing and directing are first-rate, not to mention Mr. Doug Bradley (aka Pinhead). In other words.....Time to play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This may be one of the most uncomfortable horror films ever!","review":"Wow this movie gives you a cold, damp feel that will never be forgotten by any who see it's horrific power. Pinhead's first venture is a story mostly about a man who'se escaped the cenobites, lead by Pinhead, and is now back on Earth. But there's one little problem. He's got no skin! His lover, who is also his sister-in-law (Star Wars-ish stuff going on here) lures men into a creepy-as-hell room and leaves them to the skinless Frank, who then consumes their skin to become a member of the SGOTHR : Skin Group Of The Human Race. Throughout the film we get infamous skinless rats, gross-out gratuitous bugs and enough gore to please! Basically Gone With The Wind Goes To Hell. NOTE : WE'LL TEAR YOU'RE SOUL APART!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellraiser, a movie you'll never forget.","review":"Incredible....period. Nothing more to say about this movie than what I just said. Despite some of it's VERY gruesome scenes, HELLRAISER stands out from any other horror movie, being the top on the charts. Like a few other's said before, the movie may be a little draggy from time to time, but that's where the story comes in, during those parts. Overall, it's a great movie, but people with weezy stomachs, I would suggest you try A Nightmare on Elm Street instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Good Movie","review":"I can say with COMPLETE CONFIDENCE THIS IS THE GREATEST HORROR MOVIE OF ALL TIME,NOTHING TOPS IT SIMPLE.Everything about this movie is exceptionally done.Get this,Hellraiser 2 and Nightmare on elm street 3 for a NIGHT of EXTREME TERROR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!","review":"I realy think hellraiser is a brilliant horror movie that is why i own and watch it all the time !

As a general rule, I avoid horror movies and slasher flicks. Yet, I made it a point to watch this entire series- more than once._Then it hit me. All of these movies have a \\"message.\\" Under all the gore is one central message: \\"Do not let your flesh murder your spirit.\\" Think about it, every character that is butchered and torn to bits has pretty well deserved it- it was their weakness and ambition that led them to it. Otherwise the Box would have held no fascination for them.... A spiritually centered being , such as a saint or a shaman, can laugh as he is being flayed by demons (or Cenobites.)_\\"Pinhead\\" ,you see, is a spiritual teacher- if you give too much importance to worldly matters and the flesh, then you deserve what you get...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellraiser: One of the Best Horror Flicks","review":"This movie is maybe my favorite horror movie. It's first in line for me. This movie isn't for the squeamish because it's very gory (with a lot of hook action). Doug Bradley portrayed Pinhead with great excellence. I also loved the Chatterer cenobite. Clive Barker has written and directed this film with great power. Right now I'm going to put in order my favorite horror flicks. You'll probably agree with me on how I put them:1. Hellraiser2. Halloween3. A Nightmare on Elm Street4. Texas Chainsaw Massacre5. Friday the 13thMind you I'm speaking of the original films. So if you want gore, some nasty looking beings, and a good story, you're gonna love Hellraiser. And for all you non horror movie fans, get a copy of Freddy's Dead (IT (...) THOUGH). See ya. 3/16/03"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Midnight Madness version stinks & is defective.","review":"I bought this because I have the Starz/AnchorBay blu ray box set in the plastic cube box. While the quality of that disc is great and there are a lot of extras, including interviews with the main cast etc, the discs (Hellraiser Blu Ray, Hellraiser SD, and Hellraiser 2 SD), are stuck in the hard plastic cube case and are a bit scratched. So far, they play, but I am worried the scratches may affect play later on.While this new Image/Lakeshore Entertainment blu ray version is not scratched, the quality seems to be a bit inferior to the Starz/Anchor Bay one.In the opening scene right after Frank takes the box from the merchant, you see a few very large blue flashes (scratches) in the print, that are not present in the Starz/Anchor Bay disc. The S/AB print is a bit cleaner as well.I hope the rest of the print is not inferior.

(and more disturbingly, liking it!).It might not be the goriest movie ever, but it does has it's moments, the acting is as good as you're going to find in this type of film & the characters are awesome.Pinhead is without doubt THE horror icon. Only Freddy, Jason Vorhees & Michael Myers come anywhere near Pinhead, but it terms of visual presence and downright creepiness they aren't even fit to lace old Pinhead's boots (assuming he wears any).This movie really deserves 10 stars! Nothing before it or since has bettered it as far as out and out horror films go (although the sequel - Hellbound - comes close & it's well worth watching the 2 back to back as they fit almost seamlessly).Take a bow Clive Barker, you mastered your art with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment!","review":"This movie was totally ridiculous!

It is captivating, well-informed, witty and warm. He moves skillfully from historical accounts to present-day portrayals of people and places, from anecdotes to lessons in art history. Almost anyone can travel, even to remote and dangerous places, and many can write about it, but few can match William Dalrymple in giving an evocative and intelligent account and in taking the reader on a wonderful journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining quest","review":"The idea of following Marco Polo is a provocative one. I enjoy Dalrymple's accounts of the journey. However, I did not anticipate the amount of the text that would be devoted to elaborate descriptions of architecture. It seems as though every time the action lags, (for whatever reasons) the author resorts to some sort of florid default. I do not know if the author was schooled in architecture, but it sure seems so from the persistent convention of architectural description. I have nothing against this discipline, but I specifically chose this book because I thought that it would NOT be like a thousand textbooks I have seen on similar subjects. Happily, the \\"traveller on-the-go\\" sections were remarkably funny and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Entertaining","review":"After reading a number of travel books this year in my travel-seminar, I found Dalrymple's journey to be refreshing in that there was more action, more to follow, more to experience. As you travel through the Middle East and into the Orient, Dalrymple goes into great detail about local architecture, history lessons of Kublai Khan and the great sultans, the smells of the food, the warmth of the cay tea...the descriptions paint a very clear pciture in your head. Dalrymple's adventure is even more entertaining due to the risk implied in traveling through countries like China and Iran during the 1980's. A myriad of interesting events and hold-ups do a good job of holding your attention, but beware of the multiple foreign words, there is some glossary-diving involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated","review":"i started reading this book because i found his other books really good. but In Xanadu was a disappointment.

She and I love this DVD. It contains never before seen footage of some of the music videos. Of course video quality is impeccable. No more grainy you tube videos (for those songs at least). I only gave it 4 stars because the DVD omitted \\"Smooth Criminal and They Don't Care About Us\\". We enjoy sitting together and singing along with Micheal while he performs.

It contains Bad, Billie Jean, Thriller, Black or White (with some information that at the time it was contravercial), Rock With You, Remember the Time, and The Way You Make Me Feel. I think I like the Black or White on the History II better because the making of the film bit and controvercy parts were left out. I plan to donate my MJ books to the local library after I've read them. It is a way to get out that he was innocent and that his kind of entertainment talent only happens once. I am a new fan; post MJ's death. To keep his legacy alive we need to spread the word. I'd like to see a book dedicated soley to MJ's humanitarian deeds. He was such a loving and caring person."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT dvd","review":"i already have a lot of the songs on dvd, but i loved this dvd because it had the long versions of bad and the way you make me feel on it - my kids watched this dvd in our van today and i used the long version of bad to teach them a lesson about life - there were some people in the dvd who were going to hurt an older gentleman if he wouldn't give them some money, and michael ended up saving the man and proving to those other peers that he was truly \\"bad\\" anyways!! i taught the kids that people will respect you for standing up for your convictions and telling the truth to them (like michael told his peers in the end that they were doing the wrong thing) - because at the end of the song, those peers who did the wrong thing and michael shook hands. it was a neat lesson that i didn't know existed in the song bad until i saw the longer version. plus it has lots of great hits on it like billie jean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"he's bad!","review":"can't really say too much, michael's incredible, incomparable talent says it all. im proud of him still, and he proves that he is bad despite his weaknessness and downfalls (we all have them) It doesn't take away from his genius, he's number one!!! and ya'll know it!!!remember the time someone rocked with you, and gave you a thriller, but that PYT billie jean was not your lover, so you told her to beat it and you just wanted her to leave you alone? it didn't matter if she was black or white, you didn't stop till you got enough. bad is the way you make me feel, so let's pray and try to heal the world and make it a better place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good read!","review":"This is a funny, romantic novel with an interesting edge to it.

That's saying a lot, because I usually like Spike Lee and I have seen a lot of movies. He almost had me. I could get over Damon Wayne's terrible acting, but I simply cannot get over the end of the movie. It was incredibly self-indulgent and absolutely over-dramatised. I got the message... because it was bashed into my head about a million times. By the end of the movie, I felt like I had been bamboozled into sitting for that long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Meaningful Film","review":"Spike Lee's Bamboozled is one of the more meaningful films of the year. It combines great performances by Damon Wayans, Savion Glover, and Jada Pinkett Smith, some humorous moments, and the movie itself is meaningful because it's not afraid to say that racism still exists. This is also a great DVD. New Line's Platinum Series DVDs are always packed with special features. The features on this DVD will take you behind the ideas of this film. For an important, somewhat humorous experience, Bamboozled is a good movie to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spike shows he's no Paddy","review":"Strange that Spike Lee would write an homage to Paddy Chayefsky's satirical masterpiece, but not \\"get it.\\" He starts the film as a wonderfully bizarre fantasy like \\"Network\\" but then asks us to take the events seriously, forcing his actors to play heavy dramatic scenes in which they question their part in a completely unreal minstrel show. A fascinating farce degrades into embarrassing angst and finally into downright melodrama. Note to Spike: farce is meant to be fantasy, not reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa","review":"I will not elaborate too much. This film had great camera work. I am a fan of hand held filming because its a lost art form. It is a very imortant movie to watch. I notice the negative feedbacks but I feel that is only a product of the shock and emotion that this movie provokes. Perhaps its the guilt of finding pleasure in the popular forms of black entertainment today that Spike Lee is so strongly against. So i will stress again please do see this film it is one of Spike Lee's better films."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea, terrible movie","review":"What a mess made of a great premise. Yes, reviving a black minstrel show is a monsterously great idea for satire; this could have been an epic moment for Spike Lee to use racist materials in order to destroy them with class, confidence and wickedly funny smarts. But no, Spike's only expression is angst and reverse racism, rolled up in a bunch of \\"safe\\" hammy melodrama and self-consciousness. It's not funny at all, and very boring. Worse, it all looks very amateurish, like Lee's a film student without the ability to pull all his ideas together. The film never finds a consistant tone and the end is just laughably bad. Your time is better spent reading a book about blackface or Bert Williams, or doing anything than watching this lousy dreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"spike leez a genius","review":"the 6th bestest film to come out of 2000!! thuis fimn is just gtreatz. the acting by damon wayzns was amaing. who thought thatz hez beez able to act soo good?? i didn't. everyone ois perfectly casyt in this outstanding movie. i love everyt minute of it. spike lee isz a genius!!....peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Typical Spike Lee Film","review":"I had to watch this movie for my english class it was a typical Spike Lee Film- meant to be funny, but leading astray until his point was to make a political statement.

And about Black entertainers keeping all the money as represented by the novelty bank. This is a good movie and is best watched with likeminded friends like watching Office Space or Princess Bride - it's more fun to laugh with others when watching this movie. Jada Pinkett Smith looks really pretty in everyday clothes and the best part ... Damon Wayans as a Buppie puts his HAND on her shoulder and arm and squeezes. Gack = I hate American and Western touchy culture and obviously, I am not alone in my detestation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, ground-breaking","review":"This is simply an excellent film. It is very well-written and well acted. It was shot on digital off-the-shelf cameras and maintained the quality of modern film-making. This is a ground-breaking film in many aspects.The story, a modern satire, is pentultimate expression of Spike Lee's work. The story shocks and surprises on so many levels. The personal response of the viewer can be surprising, revealing. Spike Lee attempts and succeeds in showing every conceivable point-of-view of the topic and lays it out for the viewer like an intellectual smorgasborg. Prepare to be surprised at your own feelings and thoughts, no matter who you are. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Spike....Why?","review":"One thing that Spike loves to do, is get his message across. But what he doesn't seem to understand is that is MUCH better to let people figure out the message, instead of beating us over the head with it, which this constantly does through its entirety. The Tommy Hilfiger skit was good, but a little overdone and tacky. The ending was just completely horrible, and just seems like Spike really couldn't think of a good way to end the film. And of course there is Spike Lee traditions of having characters riding on a trolley when they are supposed to be walking. Come on Spike! This was innovative when your first did, but now it's just OLD!!!! STOP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent and difficult to watch","review":"If you're a die-hard Spike Lee fan, then maybe you should get this. Otherwise, forget it. Damon Wayans is so bad in this movie that it makes it painful to watch at all. I found myself embarrased for both him and Spike. This movie doesn't get its message across by example or story -- characters simply hit you over the head by shouting out Spike Lee's ideas and themes in clumsy dialogue. The only good thing about the movie is that there is never a dull moment. If you can ignore Damon's forced accent and insipid delivery, you can actually be marginally entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality was good, but the movie was definitely not","review":"The quality/packaging of the DVD was good, beside the fact that it still had the library labels on it, which is probably where amazon recieved it from. But the movie was not good. I had never seen it before, but because after purchasing \\"A soliders Story\\" it was recommended as a movie I would like. So I purchased it, and I was so dissatisfied by the movie. It wasnt neccessarily the content that was dissatifying, more so the quality of the picture, the producing and directing, it was just not good. There were some known actors in this movie but didn't really boost the overall performance of the movie. The price was cheap, but still wasnt worth it,atleast not to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bamboozled","review":"Bamboozle- to trick or deceive, hoodwink. I'm not quite sure why this movie has been titled as it has. Spike Lee has created a movie that has done everything but be deciving. One more hurtful part of not only America's past but also Europe's, has been placed out in the open for the world to see. Blackface.This movie has a wide aray of actors- some that you'll recognize and others that you will not. It is a dramatic documentary but it has been done so well that it is quite appealing. To be honest, I didn't like the movie until I saw it for a third time. At first it was terribly offensive. It wasn't until I saw what Lee was really trying to project to the audience that I realized how good it was. In general I'd recomend it to anyone with an openmind."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I really want is O Stars...","review":"In high school, I tried to convince our African American STudies teacher to plan a field trip to see this movie. He rebuffed me, and when I saw this movie on tape, I knew why.I am glad that I am not the only one who knows Spike Lee is a racist. And a slick one at that. He does these movies and black people go see them (I am black, so don't attack me). Do The Right Thing was horrible, Jungle Fever (he ought to be ashamed) all in the name of \\"eye-opening\\" filmmaking. Give me a breakBamboozled...I don't know what to say about this movie. Stereotypes, senseless violence, just downright shameful. There was no message here...except that, we, as black people, sometimes do it to ourselves (ex. Soul Plane? same problem). And helping this man, for the sake of a paycheck is deplorable.Please spare yourself of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hit! You go, Spike!","review":"This movie didn't do well at the box office, but so what? Spike Lee has created a masterpiece. I was mesmerized by his tale of upwardly mobile Black folks who got caught up in the entertainment biz, to the point of dissing their own community. While Pierre Delacroix started out with one frame of mind, by the end of the movie he had completely \\"sold out\\". Unfortunately, shows like \\"Girlfriend\\" and \\"The Parkers\\" carry on the minstrelsy type drivel that passes for Black entertainment. I'm just as guilty as everyone else though, because sometimes I find myself watching these stereotype-laden shows.Spike is a genius. One day he will get his just desserts. I'm a big fan, and look forward to the next thought provoking film from one of the greatest directors of all times.Racism is not going away, and it is good to see that some Black directors are not hiding their heads in the sand from this controversial subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I have enjoyed several Spike Lee movies in the past but I can't say the same for this one. I think I cut the movie off about 3/4 of the way. Watching this movie was like pulling teeth (really). As a matter of fact, I have already resold this movie. In my opinion, the best part of the movie was the part with comedian Paul Mooney. I would have rather seen a documentary from Spike about the stereotypes of Black actors from the 1930's to the present."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE stop this man before he makes another movie!","review":"I have no idea how Spike Lee got where he is. This film has everything - BAD directing. BAD writing. BAD editing. BAD acting (What IS Damon doing, a bad imitation of Richard Pryor doing an imitation of a white guy?). BAD filming to begin with - I have home movies that look better. There go a few hours that I'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperate","review":"Fifty years from now, movie and social historians might study this film as a time capsule of race psychopathia in the 21st century. When this movie came out, Spike Lee gleefully bragged on cable television how he wanted to \\"lay it on the line\\" about race relations in America. What he should have said is that \\"I'm gonna make a movie where all the whites are stereotypical bigots, slobs and monsters. All the blacks will be portrayed as helpless victims who have no wills of thier own.\\" The only thing missing from the white characters are Ku Klux Klan signs around their necks. While Lee spends his time attacking what he perceives to be inherent racism in caucasians, he says nothing about his own obvious tendency of racially profiling the hated ethnic group. No wonder this movie bombed big-time in America. What movie goer wants to be labeled a racist monster just because their skin isn't the right hue for Spike Lee?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very racist movie from a very racist director","review":"Racist drivel!

This is soooooo funny. Why and how the British can get away with poking such unrelenting fun at the Catholic Church, I'll never know.

Basically they are two guys, who happen to be priests getting into all kinds of hilarious situations.This is more edgy and and a bit vile at times (but in a good comedic way) than the sweet Vicar of Dibley.

The assumption seems to be that kids are not smart enough and/or not be interested enough to hear about how humans use and find peace through meditative techniques.The text also over-generalizes the ideas and although there are slighly more lengthy explanation pages at the end of the book, there is still a tone of being talked down to which is a real turn-off.Peaceful Piggy Meditation may have its place within a larger teaching unit on prayer, meditation, and self-awareness but the book does not, unfortunately, stand alone as instruction for what meditation is and how to use it, nor is it a stand alone \\"storybook.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Intro to Meditation for Young Children","review":"One of my favorites, this book presents meditation as a tool kids can use to help them deal with the difficult everyday situations they most often confront - getting teased by their siblings, falling down at school, or served a dinner they can't stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parents Prefer Peaceful Piggies!","review":"What a lovely little book!

Virginia Woolf committed suicide. All the more reason to avoid this book lest the contagion of her world view infect your mind and depress you. This is a dated, pretentious, dry, irrelevant novel. I am asuming that it is being pushed because it is poilitically correct to have at least one female author in the great books list. Unfortunately, this is a dead author whose works should have been allowed to die with her rather than be immortalized.

Woolf uses the seemingly \\"boring\\" events of an everyday life to delve the depths of the human psyche. As I read this book and became more intricately involved with the characters, I found my eternal quest for meaning wrapped up in everything Woolf's characters thought. Some may see this as a duldrum account of characters' lives that they can't even begin to relate to; look deeper though and you'll see your own existence being challenged and pulled by the realities of life Woolf presents in this excellent novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Along the stream of consciousness","review":"Those of you interested in an engaging plot should, in general, shy away from Virginia Woolf. _Lighthouse_ is an exquisite novel that explores the minds of its characters.

I'm also aware that Woolf is someone who many respect, but whose style they may not necessarily like. I am one of those people. Woolf's experimental style--stream of consciousness--is revolutionary, coming at a time when most writers began to break free of Pre-WWI literary conventions.However, she remains, to this day, someone who is difficult to read and difficult to comprehend. Reading \\"To the Lighthouse\\" was relatively easy. But understanding it was not. To be more vulgar, it was so boring, I lost any sense of awareness of the story and the characters. Some say Mrs. Ramsay's thoughts were complex and ahead of her time; I say they were small and meaningless. And the men were even smaller, even more base.

Clearly, the Ramsey's are based on her own parents; and though this was written in 1927 and she drowned herself in the River Ouse in 1941, she foreshadows her suicide on almost every other page of this book. How or why anyone would recommend it is beyond me. Better to read Proust or Faulkner or Kathy Acker.(Waterily and Ghostlily are illustrative of Woolfe's horrible diction and mindset, as are these parentheses)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bumblin', stumblin', fumblin'.","review":"I see Woolf's point. I understand what she was doing and saying. But it was poorly executed. Every bit of it from beginning to end.She can't hold a single thought or development for long enough to make me care about anything. The writing seems to have been a toy for the writer, and not at all a serious attempt at a novel.

However, who could honestly say that there is something going on here that wasn't done much better by writers such as Joyce or Faulkner -- who also, by the way, generally had the courtesy and ability to include characters worthy of your attention, and a plot worth following. \\"To the Light-house\\" comes off as a college-lit writing exercise by a very precocious and observant writer, but one that ultimately lacks some very important abilities necessary to create top-shelf fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing on audio","review":"Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"Slow isn't necessarily bad, but in this book it was. I am biased against the \`consciousness' style of writing, so my perception of this book was already negative before I started reading it. The book wasn't too difficult to understand (unlike The Sound and Fury by Faulkner) but it was just plain uninteresting. William Bankes (a character in the book) said concerning literature \\"let us enjoy what we do enjoy,\\" and I simply did not enjoy Virginia Wolfe's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and thought provoking.","review":"Woolf's work is always more of a journey than a read and as such, as with all journeys, you need to stop and take stock along the way to make sense of your experiences, digest what is and learn to love and to appreciate it. The simplist and tiniest of actions are examined in microscopic detail so as to capture the finer feeling of the moment and what it is to be alive, here this concept is fully realised juxtaposed against terrific loss and the emotion of carrying on into newer less certain times and with assumed constants gone.Enriching and beautiful. Once you reach her pitch, Woolf is a joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Long Interior Monologue Delivered By Milquetoast","review":"Woolf has a canny ability to explore the secret hidden motives and interior monologues of all her characters, but in this book she chooses some pretty unnoteworthy subjects.

It's a brilliant book, really. There are points when you're reading this book where you can step back and look at a paragraph or a passage or a chapter and say: THAT'S how a good book should be written, that's how brilliant authors do their thing.Which is why I feel guilty that I hated this book so much. It was a scant 200 pages, and it took me MONTHS to read; I hated all the characters, hated the writing style, hated everything about the book, which is weird because I completely recognize just how good of a book it was. It makes me shudder a little bit to think back on it. If I were forced to reread this book, I actually might start chewing on my wrists.So there it is.

Although there is a lot of prose on the pages, I found that in the end I knew very little about the major characters. This book just wasn't worth the read for me.For those of you who don't like \\"spoilers\\" (there is one shocker at the end of the first time period), don't read the introduction by Eudora Welty found in this version.

That said, To the Lighthouse is one of her more difficult works; it follows the character's internal lives in a very Joyce-ian way, and like all true stream of consciousness writing, can be hard to fully comprehend. But the depth of feeling she manages to encapsulate with her deft turn of phrase is remarkable, and well worth reading. I don't recommend this novel for those who have never read Woolf before. Start with Mrs. Dalloway, and when you read To the Lighthouse later, you'll appreciate it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Abridged editions","review":"If you are looking for an audio recording of Virginia Woolf's complete book, be cautious here.

Giles writes as though you literally KNOW the characters, and you worry at each loss and cheer at each win! I am only sorry Ms Giles didn't begin writing years earlier so there'd be more of her literature to enjoy,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Savanna Jacket Illustration","review":"I just discovered the authoress Janice Holt Giles and began this book a few days ago. The opening was remarkable in both clarity of description and prosaic nature. I felt like I knew and understood Savanna intrinsically. Does anyone know who the illustration on the dust jacket was done by? I can find no credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I couldn't get past the first 15 seconds of most songs. Anyone giving this a good review is an employee of the company producing this junk or related to the artist. Go back to to Malibu Judge and stop wasting your dad's money."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding","review":"I'm not much for rap, but do appreciate talent in the genre. This \\"debut\\" has everything BUT talent. The \\"judge\\" sounds scared during his raps, as if maybe he should have practiced them more. The music is tired and regardless of obvious influences, he could have at least tried something original. Attempting to shock the audience with foul language does not make you an artist.Take some music and writing lessons judge.....then you can have a say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Architecturally interesting","review":"The structure of this book, built on the parallellism of King David's and David Wheaton's lives is fascinating, as is David Wheaton himself. The central character Emma, and her husband Nick are complex but seem to be missing some pinch of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of L'Engle's adult fiction, but I was bored to tears by this book. The plot was interesting on a purely intellecual level, and I give her credit for coming up with something orginal, but to me it read more like a study of the many wives of King David than a novel that I could relate to in any way. I felt nothing for any of the characters, and ended up having to put the book down due to extreme apathy. Perhaps there was some kind of epiphany the was waiting for me in the last half of the book, but I wouldn't bet on it. Her two novels about the life of the young woman whose mother was a famous musician were excellent, if you haven't read any of L'Engle's older ficiton I would start there."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a pad or rug than a blanket","review":"I ordered this to replace a large throw blanket. I unpacked it and found that it was VERY thick. Much thicker than any blanket I've ever seen before. It's thinner than a quilt but much stiffer. It is really more like a mattress pad than any type of bed covering. It also does not drape well at all because it's so stiff. I fact I had to smash it down some in order to get the laptop I'm using to lay flat.It is a LOVELY dark green, very soft, and the overall impression is one of quality. I'm going to wash it a few times and see if it relaxes some. If it doesn't frankly I have no idea what I could use it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drop... Tuning","review":"I bought this book after buying the cd Animosity. I have liked Sevendust's music a lot, and I wanted to learn how to play it. First off, there are no chord examples in the book, so one must have an adequate knowledge of guitar chords, which I lack. But beyond that, the worst aspect of this book is the horrible tuning Sevendust uses. For example, in a song, the tuning is explained as \\"guitars tuned 2 steps down from drop D tuning\\" This way, the first and sixth strings are tuned down three whole steps. Tuning this way 1)is a pain ...2)makes the strings loose and floppy. Another bad point of this book is that the music is incomplete, and the transcription is not matching the recording when played in standard tuning... or something. Anyway, this book is not good for someone who just wants to play the music and not do all the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but detailed, introduction to crypto and security","review":"This book should appeal to both the beginner and the professional in network security. The book starts with very few assumptions about the existing security knowledge of the reader yet still manages to explain, in considerable depth, encryption and security protocols.Best of all, it's extremely well written, well illustrated and peppered with some good humour. A topic like this could be tedious to read, but this book isn't (although I have to admit, the chapter on Kerberos didn't quite spark me up the way the rest of it did!).The book has some excellent mathematical background for those who want to understand public key cryptography but aren't that familiar with modular exponentiation and the like. It also has detailed descriptions of a number of algorithms.In summary, an excellent all-rounder on this extremely important topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Textbook","review":"Great book for learning cryptography, authentication, or about Internet Standards such as PKI and Kerberos. It is heavy on the math and theory aspects, the book actually includes an interesting chapter on Number Theory. The last chapter entitled Folklore is a refreshing way to cap off the book. The one catch is that there is little to no pseudo-code included with the examples, so you code junkies will have to start from scratch. Overall the author's attempt at a light approach to dense material helps ease the fact that it really is dense material. It covers the bases and has some nice extra material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrasing (I miss my TiVo)","review":"I like my alarm clock better than this thing...Not well thought out, difficult to use, fast forward and rewind don't \\"jump\\" back to the point of pressing play (causing the viewer to miss 20 seconds of his program only to rewind to watch 10 seconds of commercial - why?), \\"Series Link\\" feature way too difficult to use (compared with TiVo's Season Pass), etc, etc, etc.I have been a big fan of DirecTv up to this point - Too bad they made the decision to walk away from TiVo and force this dinosaur on their customers.

However, Directv users really have no choice, they have to buy it anyway.

Thankfully, it was only $99 which reduces the pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolutely terrible product.","review":"As a loyal, and \\"preferred\\" DirecTV customer for many years, I find it disgraceful that they're allowing a product that performs this poorly to have their name on it. Since my very reliable Samsung lost a disk drive 4 months ago and DirecTV informed me I had to return the DVR that I bought myself for one of theirs, I was misled in trusting that their DVR service and hardware would be equal to or better than what I had been using for about 3-4 years. Hardly. Since this thing has invaded our home like a colony of ants, I have to reset it routinely, constantly miss programs that I'd scheduled to record, and dealt with literally hundreds of strange bugs in the software. Whereas once, DirecTV was one of the best companies I'd ever dealt with as far as customer service, they are completely uninterested in dealing with this problem.They must be taking hundreds of phonecalls every hour with complaints about this shoddy and overhyped product.Shame on them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible...","review":"This is absolutely the worst piece of electronics ever to be manufactured. We have had to get a VCR to make sure our shows get recorded, because this one locks up so much. We called DirecTV technical support. They had us reset our box and lose all of our recorded programming only to still have problems.Additionally, DirecTV nickles and dimes us to death. We are stuck in a two yaar contract because we got this horrible DVR. Boy, do I miss cable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this DVR","review":"But I'm sending it back to Direct TV with few regrets. Locked up often, was hard to navigate through recorded material, and to top it off when it quit receiving the international channels before the warranty was up Direct TV wanted me to pay $77 for a tech to come out and look at it. Thanks but no thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE IT!!!","review":"Just like many of the other reviewers - I HATE THIS MACHINE! Even my child asked to have \\"our old TiVo\\" back!

It is better to pay for a TiVo that actually works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Image Quality, Everything Else is Bad","review":"The Good:* The image quality is great. It's difference between a capture card and actually saving the digital signal is huge.The Bad:* Max of 4x forward and reverse* Can't jogg to some arbitrary time code for a recording, you can only fast forward.* No 30 second skip* Frequent lockups* Non-intuitive User Interface* All actions are slow, dvr is slow to respond* Actions like play may get queued up, so you won't be able to stop a fast forward where you want* Doesn't respond well with a sketchy harddrive (software is not robust at all)* Some recording are unplayable, the dvr get's stuck on a bad sector or something.* Incredibly slow boot up time* Has problems using phone connection for PPV orderingThe Ugly:* DirecTV dls shows to your dvr you didn't subscribe for and won't let you delete them.

Any comparison between this and TiVo is pure \\"BULL\\". Directv's technical staff to every question is to \\"punch the Red reset button\\" and hope that it solves the problem and if that doesn't work disconnect the power and allow the unit to reset completely. I had a TiVo for years with little problem. When I received the NEW improved Directv model, it did not work and was replaced, was charged $55 for replacement which was credit some time after Directv received.WHEN BACK TO MY OLD OUT OF DATE TIVO.....IF YOU WANT A UNHAPPY EXPERIENCE, TRY ONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating piece of junk","review":"I agree with all that has been said before. Before reading these reviews I thought the problem with my unit freezing and needing to constantly be rebooted was that it was a rare lemon. I have had a Samsung dvr for years and have had flawless service out of it, and it is a dream to operate. I leased this second DVR for other household members and found it impossible to program and quite clumsy in operation. Why do I need to push the guide button twice just to see the channel guide? Why is it so slow in opening and changing operations? I canceled the lease, but Directv in it's usual incompetency has not bothered to pick it up. I offered to drive 40 miles to deliver it to a retail store and they refused because it had to sent by FedEX."},{"rating":"1","title":"It died and hubby is doing the happy dance.","review":"The Direct TV DVR died this morning. After putting up with this DVR for quite some time much to my husbands displeasure it finally died. Hubby is so happy right now as he has HATED the thing with a passion since we got it. He misses the TiVo that we use to have and loved but also died.He had bought a couple of used Direct TV TiVo's from a friend with plans on putting in a larger hard drive and getting a TiVo back up and running. Now he'll be able to do this.When you get a Direct TV DVR you don't own it, it is leased. Even though I had to pay $100 to lease it and then another $5 a month. Direct TV will only replace THEIR unit if you pay for a $70 service call and it is deemed a qualifying reason that the unit broke (whatever that might be).Do yourself a favor and buy a used Direct TV TiVo it is by far more superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"All been said","review":"I am adding my two cents just to vent. I've had seven technicians out to work on my system and the thing still doesnt work right. I have been a loyal Directv customer for over 10 years but I am about to give up. They are basically beta testing these crappy boxes with their customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Way Out","review":"Do as I did.

(I've dropped a few worse books midway through, but I was stuck on an airplane for 10 hours with only a copy of The Pelican Brief so I had no choice but to finish it.) The biggest problem with the book is that the plot makes absolutely no sense. Think about it. The Darby character has NO direct evidence with respect to her theory. Once she's passed the information on to the authorities, killing her does nothing but validate the theory. So if they had succeeded in killing her, it's highly likely that the authorities would eventually figure out that her theory was valid. As a result, Darby's fate is irrelevant. This book is one of the reasons that I never read anything on the best seller list (except for freakish exceptions like Pynchon and DeLillo). Oh, I just remembered one book I read that was even worse (Patriot Games, further support for my policy of avoiding best sellers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pelican Brief","review":"One of Grisham's best...couldn't put this one down ... every page was better than the last ..full of class and suspense!This one got me hooked on Grisham!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Grisham's best","review":"I felt like how this brief was written and believed was not very realistic, but it was still a fun and exciting read.

And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all.

It took 2/3 of the book to really get down to what the pelican brief was. Then the last 1/3 was like watching a car chase.

Left disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I purchased this book thinking it was new from your discription.

This type of deceptive advertising is not worthy of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Could Have Been A Lot Better","review":"I have heard of many of books by this author as being great but this book was kind of discouraging.

But it's BORING! I had to force myself to finish it. Cuz I'm not used to giving up in the middle. But I found this book totally boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage doesn't deserve a Review","review":"If there was a catgory for 0 stars, I would have selected that. It's depressing to realize that truly great modern literature is not being read by people today. Instead they read this boring trash and think they are reading a book by a great author. As a high school teacher, I am disturbed that great books are not being published any longer and that movies are actually being made using the garbage that is being published. I couldn't finish this book. About 2/3's of the way through when I had figured out the end, I asked my husband (who had read the entire book), if there wasn't really a surprise ending. He said \\"no\\", and that I had figured it out. All I could think of was what was all the hoopla about. I didn't waste anymore time reading \\"Pelican Brief\\" and I guarantee you, I will never read another of his books. It's definately 8th grade mentality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliffhanger from the start","review":"Don't expect anything and you will be blown away. Even though Grisham partially relies on obscuring knowledge his characters already have to keep the suspense, there are enough (unknown) parties in the plot to keep you turning the pages. Read it like a movie, it should go really well with popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Pelicans here","review":"If you are looking for a book with pelicans, you've come to the wrong place. The title is decieving - pelicans don't even make a \\"brief\\" appearance. Nonetheless, this and other Grisham novels provide the kind of predictable fodder that middle Americans seem to sop up like gravy with white bread. There is no literary merit, but no one cares because that isn't the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good even after the movie","review":"My husband cannot understand why I prefer to read a book before I see the movie because it's such fun to see what they leave in, what they take out, how they cast the characters, etc. But I didn't have the opportunity to do so with this book. It was the wonderful movie with Denzell Washington and Julia Roberts which sent me looking for Grisham's books. I've been reading them in the order in which he wrote them and have found them all wonderful. The Pelican Brief exhibits very well something I often find in Grisham's work - the expert unfolding of the story and of the details about the characters' lives. This book, in particular, has a complex plot and a secret long-held within the pages of the book (and as well in the movie) that keeps you spell-bound. I found both main characters to be interesting and I kept wanting to know more about how they thought and how they ticked as they tried to save their lives. Read the book first and then see the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice surprise","review":"When I first started reading this book, I had my doubts for two reasons. Number one, part of it deals with politics which I don't necessarily like in a fiction book. And number two it had a few elements which were similar to the Firm such as the FBI and the goons following the main character. However, as I kept on reading, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. A good plot surfaced complete with smart characters. I ended up liking the book. It isn't the best I've ever read, but good nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you Like Suspense.......","review":"When I got into this Story I couldn't put it down! This book was interesting and engaging. Although at times the plot seemed to drag, overall it was a good quick read. Anyone who enjoys a good suspense thriller will like this book. Grisham's detail of the main character Darby Shaw, makes you actually feel empathy for her and you find yourself pulling for her throughout the book.This novel draws you in and keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. It is an engaging book loaded with excitement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical John Grisham style","review":"I enjoyed this book. Grisham wants to capture the attention of the reader. And it works although there are a few unbelievable elements in the book. But these unrealistic elements are necessary. I wish the government would react to the opinion of students more often. What is also very intresting in the book is, that at the beginning you just have parts of a story and trough the book you get more an more and at the end you can connect everything like a big puzzle. The book is written in typical John Grisham style, very fast and intresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal Favorite","review":"This is my favorite Grisham novel, and I can not say enough good things about it. He is devious and clever in his writing, capturing our attention as well as our imagination.Grisham has created a story about the biggest government cover-up since Watergate.

The ending of each chapter is a cliffhanger. I read this in one sitting. The book is far better than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pelican Brief","review":"The Pelican Brief could have been better, but nonetheless was another example of author John Grisham's ability to write suspenseful, gripping novels about lawyers and other law-involved figures. I am a Republican and conservative, and contrary to another opinion I read I enjoyed it immensly. However, if you have yet to read his book such as The Runaway Jury, The Firm, or The Partner, then you may wish to read these first. Grisham is undoubtedly one of the best authors of today, and this book is another example of his fine work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call me crazy, but I liked this one more than \\"The Firm.\\"","review":"I enjoyed this book. While I don't put it on the same level as Steinbeck, Tolstoy, or Shakespeare, it lived up to my expectations: It was an enjoyable read all around. I enjoyed \\"The Pelican Brief\\" more than \\"The Firm,\\" despite the fact that the latter is probably the more popular of the two. Perhaps that is because I chose to avoid the movie version of \\"Pelican,\\" while I was thoroughly disappointed with the movie version of \\"The Firm.\\" I don't know.

Another great one from Grisham.","review":"Opinion:Good writing. Good suspense. Good characters. He's a talent. Although John Grisham has been writing for 20 years, I just recently discovered him, so he's new to me. I'm a lover of romance novels because I want happy endings.

Grisham Cheats in this one","review":"Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story. We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.John Grisham cheats us out of that fun. The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings? That's bad.Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham Stinks","review":"I've read two-and-a-half John Grisham books.

A law student does some research and looks up some information in the public records and writes a summary of her findings.

I can live with all of the contrivance up to this point in the story; but, once the brief is turned over to the FBI, they have all of the information the law student had and stronger motivation to hang the President, so why kill the student? And why write a whole novel about attempts to kill her?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-Paced Book","review":"Having read most of Grisham's books, I've saved a few of his \\"best\\" for last. While it wasn't a 5 star book like I'd hoped, it certainly was one of his better books with a lot of detail and of course the plot was an interesting one.Having saw the movie years ago, I had a good idea of what the book was about: Two Supreme Court Justices are killed, a law school student, along with many other people become curious and try to figure out \\"who dun it\\"...only, she writes a brief and hits the nail on the head, and when the wrong people find out, she's on the run for her life!I enjoyed the book mostly because it was fast-paced, and had a lot of detail.

I waited and got someone to help me, but the problem wasn't me, it was the way the magnet was designed. If we tightened it to stay on my spoke, the nut just got pushed out and fell on the floor. So we put it on as securely as it would go, I rode once with it and it worked, but the second time I used it, the magnet fell off and got lost. I think there is a problem with the buttons too, they don't always seem to work, although I didn't get a chance to use it enough to be sure if maybe it was just me getting mixed up.

I was able to achieve the 5 mm gap by mounting the magnet about halfway down a spoke, but I'm concerned that it will work its way up the spoke over time. At least the wire was long enough.

I installed it as per the instructions and the cable did not at any point experience any unusual amount of strain. Very shoddy construction.Beyond that, is it so difficult to have two buttons instead of one? It would make using it much more intuitive and would add a trivial amount to the cost of production."},{"rating":"1","title":"bc 506 bike computer terrible to mount","review":"The computer itself is nice but it is just impossible to mount so to respect the 5mm max gap between sensor and magnet with the provided instructions and material.The spring fork on a mountain bike is just to far from the spokes.Waisted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somethin' different for a change ...","review":"If you've already listed to Bing's Xmas album 10,000 times, you will really welcome this album.

This one is no exception. The cassette is worth listening to again and again. Though this release is not as gripping as the Days of Future Past it is still a wonderful album that takes you on a wonderful musical journey into ones imagination.The difference in the Moody Blues albums and say rap or hip hop is that the Moody Blues released music and the others didn't.Today's kids are depriving themselves of a real musical experience. I understand that some of the prior decades had their share of thumping garbage noise, but not nearly as bad as today's garbage thumping.If you really want to listen to some of the best ovatious music rock out there pick a Moody Blues tape or lp. Slide the tape into your car's player, crank up the volume and enjoy the ride. You can't go wrong with this album or any of the Moody Blues releases. They are all pure ear candy just like Question of Balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Was wanting to duplicate my Moody Blues LP collection with digital releases. This new \\"jazzed up\\" digital version is disappointing. Something has changed... the vocals aren't the same as what I heard on my LPs. The sound flat where it once soared."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic - no Question","review":"One day I was looking through some singles in one of the sales I loved going to at our local church. I came across 'Question' and was curious to hear it as it had been #1 in the UK but not played in Australia. I was so impressed I went straight out and bought 'A Question Of Balance', my first Moodies album, knowing for someone to produce such a beautiful song, the album HAD to be great. It turned out to be every bit as good as I expected and is close to my all time fave album. Every track is a joy, with strong melodies and lyrics. The lyrics of the track 'The Balance' are particularily brilliant in the way they reflect on our existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece from the Moody Blues","review":"The Moody Blues/ A Question of Balance (1997 remastered): This is the Moody Blues best album in their series of Great albums. Far from being an expression of harmony, it comes across as the story of someone about to fall apart, which may be the edge it needed to become the Masterpiece it is. The 1997 remaster has the original album and no bonus tracks (which is the way I personally like it). There is a newer release that contains bonus tracks. I think that having bonus tracks on a Moody Blues album does little more than distract from the album itself, but that is just my personal preference. Whichever CD you prefer, you will be getting a Masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"Being in my opinion one of the best (and my personal favorite) albums The Moody Blues has ever put out, I was extremely surprised to find that this CD hasn't gotten one review so far.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible, horrrible!","review":"Was this 5.1 mix, mixed by a stoned 60s hippie? 5.1 means 5.1, not 4.0. There is no center channel or subwoofer action. There are parts of the songs that are either completely missing, or not where they should be. Vocals whispering in my rear speakers? WTF? Thankfully my OPPO BDP95 can select to 2 channel, which isn't a big improvement over the regular cd. Maybe the guy who mixed this album should visit the guy who remixed the old Elton John records into SACD 5.1 I know it says on the cover that it was mixed from the old quad tapes, but it shouldn't tell you 5.1 when it is not. And it carries on to the other Moody blues albums also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reply to bill","review":"Yes Bill this album wasn't planned. The Moodies went into the studio and constructed this album in 5 weeks. If yo had gottewn Time traveler you would know this. but the range of music IS tied together...even though it wasn't planned. Even though Question was the HIT of the album there were a few songs that should have recieved airplay. Songs such as Don't You Feel Small?; Its Up to You; and How is It We are Here?

It took about 15 minutes to get it unstuck. It was almost as if it was glued down. This has to be the worst design for a gas can I've ever seen. It is very difficult to get the lid open wide enough where a gas nozzle would fit. You almost need two hands to hold it open that far. I'm not looking forward to trying to fill the thing. The same problem makes it extremely difficult to place or remove the funnel. When the funnel is on, there is not enough clearance to fill the can. I think it would be dangerous to put the funnel in place when the can is full of gas since you would be likely to spill gas all over yourself. To top it all off, Amazon won't allow the return since it could potentially have had gas in it, even though I haven't put any in the can, and will probably throw it out. What a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did we survive","review":"I don't know how we members of the baby-boom generation survived our youth without child-proof caps, safety belts, etc, But somehow we did it. The safety features of this gas can make it impossible for me to fill it at the gas station or pour the gas into my chainsaw when I get home. I am not weak. I just finished splitting a cord of wood by hand. But it takes all my strength to open the cap just a bit, and my wife finds it impossible. If I can't open the cap to fill or empty the can, the can is by definition, useless. All I want is an old fashioned gas can with a screw cap. But Big Brother can't trust me with a simple screw cap. I grieve for the next generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Price","review":"I received this Eagle Kersone Can this afternoon. The box it came in was open. There was no instruction manual that came with the can on how to use it. Just a regulatory compliance guide. The painted instructions on the can are uselss. I finally figure out through trial & error on how to open the lid. Considering how much I had to pull on the lever to get the lid open. It would not be easy to fill up, unless you wire the lever to the handle. Or put a board under the lid to keep it open till it was full. I have other kersone containers that are easier to fill up & to pour out. I wouldn't recommend this Kersone Can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Galvanized Steel bad for diesel !","review":"I was very pleased with this Eagle Diesel Safety can until I found lots of very credible online sources indicating galvanized steel containers are not appropriate for storing diesel fuel.

There was no damage to the box that I received it in so it is virtually impossible that it was damaged during shipping. See uploaded photos. There is another review of a similar product from the same manufacturer that mentions a very similar dent. Maybe Amazon is selling factory seconds?

The lid does not lift open far enough to permit easy filling at the gas station.5.

Starting from 5 stars, I subtracted one star for the plastic handle which seems destined to fail earlier than a metal handle would. Then I learned that galvanized steel should not be used to store diesel fuel -- my John Deere manuals explicitly state that this will create a zinc sludge that will clog my fuel filters and damage injectors. So, I had to subtract two more stars. Perhaps it does not deserve any stars since it completely fails to do the thing that I bought it for (i.e. store diesel fuel) but it is a really nice can.

I saw this can and I read the other reviews . They make it for gas as well as for diesel. It's a lot more than you would pay for a typical gas can but worth it. It's well made and it doesn't spill when transported. When you pour the diesel(or gas), the cleverly designed funnel attaches to the can like collar so fuel can't leak. Make sure you push the collar all the way down on the neck. On my first attempt I didn't have the collar seated snuggly and some fuel leaked out. The spring-loaded top allows you stop the flow instantly if necessary. I wish the funnel had a bit more bend to it so all the contents could flow out easier when you get to the bottom. I'm thinking about buying the gas version as well.

The opening at the other end is about 4\\" and then tapers to about 3 7/8\\" to ensure a snug fit. The problem is that most of the taper occurs in the first 1/4\\". This is not enough to secure the hose without tape, etc, which defeats the purpose of a Quick Connect/Disconnect.

A loving parent loves a child unconditionally, automatically.On page 12 he writes of \\"the message of unconditional love ...\\". But unconditional love is not a message - it is a feeling. And if you can't feel it, you are emotionally crippled, and completely unqualified to offer advice to anyone about anything.The only way to deal successfully with anger is to deal with the feelings behind it.

I rented the game originally and loved it. Then I made sure I got a copy for Christmas.I play video games only occasionally, but have to be careful with this one. The missions are varied and keep the play interesting. It runs the gamut from special-ops sneaking-around missions to sniper play, to full-out crazy firefights. They have done a pretty good job with building in the tendency of cover to degrade (if you hide behind a wooden wall, the enemy can shoot through it), though that doesn't always seem to work.I have played one of the other CoD games, so I can't compare it to the others in the series. However, for those of you who are casual gamers and enjoy shooters, this is one that you can play over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CoD game yet!","review":"I got this game for Christmas, and ended up beating the single player campaign on the normal difficulty setting the same day. Short? Absolutely, but crank it up to the \\"Veteran\\" difficulty and it should last you awhile (heck, I haven't even beat CoD 2 yet on Veteran). I can't really comment on the online portion of this game as I am currently switching ISPs and am waiting for the installation guys to come over (curse you, Verizon, and your lack of installers), but from what I can tell that is where the game really shines. I highly recommend this game for fans of previous CoD titles and Battlefield 2 players alike. After the last Call of Duty I was beginning to worry about the series, but with Infinity Ward back at the helm the game has returned to greatness.Welcome back, Infinity Ward. You were sorely missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game and graphics!!!","review":"I got this game on Christmas and sat down to play it right away. The graphics, sound, and storyline are great, and i used my 7.1 surround sound on my 1080P tv and it blew me away! Theres only 2 drawbacks. Number 1 as everyone else stated is that its short. And number 2 is that i find that when you aim the gun the controller is too sensitive and it seems harder than it should to aim correctly in a short time.

My cousin had Call of Duty 2 and 4 looks so much better. The fourth installment of the series is not set on World War II, it actually moves to the present day, which means new weapons. To me is the best call of Duty game compare to the second one. Call of Duty 4 is a great game, the graphics and visiual presentation are gorgeous, and the great sound adds to the intensity of the gameplay. The multiplayer is is fun to play.One thing i didn't like was the single player campaign is short.

I like the fast pace, almost no time to think reaction of the story modes. Also the online gameplay is classic. However, online gameplay adds a bit more advantage and disadvantage from some ppl who do not equip themselves correctly.Online, some people may have more health than you, or stronger. Sometimes head shots do not work either. That may be due to them equipping themselves with more life or a glitch.All around great story mode and online gaming...I only play this game and Burnout Paradise these days!@!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Call of Duty 4","review":"After pondering the thought of buying an Xbox 360 just for CoD 4, I went out and got one (with CoD 4 of course)and I must say it is amazing. I'm normally not a graphics kinda guy but CoD 4's graphics are astounding. Everything from the junk on a desk to the explosions from an RPG. The game controls with ease. The smooth movements makes scoring headshots a breeze. I am pretty much impressed with every single aspect of this game. I have yet to dive into multiplayer just yet but I can only imagine it being better. Infinity Ward did a great job of putting CoD back on top of the FPS list. Kudos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Single Player, OK Multiplayer","review":"This is one of the best single player games out right now and a must play for any FPS fan.

I'm spoiled like that.Cons: I wish it was co-op. I heard COD5, might have co-op. I hope so, more hours on the 360 and less time with the girlfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest FPS I've Played In a LONG Time","review":"Ok, so Halo 3 was incredible (so exclude that from my review)... That aside, Call of Duty 4 has without a doubt the best graphics, gameplay, sound, voice acting and emotional storytelling I've ever seen in an FPS. Much of the action will have you completely glued to your seat, (especially the stealth levels in the nuked city.) This game has incredible controls as well, making the experience feel completely natural.If you love a good FPS or action game, buy COD4 and be blown completely away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Graphics - Terrible Freezing Problems","review":"I am stuck on the second level of this game (Marine Sgt Paul Jackson) where the game freezes 100% of the time within one area of the game. I have restarted the game for days and dozens of times and the game freezes at about the same physical point in the game all the time. I can approach the block from the left, center, or flanking right and it freezes an approximately the same boundary point.Google \\"COD4 freezing\\" or anything similar and you'll find reports of thousands of users who are experiencing hardware issue caused by the games use of resources or software freezing issues such as I encounter.I asked my teenage son about it and he reported he and his friends gave up on the game over the Christmas break - they all couldn't successfully regularly run the game.No similar problems with COD2 or COD3 so its definitely this release.

As soon as I started playing it I knew he had recommended correctly. This game, along with its sequel, are two of the most fun FPS games I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. It's a little short but the campaign is fun and unique, definitely worth checking out. I hear most people play it for the multiplayer but I've never had an interest in that so I can't comment.

Without adding a big spoiler, I will warn you that you play characters who die despite your best efforts. You'll also be transported through time without warning.I was done in about five hours.The graphics looked great on my new HD Samsung TV. Multi-player mode is fun and I expect hours of enjoyment once my scratched disc has been replaced for a fee of $20.

Although it is short, it is exciting and has some cool cut scenes (FP execution anyone?).The multiplayer is highly overrated. There are so many glitches and bad spawns that after a while it just gets frustrating. Spawned in the middle of airstrikes, grenades, and even in the middle of enemy territory really blunt any tactical feel this game ever had. Also the helicopters have god powers.The guns are unbalanced. On consoles, use the M16: it's a one shot kill. On PC, use the P90. Plus frag x3, juggernaut, grenade launchers, and martyrdom make the online experience a really really annoying one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get old while waiting for shipping...","review":"Easy to buy, very slow to arrive.

But it came, it was in good shape, and it has been enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"In fairness, I haven't tried multiplayer yet. Mainly because the single player was so disappointing. It's hard to tell what's going on in places. At some points you take the view of a different character, which may seem cinematic but turns out to be a cheesy gimmick. In one mission, your name might be \\"Smith\\" then in the next mission they're yelling at \\"Martinez\\" for 20 minutes before you realize it's you and you need to be doing something you're not. The visuals are nice, and the actual combat system seems decent, which leads me to believe the multiplayer function may be where it's at. Sadly, the single player campaigns were just so frustrating I didn't want to keep playing.Do yourself a favor, get Halo 3 if you don't have it, or wait on Battlefield: Bad Company. I thought since this was on sale for 35 bucks it would be worth it.

SW's lyrics are a bore, and the noisy production makes it near impossible to distinguish Slash's playing from that of Dave Kushner's. Two guys trying to play leads over each other is silliness. Amazon's review is a joke, how much did the record co. have to pay the critics to give this stuff a good review? And, really, this album lacks even half the energy of \\"Contraband,\\" VR's debut. This is all coming from a guy who saw VR live in '05 and loved it, and I also loved the debut, but really, save your money and your time and stay away... what a huge disappointment this was. \\"Libertad\\" is throw away bunk... you'll be taking it to the used cd store to trade it in unless you're a completist of the GNR & STP catalogues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Libertad!","review":"This album is great. It's a pretty much straightforward rock album. Slash does have some pretty good solos in there. This band has the potential to make great albums for years to come as long as they can hold it together. Comparing it with Contraband (their 1st album) is hard for me. Their first album seems more angry and in your face. While Contraband is more aggressive in my opinion, Libertad does have it's share of rockers. As a whole this album has a more clean and polished feel. While I prefer Contraband over Libertad, it is still a very good buy. It's definitely different in a good way and I'm not disappointed. I'm giving it 5 stars because compared to whats out there on radio and MTV Velvet Revolver is on top. So far this year it's the best CD I bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good many songs @ Libertad","review":"About three yeard from Former album, they work active and hard, I think.This albums \\"LIBERTAD\\" is better than 1st album totally.Especially, Vocalist, scott, is growing up as a band. At many songs,his voices match tunes and lyrics than 1st. 1st was simpler than 2nd.And, Slash, Duff, Matt like Fomer GNR member is more tight as a band like scott.

I gave it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth purchasing","review":"A couple thoughts on this album upon first and second play throughs:- A very generic sounding album-I wanted to check the calander to see if this was 1988 or 2008- This sure doesn't sound anything like STP, GNR or Alice in Chains or any other hard rock band- The songs trudge along like I do on a full day at the office -- This should be a favorite among the mulletheads in the crowd.- Thankfully my local library had this cd to check out, it saved me some cash. I'm returning it now because it sucks.- I can see why it dropped quickly off the charts- most people probably used iTunes to download 1 or 2 tracks and called it good at that.Some of the 5 star reviewers said you could here the excitement and fun in Weiland's voice. Guess I must be listening to an entirely different album.-btw I'm not some Linkin' Park lovin' poser. My favorite bands include Metallica, AC/DC, GnR (of course) early 7marythree and others. Although I enjoy a wide range of music as everyone should."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good, if Not Better, Than Album #1","review":"Surprise, surprise--Velvet Revolver survive the sophomore slump and put out a decent record. While there aren't any stand-out singles upon the first couple of listens, there's plenty of melody and sweet guitar work to go around. If I had to compare it to anything, it sounds a little like latter-day Stone Temple Pilots (Shangri-La-Dee-Da-era) with better guitar solos. The only real downside is that the two best songs aren't even on the standard release--\\"Messages\\" is available only on iTunes, while \\"Psycho Killer\\" appears as a track on theMelody and the Tyranny EP.Guns'n'Roses fans probably aren't going to be too thrilled, however, so approach with caution--if you didn't like the first one, this album's not going to change your mind about Velvet Revolver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"What can I say?

The whole band is great, but Slash is just exceptional: so smooth, so precise, so effortless and experienced. Just superb. Hint: go see them live too, they're absolutely great."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars - Band Finds its own sound. BUY this album","review":"Libertad is a major step for VR. They sound like a band that has come into their own. The album has a consistent sound that is neither GNR nor STP. It's a slick, dance / pop / rock sound with amazing rhythm and killer guitar solos overlayed with the unique vocals of Scott Wieland.I thought Contraband was kind of a hodge-podge with some great singles. This is a great ALBUM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like the last album - All noise and no melody.","review":"This album sounds exactly like the last album and the last album wasn't very good.Weiland had said that this one was going to be very melodic and more of a concept album and I fail to see any concept too tie the songs together and it is deffinently not melodic.You can barely hear Scott's voice through many of the songs and Slash's solos seem to be misplaced and out of sync with the rest of the music. The drumming keeps it at the same tempo as the last album which is almost always a fast tempo.I think it's time for Stone Temple Pilots to reform.

Nothing really stood out from the get go. I really liked the guitar lick in tune number two, but other than that it seems to be lacking something. However after about the 4th or 5th spin, I really started to get into it and now am pretty pleased with what on here. Yeah it's nothing ground breaking or earth shattering, but it's good straight ahead hard rock which is something I do enjoy a lot.If you liked the first one?, you'll probably grow to like this one as well as it's pretty much a carbon copy of the first outing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what Rock n Roll is about","review":"On their second album, Velvet Revolver bring rock back to where it belongs, crunchy rhytym guitars, pirecing leads, with a hard driving beats and Weiland sounding better than ever. Perfect mix of power, talent, and attitude. It blows the first one away, hands down.It's as if what ever fell short, or \\"didn't work\\" the first time out, works now. The songs are stronger, and the band is playing better. Whatever their appoach was, it worked. No gimmics, no bull. These guys do what you want them to do on this record, they rock!My personal favs right off the bat, \\"Let it Roll\\", \\"She builds quick machines\\", \\"For a brother\\", \\"Spay\\".I agree it's probably the best record this year, so far. It a pleasure to hear a record by a real \\"band\\". They blend together wonderfully, each song allows each member to shine in their own right. But, as it should be, the song comes first.If you are a fan , buy it now, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, just...boring.","review":"VR's first album wasn't bad, but it was clear the band had more potential. Unfortunately, that potential may never be realized. Libertad isn't a step backwards, or forwards. In fact, it doesn't really take you anywhere the last album didn't. It's just as bland and riskless as Contraband was, perhaps moreso.I really wanted to like this album. I'd heard it was better than Contraband, but after listening, I just couldn't lie to myself. All the songs sound the same, and all of them are forgettable. It's not that VR is a bad band--everyone in the band is a great musician, but as a whole they don't quite equal the sum of their parts. Just another bland, cookie-cutter rock album from a group that should be capable of delivering much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want GNR or STP ? ?","review":"If you want GNR, buy the 1st CD and Use Your Illusions I+II. If you want STP, buy their 1st 3 CD's. If you want the last song on Libertad, buy the new Travelling Wilburys. But, above all, buy the 1st Velvet Revolver and don't waste your time with this.By the way VR's CD's can't touch any of the above. You know how 2nd CD's go.......D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you might be looking for","review":"Although a good rock album overall, Libertad was not what I was looking for at all. I expected something harder than the first album, and didn't get it. It's not a bad album, but it definitely took a few listens to convince me not to return it. I guess I'm too caught up looking for some hard hitting music, and thought this band might provide it. It's definitely more watered down than I thought. I'm sure some will like it, but I think most won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Terrible, Awful","review":"This is a terrible cd. I wanted to like it. After all, I am a fan of both bands. However, there is no spark. The music is generic, the lyrics are boring. The songs have no hook, no great Slash riffs. There is absolutely not a single redeeming moment on this disc. This is possibly worse than the first Velvet Revolver cd. I don't have enough bad things to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whut Were They thinking??","review":"This is more bland, soulless, corporte rock we are plagued with on a daily basis.

I've seen sheap cookwear at multiple stores such as Target, Riteaid and Big lots that retails for $30 that is superior to this.Best I can come up with is the fact that the extra profit they made allows them to ship in an expedited fashion, but the end result is that this product is woth about $25.I would not recoomend it to anyone serious about cooking, and even for those that just need cheap cookwear, I'd suggest you save your money because this cset is not worth anymore than $30 out the door with shipping, tax and all that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Treasure","review":"The last treasure is about a thirteen year old boy named Ellswork Smith.

I chose two areas that I wanted to see hair inhibited, my private area, and my upper back.

I've cut the hair back repeatedly during those weeks to keep it short, but it continues to grow back thick and full.If you like spraying a fruity smelling water solution on yourself, then go for it.

Better than the second black mages album in my opinion, but there are a few tracks I was disappointed with. I really enjoyed hearing the tracks from the older games in the series (1, 2, 6,) since those were the games that originally got me hooked on final fantasy. Dancing mad was awesome, as was the other battle themes from six. Those three tracks alone make this album worthy of my collection. The only two tracks I was somewhat disappointed with were tracks seven (JENOVA) and ten (Fight With Seymour). I think they should have dropped those two tracks and picked some tracks from final fantasy 4 instead.

The beats and the rhymes go together like D&D (Royce Da 5'9 reference). I won't spend a lot of time on this review. I'll just suggest for everyone to cop this CD.

Little Brother are the little brothers of real hip hop (I hate that term lemm go back), of ol' skool hip hop groups like Tribe, Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth and Leaders of The New. Matter of fact, this album sits alongside of them as future classics and lessons of how to do hip hop and be proud after the mastering of the disc. The production is handled by member 9th Wonder and the M.C.'s are damn near perfect group member M.C.'s (you know not too boastful, not too underground).

The production builds on Pete's early work, and even steps it up a notch in some areas.With respect to Tribe, I was listening to them in college [NC A&T;], back in 90, when the first disc dropped. Always been a fan, but honestly, Little Brother's production is a whole lot better than Ali's...Sorry!!Pick this one up!! Also, find the Nas' Stepson.

I thought all of the other CDs he sent me was garbage except this one. I found myself bopping my head to the songs immediately...I still listen to the CD a whole lot. It is my favorite CD to listen to while riding to and from work.This is a very fun CD to listen to and it has some nice, smooth rap flows, and just nice music/beats behind the rap. It sounds like some guys just in the studio having fun and some of the rhymes almost have a freestyle flow to them which goes well with the overall feel of the album. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Listening","review":"With the way Hip Hop has fallen into a materialistic, crime-promoting rut, it's hard to not feel nostalgic for the thoughtful lyricism of years past. Little Brother's 2003 debut \\"The Listening\\" justifies this old school superiority by retaining the lyrical style of years past, while staying relevant with fresh production and song concepts. Part of what makes this album so appealing is the way they take a new approach to the old lyrical style. Instead of falling to the common limitations of older Hip-Hop (namely the gangster persona) it keeps what was good about that time (rhymes, delivery) and matches it with their sincere lyricism. The album's production takes a similar approach. Instead of mimicking the famous producers of the old, they merely revisit them, and mix the sound with distinct drum patterns and choppy sampling techniques to create something familiar yet refreshing.4 Stars - So long as you can appreciate laid-back Dilla-esque production, you'll love \\"The Listening.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"For the love of pure beats.","review":"Stumbled on this album whilest doing my routine hip hop 'sample listening' here on amazon.When I heard the first song,I adjusted my seat,the beats grabbed me!

Actually I can't describe how awesome this album is in words.

Before purchasing the album, I glanced a few of the other reviews for The Listening. With the reviews people gave, I racked my brain as to why I hadn't heard of Little Brother before. After listening to the album, the explanation quickly formalized as to why these guys were so unknown. Sure, Little Brother sounds remarkable if you're taking a break from listening to the average materialistic Rap artist stuck in the gutter of materialism, but compared to the current Hip-Hop talent out there, these guys can't even compare. Even their title song, routinely the most impressive of an album, The Listening was average at best, and only conveyed the message that every other artist tries to convey throughout their albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD!","review":"There is a lot of hype on this album, I ve heard so many people say that this can be one of the best underground hip hop albums of the year....are you kidding me?

It should only be purchased by completists, as it is the weakest of the bunch. But even as the weakest it rates more than one star, because the series is so excellent. Indeed, at its peak (years 2, 3, and 4), Black Adder is about as funny as TV gets. Alas, this one just doesn't cut it. Atkinson is not at his best, and the usually delightful Baldrick is WAY off his usual form (he actually looks and sounds ill).

Granted, you have to be familiar with the series to get any of! I think Tony Robinson comes off quite well as Baldrick in this one and he's the main reason I watch it!My only regret is that the film was obviously shot in widescreen (or at least Super35), based on the deleted scenes contained in the documentary.

This...celeb cameo-athon was put together for the Millennium Dome - and boy does it show. There is no heart, no passion and most of all, no comedy in this extremely short film. How it can even be released as a stand-alone DVD is beyond me. Suffice to say, I have lost a little more respect for the previous shows through watching this. It retired young and really should have stayed in the shadows, Greta Garbo-style."},{"rating":"1","title":"surprisingly terrible","review":"I have been a major fan of Black Adder for a long, long time. I was overjoyed to hear that there was a new episode. How utterly disappointing it is. It is pleasantly nostalgic, nice to see them all back together again, but it is thoroughly unfunny. It had the characters, but lacked the wit, cleverness, and j'n'sais pas. In my experience, British comedies tend to be either very very good or very very bad. Black Adder was always firmly ensconced on the good side. This reunion episode is entirely on the bad side of the line.Still, it is nice to see them all back together again, so for a real fan of Black Adder, it is probably worth buying. Just don't expect to be laughing very hard while you watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was hilarious.","review":"Don't believe the bad reviews. It's classic Blackadder all the way. He's as slimy, avaricous, clever, suave as ever and Baldrick is funnier than ever. The \\"behind the scenes\\" bit at the end shows scenes that had to be cut which are funnier than what was left in. Wonderful ending. Hilarious new words to the theme song. A great gift from the makers of Blackadder to us fans who were always saddened that the series ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 55 minutes - including special features!","review":"I should have looked more carefully at the reviews. $15.99 for what is essentially one episode of a 1/2 hour TV show is monstrous.

It was like watching an aging rock band reunion when all the members had forgotten how to play. I've been a Black Adder fan since first seeing the show in the early nineties, and I'd hoped for some of the old Adder magic. After all, Corporal Punishment, from the Black Adder IV series, was one of the funniest half-hours ever produced for television.Sadly, this waste of tape had very little of that, instead mostly relying on puerile toilet humor and superficial unfunny one-liners.If they get the urge to do another reunion, I hope they have a lie down until the urge passes."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I'm sorry to force my opinion on you but you must stay clear of this.

Ok, perhaps the first one is a flawed masterpiece. Nevertheless, it really was a moment of madness on the part of the writers and is as painful as seeing Mohammed Ali struggle to walk when he was once an irresistable fighter and statesman. So go buy the DVD Boxset instead of this lethargic, uninspired, hackneyed waste of time - I guarantee you'll have no regrets in doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly for Ardent fans","review":"I am the biggest fan of the blackadder there is (including three email addresses entitled blackadder), but this video is for the fan who waxes nostalgic.

Back and Forth starts out slow, and never picks up the pace. There were several (two I think) places where I actually laughed. Other than that I found the show pretty lame...Black Adder punched Shakespeare to punish him for his having to read his plays...Queen Elizabeth likes the taste of breath mints...I'm sorry but that's a pretty poor excuse for comedy.Don't waste your money on this yawner!

I was pleasantly surprised to see how heavy the machine was built, its beefy stature screamed, throw anything at me I can plane it, and after some adjusting it did. I ran pine and white oak threw it, and it produced a wonderful finish on both. The one problem I have had is trying to plane exceptionally wide boards. For some reason if I plane a board 10\\" wide or better it machine has some trouble feeding the board threw. I found that with some adjustment of the spring tension on the urethane infeed and outfeed rollers this can be reduced but not completely eliminated. Other than this the machine runs great. It is easy and safe to operate, and fun to use. This planer is another fine example of Powermatic's expertise in building heavy-duty home shop machinery."},{"rating":"2","title":"First try at reviewing","review":"This is a good code red book.

The headphones are decently comfortable, although, again because of the circumaural design, use for over 2-3 hours leads to sweaty ears (didn't think ears sweat, did you!). The sound isolation is subpar and little compared to really good full size headphones like...say the sennheiser hd280 pro or bose triport. However, since effective sound isolation is a difficult task to pull off, better isolation usually translates to a big price jump, unless it uses noise cancellation, which is just an annoyance (I've owned 2 already).

Unfortunately the plastic used in them is very cheap... I have a feeling if they were accidentally dropped or had any type of pressure put on them they would break. The good news... they only cost about $8 so if you can be nice to them they will serve their purpose well for the money spent. Also, I really like the dual volume control... I have a bit of hearing loss in one ear and sometimes headphones sound weird because the sound is uneven... the dual sound allows me to adjust to get a more even sound.

It looks like they used a 20 gauge. It could be some kind of stunt, but nobody told the rats. Certainly these rats react violently to the projectiles that hit them, and they don't seem to like it. They are knocked end over end by bloody impact. Meat flies off the wounds, even. They seem hurt, and they squirm pretty convincingly. Perhaps they are good rat actors.There is lots of bad process photography, and the puppet rat heads are unimpressive. But the real rats are filmed against miniature sets in medium and long shots. Such wholesale slaughter seems unlikely as late as '76, but I doubt the FOTG set even saw a caterer, much less OSHA and the Humane Society. I don't know anything about this production, but I've shot a few rats, and this is what it looks like."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY GOD-AWFUL GREAT!!!!","review":"This is a movie that requires total and complete suspension of disbelief! And it's not just because of the god-awful special effects, either! The acting is completely off kilter with the story line of giant mutated creatures. Marjoe Gortner is quite possibly one of my all time favorite baaad actor of the 70's and his casual shoulder-shrugging, oh-well approach to the mutations is absolutely hysterical! No one else in the film seems to be too bothered by the giants so I guess why should he?! I loved this movie when it was first released but I was also 9 years old! If you have 90 minutes or so of your life to waste one evening, pop this sucker in the DVD player, grab some Jiffy Pop, sit back and relax.

This film features these mutants.I worked on this film in 1975, in British Columbia, Canada. It was mostly filmed on Bowen Island, not far from Vancouver. As hokey as the film seemed, it was fun to work on.However it was a shame to see a star the likes of Ida Lupino with all her talents working on this film.

You know a giant snake would have given me the creeps, but the rats just look bored - even giant rats.This is pure drive-in cinema that should have been on a double bill with a Herschal Gordon gorefest flick (but I'd never have been able to get into it then).Poor Ida Lupino - what in the world was she thinking?!

You find some weird gloop coming out of the ground and after realizing that it's not oil, your first instinct it to 'feed it' to your chickens?! And don't get me started on the 'transparent' flying wasps.But the most important thing that I really wish someone told me about is the actual, REAL LIFE ANIMAL ABUSE that is show in this movie. Rats are killed, maimed, drowned - you name it. Not fake rats but real ones. I don't know how it was allowed, seriously.

I was wrong and what it was I didn't like initially was the violence the music expressed. But, let's face it, the movie, even the title is about violence.On the other hand, the jazz pieces while beautiful, were for me too reminiscent of Woody Allen movies, which was another obstacle to reconcile.The best soundtrack piece is \\"Dirty Money,\\" cellos and trumpets, very grand and upbeat; the next best, \\"The Road to Chicago,\\" violins and piano, you can almost see a city on the horizon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect score since The Shawshank Redemption!","review":"I enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption a lot, then I bought this score.

Oh well, maybe taht will teach me not to buy pre-pub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I love Yvonne Porcella's work. It has a distinctive look, filled with simple shapes and bright primary colors. Sadly, most of that is missing in this book. I can just hear the publisher telling her to use varied palettes to appeal to more people. Who knows? Maybe she will. But somehow I can't see the repro and plaid crowd wanting to make her freeform quilts. If they want to, there are instructions for how to assemble a conglomeration of 4-patch and 9-patch units with spacer strips. In trying to please everyone, the book ended up being neither traditional nor contemporary and all the magic is missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give a girl a break","review":"Great creativity is sometimes born of impatience, and this seems to be the case with Yvonne Porcella, who says she never has made a large quilt using a repeated block because \\"I do not like the precision required to measure and calculate fabrics to make a large quilt.\\" Instead, she thinks up magical numbering schemes, fiddles with brightly colored strips of fabric, and makes eye-popping quilts out of simple elements. In this book she shares her clever techniques in great detail and with lots of examples. Some reviewers have carped that Porcella departs from her usual bright primary palette in this volume, but it is nowhere written that an artist can't experiment with other styles and appeal from time to time to other color sensibilities. The primary purpose of the book is to teach a highly formalized technique, and the variety of color choices shows that it works as well for country plaids as for high contrast."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspirational","review":"Sadly,this book lacks variety in the patterns.

Perhaps the author has an artistic vision which works for her, but these photos of her quilts look very amateurish. The directions are poor. She states she started this method because she had trouble getting her blocks/seams to match. Her solution is to take a row of blocks, add random strips of fabric, then square it up after it is finished. One does not need to spend money on a book to learn how to do this.

Khidhir Hamza, an Iraqi scientist, was happily teaching college in America, when he was ordered back home. Despite having almost nothing in the way of workable plans, Saddam, determined to develop nuclear weapons, charged Hamza and others with this task. Despite many obstacles, not the least of which was Saddam's mercurial leadership, the goal was reached. But many of Hamza's colleagues were jailed or put to death, causing the author to finally take the bravest step of all - getting himself and his family safely out of Iraq.

Iraq has nothing close to this. Yes, Iraq can build a dirty bomb, or crude air dispersed chemical weapon, but the big boys (UN Group of 5) have the real tools.

Unfortunately, like so many things in this world, if you have the money you can usually buy what you are after. Luckily in this case, Saddam ran out of time. The one bright spot was the large amount of time and money that was wasted on projects that did not succeed.

Reduced to a non-entity in the accelerated nuclear weapons program between 1987 and the start of the 1991 war, he retired from the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission in 1989 and became a college lecturer, a stock market swindler and a shady business middle-man.\\"Therefore, he would have had no direct knowledge of Iraq's nuclear program after 1989.

When racing with my son, we love the Brooklyn Bridge races, and it is too cool feeling the expansion joints of the bridge through the wheel as you are tearing across at 200 MPG. Setup is easy, as long as you have an open A/C outlet near by. Two issues though. First, you need some type of lap desk to clamp it to. I put together a quick one using some scrap 1X4 lumber and that works OK. Second, the foot controls slide around carpeted flooring. You constantly have to move them back into place.

Which is by far the best force feedback function I've experienced in a wheel besides the real thing. My only real problem with this product is the rear shifters on the wheel, which unlike the real thing the buttons move with the wheel(which have a slight delay in one that started a while ago),but the front buttons still work fine. Pedals are good, but have very little natural resistence and for me slightly too close together.

It just displayed \\"Disc Access\\" for several minutes before shutting itself off. When he was finally able to get it to come back up, everything on it (our sons' track finals and talent show) was gone.

It will format and start to use the disks, only to show a disk error sometime during the recording. I have be unable to recover ANY data from the disks after an error occurs.I live in Houston, TX and the closest repair facility is about an 1.5 hour round trip. And because only parts are covered by the cheep-o warranty, it would cost me $75 in labor just to have an estimate done (applied to the cost of fixing it if I go forward). So now I have to decide: Is it worth driving 3 hours (drop off and pick up) and spending at least $75 to fix a camara that broke after just 4 months? Am I willing to trust it to film my daughters 2nd birthday?

It is a porblem with the DVD itself and they do not stand behind the DVD's (because they are from a different manufacturer). My only option is to contact a data recovery service to get back my hours of lost video. Looks like that will cost me about $200-400 for two discs.I understand that they do not make the DVD's, but their cameras use them. If I can record my videos on to them, I should be able to see those videos again. The only way to use their DVDCams are to record onto DVD's!

Bought it as a kit with a super flashlight and two batteries. I was looking at this site because my handyman said he was thinking of getting a PC because he liked mine so much. I was surprised to see just a 3 star overall rating and a couple of negative reviews. No doubt those people got lemons. Mine gets used at least several times a month, has taken through many remodeling projects, and has performed flawlessly. I've used it to drill holes in all kinds of wood, drive screws in pressure treated 1 x 10 pressure treated lumber to build a 400 sq foot deck, many hundreds of dry wall screws, etc, etc. It charges quickly (about an hour?)and runs for a long time. Get the flashlight too - it's great. I thought I had made a somewhat frivolous purchase when I got the light but there have been dozens of times when I was very glad I did. Both have performed flawlessly and I'm 100% satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service","review":"They do not service their own items and the companies that do are few and far between.

One of the batteries that came with the package began to fail after a year. The motor failed at the 2 year mark. The motor replacement cost was $80.00, almost as much as I paid for the drill. After 2 years for light use, I used the drill for around the house projects, I had an unusable product. Needless to say I wouldn't buy another Porter Cable drill and I wouldn't recommend this drill to anyone. I expected this drill to last longer than 2 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime","review":"Almost two years after this CD was released, I still listen to it at least every other week. I can't praise it highly enough. Brian Wilson rules!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Disappointment of Brian's Career","review":"Hoo, boy... We all waited for this one, and despite what the fanatics say, it's the most disappointing release of Brian's career with far too few moments of the \\"genius\\" we've come to expect. I mean, we, his fans, have always held Brian up as one of the great (albeit misunderstood and under-appreciated) pop artists of the century, which he certainly is... but you'll never prove it by this awful album. Contains exactly one worthy track, \\"Lay Down Burden\\", and the single most embarrassing cut he's ever done, \\"South American\\". Still, the worst of Brian is worth hearing once, and this album is a lot better than that Andy Paley horror that's making the bootleg rounds. But for REAL Brian, catch him on his concert tour... He's terrific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure trove of sound and harmony","review":"Although the songs aren't really that special, the way they are played and sung by Wilson and the others is amazing. Harmonies and instrumentation haven't been this well-used since vintage Beach Boys days. While Pet Sounds is obviously better, Imagination represents a return to form for this troubled genius. Well done, Brian! Welcome back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What more could we ask for?","review":"Imagination could be Brian Wilson's best chance to regain a foothold into music's mass market. While singing lead and all background vocals(except for a cool tune with Jimmy Buffet) Brian takes us on a journey through his musical world. Highlights from this album include: \\"Lay Down Burden\\"- a tribute to Carl. \\"Keep an Eye on Summer\\"-will take you back to summer love in the 60's. \\"Cry\\"- a haunting tune. Brian Wilson is a beach boy that has grown and matured and lets hope there are many albums to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Cd-I love it!!!","review":"I love this CD!!!! I bought it only a few days ago and I might have played it a hundred times since then!!! Does this say something???!!! I just love the whole thing, but the title song is probably my fave song on the album, you just can't go past the wonderful sounds and harmonies...AWESOME!!!! Apart from that, all the tracks are good, some (most) are absolutely awesome..let me see, looking at the CD cover...well, the whole thing is terrific!!!! Faves...\\"Your Imagination\\", \\"She Says that she Needs Me\\", \\"South American\\", Lay Down Burden\\", \\"Where has Love Been\\", and \\"Sunshine\\"..but its all good. Great Cd Brian, sorry I took so long to \\"turn onto it\\"!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Brian is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like the 60's","review":"Everyone says they love Brian but, as with most artists of his generation, he's expected to live in a time-warp and stick to the old songs. This album sounds like one of the best Beach Boys albums ever. Brian's current singing live is one thing, but these studio recordings take 20 years off his voice. This sounds like an album of singing and songwriting that a healthy Brian could have produced in the late 70's. 'Your Imagination' is a wonderful song full of personal reflection. And 'Dream Angel' sounds like the young Beach Boys with a hint of Phil Spector. This is a thoroughly enjoyable album and a big improvement over his first solo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagination","review":"I am admittedly one of Brian's biggest fans; after listening for almost forty years, he's clearly my favorite artist. Brian's greatest talent is not his composition, arrangement or production (at each of which no one is better). What really speaks to me is his passion and feeling. As a new father myself, listening to Brian's DREAM ANGEL from this album is a cathartic, emotional experience which only the highest art can instill. Each other song also shares a real piece of Brian's soul, and connects with the listener's soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparkles","review":"Considering all he has been through in life, it's very good to hear Brian Wilson so healthy and focused - he can still write, sing great emotional harmonies, and produce very well. The first half of the album is quite as good as ever, and \\"Lay Down Burden\\" and a solo version of \\"Let Him Run Wild\\" are also quite moving, each in their own way. There are a few weaker spots of songwriting in the second half, as if Wilson couldn't quite sustain the original energy, but there is enough original energy in the album overall to make it a must have for Wilson fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRIAN'S BACK!!!!!","review":"His music congers up the warm memories of summers-at-the-shore. Of surfer girls and fast cars. Of the warmth of the sun and California girls. Then, things went higher. Pet sounds and good vibrations to over for sun and surf.But, through break-downs, break-ups, and brothers lost, Brian Wilson continues to relate just what the music is that's playing in his head.If this is YOUR IMAGINATION, then Brian, keep it up!Use YOUR imagination listeners - Listen to YOUR IMAGINATION!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just About Perfect","review":"I don't get the negative reviews. I am a long time Beatles fan, and a relatively recent Beach Boys/Brian Wilson convert, so maybe I don't have the extra baggage or expectations of the longtimers. This album hooked me from the get-go. Songwriting, musicianship, production, singing are outstanding. This is a quantum leap above some of the dippy Beach Boys stuff that the die-hard fans seem to love and adore. I'll take Imagination's polished production, crafted harmonies, and fully realized songwriting any day. Only exceeded in breadth of concept, sophistication and execution by Wilson's Smile. Paul McCartney could learn a thing or two from this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Wilson one of the gratest","review":"I have this cd in my personal collection and listen to it almost every day. Brian is not only one of the Beach Boys but one of the best song writers of the times. The 5.1 DTS is so amazing, so clear,and the mix so perfect I would recomond this cd to anyone who likes Brian Wilson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Wilson's Back in top form!","review":"Brian's production of this album strongly reminds me of the \\"Beach Boy Today\\" and \\"Summer Days...\\" era; which happened to produce incredible song like \\"Please Let me Wonder\\" and \\"She knows me too well\\". This is an *incredible* album with GREAT harmonies, all performed by the genius of Pop music, Brian Wilson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back from Hell","review":"Brian Wilson still has it! His enthusiam bubbles over on tunes like South America (I'm hungry and I'm doin' lunch with Cameron Diaz), and the bridge in She Says That She Loves Me sends chills up my spine (listen as the layers of harmony behind \\"Baby if you don't stop cryin'\\" take turns ascending.) My only knock on the disc is that it sounds a bit overproduced - I'd rather hear analog instruments than all those digital synthesizers.Welcome back from hell, Brian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"Many reviewers compare this new album to Pet Sounds. It doesn't. Still, what is amazing is not that it IS NOT Pet Sounds, but that it is good at all. Which it is. Don't pay any attention to the hype. Just listen to the album. It stands tall on its own. I give Wilson a lot of credit for pulling this off. Great melodic hooks. Carefully crafted pop songs. His strengths shine through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks, Brian","review":"By comparison with other new music, this is a breath of fresh air! Brian Wilson returns to top form vocally and in spirit. Though some have complained that the production is not \\"pure Brian\\" this is a landmark achievement. Brian doesn't \\"come out to play\\" very often, but when he does we can all have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"God bless Brian Wilson","review":"Imagination is a wonderful album. I agree, it's not Pet Sounds, but so what? As much as I love 1988's Brian Wilson, this is a much more cohesive collection of tunes. Imagination deserves a broad audience. For anyone who loves Brian or the Beach Boys, or just wants to thrill to some sublime music, this album is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will NOT give Brian a break!","review":"I love a lot of Brian Wilson's work, too, and I'm glad that he's cranking the music out on a semi-regular basis again, but he's just composed too much good, transcendant music in the past that this entire CD just pales in comparison. The production is unfortunately uninspired and samey throughout, and the lyrics may mean something to Brian, but they strike me as bland and cookie-cutter. The inclusion of the remake \\"Let Him Run Wild\\" only underlines the fact that he has lost something vital--it reminds you of the magic that was the Beach Boys. I refuse to believe Brian doesn't still have it in him, but it's not to be found on this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half A Good Album Does Not Make A Great Album","review":"Yeah, well. Only fanboys bought this album. And mostly fanboys review it, in the unquestioningly adoring manner of the Brianista. but the Rest Of The World (and there are quite a few of us) greeted this release with a resounding two cheers. Lazy product; couple of so-what retreads that answer a musical question no-one was asking, and Brian's worst-ever song; the Care-Bears On Downers stumble through the non-ironically named \\"Happy Days\\".Yep, there's a few lovely songs here, all dressed up in a satin tour-jacket of a production, but hardly enough for the ten years it took to cobble the thing together.Stop cossetting him, guys. He can, and should, do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Wear Well!","review":"I picked this CD up when it first came out and thought it was very good. I probably listened to it four or five times the first week. Then, the other day, I popped it in the car CD player and could barely make it through one song. In fact, I couldn't wait to trade it in. It is so incredibly sacharine and just plain dull. Brian Wilson hasn't made a decent CD since \\"Pet Sounds\\" (vastly overrated itself!) I've owned all his solo stuff and eventually traded them all in. They simply don't hold up."},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant classic","review":"I bought Imagination the day it was released and I can't stop listening to it. None of the tunes get old. Rather, they get better the more I listen. My favorites are \\"Lay Down Burden\\" and \\"South American,\\" but let's face it, I love them all. Thank you, Brian, for this amazing treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"..seems to pickup where \\"Summer Days..\\" left off...a gem","review":"I don't look too deep lately into Mr. Wilson's work...all I know is that I love his voice (sounds great this time around), I love the harmonies, and the tunes are great. I (as all BB fans) was deeply moved by \\"Lay Down Burden\\"..if only Brian and Carl could have sung together just once more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a great album from an underrated genious","review":"I'm sure most Brian Wilson fans will agree that this is his best effort in a long while. This album contains some of his most beautiful harmonies (\\"She Says That She Needs Me\\" is nothing less then breathtaking) most personal (\\"Lay Down Burden\\") and most carefree songs (South American and Sunshine). Its a mixed bag of songs...and they all work! A little fluffy, sure, but it makes you feel good. This is music for the soul. Thanks Brian for giving us this album...almost 2 years after its release I still listen to it constantly.

I was sad to see that the transfer of this DVD is virtually washed out of color, but then again, there has never been any problem with black & white film has there? There is some very solid direction from Vadim, plus great acting from Bardot and Robert Hossein. The story takes place in the great European period of the 1960's where tragic love stories reign better than they ever have. Give me this over any American romantic comedy anyday (And technically this is a true romantic comedy in light of the story structure and the ending in particular; it's just the superior European take on the genre). If you love this time period as conveyed through film, and like Bardot, this is a definite addition to add to your library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A jaundiced version?","review":"THIS is an extraordinary film..the entire picture looks jaundiced that it might perhaps be better off described as black&yellow rather than colour. That aside this is the dubbed version, something I never really liked in a film, the stars' lips were obviously out of sync with the dialogue and the plot incredibly shallow and bland ( though I suspect it was intended to convey some profound message...but what?). Bardot saves a man's life and falls for this sad character...well love is truly blind here and in the process dumps her fiancee and starts avoiding her mother. Finally if I was not a Bardot fan I would not have sat through this....my eyes were sore afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated French melodrama leaves viewer empty","review":"Bardot, Bardot, Bardot. In the 1950's and 60's, this name would garauntee box office success. Unfortunately, this is the new millenium and there is little in this film to amuse viewers. First, the quality of the print used to make this video was so washed out that the film looks like monochrome. Secondly, Bardot, while sexy, does little to enhance this slow tale of a young women fighting the age old battle of the sexes with a drifter she picks up and brings home. Nudity, don't count on it. You'll get more on modern daytime soaps. If you just have to have more Bardot in you collection, OK, buy it. If your looking for entertainment, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of little interest cinematic interest, but full of ambiguity","review":"Vadim's films may be exploitations, but they are also contradictory narratives about his own life, his own power in discovering Brigitte Bardot ('And God created woman': modest, isn't he?) and emasculation in having her transcend and ultimately reject his influence. This film is typical. On the one hand it is an 'anti-bourgeois' (yawn) tale of a woman who leaves her dull husband, embraces sexual 'liberation' (i.e. hoovers in her birthday suit) and eventually masters her mean lover in an extended rite of psychological S&M. This is Bardot's narrative. On the other, Bardot is repeatedly stripped and humiliated for men (her lover; Vadim; the implied viewer), but shot in a fragmentary way that denies her even sexual power. This is Vadim's narrative. Guess which wins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anime greatness","review":"I have seen many animes and gundam series and Gundam seed is by far my favorite anime.

He has no background in evaluating wine, he gives no description of the overall industry or wine regions of Chile, and no real discussion of Chilean wines. Given this lack of substance you might expect at least a charming travelogue. But alas, to add insult to injury, this journal reads like a high schooler's first trip, complete with descriptions of parking at O'Hare, hotel gym facilities, etc. It is hard to understand how this book got published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sauvignon Boring","review":"This book contains very little information on Chilean wines and not enough insight into Chilean culture. I don't want to call the author racist but I got the impression that he views Chileans as second class people.

So now it is my Number 2 favorite (after Red Door). Hubby doesn't like it (says it is too strong), but ALL Arden fragrances are strong (which I like, because you use less).

Although straightforwardness is certainly preferable to anything else, I felt there could have been a greater quantity and more interesting real-world applications to help explain more difficult concepts.

I read the description of the book written by the seller and it said that only the cover had damage and that the pages had not been written in or highlighted.

This book is worth your dollars sheerly on talent alone. It does run through some unfocused spots, but for a debut novel this is great.

Mephistopholes), etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gah!","review":"Hi! This novel is riddled with typos. It's clunky and awkward. There are some tremendously good moments, though they're ride scattershot through bad terrain. I have no idea what the author was thinking when he wrote half of what's in there, and he should have revised it some more, and he should have taken some more stuff out. That said, the author meant well. Had he been less impatient he could have salvaged a novella-length gem out of this promising but unwieldy rock.If you're willing to look for the good bits there are good bits to be found.

I love the double laser because it gives you the kerf cut. Therefore, rather than 'splitting' a cut in the middle, you can accurately cut to your measurement. I have done a number of 45's for trim work, and it has made great cuts. I have also cut 2x6's, metal and plastic pipe (go very slow bringing the saw down and it won't chip) etc., and it's a horse. Love it and would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Purchase","review":"I looked at many different saws before purchasing this one. While most of the saws I looked at could do the job, I had a big concern with the way the trigger occassionaly pinched my fingers when engaging the blade of other saws. If you repeatedly engage the trigger using slight variations to your grip you may find the same problem I did. The grip on the saw is perfect, never a problem. The twin lasers also make cutting much easier. The cut they outline is dead-on. I did not buy the saw because of the laser feature, (I bought it for the grip remember)but now that I have it, I'm glad I do. I will never own a mitre saw again without the twin laser.The construction of the saw is solid! Overall, a very good purchase I am glad I made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price","review":"8 feet of fencing (about 9-10 inches high when it is in the ground).

I purchased this one on a clearence for 14.99 as part of a promotion from one of those big box retail chains. That is the only way I will see this show on DVD. I would not even think of paying full price! If you are fortunate enough to get a lower price for this set; it's worth a try. For all intents and purposes it's harmless fun and a good show.I am wondering if the rumors are true. Is the quality of season's 3, 4, and five lower than that of the first two seasons?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first season.","review":"I didn't really get hooked on the show with season one. Most of the characters just seemed annoying. Other than Captain Hunt, Rommie, and Rev Bem, the characters were barely tolerable. When characters don't take life and death situations seriously, for example, it's hard for the audience to do so. And, the whole slip-stream deal is just too bizarre.But, season two does have some strong episodes, and the characters have started to mature. One disappointment is that Rommie is yet another android/non-human trying to be human. It would have been refreshing if she were either comfortable with emotions from the get-go, or completely non-emotional.Any word on when Season 3 comes out on DVD? I see that Season 3 \\"volumes\\" are available. I don't know anyone insane enough to spend $36 on a few episodes in a \\"volume\\" when the entire season sells for $56. Some Season 4 \\"volumes\\" are already available, but Season 3 is not even available for pre-order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Toasting, Uneven Browning","review":"This is the worst toaster I have ever owned.

I've also read about five books that tout various conspiracies in the JFK case, and _Six Seconds in Dallas_ is the best of them. Thompson appears to be one of the more honest conspiracy researchers who attempt to find an answer to the mystery rather than just endlessly find fault with the Warren Commission. His theory of the shot that hit JFK in the back (or throat, depending on how you see things) is particularly interesting and almost compelling. I recommend this book whether or not you believe Oswald acted alone. It's very readable and to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice chapter book for young girls","review":"Margaret wants is a sister, a dog, and, most important of all, her mama's permission to study medicine so she can be a doctor like her papa.

It shows little girls and boys as well that they can be what ever they set their minds to be. This book is great for bringing about discussions on medical history, the 1900's family life, and character lesson on determination.We would recommed this book to mainly girl readers ages 9-12.

The comic strip is absolutely hilarious, and it always makes me smile. You will love Bucky's (the cat) funny quips, the mischief he gets into and the excuses he makes to get out of trouble. My favorite strips are when Bucky makes up a definition for words he does not fully understand- it's just great. And then the dog is fun because of his lack of knowledge and the way he tries to be part of the intelligent conversations. This book sits out on my desk and it read constantly when I need a little humor to brighten my day. I recommend this book to everyone with a sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice progression from the first collection","review":"As I had hoped, Conley's characters have deepened as the script matures. One has a better sense of each of the animals' personalities, and the human character, Rob, is becoming more sympathetic as well, especially when he tries to preserve Satchel's feelings from Bucky's very cat-like unintentional cruelties. Conley has done a very good job taking the essential animal characteristics of both the dog and the cat and morphing them into not-quite-human analogs.

That'll appease the audience for the next 10 years.\\"There is a lot of potential here. And he does hit once or twice a month, but no job will let you get away with delivering 3 percent of the time, so why do we all think this \\"cat' is the next best thing.

In this case all we see here is a cheap rip off of the original Garfield. Let's see both Garfield and Get Fuzzy both star obnoxious cat, a simpleton dog and a nerdy owner. Of all the possibilities in the world Darby could have chosen, he opts to use the same three types of characters that Garfield has. Could he have more plagaristic than that? If it isn't Garfield, why then do people have to keep defending it so much that it is not? Why are we all automatically reminded of Garfield if Get Fuzzy really is not? If it wasn't Garfield to begin with, then no one should have to insist that it isn't. I cannot believe the heaps of praise this stuff gets. THis is the most shallow, unoriginal strip out there. You know what an imposible task is? Trying to explain to another person what Get Fuzzy is, who has never heard of Get Fuzzy, without them thinking of Garfield."},{"rating":"1","title":"F Minus!","review":"Hmm, lets see here. Take a comic strip, put in other ideas from other comics and what do you have? The worst new comic on the market.

Just because I own a cat does not mean this is a good strip. Just because the drawings are pretty good does not mean this is a good strip, if I thought it was all about the drawings I'd be a huge Mary Worth or Mark Trail fan.

Please somebody put this strip out of its misery, or else just realize that this is a less than average strip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny","review":"This is not a funny strip period. All it is is Garfeild. Do not compare this to the best strips of the past. It is a simple shallow cartoon. Darbey has yet to explore areas that might make this strip entertaining. What made \\"The Great\\" strips entertaining were that they used political, historical, religious, and philisophical outtakes to make them work. \\"Get Fuzzy\\" is not any of these.Simply owning a pet does not mean this is funny.

Conley is a breath of fresh air on the comic strip scene, and the only artist/writer around who makes me laugh out loud at his strips.If you're unfortunate enough to live in a city which does not carry the daily antics of Satchel and Bucky in its paper, all the more reason to get this and see what you're missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"these books just crack me up, my only complaint is they are too short!

Helps young girls stop and think before jumping into situations. Gives girls positive encouragement to have their dreams fulfilled, making goals, understanding parents, grownups, and consequences. Picture and journal areas for writing down feelings, thoughts, goals, self evaluation and future dreams. Nothing offensive inside this book. What is nice is that it is for any girl no matter what belief they may or may not have. There are no religious topics, so anyone can incorporate their own beliefs if they shared this book with their daughter. It will help young girls decide to wait to have sex or a baby and respect their body."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good reference book","review":"This is an interesting and helpful reference book if simple answers are all that are needed.

However after two months of use the left speaker on the headphones stopped working. In addition to that, the cover that holds the foam in place (soft part that goes over both ears) is ripping and exposing the foam on both sides. I definitely do NOT recommend this product. Buyer beware. To break down in such a way is absolutely unacceptable. This is unfortunate, as I am outside Amazon's one month return policy and because of the price I got it for, shipping it in for a warranty claim would not be worth it. This was probably what Koss, the manufacturer, counted on anyway.If you are looking for headphones that would last for more than two months, I would recommend looking somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koss Collapsible Headphones","review":"I bought these and I was very satisfied when I received them! The sound quality is excellent and the price was unbeatable. The ear cushions cover my ears completely and when I use them, they cancel out a very good amount of background noise.

That's just a minor imperfection, for the price and sound quality, this is a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, very comfortable, at low low price","review":"There are a lot of bad headphones on the market. These are very listenable, comfortable to wear, and incredibly inexpensive. I have three pairs that I use with my computers. They don't require external power like computer speakers. They sound much fuller than even expensive computer speakers, with deeper bass, cleaner highs and mids, and you can play louder without disturbing others. They have a useful long straight cord. I highly recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying","review":"a satisfying buy, but it didnt really project the kind of sound that i expect.. that clear crisp, loud sound"},{"rating":"1","title":"The jack was slightly too small.","review":"The sound quality was alright, but the sound came through very quietly (perhaps due to the length of the cord?) My main issue with the headphones was that it seemed the jack was slightly too small, such that you hand to press it in the socket to get a clear sound. I've stopped using these headphones due to that issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Feelings","review":"I am not exactly sure how I feel about these yet. I like Koss because they are sturdy and my first pair lasted for maybe 7 years. When those broke, I replaced them with the exact same style, the only difference being the plug was straight and not L shaped like my first ones. This new pair lasted 4 months. The wiring in the plug started to pull out at about 2 monthes. So I decided to replace them. I chose the UR18 because the picture showed an L shaped plug and the description specifically said L shaped plug. They arrived today and they ended up having a straight plug. If I had known they were going have a straight plug, I would have saved myself $10 and gotten another pair of UR10. So I will have to see if these will last any longer.Otherwise, they seem to be a decent pair of headphones. The sound quality is different than the UR 10, but I'm not too picky"},{"rating":"2","title":"The inner game of Tennis","review":"Dear Amazon :I bought this book over two years ago and never sent a review.

I recommend to all my book owners and students that they read Tim's book. There are many other so called sports psychologists out there that try to say the same things Tim is saying but they just don't succeed.

All the while, I kept beating myself down for not being able to master the different aspects of the game. Until this book came out! What a revelation. It shifted my focus into positive thinking, or non-thinking. I stopped figiting with myself and focused on the ball. I began to experience \\"being in the zone\\" in one particular double tournament. My opponents couldn't believe how they could let the game slipped away when they were ahead 5-3. I went back and read the book from time to time and had given a few of them away to my friends.

Mr Gallwey starts the book by explaining Self-1 verses Self-2 and how Self-1 must allow Self-2 to play the game. While I found this form of existentialism interesting, I found very little that I could use in my tennis matches. I prefer a book with more practical applications for maintaining a strong postive attitude with direct discussion of how to flow with the game so I can hit the ball both accurately and smoothly without over thinking. If you're looking for a book like this, I would recommend 'The Mental Edge' by Ken Baum instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"Easy to read, understand and apply.

It opened my eyes to several issues pertaining to the subject of death and dying. I would highly recommend this read to someone who is dealing with a loved one's death or perhaps even their own death. It will instill in you a respect and hopefully less fear towards this segment of life. Concerning others, it will enable you to respect your loved ones' wishes or help you in assisting them to make important decisions as it relates to their final days. The text also instilled in me the importance of having a living will. This is one of those books to read and then pass around to enlighten others. My only complaint about the book is that sometimes the information seemed repetitious or irrelevant. I found myself growing impatient with some of the conversations shared in this book as a result. Of course, that may just be due to my character and nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Older book, but very informative.","review":"This book was older but I knew that and it DID offer the information I was wanting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful during difficult time","review":"This book was recommended to me when my mother seemed to be dying of cancer.

I found this book to be very dull, for the most part a collection of VERY meandering and unfocussed interviews of the dying (transcribed verbatim). In particular, the topic turned frequently to religion, and as we both were/are atheists this discussion was completely irrelevant and irritating to me.I found another book called \\"I don't know what to say\\" to be vastly superior for me as a practical compedium of suggestions on how I could handle (and help my loved one handle) the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic 1969 book about grief stages that defined mainstream views about a person's grief","review":"In this classic book about grief, Kubler-Ross explains the stages of grief that became widely used in the grief and loss field. The media's use of Kubler-Ross's stages- denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance--created mainstream acceptance of Kubler-Ross's findings. An interesting book to give you a revered author's view of the grief and loss process based on her research. Some newer books have dismantled some of the views expressed in this book.

The narrator is unidentified, as is his interest in/connection to the main character, as is his ability to know the main characters thoughts, despite having met her only once.

But instead he insists on jumping back and forth between Teresa and a reporter (who is deadly boring and self-important) telling Teresa's story, which made it impossible to keep any connection with the story, the events or the characters.Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring book I have actually finished","review":"Maybe it was the editing or the translation, but this book was a long and frustrating waste of time.There was no spark in the writing, plot or characters. It was as if everyone was either on Prozac or needed it!I was really let down because the middle started getting more interesting so I kept reading, thinking it would finish strongly, but was disappointed.Actually, the only reason I am writing this is because I was taken in by the many 4 and 5 star ratings and am pissed off that I was duped!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please go back to the \\"arcane\\"","review":"If no one had told me what I was reading, I would never have guessed that the author of this *sensationally* violent trash could be the same person who wrote Seville Communion, Flanders Panel, Fencing Master, etc. I only hope that it is a \\"stage\\" and that he returns to what Booklist called his \\"arcane\\" writing --- write what you know, not what you research."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfied","review":"I purchased this book intending to recieve it within 21 business days, however the book never came. They have notified me that they must have recieved errors at their warehouse. They gave me a full refund. But I am not satisfied because I wanted that book and now they don't even have it for around the same price. I am so frustrated when all I wanted was the product. I still purchase from Amazon but just not happy right now with my latest purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time so far.","review":"Why an Author would repeat Teresa's insults to her deceased boyfriend SO MANY TIMES throughout this book is a mystery to me. I wish it were the only thing that was repeated excessively. Virtually anything that bores you reading once is guaranteed to come up again in the following chapter. With no development, mind you, just repeated. Does Perez-Reverte have no one in his life to tell him honestly how insufferable this tome is? I was really looking forward to reading it because I have a personal connection to many of the locations he writes about, but, alas, I probably will not be able to finish it. I am getting to the age when I begin to realize we do not have an inexhaustible number of days in our lives and should use them all wisely. Writing this review was very cathartic, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating to read!","review":"I did not like this book and had an extremely difficult time finishing it. It is not well written and it is hard to follow. The subject matter is disgusting, throughout the entire book. I gave it to my sister and she couldn't finish it. I would not waste my money on this book. If you are a fan of the author, buy it used and try to wade through it. Be prepared to be frustrated and annoyed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entry Level Arturo","review":"Perez-Reverte is at his most accessable in this Iberian soaked tale of drugs, death and defiance. Typically, his female lead is gutsy, gritty, gorgeous and ruminates on the eternal 'whys' of fate, love, mercy and cruelty.The Queen of the South is tightly paced compared to many of Perez-Reverte's other novels and perhaps because of this the depth of nuance found in The Fencing Master or The Nautical Chart, is missing here. Still we cannot help but want more.Perez-Reverte writes with a touch that is personal to everyone and accessable to many. The Queen of the South may also be the best-translated of his novels. For those new to the genre, its a great entry point into the best Spanish-speaking literature we have today."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS BOOK! One of my all-time favorites.","review":"I loved this book. I listened to the audio book (though I can't recall who read it), and I found it to be a riveting story. It was complex and multi-layered, and I found that hearing the story read by a Spanish speaker allowed me to really sink into the story, as it sounded authentic and real (as opposed to how I may have narrated in my head). I would highly recommend this book, and would urge readers to listen to this story instead of (or in addition to) actually reading it. For word pronunciation alone, it was worth it, but the who audio experience added a additional level of enjoyment for me.Also, for what it's worth, the ending left a huge opportunity for a sequel, should Reverte ever be inclined, and that is a very tantalizing way to end a book & have the reader (listener) searching for more titles by the same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"steady and haunting","review":"I admit, my interest took a while to build. Once finished,though I was sad. The book is haunting with excellent descriptions of the heroine's history,motivation and culture. The parallel story lines-one from the protagonist,another from a reporter investigating her history are very complimentary. Finally, the rich description of Mexican and Spanish cultures,as pertaining to narco-trafficking was fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the first 100 pages and then read no more.","review":"If you want to read something really believable read \\" El Narco \\" by British authorIoan Grillo. It reads like a novel while it is a real investigative report."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Queen\\" not my cup of tea","review":"Perez-Reverte is a master novelist, but this is not among my favorites. I found the shifting points of view too jerky and hindered my comprehension of the complex story of the poor girl rising to become \\"The Queen of the South.\\" The tale takes us to all the exotic locales one comes to love in a Perez-Reverte novel, and introduces us to his usual cast of equally colorful and unique characters. Like a good thriller on the screen, Perez-Reverte's gets tremendous mileage out of his secondary and supporting characters. Some will love this tale of the men and women in the world of narco-trafficantes, but \\"The Queen\\" was just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore POV, Enjoy the Ride","review":"This was a great adventure story, one which gave me escape for several hours. However, as I read the review from the Washington Post, I was reminded of something that had bothered me while I read the book. It was the journalist's point of view which had knowledge of the heroine's most intimate moments and even her thoughts! Since Arturo Perez-Reverte is a Spanish author, I thought that perhaps this was deemed acceptable in some European novels, but surely there is at least this degree of sophistication in Spain, eh? It surely seems that an American editor would have made certain that this was corrected before publication.Having said all that, I DO reccommend the book. The first scene is gripping, the escape harrowing, and the adventure never gets tired. If you can accept the suspension of disbelief, as Gardner called it, you will enjoy the exciting narrative and the characters. Especially the heroine. She is unlike any other female protagonist, and deeply absorbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"This story is told in two styles; from an omniscient perspective following the main character, and from the first-person point of view of a journalist researching her story. At first I was quite bored by the latter story. Later on, however, I began to feel like Perez-Reverte was trying to coax me into a state of mind whereby I would begin to use Teresa Mendoza's story as a truer reality. Throughout the book Teresa discovers that through books she can live more fully, and understand her life more by applying stories as filters to her own life. I began to feel that Perez-Reverte was trying to create a mindset so that I would apply Teresa's story as a filter to my own life in order to gain greater understanding from it. Maybe this is too deep, but that's what I've been getting from it. I'll go into greater depth later, but suffice it say I found a lot of truth about humanity in this story. I very much enjoyed it, and will read more by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a queen","review":"This is the first of Perez-Reverte's books that I have struggled to finish. The ham-handed interviewer slows the story down to a crawl every time he enters. And the story itself has none of the fascinating complications and turns that make the author's other novels (Club Dumas, Flanders Panel) so fascinating. No queen, just a lady in waiting. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disappointed, Arturo","review":"I've been your adoring fan all through your other classy, elegant books, which are among my favorite fiction---especially \\"The Seville Communion.\\" But \\"Queen of the South\\" is too much a departure, for me, from your usual stylish novels. I'm surprised at the rave reviews of many readers. I and my more discriminating reading friends don't understand why you wasted your talents on writing a book that borders on pulp trash about a sleazy woman in the sleazy drug world. There are already too many authors churning out pulp, disposable fiction. Did you just want to do something different? Okay, you've done that now, so please return to the Perez-Reverte that I knew and loved...and I'll return to adoring you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters I don't care about","review":"The author was recommended to me by a friend whose opinion I respect. Perhaps Perez-Reverte's other books are better, but this one was very dull and the characters were lifeless. I can see that the author has a good writing style, but here his technique was wasted on characters and circumstances that I simply couldn't care about. I rarely give up on a book, but after plodding through the first 100 pages I decided I'd read enough. The was no snap, no sparkle, no mystery, no suspense, no fun. Even the death of a character was essentially \\"ho-hum, the (Spanish expletive) was dead.\\" Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointed fan...","review":"I'm a huge fan of Perez-Reverte generally, but - like a couple of previous reviewers - am very disappointed with this one so far. I was warned that it's very slow to get going and I'm only on Pg 100 but I think I'm going to have to put this down for a while and try again later. Somehow it manages to be both sleazy and deadly dull. And why do all the characters and many of the bars and restaurants need so many different names and nicknames? It may be authentic, but it doesn't move the narrative forward and sure makes for tedious reading. The characters, including the heroine Theresa, seem flat, unreal and unattractive. Perez-Reverte has failed to breathe life into any of them. He does paint a vivid picture of the world of drug trafficking but that isn't enough to sustain this peculiarly lifeless story. If I change my mind when I come back and finish the book, I'll amend my review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have over 40 books on make up and this is surely the worst one I have bought.The title is completely misleading and there is very little of substance.Basic make up techniques with reference to various lighting techniques as well as color light relationship is not mentioned.Fundamental things like colour theory which is so essential to make up and photography is not mentioned in the book.This book is just one of the many mediocre titles available on make up.I would not recommend this book to anyone but if you wish to waste [price] feel free to order the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"This is, at best, a poorly done book. As a professional photographer, I thought it would be helpful for me to know a little more about makeup. This book has the basics, but the example photos don't look particularly impressive and the writing seems carelessly or hastily written.There don't seem to be a lot of books on makeup for photographers, but I didn't think this book was worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank god I checked it out at library","review":"I recently checked this book out at the library. Thank God I did before I bought it. It should instead be titled, \\"Makeup application for little girls that think lipstick all over the face is a good look.\\" It would have been more accurate.If I was the author of this book, I would be ashamed of some of the images. He obviously didn't look closely at the photos that were supposed to be representative of what he was writing about. The eyeliner is jagged and not close to the eye. The foundation is oily and dirty looking. The child's clown makeup looks like she probably put it on herself.This book is a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make-up Techniques for Photography","review":"As a professional portrait photographer, I thought it would be helpful to have a better understanding of the differences in applying make-up for a normal social setting, and a photography shoot. What a disappointment this book was! In addition to being poorly written and redundant from page to page, it didn't offer any information that any female over the age of 12 doesn't already know. I think we all know that we should wash our faces every day. And the make-up depicted in the photographs was very poorly done--my 14 year-old daughter does a better job of applying eyliner than their so-called expert. Even the photography itself was not impressive. And most of the make-up styles shown were very dated. All in all, it was a complete waste of my money, and of the 30 minutes of my time it took to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No important information at all","review":"This book was empty as far as knowlege and techniques for a makeup artist.

The author turns primarily to Southwest Australian orchids and gives a brilliant insight in evolutionary matters. Funny to realise that Darwin himself did not like Southwest Australia when he had a stop over there with his Beagle voyage. He detested Albany, I love it. Southwest Australia has been recognised as one of the top biodiversity hotspots worldwide. Read and enjoy the book and share the author's enthousiasm and expert knowledge.As I have been botanizing in many places where the author has been, I enjoyed the descriptions of his discoveries during his fieldtrips. It also revived my holidays. I share his thrills and was also intrigued by the Hammer Orchid and its pollination. The books gives excellent explanations. I have sent a photo of the Hammer Orchid to Alcock and had it identified by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a top UK gangster movie","review":"I've seen this film ten times and I will watch it again and again. This movie is pure brilliance, the very original concept of gangsters putting the Karaoke before business, the humour, and yes the violence all come together to make this film, for me, stand out from all the same old same old being rolled off the Hollywood production line. It is British at its best and wackiest, like all the main actors using their own first names. However, what I will say is that I don't think it would be appreciated across the pond because I just don't think they will 'get it'.

This movie is for lovers of British cinema, whether it be blockbuster or independent. I'm a big fan of Britain and I was lucky enough to understand not only the jokes, but the history behind them that lend itself to the hilarity of it all. Rhys Ifans as the thugged out Welshman (not true for all Welsh) in the scene with the firebomb screaming his insults, only the British and their legions can truly know how funny that is. The entire North vs. South London theme was pretty funny, too. It goes to show that the British have a great sense humor regarding their bulldog spirit. A+ film. Not one for this side of the pond."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was weird but kind of funny","review":"Being that i'm american and not british i don't think many british likes this movie, i thought it was ok my dvr taped this and i fun myself watching it, i thought it was ok a bit weird sometimes but ok, i like the music in the beginning thats what got me hook into watching it"},{"rating":"1","title":"I never walk out of a movie but...","review":"The only reason why I rented this movie was because Jude Law is in it. It just goes to show that all actors star in horrible movies from time to time. Watching \\"Love,Honour and Obey\\" is like watching a movies deleted scenes without watching the actual movie.

Overall, I liked it, but there should have been a few larger pockets. The inside pockets were good for my passport and wallet. I used the outside pockets for an extra camera lens and a few other accessories. The extra lens (not that large) fit tight in the largest pocket, so I wished the pocket had been a little larger. If you want to carry several lenses or a large lens, this is not the vest for you.The vest is well-made, and is heavier than you would think, but pretty comfortable.

FROM ROME TO BYZANTIUM basically consists of a series of quotes (many from other books by Michael Grant, a few from other standard histories of the period) with some linking passages to hold the thing together. I gave this two stars rather than one because for a reader new to the period the book at least encapsulates the basic facts and trends. But a far better short history of the 5th century AD - despite its unfortunate occasional descents into religiosity - is Perowne's END OF THE ROMAN WORLD."},{"rating":"1","title":"black and decker mega mouse","review":"I used one on only one piece of furniture, the allen wrench fruitless whirled around rendering the \\"interchange\\" parts all useless.

I tried 2 of them and will return the second soon - Worthless- correct your flaws Black and Decker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost 5 stars","review":"This was a present from my family. While I am not a big fan of \\"do it all\\" tools, the Mega Mouse sander seems to do the job. For what it is designed for, it does quite well. Small to medium project sanding seems to be what this tool is designed for. If you are going to sand a floor, you should get something that is designed for it.On the other hand, if you are working small projects, this is it. Even medium sized work, in my case a 6' X 4' deck that serves as my front porch. It needed sanding after some pressure washing, and I did not look forward to doing it by hand. Out came the Mega Mouse, and it did the job very nicely. I am satisfied with the product so far, and I reccommend it as long as you realize that you are not getting a heavy duty belt sander. Keep this in mind and you won't be disappointed.The four star rating is due to the plastic case. Too tight, too hard to get everything back into it. But so far that's my only quibble with the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the regular mouse and a better sander","review":"I wore this unit out in less than 90 days. The RO sanding base lost its hooks, the mouse base broke, the dust control unit fell off and the finger attachment wouldn't stay in place. I returned it, bought the little mouse and a better RO sander and spent the same amount of money. It was an appealing idea to get all of those tools in one, but the whole package doesn't stand up to more than light duty."},{"rating":"1","title":"black decker 4-1 multi sander ms700","review":"Sander okay for small sanding project.

The first time I used it the iron shaped plate, it melted and broke where it attached. I followed the directions so I don't think I did anything wrong. The Dust collector has never collected any dust. I have used it for a few more projects just as an orbital sander, but now the Velcro on the round plate has started coming off, which after some research, I have found is a common problem. I suppose I could buy a replacement part for it, but I think I'll just buy a dewalt sander interwar. It doesn't polish, but we use one at work regularly with abuse and they've never given us any trouble and the dust collector works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Sander, sandpaper hard to find","review":"This sander is good for consumer use only -- and works well. My problem is that neither of the big box stores carry a good selection of sandpaper for this model and at best they sell one or two grades in 5-piece packages. If I could find the sandpaper in all grades (60, 80, 120, 180, 220, 320) in bulk I would be a happy camper. Since that's not the case, it's not a useful tool and paying over $1 per sandpaper change gets expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huxley's best","review":"The Genius and the Goddess is my favorite work by Huxley.

This book may stand out from the rest because it actually quotes what others teens themselves have to say on various topics. However, it lacks content and appears to be like many other teen books, addressing similar issues in similar ways. It won't bore you but it definitely won't leave you breathless. If you want a book with the same edge but filled with content try \\"Stories for a Teen's Heart\\" by Alice Gray or even Wade F.

This disc presents pianist Friedrich Gulda performing two Piano Concertos by Mozart and a Piano Sonata by Beethoven. Long ago, Gulda left the classical scene to explore a (mediocre, in my opinion) career in jazz. This title takes us back to the vintage, pre-jazz Gulda on two first-rate late mono performances (1955) of Mozart's 25th and 26th Piano Concertos with Anthony Collins leading the New Symphony Orchestra. The set concludes with a 1958 stereo recording of the 22nd Beethoven Piano Sonata. This is the type of disc collectors eagerly anticipate from Testament, but I'm withholding a fifth star because it is hard to ask the average fan to pay full-price for historical sessions. In all though, this disc is yet another \\"testament\\" to a great reissue program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"Nice concept and a quick way to connect to the female side of the Marinco connector.

Though it didn't suspend my disbelief as it could have, it definitely was very creepy, interesting, and a worthwhile experience overall. But Ju-On2 is just bad. The acting usually isn't bad, but the effects and makeup are no better than comical. (I can't help but giggle every time I think about the scene in which the two were hanged by the hair of a phantasm that resides in the ceiling.)

Freundel shows the development of Jewish tradition and practices, and shows how the philosophy that makes up Judaism has changed over time. Particularly of interest are the ways in which he ties changes in Jewish thought to global changes in thought over time, and how the overarching idea of a given era affected Jewish views.This book takes the approach of being a quick overview of a variety of topics rather than an in-depth study on any of them, but it still provides the reader with enough information to give them a cursory understanding of the selected topics. The footnotes and citations are part of the real wealth of this book - if you do want to do an in depth study on any of the topics the book deals with, those would be a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!","review":"This was a very good book.

But anyone with an MFA knows from the get-go to stay away from the topics of dogs and dreams! I'm too type A not to finish a book (this was on the shelf at a beach cottage) but it was tedious. Bizarre and boring on the topic of teaching a dog to talk, long-winded on tarot cards (unless you're into that... if you're not, a reader just wants to know the outcome), the tension is drawn out too long about the so-called \\"mystery\\" surrounding Lexy's death, and she herself is an unlikeable character.

It's a shame the author ruined what could have been a wonderful love story.Oh, and by the way, I wonder if Ms. Parkhurst is aware that neither dogs nor humans have the ability to swallow (and therefore eat) without a larynx????? I think she neglected some important research. Not only is the dog mutilation part of this book distasteful, it is also not factual."},{"rating":"1","title":"For people who enjoy animal torture","review":"I only wish there were options to give \\"minus stars\\". In 58 years I have never thrown a book in the trash (much less a brand new hardcover) but I was so disgusted with this book it went into the trash compactor when I was two-thirds through. I wouldn't even consider putting it in a booksale for fear a nut similar to the author would find the book instructive. If you are interested in finding new ways to torture animals, have at it. But you will have to plow your way through idiotic, inexplicable and annoying behavior of a dead wife and a husband with a jellyish spine and mind. There was absolutely no redeeming value in this book. It is incredibly insulting to Alice S. to compare this [book] to her \\"lovely bones\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool idea, bad book","review":"When I started reading this book I hoped it would be a cool mystery about how the narrator uncovers the truth of his wife's death with clues given by the only witness, their dog. Unfortunately the book was not nearly as neat as I thought it would be. The fact that the professor literally tries to get the dog to talk is just plain dumb. This book focuses way too much on that, and not enough on solving the mystery...which by the way turns out to be not mysterious at all. There is some stuff in the book about animal abuse, and as a huge animal lover, I was somewhat bothered, but it really isn't that bad. Also, I did not end up feeling anything for the characters. Lexy, the wife who dies, is self centered and basically psycho and Paul, the husband, is just plain boring.I finished this book, because I hate the idea of not finishing books, but it really wasn't worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting love story","review":"My wife and I enjoyed this interesting read about love and grief.

The notion of teaching dogs to speak was very funny, but a weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read - well written","review":"This was a quick read (took me a week) for me. A unique take on a tragic love story with a sub-plot diversion. Very well written, very introspective. Narrator and main character Paul was very well developed, so well that I could imagine him as a real person. I think I appreciated that he was flawed but not so flawed that he became a caricature. He stayed very believable and very accessible. A recommended read during a trip or your summer vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent, Fast Paced Novel","review":"The very first sentence of \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" drew me into this thought provoking and sincere book immediatly. Carolyn Parkhurst does a wonderful job of making you care for Paul Iverson, a linguistics professor who's wife died when she fell from an apple tree. Paul Iverson reminds me of a neighbor or good friend, a person everyone knows. Paul believes his wife, Lexy, has alterior motives for climbing the apple tree and so tries to get his dog to talk, hoping she can decribe Lexy's last few hours. Throughout the novel you find yourself rooting for Paul to succeed and teach his dog to communicate as well as overcome his grief. I would strongly recommend everyone even slightly interested in this book read it, because it will draw you in. (The short chapters won't hurt either.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real picture of grief","review":"This book is wonderful. I read it in one sitting. I couldn't put it down--not because it's a thrilling page-turner--but because it's so real. It paints an accurate, if ugly, picture of grief and depression. It's also well-written; the author's use of short chapters allievates the density of the topic and makes it an easy read. I've seen lots of criticism, in various reviews, of the plot--specifically the introduction of an animal cruelty group. In my opinion, however, that plot incident shows the true madness of grief--a grieving person often does things that make little sense to others to others, and as the narrator says, never EVER judge someone's grief, and never take away what the grieving person needs to get through. Give this book a chance. It doesn't make grief pretty as some books, including a New York Times Bestseller, \\"Good Grief\\" (by Lolly Winston) does. Grief isn't pretty. Depression isn't pretty. It's strange and ugly and this book shows it in all its glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all wear Masks","review":"I liked the book.There are lots of people who hide behind masks - in fact most of us do. Lexi was beautiful, creative, fun, talented, loving - that was her 99% of the time mask. But it wasn't really a \\"put-on\\" mask; it was the really her most of the time mask. Once in awhile another part of her, a hidden part, peeked out. It was a part of her that she did not like, a part that she could not control.Paul chose to ignore the ugly mask that Lexi would put on from time to time. He loved her every day mask too much.This was a real life kind of story. We all have masks. The people we love have masks. The question the story sets before is, how do we deal with our own masks and those of the ones we love?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulative and one-dimensional","review":"The point of this book is to find out whether or not the wife's fall from a tree was accidental or suicidal. It is only at the very end that we're told that the husband knew two EXTREMELY important facts from the very beginning that were never shared with the audience. Had we known these facts when the husband did, there would be no mystery, and absolutely no story of any kind. It was an extremely manipulative thing to do and cheapened the entire story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dog of a Book","review":"I had really high hopes for this book and there is a lot going for it. I enjoyed the writing style very much and it was a page turner. The problem was turning to the last chapter or two. What was initially a very engaging story with a unique premise got bogged down into absurdity. I won't give anything away, but the manner in which the character discovers how his wife died was so contrived it completely ruined the book for me, and then to assume that he \\"discovers\\" the manner of her death from such a contrivance made me re-read that page a few times to see if I missed something. Promising start, a ridiculous ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most horrid books I've ever read","review":"The idea is unusual enough to intrigue me. But the book made me nauseated. The two human characters were very unsympathetic, and I didn't care what happened to either of them. The only one I had any positive feeling for was the dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Section on Animal Cruelty Ruined My Love for this Story","review":"I was totally in love with this book and couldn't put it down...until I got to the section that others have mentioned about animal cruelty. I felt like I was floating through this whimsical unraveling of a tragic love story. Then I hit an unexpected wall with the descriptions of animal abuse.Dog lovers will be drawn to this book and, for me, to read this section really upset me and I did not recover at the end. It was a jolt to the tone of the book; and didn't seem in character for the protagonist...without giving away the plot, there is one decision in particular that he made that seems ludicrious and you immediately know what will happen.This chapter detracted from what would have been a great novel. It turned me off the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more","review":"I just finished reading this book over the weekend. Granted, the overall plot was interesting enough to keep me reading until the very end. Perhaps, I thought the book would get MORE interesting as I read on. Much to my dismay, it didn't. For one thing, as many other reviewers have pointed out, there was little character development. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters...except maybe the poor dog, Lorelei. I found Lexy to be quite an annoying person and did not see HOW Paul would have wanted to be with someone like her to begin with. I thought the book was predictable and poorly executed. The author wrote in the voice of a man but with a heart of a woman. The relationship she imagined between the two characters seemed so unreal I couldn't connect with them. I guess I was hoping it would turn out to be another \\"Lovely Bones.\\" If you have to pick between this book or \\"Lovely Bones\\" and have not read either one, read \\"Lovely Bones.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"Parkhurst's debut novel is INCREDIBLE.It's not just what she writes (an utterly engaging narrative in and of itself) but the way in which she does it. Each sentence is expertly crafted and this really works to elevate the tale.It's also dark - which makes it better still, lending the story a gritty realism most tales of grief and loss lack. It would have been so easy for this book to fall into melodramatic cliche, as Paul pined and cried for his dear lost Lexy. But he's gripped by a sort of madness that gives him a disturbing focus. He's sent places he has no business being (both literally and figuratively) and this makes the story both interesting and engaging.Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"...I...bought this book because I am a huge fan of Anna Quindlen. After finishing the book, I also wondered why in the world Quindlen would recommend this novel. The characters are unsympathetic and unbelievable, particularly Lexy. Frankly, I found myself not caring that Lexy had died. My reaction to this book was totally different from Lovely Bones, another novel about death that Quindlen recommended. Read Lovely Bones instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The plot is inane. The only sympathetic character is the dog. Lexy is a spoiled, selfish, egocentric fleabrain, incapable of concern for anyone else--neither her husband nor her unborn child. The husband is fumbling, inept, and downright stupid. I was not affected by his pain, his loss--only by his selfishness. The parts on dog abuse upset and angered me, especially the husband's part in exposing his own dog to the horrors of the underground \\"research\\" group. The plot is silly, the ending a foregone conclusion from the beginning. Apparently it did not occur to either the professor or his wife to get help for her problems. The novel is somewhat appropriately named--it is a dog and it is babble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original but unconvincing","review":"I was at first drawn in by the novel's delightfully absurd premise: a linguistics professor in mourning tries to teach the family dog, Lorelei -- the only witness to his wife's assumed suicide -- how to speak English. But I stumbled as Parkhurst fell (often comically) short of writing in a masculine voice. Paul Iverson, the narrator, is a very unconvincing man-in-mourning, and often unconvincing as a man at all, using descriptors like \\"prettily\\" and \\"lovely,\\" and so often saying things so decidedly feminine (\\"I sink into the memory as if it were a warm bath\\") that I could never get into the narrative itself. I had high hopes, but the Dogs of Babel failed to speak to me on any level.To read more reviews check out Void Magazine's website."},{"rating":"2","title":"No other book quite like this one!","review":"This book was enjoyable although not what I expected. It was similar in mood to The Lovely Bones. Somewhat dark and painful. There was the one chapter that I see other reviewers here mention, that was very disturbing, on animal abuse, but faint hearted people just need to skip that one. It is worth it to keep reading. I enjoyed this book very much. I like to come across something new and different. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The sort of book that stays with you, but not in a good way","review":"This book was one of those I had to keep reading, even though I didn't want to. The author is a great writer, but the subject matter left something to be desired. There were parts of it that absolutely haunted me, especially about the mutilated dogs. I wanted to know what happened, but I wish I had never read the book. I can't get it out of my mind. Don't read this book *especially* if you are a dog lover. The fact that the main character could even remotely identify with these dog butchers made it absolutely impossible for me to feel for him in the main story about his wife's death..which was a bit bizzare in and of itself, but a good story. My best advice is don't start reading this book, because you'll have to finish, and you'll probably be sorry you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just talking dogs","review":"When I began this book, I thought it seemed like a cute story. However, by the time I finished The Dogs of Babel, I realized that this was actually a book about love and grief, and what a person feeling these emotions may be willing to do. I have felt both these emotions first hand and the author does an amazing job putting these feelings onto paper.Yes, Parkhurst does use an unusual storyline to get her point across. Who would think that a book about a man trying to get his dog to communicate with him could be serious? The point is that someone with unresolved grief is willing to do ANYTHING to have it resolved. If you are the type of reader that likes straight to the point, no deep thinking involved, books, don't read this. If you are the type of reader that likes a book to keep you intrigued for days to come, I suggest that you give The Dogs of Babel a try. I think you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Creepy Book","review":"Though I will not deny that this book is well written, it is, nevertheless, creepy. I had to skip over a few parts about the graphic dog abuse. I couldn't find warmth or depth in the characters. They were just too bizarre for me. After reading other reviews on this book, I am aware that it has moved some readers to tears. For me, I couldn't wait for it to be over. I bought it for $3.00 at a used book store and am planning to give it back to them for free. I don't want the negative energy hanging around my house. I'm left to wonder what has happened to our society to make so many people love this truly weird, unbelievable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I found it difficult to put this book down. It was so beautifully written..it was intruiging, sad, but hopeful. I'm actually disappointed now that I have finished, I'm missing the story now that it is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money.","review":"This book was shallow and unbelievable, going for a kind of magical realism, but falling flat. The main character tries to teach his dog to talk, after his wife kills herself, in the hope that the dog will shed (no pun intended) some light on his wife's death. But even the character's reactions to the suicide and bereavement were not convincing. Shallow, and the subplot of lunatics who believe dogs can be surgically altered to talk, was not well-enough developed, or compelling in the least. I was prepared to like this book, I have liked other noirish-type fantasies, but I found it really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book IS a Dog","review":"This is truly one of the most dreadful, depressing books I have ever read. I did not like any of the characters and thought they were two dimensional at best. And maybe it's because I am a dog lover that I just could not stomach what happened to Lorelei. This book left me depressed for a couple of days after I finished reading it - because it's horrible and because I actually bought it in hard cover.I am an electic, avid reader and fairly sophisticated about my reading choices. However, I'd like to burn my copy of this book. I give it minus stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"My copy is in the trash! Don't bother with this book!","review":"Gratuitous and frightful descriptions of animal abuse do nothing but add to the horror of a deseperate suicide survivor's search for answers. I hate, hate, hate this book. HATE!It is disingenuous to put Dog in the title of this book. It should be titled \\"Suicide Babble\\". I was lured into the book by Dog in the title like candy to a child molestation victim. Terribly self conscious writing.Please don't read it. If you have a heart, you will be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable and Disturbing Read For Animal Lovers","review":"I would give this book zero stars if possible. I hated this book. It started out slow, predictable in its dialogue, and then I realized that the gloomy and depressing \\"climax\\" of this book is animal torture.If you are sensitive to animal suffering, don't bother reading this atrocity- it will give you nightmares and add to your thoughts of how sick the world really is. There are so many wonderful books to read- don't squander your precious time on this shameful garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be","review":"I agree with the review that says this novel is predictable, and I'd like to add that it's very sappy. The dialogue between him and his wife seemed made up and unnatural, and her character wasn't consistent.I decided to read this book because I was lured in by the idea that he was going to find some secret unknown canine language. But it more explores this man's feelings about his deceased wife. It goes back and forth from past to present: (past - he reminsces of his wife and their relationship and present - trying to find the mystery of her death), but the \\"mystery\\" was very predicatable. By the time I reached the end, there was no \\"ah-ha!\\". After I finished this book, I felt very dissatisfied, like I'd wasted a week of my life on this let-down of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"This is a disgusting book and I did not read the whole thing. I could not read past the animal abuse stuff. The author must be some sort of weird person. I have destroyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's the question,though.","review":"What is the connection of the title to the story? Not one reviewer (professional or general reader) ever expanded on that thought. Why did the writer choose the title?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but disturbing read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but a word of warning: It is NOT for the faint-hearted. The things is, as a reader you have to get past the extremely disturbing parts and see the book as a whole--much like you have to do with other novels that take you someplace difficult (think McCrae's \\"The Bark of the Dogwood\\" or any of the other thought-provoking books dealing with the darker issues life has to offer). That said, \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" IS well-written and worth a shot--just don't read it right before bedtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Palapable grief","review":"This is quite an astounding book with a great premise. When Paul loses his wife Lexy in an accident and the family dog is the only witness, Paul decides to try to communicate with the dog in order to find out more about his wife.Parkhurst does a brilliant job at portraying Paul's grief and his desperation to find out more about his wife. She also chronicles the sheer darkness one experiences after a loss. Lorelei, the dog, is literally Paul's only lifeline to his wife.Where Parkhurst goes astray is in the second half of the book when Paul's search to communicate with the dog brings him into contact with a psychic and an underground dog linguist group. This stretches the imgination and distracts from Paul's struggles.Still a beautiful book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad and emotional book","review":"I read The Dogs of Babel in two days. It is about a man who suffered the loss of his wife who fell out of a tree in his backyard with his dog as the only witness to her death. As a reader, you will sincerely connect with the characters and feel for Paul. This book really touched my heart. It is interesting, sad, funny at times, and a great read in general. The plot may seem outlandish, a man trying to teach his dog to talk, but it is his desperation and need to find solace that touched me so deeply. I would definately recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dog","review":"I rarely review books on Amazon, or anywhere else, but this book is so bad, I felt obligated to warn people. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are poorly drawn and tedious, and the prose is alternately banal and pretentious. How did this book get so many good reviews? A cult that mutilates dogs in an effort to get them to talk? A woman who climbs a tree and jumps out of it as a way of killing herself? The stupid trip to Disney World. The paper mache mask nonsense. The silliness about rearranging the books. The whole thing with the psychic. Silly, boring and utterly uncompelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't \\"get it!\\"","review":"Two stars instead of one, simply because the grammer and punctuation is decent. Perhaps I'm unable to suspend disbelief long enough to wrap my brain around this story--because I'm befuddled by all the glowing reviews this book has received. The characters seemed under-developed (what's the deal with Lexy's rage?). If she was so unstable, how could Paul be completely oblivious? The secret society and dog mutillation was ridiculously unnecessary--why it was thrown into the story at all is inexplicable to me. Very bizarre, indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horribly conceived book","review":"Come on people, don't you want even a little more from your reading experience than this load of sentimental nonsense? Terrible characters (especially Lexy, who never comes across as a real person -- too plucky and kooky by half), and a horrible plot involving Frankenstein-ian surgeries on dogs to get them to speak like humans. Read the review below written by a medical doctor if you don't believe me -- what happens in this plot is incredible and gross and silly. I never got a sense that the narrator felt much for his dog, and I could care less about how his wife did herself in (I could see the answer to this question coming a mile away -- all those 'kooky' little character traits. So irritating). One of the worst plots I've read in a long time, a close second to 'Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell', but mercifully much shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"must have missed it.....","review":"I almost didn't finish this book. I was disappointed because of the lack of development of the characters and it felt like the author was trying to herd cats with as many directions the story traveled. The way it was written gave me the impression that the author was just trying too hard to make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: DEEPLY DISTURBING TO ANIMAL LOVERS","review":"If you're an animal lover who is repulsed by scenes of animal cruelty, avoid this book at all costs. Although it's billed as a moving novel about grief and the bonds of love, those themes are overshadowed by the graphic (although highly implausible) theme of surgical animal mutilation. The animal cruelty that you dismiss as only a passing reference at the beginning of the book blossoms into a critical plot point that made me want to vomit with disgust. I couldn't sleep after I read it.Can't stand reading about the occasional animal-cruelty story in the newspaper? Do yourself a favor and skip this book: there are plenty of similar novels out there that won't turn your stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babel, Babel","review":"The book is OK, wouldn't recommend it. It's a nice love story between husbad and wife and, of course, the dog. The dog cruelty is upsetting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"I really like this novel. Even though the part about talking dogs is quite weird. Lexy would be the ideal wife... if she could just keep herself together :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst books I have ever read","review":"This book represented everything I hate in a book. First, the writing was terrible: it was hollow, the author asked rhetorical questions, she answered rhetorical questions, and the characters congratulated each other on the depth of their wisdom (which is really the wisdom, or lack of it, of the author). Second, the plot was about a person who suffered the kind of \\"tragedy\\" that most people will have to face sometime in their lives, in fact many times in their lives, but the book portrayed this as something greater and rarer than that. At least the dog didn't learn how to talk. That would have been unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but I really, really didn't. The premise is interesting - it sounded a bit John Irving-esque - but the execution was just bad. Though this is purportedly a love story, the characters are flat and lifeless, and I felt no empathy for them or their story. The character of Lexy appeared to be trying too hard (I think I met her in a women's studies class in college). And I felt as though the author was terribly manipulative in the way in which she described the relationship between the couple. None of it seemed real. I kept waiting, but the book never really got worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A shot to the gut","review":"Stylistically, this book reminded me a lot of The Lovely Bones. However, The Lovely Bones took a couple weeks of gestation to really start to appreciate it, whereas this book pretty much hit me from the start. This is one of the saddest books I have ever read, and while I think anyone who has ever loved will find the heartbreak in this book wrenching, those who are married will find it nearly unbearable. In a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!","review":"I finished it within 3 days, and could not let go of the characters, or my heartache, or my laughter at remember some of the lines, for weeks. THIS IS THE SIGN OF A FABULOUS BOOK! Run out and get it, curl up, read it, re-read it, and prepare yourself for true entertainment, both emotional and pleasurable."},{"rating":"2","title":"An immensely sad book","review":"What a melancholy read! Paul is a trustworthy narrator, sinking deeper and deeper into his own grief. Lexy is a natrual tragic chacracter. Both of these characters create a work of domestic bliss as well as tragedy. Not a happy read by far, this work will make you look at the secrets of married life in a new way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Mediocre","review":"The first one hundred pages were wonderful. I really enjoyed the authors writing style. I was so into it that I actually forgot that this was fiction. I was very disturbed by the discription of the Cerebus Society, the treatment of the animals, the description of Dog J, and what happens with Loreli. I felt that took away from my enjoyment of the book.This is a book that has a good concept, starts out well, but make a wrong turn in the middle that causes me to not enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This book is really good. I had to read it for school, but ended up taking it in two days. The imagery is what really makes the book so great. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real downer","review":"A friend told me this book had been on the USA Today bestseller list for a long time. Okay, so I read the blurb. A man teaching a dog to talk. I remember how much I loved Dean Koontz's Watchers and forked over way too much money. Certainly the author is skilled, but this book is not uplifting like The Lovely Bones. I can handle death, but when dogs are mutilated, I can't take it. What really haunts me is that the author probably saw an article about actual people who do these horrible things and went on to weave a fictional story about it. I know these things exist in the real world, but I don't have to read about them for entertainment. And that's why I read. Anyone else who wants a good book about dogs, if you haven't read Watchers, pick it up. It's been re-released recently. Sorry, Parkhurst, but you're off my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"After reading all the favorable reviews of this book, I was in for a nasty surprise. I was drawn into the book immediately by its interesting premise, but it wasn't long before I began to be bothered by the voice of the narrator. The story is told in an imaginative and frothy voice that I was unable to accept as the voice of a man, and this is where the book fell apart for me. By the time he started calling the psychic hotline, I gave up on the book and will not go back. Paul Iverson is the least convincing male character I have ever encountered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"The story of each of the characters, Paul, Lexy and Lorelei are tragic and heartbreaking.

I was not prepared for the absolutely preposterous story of a secret cult of dog mutilating men! These images were so disturbing and unneccessary that it was difficult to focus on what should have been a beautiful and intriguing love story. The writing was mediocre at best and at the end of the book the author was forced to tie up too many lose ends that the main character (as an intelligent Ph.D.) should have known- grief stricken or not! There were grammatical errors (You cannot \\"graduate college.\\" It is a building. IT doesn't graduate, YOU graduate from it!) and I found myself skimming just to get through it. Save yourself the nightmares."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE....","review":"I HAD \\"HEARD\\" A LOT OF GOOD REVIEWS ABOUT THIS BOOK SO I WAS QUITE ANXIOUS TO READ IT.

The main character in this book (the narrative voice in the book) is very Forrest Gump-like. Ok, perhaps 20-30 more IQ points, but similarly boring, naive, gullible, and hapless.His wife's character is revealed as somewhat complex and thus somewhat interesting, but not until after her death, and unfortunately the life-flashback portion of the book takes up half the text. While she is alive she is simply whimsical and quirky, and so, together with Forrest, their 150-or-so pages of courtship and marriage is banal, saccharine, and commonplace.The last 60 pages or so help to salvage what was at best a plodding love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dogs of Babel","review":"This appears to have been written by a high school freshman in creative writing.

The tale of a man who is so consumed with grief by her loss that he embarks on a journey to get her dog to speak the story of her death is artificially sweet at best because she is the kind of person most people avoid because she is unstable. This makes Paul unlikable because what kind of person attaches himself to a woman who is this much of a timebomb? A fine example of a book that made a strong start and just got lost in a labrynth of ludicrous twists and turns that led to a predictable and safe ending. What was supposed to be thrilling and suspensful was just plain absurd. Moreover, Paul talks and thinks like a woman. Disappointing. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, disappointing execution","review":"The idea of communication with animals is one that resonated with this reader. Unfortunately, as some others have attested, the character of the dog in this novel is much more sympathetic than those of the humans. Lexy, the narrator's wife, was a whiny, irrational and frustratingly self-involved character who I found it difficult to care about. The focus of the novel is on how the narrator deals with his grief over the loss of his wife, so this was a major problem.Also, there were some really nice metaphors and good, original descriptions, but the leap into \\"noir\\" halfway through the book felt forced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Haunting","review":"To say that I loved this book would be putting it mildly. The characters, the plot, and the beautiful prose of this author has been haunting me since I read it. The novel takes you on a rollercoaster ride that I did not want to get off of.Although the story line seems farfetched, in the context of the book and the characters it truly did seem believable.I would highly recommend this book, but not to those who cannot handle something of this dark of nature or someone who is grieving the loss of a loved one. It is a very deep novel and it seems to stick with its readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read about the premise of this book and couldn't wait to read it. It dragged for me. It would have been so much better as a murder mystery where that is actually solved by something that results from Paul's effort with Lorelei. The character of the husband was sympathetic but the wife came off as a fruitcake. The writing itself is nice, just the plot needed some more twists and turns. You could see the kidnapping coming the minute the kidnapper excuses himself, it was so predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I usually hate books that are self-consciously quirky, and so I approached this book with some trepidation. The first few chapters took my breath away, however, and I rushed headlong into it, believing that Parkhurst was a major new talent, and that the quirky elements of the story really served a purpose. Unfortunately, the book does not live up to its dazzling beginning. Just when the depth and complexity of the characters should have been revealed and explored, Parkhurst instead gives us inane plot developments and girlish whimsy. What a disappointment. The \\"girly\\" voice really became irritating as the book wore on -- by the end, the narrator felt more like a fourteen year old girl than the middle-aged man he was supposed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused effort","review":"The Dogs of Babel offers readers an interesting premise--training a dog to master human language--and some potentially interesting characters; however Carolyn Parkhurst is not up to the task. The novel suffers from pedestrian prose, uneven characterization, and (in ironic harmony with the deceased wife, Lexy) an identity crisis. The writer can't seem to decide what the story should be, a mystery-romance or a Garpian satire. There are a few moments of wonderful lucidity in which the prose shines and the story compels, but such moments stand in stark contrast to the mostly limp prose of the narrator and the split-personality of the plot. Perhaps Parkhurst should write short stories exclusively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange story","review":"I'll cut to the chase. This book quickly reminded me why I don't read fiction anymore.

The author's dark side is scary -- that she would utilize animal cruelty of the most evil kind imaginable (not once, but twice) to sell books makes me frightened she is on the streets. This is gratuitous violence at its worst.I checked this book out of a library, so am certainly glad I didn't give this person a dime of my money. I was ready to toss it mid-book, but felt, to be fair, I would see if the author had any purpose for the cruelty to the dogs in her story and if the merits of the book could redeem her choice to write about such depravity.

Just disappointing for this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been so much more","review":"Entertaining? Yes. Fulfilling? No.While I read it in one sitting, I felt denied and hungry at the conclusion. There were intriguing and thought-provoking phrases attributed to both Paul and Lexy. It was a wonderful trip through their romance. But I found myself longing for more substance, less fluff. I expected more on the \\"teach Lorelei to speak\\" angle, but that, too, proved empty.Don't waste your time, speedread this book, if you read it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"High And Dry","review":"This is a book that did not deliver. Like a sincere but inept lover, it will leave you high and dry. The plot was too vague and too timid. It is if the writer wasn't sure what to do with the story after the premise was established - turn it into a murder mystery or a soul-searching odyssey. In the end neither was served up adequately to the reader. Nevertheless, the book is not without charms. The description of the dog is sweet, funny and very realistic. Dog lovers and pet owners will be tickled."},{"rating":"2","title":"talented author","review":"Carolyn Parkhurst uses a great vocabulary.This book is one i'm going to want to read time and time again.It was a very sad book from the begining, but it was a great read.

The husband is so desperate for the dog to tell him what happened, he embarks on a journey to teach the dog to speak. This is a unique story, to be sure. But not only is the premise preposterous, the ending is a true disappointment. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say I find it seriously annoying when I spend hours and hours reading a book, and only at the end discover the resolution of the mystery required a tidbit of information the author held back merely to encourage you to read the book. I'll compare how I felt at the end of this book to the following example: when I read a murder mystery and I'm introduced to several suspects, but at the end of the book I find out the murderer was someone never introduced in the story before then - a surprise character added at the end. That's how I felt at the end of \\"Dogs of Babel\\" - manipulated and irritated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to Stop Reading","review":"Sorry to report that I had recommended this book to our club for a January 05 discussion. As a dog lover I had to close the book when I reached pages 178-179 because the author felt describing animal torture was suddenly needed to keep this story alive. My attention had begun to wane before page 178, but getting there nailed it for me. I have decided to not finish the book and will urge my club at next week's meeting to make another selection. Good effort Mrs. Parkhurst, but your future projects will not be found on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning- Animal Abuse!","review":"I was extremely disappointed in and disgusted by this book! I felt misled by the book jacket description, and was horrified to discover I was reading a book about animal abuse! I found it very upsetting, and I would NEVER have purchased this book had I known that it would take such a twisted turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising Premise - Boring Book","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. It was so boring I put it down for three days - I tried to start reading it again and just couldn't bear the boredom. I skimmed through the last half and was compelled to write this review. This book gets my vote for the \\"Most Boring Book With the Most Promising Premise\\". In other words: Steer clear of this book unless you are having trouble sleeping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, disgusting trash.","review":"A horrible, disgusting book that includes torturing dogs. I threw my copy in the trash after I got to the descriptions of basement surgery on dogs. Too bad trees were destroyed for this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read","review":"Having a Minor in Lit, I have read lots of books. Having purchased many, many books, I have never felt the desire to write a scathing review of a book. I HATED this book.If you HATE animals or get some weird enjoyment over the gross abuse of animals this is the book for you. Once that part of the book began to develop, I really could care less about why this woman killed herself. I could go on and on but this book is not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Please...don't buy this book. Save your money. I read this book because I am a dog lover. I thought there might be something sympathetic in the story, but there is nothing. This is an awful book...all about a woman who is manically depressed, but no one recognizes it. I can't begin to comprehend why the Today Show would recommend this book as a highlight of its book club. The author must have a very powerful agent. I highly respect Little Brown as a publisher, but I can't imagine why they wasted paper for this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a better book.","review":"I don't understand the glowing reviews for this book. The characters are contrived (Lexi, mysterious woman marries Paul,divorced professor) and uninteresting. Lexi somehow convinces Paul to drive 2 days to Disney for their first date (first hint that this book wasn't going to be believable). We never learn much about the backgrounds or motivations of either character. I wanted the author to flesh out these people -- what brought Lexi to her depresssions? What were her outbursts about? We never really understand Lexi because it is written from the male perspective. Then there is the subplot of an underground talking dog society which grossly abuses dogs --- not worth the paper it took to print. And who would believe that Paul would leave his beloved dog in the backyard after meeting up with these creeps? It was a quick read, but still a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Lovers Beware","review":"This book pulled unexpected emotions from me including full blown rage towards one of the main characters. His blindness in the face of trying to uncover the secret of his wife's death includes an act of such insensitive stupidity I wanted to jump into the pages and rescue the long-suffering Lorelei. I understand the point of exposing the animal abusers as a plot device but I think the author went overboard with the sacrifice Lorelei is required to make. It could have been made with less obvious drama and brutality.My sympathies for Paul's grief remained acute until this pivotal act. From there, it dissipated to the point of disgust.Enter this book at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unpleasant Experience!","review":"What are publishers thinking? ARE publishers thinking?Paul, the main character, has no character. He loves his wife... that's who he is. She is troubled and clearly needs therapy.The writing is somewhat tedious (do I need a paragraph to tell me they say hello to each other when he comes home?) and the book is quite sentimental, except for the dog abuse, which is horrific. I wish I could wash the book out of my mind.I have given it two stars because she defined his first wife's self-obsessed ways beautifully, having her say something like: \\"I have repeatedly asked you not to leave your dirty coffee cup on the table and you have ignored my needs and wishes.\\"Possibly the writer will grow now that she is a published author (obviously most people here disagree with me).Hug your dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally Honest? If You're a Zombie","review":"This book is, quite frankly, overhyped. It's a fast, light read, yes, but the narrator is cardboard, and I don't buy that his disconnectedness is due to grief. Paul doesn't know his wife at all, and while that is part of the point, the book relies more on plot surprises than the deep character revelation that makes a book literary. Check it out of the library, but don't shell out the cash for hardback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transported","review":"I so enjoyed this read. I could not put it down until I'd learned the secret of what happened. Lorelei the dog is a wonderful character and I lived that she acted always as a dog would. It was a sorrowful and thought-provoking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in between book..","review":"I read this book in a day. I have a stack of books that I want/need to read but happened to pick up this book and couldn't put it down until I was done. It is not very believable and the characters do/say things that are not believable but it's not all bad. Need something to read on a long plane ride? A beach weekend? Pick up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I literally just finished reading this book (and drying my tears) and felt compelled to add to the many comments here because this book is amazing; so unexpectedly interesting and emotionally wrenching. Such a simple story that I never thought would affect me the way it has. The New York Times called it a \\"captivatingly strange book\\" and I think that is a perfect description, it's like nothing I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The male narration sinks this novel","review":"Ultimately, this clever idea fails to go beyond just an idea; and the great pace and writing of the first 30 pages dissipates. Others have commented on the play of the arrangement of books on the shelves at the narrator's home, and I agree that it comes across as forced. The caper with the underground dog people is a silly and belongs in a different novel. But what really brings this novel down is the \\"male\\" narration which is never male enough to deal with the female lead, Lexi. Paul admires her in the way that a woman wants a man to admire her, and not the way a man would. Save your money and buy the used copies. There will be enough of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barking up the wrong tree","review":"Intriguing premise, some good prose and imagination, nicely paced, but ultimately a disappointment. Once you get to the parts with an underground cult in suburbia (who just happened to live in the same neighborhood as the protagonist) doing mutilation surgeries on dogs to try to get them to speak English, a television psychic who takes copious notes of all her conversations for the book she's writing (who'd read that one?), and a PhD in Linguistics who is about as bright as a blown light bulb. Similar in tragic tone to \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" but without all the humor. My advice: speed-read through all the Dogs Hooked on Phonics stuff, and you'll finish in half the time and may be moved a bit by dysfunctional people meeting in mid-life and trying to overcome their psychological issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just gross","review":"I somehow always end up reading books that leave me disturbed - and, while many people will disagree with me, that is not an emotion I particularly enjoy. ( I probably should read these reviews before I pick up the books!) Anyway, this book was no exception. While the premise sounds kind of interesting and mysterious, it really is a warped book. Unless you enjoy getting new, repulsive ideas (say, perhaps, you can't get enough from the newspaper)I'd suggest that you skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"derivative and not well characterized","review":"I felt like I was reading a sophomoric version of An Accidental Tourist by Anne Tyler. Unfortunately, this book utterly lacked the depth and originality of Accidental Tourist. The protagonist is supposed to be a professor of linguistics who has written multiple textbooks. Nothing in his voice or his understanding of language would suggest that he has even broken open one linguistics text, let alone authored one. The inaccuracies about language acquisition were appalling, the premise was silly, and the characters were not credible. A boring book, only to be read if you have nothing else to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hank the Talking Head; not much more","review":"I'm mostly disappointed with this video. A good 80% of the video time is simply a close-up of Hank Reinhardt's face, as he talks to a point a few feet to the side of the camera. Another 10% is made up of pans across still images from historical drawings. The remaining video time is actual live action. What Hank is saying is usually interesting... but considering how little sword use they actually shot, I'm left wondering: Why didn't he just write a book with this material?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Quality","review":"I already owned the VHS version of this film and expected the DVD to be of equal or better quality. I was wrong. The picture was blurred; the color was worse; and the sound was constantly adjusting up and down.There was a long period of blackness; then, the movie suddenly arrived. My first thought was, \\"This is horrible!\\" The sound was garbled and the picture was so dark and blurred.How sad that this film was not properly restored, before someone made a bad copy for DVD. What does 'Digitally Remastered' mean...Make a bad copy of a good, old film?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Presentation","review":"The Jungle Book is a wonderful movie, in beautiful technicolor, that deserves a much better presentation than this DVD.The movie is so bright that one can barely see that it is in color and barely tell what is happening in the movie. I was able to make it watchable by drastically changing the brightness and color controls on my TV, and then it had nowhere near the color and clarity that I had seen when the movie played recently on TCM.If you are not comfortable changing these controls, don't buy this version of the movie.This movie deserves a much better treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO ADAPTERS","review":"It's pictured with adapters, but when they ship it, there are NO ADAPTERS...then the replacements come, and STILL NO ADAPTERS..."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT DOESN'T COME WITH THE NOKIA ADAPTERS","review":"I order this item and when it arrived I complaint with Amazon because it doesnt come with the Nokia adapters. They said sorry sorry sorry, I reorder and again it doesnt come with the adapters so I think that this product has a bad description. In the Coby web page this product is listed as CVM153 not CVM155 so this is an Amazon scam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences","review":"There should be a table of contents of this book on theweb. If I had known it, I would not have ordered this book.The title and the contents of this book are really mismatching. I thought the book was about more practical applications of quantitative research methods to the social sciences. In reality, however, the book is about elementary-level statistics assisted by a simple computer software, accompanied by an introduction to social research methodology."},{"rating":"1","title":"still haven't received order","review":"It has been several weeks now, and I haven't received this book. My class is almost over, and it will be worthless to me by the time it arrives---if it arrives.

Again, unfortunately, it was published in 1999 and the information on the use of Excel was not applicable to 2007. In addition, the content was not easy to follow. The feedback from other classmates was similiar to my experience. By the way this was for a graduate course.OH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, even to the experts","review":"We used this textbook in a quantitative research methods course, and it was not fun. The professor, who has a doctorate in statistics and works in stats every day actually told us not to read certain chapters because they were confusing. She provided alternative materials.I am also very expert at using Excel, but I found Black's Excel exercises to be difficult to follow and poorly set up.If you have another alternative, I'd opt for that instead of Black."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made","review":"I purchased the Oster Fast Speed Clipper through Amazon after much research & many reviews.My husband has very short hair & trims it perhaps every three weeks or so. The first time he used the clipper , the 1/4 inch guide snapped in two! Thinking that it was just one of those things & probably a fluke, I purchsed this set. Again, he used the 1/4 inch guide (twice this time) & it snapped in two! Unbelievable.In retrospect, we should have just got an \\"off-the shelf\\" trimmer at Wal-Mart.

I really only use one of the guides but it is worth buying the others to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish","review":"The writing is the worst I have seen in any published book, it reads like a high school paper. I could not get through this book so cannot comment on the plot.Edit: Other reviewers note that it was self-published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow","review":"A more meaningless, pointless and badly written book I haven't come across. Utter lack of depth to the characters and storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book.","review":"The book just isn't good. The writing is atrocious, plot and characters are the same. The style of writing is the worst part. Be wary of the good reviews, they all say the same thing but it seems like a bit of lie considering what they say and what is real."},{"rating":"1","title":"a complete waste of time.","review":"Reads like a poor outline of a b rated movie. All meaningless action with no planning or direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"It appears that someone took a game of D&D and tried to write a story from it. The charactors wish they had even two dimensions. Poorly written tripe. Those giving this five stars must be in the employ of the publisher. and any publisher who would waste paper on this is suspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"The storyline is the only thing that is worth anything in the book. It is a very tedeous read, almost painful. There is no clear end to the book. If you want the adventures of the a teenage D&D game with the play by play this is your book. But if not... Well, just skip it and do yourself a favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly bad fiction","review":"Don't waste your time, don't waste your money, don't waste the space on your Kindle. Really. The story line is horribly repetitive. The protagonist spends most of his time going from Inn to Inn, bargaining for a room and taking baths. Any action or fighting is dry and lacking in imagination. I never did figure out what the actual conflict was. Not only is the protagonist a boring idiot, but really... he gets zapped to a new land and doesn't spend ANY time worrying about those he left on Earth?I am an English teacher. Every year my students write short fiction that is much on par with this novel. Oh- did I mention that I teach 7th grade? Same confusing tense shifts, lack of creative tag lines and descriptors, and so on.I can't even begin to tell you what a waste of time this is. What amazes me is there are actually several more books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor execution of scenes","review":"While the premise of the book is of interest, the scenes in the book are very linear. The sub-plots resolve very simply, without any buildup of tension. If you think about, say, the LOTR trilogy, every scene is imbued with its own level of complexity and anticipation. That this book is meant for younger readers is not a worthy defense - the Percy Jackson/ Olympians series is sophisticated enough to attract older audiences as well. Usage of the present tense also makes reading challenging, without delivering any side benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst fantasy novel I have ever read!","review":"From the spectacularly cheesy and predictable storyline, to the unbearably irritating third-person present tense style of writing, this book was actually painful to read. I found myself silently cheering for any of the enemies James encounters in his 'adventure' to kill him and end all of our misery. The author could do with the services of a decent editor, as well - the misspelled words and incorrect homonyms were very distracting, although a pleasant diversion from the tragically awful storytelling.I urge any reader interested in reading a _good_ novel in the genre to stick with the far better Raymond Feist and David Eddings. At any rate, I paid nothing to read this book on my Kindle, thankfully. I definitely got my money's worth with this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spell-check no substitute for editing","review":"I have been reading the Morcyth Saga books along with my 13-year-old son. We both are enjoying the story line. However, the text is riddled with errors that appear to be the result of relying on spell-check instead of actual proofreading or editing. This does not serve to help teenagers struggling with spelling to get a better grasp of what is correct. Further, some of the words are misused (again, a spell-check artifact). For example, \\"empirical soldiers\\" is used, when \\"imperial soldiers\\" should have been. Look up both adjectives, and you may burst out laughing. The list goes on, but you get the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errm","review":"If this was written by a High School Senior that took notes while playing a linear RPG (Say, Heroes of Might and Magic) and then put his notes into a book, this is what you would have. I can almost imagine the \\"pick how you would respond/reply to this situation\\" on screen. Do you A) go get help to get the cat from the roof (it's in there, yes, page 190), B) Help the kids throw rocks at the cat, or C) Scold the kids for being immoral and attempt to rescue the cat yourself. If you chose C, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man from Earth brought in to rescue an alien world","review":"This appears to be the very first book of a long series. The magic is good, and it can be exhausting...possibly even fatal. The main key to magic seems to be being able to visualize clearly what you want it to do, which means a bit of understanding of science goes a long way...probably why the main character was brought in in the first place since science is pretty rare on the planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, better writing needed.","review":"I really enjoyed the story in the Unsuspecting Mage - but dear me, the writing was, well, terrible. I wondered at one point if it had been written by a teenager. Sentences switched tenses mid-stream, which made me wild. Which sucked, because it was a good story. I'll try the next book with the hope that the writer matured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing a little Je ne sais quoi","review":"The plot got better over time, but in many places I found it to be lacking. It seems like the work of someone who hasn't quite figured out the intricacies of what detail needs to be included and what detail can be left out. He just didn't push far enough. There are some details that really didn't make a whole lot of sense either, such as how a main character with the particular set of experiences and attributes that James had could know and accomplish some of the things he did, even if he did read a lot of fantasy books.I'd say this makes for a mediocre book for middle school students. With some more practice perhaps Pratt could go somewhere, but this didn't really hit the mark.*Re-posted from goodreads.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Printed Video Game","review":"This book is like a video game. It has a simple, one dimensional world that vaguely resembles medieval Europe. The main character (I wont call him a hero as others have), James, is a seventeen year old boy from our modern world who suddenly finds himself in this strange land to which he adapts instantly. He never gets homesick, almost never shows any emotions, even when killing people by the dozens.James has magical powers in this world which he uses like a video game player: to kill, maim, destroy, blow up and set fire to things. He goes out of his way to constantly put himself in dangerous situations so he can have the fun of killing a bunch of people. And then the book just stops. I wont say ends, because in a novel that implies resolution of the major conflicts in the story. There is no resolution of anything, we are left hanging like a TV show that ends with \\"To Be Continued\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad people!!!!!","review":"Ok I have just read some nasty comments!!!I personally liked this book.The beginning is very slow, didn't know if I was going to be able to get into the book but it did take off.I ended buying all the ebooks in this series and he is now starting on a second series with same characters so will be waiting for it also.thxs for the free ebook Mr. Pratt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great start for the set","review":"This is a great read and I was very happy about the thought that went in to the story.

I had no idea that he would flip over it! Talk about a great choice! I can't give you an idea about what its about, except to say a 14 yr old really loved it and is going to read all of them....so if your child is into fantasy computer games and books, magic etc, this book will win their heart.Some books that worked too, which I was amazed at, because they were popular with kids long ago were the original Tom Swift adventure set, all are good, here are a few:Tom Swift: Seeking the Platinum Treasure: Swift by Name and Swift by Nature!Tom Swift: Adventures on the Road: Swift by Name and Swift by Nature!Tom Swift and his Mastery of the Sky: Swift by Name and Swift by Nature!Keep reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollicking adventure","review":"A truely fun novel beginning I hope a great fantasy series.

Please hurry with Book Two!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I am 11 years old and my mom bought me this book after I nagged at her for awhile. I loved it. The action was cool and the way James and Miko get into all sorts of situations is exciting. They make me laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"The kind of book you just love to reed because it is fun, entertaining, and straight forward.The book follows the adventure of James. A regular guy in his late teens reluctantly going to an interview and finding his true passion: MAGIC, REAL MAGIC! The only catch is: he may have to pay for it with his very own life.Launched on a path without knowing the target, He is now forced to complete an unknown task directed only by little pieces of information in a world where He absolutely ignores everything but language.The book follows the usual path of an RPG, preparing you for the rest of the series (Morcyth Saga).The book is not \\"a classic\\", but it is, obviously, not intended as one. If you are looking for something light, fun, and addictive you should definitely give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read in present tense","review":"This book read like a grocery list. Go to store, pick up rock. Throw rock at bad guys. There was nothing memorable about this book. I'd give the writer credit for completing a novel, except it doesn't feel like anything was accomplished by this book. Usually when a book is a series,when it one book ends something get resolved. This booked ended with no questions being answered, no idea where the next book is heading. While not all series books do stand on their own at least they feel like a complete novel, not a half finished book.I would be curious as to where the author is from, because the spells in the book are supposed to rhyme and they do not to my ears. One line has steel trying to rhyme with kill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Suffice to say I didn't like 'The Unsuspecting Mage' very much and promptly returned it.

There was bad use and awkward switching of tense, along with spelling and grammatical errors throughout. The story premise could be good, but the execution just didn't make it. It's a prime example of how important it is to have good proofreading/editing. I'm glad this was a free Kindle download. Even though I am a bit curious how things work out, I won't be paying for or reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Felt Cheated","review":"Had I actually paid for this, I would have definitely felt cheated. As others have already said, this reads like a transcription of a game -- the reader can only follow along and not actually participate. Mostly, though, I thought it was more a travelogue than a story about a mage.The passive present tense was jarring, until I figured out that this was a game -- and even then, I did not care for that style. The whole thing cries out for proofreading and editing.I have the impression that any follow-on episodes will be more of the same. There is probably one good book's worth of story in all the episodes, but the first part was so non-engaging that I'll not be joining in on the rest of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it...","review":"I could not finish this book. Believe me I tried. Usually I can force myself through a book. Sometimes I continue reading when everything in me says MOVE ON and I'm rewarded but honestly I couldn't talk myself into finishing it. Maybe there's plot eventually. I have no idea. I read about 60% of this book. All that I read of it was the main character traveling and then fighting battles he shouldn't be able to survive and yet somehow does, then he travels some more, gets into some more craziness he shouldn't get out of alive and then more traveling. None of it seems to have a purpose. It's just walk walk walk and then fight fight fight. It felt like a dungeon crawler video game. No real purpose. Just walking and killing. I have no clue why this has so many good reviews. I'd think maybe it gets better in the end except so many people feel the exact same way I did that I have to say I must be right and it's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Potential With A Lot of Heart","review":"When I first decided to read this book, it was based on the author's voice, because he said that he was skipping over chapters in a particularly popular book. I can only think that he was talking about Harry Potter. I too, wished for Potter to be a bit more dark than it was, so the idea that an older version (Older meaning High School Senior) book was on the rise was very interesting to me. It was definitely not anything like Harry Potter, but the book was simple, and an easy read and I did enjoy it. I give it 4 starts instead of 3, because I think it was a good attempt and I appreciate when someone tries to execute something with their own passion through their heart. I think if anything, that shines through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got it for free, and now I think he should pay ME.","review":"I stuck with this book for quite a while after I got it for free in the I-tunes library. After reading almost 200 pages without any direction or story line I walked away. I only stuck with it thinking there had to be a direction eventually, a plot line eventually. It hasn't gotten there yet. I charge $90 an hour for my time, I want my $135. Had I paid I would demand my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"None","review":"This book should never have been published. There's a reason it's free!

If you prefer immersing yourself in an author's world where the scenery is vivid, and characters have more personality - then this is not the book for you.The good:The most descriptive scenes involve food and/or drink.The bad:Lack of character development.The story really didn't go beyond traveling from point A to B to C, and all the meals in between.Feels like it was written directly from someone's D&D; campaign."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Unsuspecting Reader","review":"*YAWN* Do yourself a favor and delete it before you even download it. It's that bad.It is nothing more than the transcript of a computer RPG play-through. There is no plot. There is no story. There is, however, lots of boring repetitive traipsing through the realm in search of . . . what? Who knows.The story *might* have been improved if it came with an MP3 of the sounds of D&D; dice being rolled--just for background ambiance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not enjoying it","review":"I find the premise of the story to be an interesting one, but am not enjoying the quality of the writing. It reads more like an outline than a fully fleshed novel. Or perhaps fan fiction written by a middle schooler. The characters are not well developed, and the story is rather unimaginative and repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"I tried reading this book, but just could not get into it. The storyline itself sounded like maybe it was a new spin on a well known Fantasy formula, but it was just the same old stuff. The writing is amateurish. And just as the other reviewers wrote, the author does more telling than showing.And that makes for a very boring book. (Sorry)I really wanted to like this one, but I just couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but...","review":"This book sucks, I could go into more detail, but it's not worth my time. Extremely poorly written, reading it was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ungood","review":"Even for free, it's overpriced.Calling this bad doesn't cut it. Bad implies that it would have had to work at being bad. This? It's just so immature that it comes across as the literary equal of vomit thrown on a page. It doesn't even deserve to be called bad, just ungood. It's a completely unthought out and bland description for a unthought out and bland attempt.Skip this title and watch paint dry for a more rewarding time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Lord, how dull.","review":"In a world full of wonderful books, I will not waste my time with this one. It's as if you're at a wonderful desert table with a chocolate fountain and unbelievable cakes and candies, and you choose to eat a stale wafer cookie.It's narrated as if you're watching a old educational video, dialogue that was totally out of style 50 years ago. What is with the weird use of present tense? And the weird absence of use of contractions? What teenage boy says \\"I did not know him well, but he was well liked by everyone.\\"? The whole thing has the effect of distancing the reader from the characters altogether. It's as if all the characters are on very heavy doses of anti psychotic drugs, totally flat affect and super super superficial. I cannot stress enough what rubbish this book is. That there are apparently 5 books in this series already completely boggles the mind. Who buys this rubbish? What moron in the publishing house sent this through?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I really enjoyed this book, I loved the characters! It was well written with just enough balance! I loved this book so much i went on to read the rest of the series, Now i am waiting for the next installment!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hrmm.","review":"This is the first book I'm actually reading on my new Kindle. I am having huge issues dealing with the physical grammar of this book. Throughout the first half of this book (I'm exactly half way through now) the author cannot quite figure out which tense he wants to write in .. which is grossly distracting. It also has a number of spots of incorrect word use (which actually renders one sentence literal gibberish .. it just doesn't parse) that I can't quite attribute to publishing typos.Mostly I'm finding the writing is getting in the way of the story/plot .. or lack thereof. Like the other non-five-star reviewers here, I find the yarn basically lacking from the typical literary fantasy fiction standard I'm quite accustomed to reading. Its merely tolerable because it was free; I'd be seriously put out if I'd purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The Unsuspecting Mage is totally and completely unreadable. The characters act and talk like cheesy cartoons. Pratt's writing IS horrible. Do yourself a favor and skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great find!!!!","review":"This book is terrific. i just couldnt put it down. i highly recommend you read this book. you wont be dissappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have not reached puberty yet this might appeal to you.","review":"Maybe I'm just to old but this book just seemed to be rambling on and on never going anywhere. I think the only female interaction was a princess smiled across the room. But D&D never was one of my favorites. I think the comments about the food in every pub they stopped at was about the only sensual appeal to the whole book. As far as the \\"Mage\\" his magical abilities were limited by his lack of insight as he stumbled from one thing to the other. If you have time you want to totally waste then this book is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some easy things that could have been fixed","review":"This is yet another two star review. I am reading the first two installments because I am a gourmand reader, not a gourmet reader. I will not address critiques I have read that characterize the story as one dimensional D&D adventure. I will simply state that the writing is so bad that it interferes with the story. Misused language. Story goes back and forth between third person present tense (which grates on me anyway) and third person past tense, sometimes in the same sentence. Mr. Pratt, you don't \\"make due,\\" you \\"make do.\\" Please find an editor. I can't believe this was ever edited at all. It wouldn't take that much work to fix these simple issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get an editor","review":"Imagine a 15-year-old nerd recording his role playing game and then publishing it without any rewriting, editing, or even a literate adult's proof reading. That, in Pratt's terms, is what you have to \\"make due [sic] with\\" in this book. I found the lack of editing so frustrating it was hard to pay attention to the mediocre story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh","review":"So I am all of maybe 10 pages into this book and I just can't force myself to read it. It is written like a trashy romance novel. The dialog is very poor, and the narrative bland and stilted. I believe I written essays in middle school with more pep than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept poor execution","review":"I liked the concept of the book however, the author lacks the skill to keep the readers attention for either the storyline. Read only if you are desperate for fantasy style adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, present tense rubbish","review":"I tried to read and like this. The basic idea sounded good, a teenager fumbles his way to becoming a wizard in an alternate world, BUT the thing is written in the present tense. Personally, I hate that. You read lines like \\"He washes his hands\\" or \\"As he walks along, he stubs his toe and he falls.\\" It's like reading a narration, and it's unpleasant in the extreme. I found the dialog to be weak, I thought the characters were a little flat and all in all, I thought it read like something from an inexperienced 7th grader might have written for a school project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"Really. really bad writing - the whole thing was written in the present tense. \\"He gets up. He drinks some ale.\\" I couldn't finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same content, no past or future tenses","review":"This book has an interesting premise, however it fails to deliver a story that carries the reader away into another land. The primary problem is that is does not use past or future tense. Also, several times words have been confused such as effect and affect. Like several other reviews have said, it sounds like a transcription of a D&D game that has been thrown together into a \\"book\\" without any proofreading or editing to make it interesting. The author clearly has a nice idea, but a horrible implementation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average story, awkward writing","review":"The glowing 5 star reviews are likely fake. I'm not sure I'll even finish it. The plot is pretty standard (\\"boy tricked into entering a magical world\\"), but the writing is not very good. An actual quote: \\"His eyes start to water and can barely breathe.\\" Another: \\"They stroll down the street eating their tarts, when James sees coming down the street toward them, a group of boys a little older than Miko.\\" I realize the author self-published, but I think he should at least find a literary friend to proofread his work. I'm just glad I got a free e-book and not a hardcover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Published","review":"All of the one star reviews have covered all the relevant points in regards to a reading of the book. I should have read these reviews before wasting time downloading. Like others, I am happy I didn't spend money on it. However, a few reviewers feel the need to congratulate Mr. Pratt on having at least been published. Then they wonder about what the publisher was thinking. Let me clear this up for you. Mr. Pratt is Mr. Pratt's publisher. It says so right on his own website. Apparently, he's his own editor as well, and he knows no more about editing than he does about writing. It is hard enough to find good books these days without free crap like this getting in the way of the search. If it was possible to give this book negative stars, I would do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother to download","review":"I downloaded this book because I thought the storyline sounded fun. I forced myself to read 4 chapters, hoping that it would improve. Other reviewers thought it read like a D&D Campaign. I've never had the opportunity to play D&D so I can't compare it to that. Personally, I thought it was like one of the old \\"Choose Your Own Adventure\\" books without the fun of choosing what happens next. I feel bad for those of you that paid for the book. I downloaded it free for my Kindle and am really glad I didn't pay good money for a bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"reads like a beginner writer","review":"Very hard to follow. Very choppy written.Rough around the edges. The story has potential given a few more rewrites and thought for a more smoother flow of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Well, I was really looking forward to reading this, it had me written all over it, \\"do you love books? Become the hero of your own story\\" it was a bookworms dream. Sadly it fell short of the mark, yes it had all the right ideas and by the book but it lacked draw and imagination. I couldn't picture the world I couldnt see myself as any of the characters and it bored me.This could be because the author always used third person view for the main character, it made it impersonal and didn't feel as though you were part of the story.Sadly this is one of the books I never finished, I couldn't, so maybe it does get better but life's not worth reading boring books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, Great Series","review":"I'm surprised by the poor reviews here. I purchased this book on my Nook Color and I enjoyed it immensely. Some people may be put off by the style of writing used by the author, but I loved it. This first book is, in essence, a first person tale of guy learning to cope with a crazy situation. I was personally enthralled by the story. I couldn't put it down. Once I finished it, I promptly ordered the next book. And so on, until I finished the series. Very good story here, that sets up a very good series."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun to read","review":"I normally do not write reviews on books, but I felt this needed it. I agree the editing was terrible. I enjoyed the plot. Someone said they enjoyed that this did not have multiple plot lines. I thought it unusual that the character acutually accepted what was happening to him. He does not try to change the world but work with it. I am looking forward to buying the remaining books. I can\`t wait to find out what happened to all of the minor characters and of course the main one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other reviews are accurate","review":"I'm glad authors can self publish & find their audience using ebooks. I'm not going to vituperate a self published author for making it easy to find out if I like their work.This book inspired me to learn how to purge books from my kindle archive. Go to amazon.com/myk and use the \\"actions\\" pull down on the right to make sure a book no longer shows up in the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"no depth","review":"As everyone says, since this was a freebie so I decided to give it a try. The storyline sounded interesting. Unfortunately, the characters were very 2 dimensional. The main charactor, James, seemed to just meander along from place to place with no goal or idea except to do \\"what feels right\\". Other than that all he and Miko does is fight off bad guys and eat one meal after another.With lots of irrelevant observations.The other annoying thing was, although for young adults, the writing was so simplistic that if not for all the fighting would be more for an elemantary student. Talk about dummying down for the reader! Definately no challenge.Needless to say I will not be reading anymore from this series and probably won't give the writer another try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't be paying for any more of these","review":"Well, since it was free, at least I don't have to feel cheated ;-) I definitely won't be buying any more in the series. I thought, with so many published books under his belt, that the author must be fairly talented, but his talent must lie elsewhere. I won't repeat most of the things that other reviewers have mentioned aside from the present tense of the book. I found it extremely distracting, and actually started forcing it into the past tense in my head.I agree with the other reviewers that this reads like a walkthrough of an AD&D; session with very little character development, strange/stupid reactions and lack of questioning of various events and situations, no reflection of previous events, and repetitive battle scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Linear Path","review":"This book was purportedly a novel, but was written as one short story followed by another by another with little suspense and no use of subplot. While entertaining at moments, it never fulfilled the promise of its premise nor, in fact, of being a novel at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sound D&D script","review":"This one started out with a good premise but the writing style and the linear nature of the plot didn't live up to its promise. It reads just like a gaming script which makes it a bit stilted and occasionally jars. I finished it hoping it would get better as the author got more practice but it didn't - I wouldn't recommend it and won't be going further with the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Present tense is an amateurish way to write.....","review":".....and this book reads like it was written for a high school English class. Worst book I've read in a long time.I like lots of books, especially ones written by Robin Hobb, George Martin, and Stephen Donaldson to name but three. These books were well written. This one was not. Just wondering - how many of you are still in high school yourselves?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Adventure Story","review":"I know many have rated it low because they do not like how closely it resembles different D&D; possibly story lines and the D&D; world; however, that is exactly the reason why I enjoyed this book so much. I enjoyed the idea of a kid as \\"nerdy\\" as I was being transported to a world where those rules seemed to apply, where he suddenly had the ability to develop the power of a Mage (i'm always a mage lol). I LOVED this idea. I love how the story focuses on the journey rather than the destinations. It's refreshing. I love how the characters develop slowly over the course of this book and the following one. I enjoyed how this book ended perfectly setting up the next but not leaving me feeling cheated or with too many questions up in the air. I loved reading about the displays of magic, and the feeling of never being able to quite relax but being on edge.So yes, its a lot like D&D;, but that is what I enjoyed so much about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book.sometimes lacking but 99% of the time its great","review":"this was a great book for me.people that like magic books should read this.it might get a little boring but that is gone quick and its replaced with action.i will definetly read the rest of the series!this was a exelent book also because of its lenght.this was a LONG book which is a really good thing snce i LOVE long books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"My guess is that these reviews were all written by DeWalt's marketing department. The day after I bought this rotating laser, it stopped working, and I had to argue with the dealer to get it warrantied. In addition, I found it time consuming and not so simple to set up. I won't buy another laser from DeWalt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting style--very palatable","review":"Mr. Malone's music is reminiscent of George Benson's early work, and as such there is a rich variability in his phrasings. Equally capable at playing ballads, as well as at breakneck speed, this music is a force to be reckoned with. He has the capability of becoming a premier mainstream artist for the 21 st century. Expect more great albums from this artist. It would be interesting to hear him paired with McCoy Tyner or Herbie Hancock for a session."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again, the Feel Kills it.....","review":"As a jazz guitarist you always listen for what you can learn from someone, what they do well and not well. Russell is an amazing talent when it comes to chord melody playing. His voicings, along with slick tricks using harmonics makes for a beautiful addition to the standard approach to playing jazz guitar chord melody. What makes this CD difficult to listen to is his playing in time or with the rhythm section. His lines are mostly un inventive and have a very awkward feel. It does not have the feel of say, Grant Green or George Benson. It sounds as if his picking is not worked out well and subtracts from the over all rhythmic feel of the music. I would love to hear a record of just solo guitar from this artist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bones Season 3","review":"I thought that this was a very good season I also thought that it was nice that they previewed the first four episodes of season 4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great gift!","review":"I purchased this season of Bones for my daughter as a Christmas gift.

Due to the writer's strike, we have a 15 episode season. As if these guys did not make enough money. I wish I made their money. But I make $0.00 thanks to the factory I worked in for 20 some odd years closing and moving south. But back to the show. You can feel the chemistry between Bones and Booth. It's constant. The cases are fantastic. I have not watched the last 2. I was hoping there where more but after checking a few websites I guess that's it. thus my disappointment. I will see if I buy the 3rd season depends on how much they are going to rip us off for.

Just wish there were more episodes!","review":"I got hooked on Bones during the end of Season 3, watching a repeat from Season 2 on TV. Now, I have bought all 3 seasons of Bones. I love them all! I never get tired of watching the episodes. David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel have awesome chemistry and great one-liners!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Dealbreaker","review":"Zack was vaguely interesting but really never fully clicked with the cast so it is OK with me that he is gone. They needed to give him a personal life (a nerd girlfriend or something) to give him depth. They never did. In Season 2 they took out the british anthropologist boss and replaced him with the annoying lady boss, which I didn't like. But neither were dealbreakers. Bones and Booth are primarily what matter. And, for me, Angela and Hodgkins is the secondary story that they had to keep...and they did. And, the goofy psychiatrist is an OK addition. At least he is funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good show","review":"This show is gross and funny, with a splash of romance. It is a good drama show with just enough of each category for all to like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bones, season 3, partly defective discs","review":"I love what I can watch, but part of the series (parts of discs 1 and 3 seem to be edfective - they won't play for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"digital screw up","review":"There a total of 6 disc with up to 4 shows per disc and on at least 6 shows are digitally messed up.

I'm very dissappointed only mess up to every happen to me through amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Expectations","review":"While the stand-alone episodes of \\"Bones\\" remain entertaining and true to their conceptual formula, the writers and directors of this series have never been able to pull off significant shifts in character development or extended plot lines without \\"jumping the shark.\\" Season 3's \\"Gormagon\\" killer episodes (including the season finale) make up some of the most disappointing television I've seen in some time. It's amazing how this program can swoop from such excellent highs to such interest crushing lows. Overall, for the feeling left in one's stomach after swallowing season three as whole, it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bones","review":"Bones is just an awesome program.

If you just like to watch an episode here and there and don't want to buy the entire season, this is a good way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHEMISTRY+HUMOR+MURDER= FUN","review":"I've been hooked on BONES since the first episode, and though I hate what was done to Zach, and also to Hodgins, and Angela the shows are always watchable. I am, however, getting just a bit tired of seeing Booth's, and Bones' inability to realize that they're in love with each other. The writers are ( hopefully ) running out of contrivances to keep the lead character's apart ( which is obviously being done because they're afraid that interest in the series will dissipate should Bones, and Booth actually come together ). David Boreanaz, and Emily Deschanel play off from one another beautifully, and the cases always seem much more plausible than the other forensic shows out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"as usual","review":"Still a very strong series and a personal favourite, Boes has excellent writig good stories and directing. The main problem which will be resolving is the youth of the cast and even the excessive youthfullness of some of the cast memebers which renders the story slightly unplausible. However David Boreanaz is overcoming his character of Angel.Emily Deschael plays the socially inadequate Bones and even she is somewhat too young to be totally credible. OK, these are minor esthetic points that should not distract from enjoying the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd Learning Made Easy","review":"This is a really great way to learn songs from the album.

I'm an experienced knitter, and had a hard time with some of the patterns. For instance, the cast on and number of stitches weren't even mentioned in one of her hat patterns. I eventually figured it out by counting the stitches that were in the rounds.Suss Counsins...Knitter to the Stars! Please. This book looks all shiny, pretty, and hip. Upon closer inspection, the patterns are a bunk. I've tried to make several items in this book, and just about every pattern has a correction to it. To find the corrections for the pattern one must visit Suss Cousins's website. I find this frustrating, because I was expecting a level of quality that wasn't there. I will, however, grudgingly admit that the book does make knitting seem glamourous with photography. In the end, save your money, and check this book out of your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even for free","review":"I checked this book out from my local library and began to flip through it. By the time I got to the front door, I realized that I did not even want to take it home. The name-dropping of celebrities is annoying enough, but anyone who thinks that a woman with a 32-inch bust is \\"large\\" has been in Hollywood way too long. None of the patterns is unique enough to put up with all the alterations needed to fit a normal person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly impressed with her fabulous customers--still!","review":"This book suffers from the same irritating weaknesses as the first book-- self-involvement of the author, the directions are frequently unclear, the sizing unrealistic and the name dropping PATHOLOGICAL. On an anecdotal level, I have been to Suss Cousins's store in L.A. twice and found her to be rude, dismissive and unpleasant--apparently she saves her friendly demeanor for her fabulous celebrity customers. I wonder how THEY feel about her advertising her connection with them in order to increase her own sales..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematic","review":"Overall, This is the wost knitting book I own. That's not to say it's awful, but there are FAR better.The patterns are adorable! A lovely afghan, heart-shaped pillow, and an excellent sweater jacket are highlights (at least for me.)The issue is the patters have problems. A LOT of errors. Check her errata page big time here, and just keep your eyes peeled for things that just don't look right....It's also more of a coffee-table book, with a lot of extra nothing"},{"rating":"1","title":"bland book","review":"I find many of the styles pretty bland and even for the simplest designs, there were errors. I feel embarrassed that this was the first knitting book I purchased when I was starting out. I remember I used to look up her website to order some yarn that was called for in her book but am very glad I didn't. I've visited her store once but didn't have any unpleasant experience. One of her assistance there was really sweet and I think she modeled one of the shrugs that were online exclusive. Other than that, I've touched some of her in-house yarn that they had and they weren't exactly the softest I've felt. Again, none of the designs are very innovative and if you're an intermediate and above knitter, it's just easier to eyeball it and make it up on your own. Glad I gave up my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"What happened? Where is the melodic Cure we know and love? The lush song structures? This album has none of that. It gets 1 star for \\"Aniversary\\" - in my opinion - the best track on the album. On just about every other track on the album - Robert Smith's voice is all over the place - and not in a good way! I am all for experimentation (..The Top - I personally loved it!) but this seems to have NO direction - and Roberts voice gets increasingly irritating when he is shouting and howling through ALL the songs. Sorry...I have been a fan since 1981 -and this new Cure donsn't seem like the Cure at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Stop Now?","review":"So it was supposed to be all over ... well, Bob Smith changed his mind about that, and a good thing, too. This self-titled album sounds incredibly fresh, and there are none of the 'acoustic' numbers here that made up a good chunk of the songs on 'Bloodflowers.' It's mostly gloom most of the time again, with the ten-minute \\"The Promise\\" as a prolonged and eerie finale. It is interesting to note that in \\"Us Or Them\\" we are presented with a Cure song that has political overtones, a first for the habitually introspective Mr. Smith.If you're already a fan of The Cure, you'll very likely love this new offering (and are probably listening to it as you read this). If you're not, but are prone to reveling in melancholy and like stuff that doesn't sound too bloody cheerful, these songs may well make one out of you. Give it a spin."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER THE EDGE AND DOWN THE CLIFF","review":"There is a fine line between beautiful dissonance and dreadful dissonance. The Cure has always ridden very close to the edge and has managed to pull it off in the past. DISINTEGRATION was perhaps The Cure's most astonishing achievement in taking bent sounds and making great rock. These days, many young bands proudly cite The Cure and DISINTEGRATION in particular as inspirations.As much as I love the band, I'm afraid I have to say they have veered over the edge with THE CURE. I have played this album over and over thinking surely I was wrong. But I keep coming up with the same conclusion. Of the eleven cuts, I only like two: \\"Before Three\\" and \\"Taking Off\\". The rest are only so-so or down right unpleasant.I really wanted to greet The Cure's resurfacing with enthusiasm; but I just can't do it. Be forewarned. Maybe you'll like it; but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture...and not in a good way.","review":"I have been a devoted Cure fan for years. I own their entire catalog and can honestly say that they have very nearly never recorded a song I don't like. Songs that didn't appeal to me initially grew on me over time. Consistently, the Cure have produced the kind of lush sound that brings to mind a nightworld filled with ecstacy, epic disappointments, and magic. The bottom line is: it's beautiful stuff.So you can imagine my surprise when I headed off to buy \\"The Cure\\" the day it came out, got home, excitedly put it on the the stereo, and sat, liner notes unfolded in my lap, to listen to the first new album in four years from my guys. But these aren't my guys. This isn't beautiful. The first time I put this on, I couldn't even listen all the way through. Not the kind of epic disappointment I had in mind.In a 25-year career, a band is allowed to make one bad album. I hope this was it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Distinct Sound of Vomiting","review":"Arggggg! What a load of manure this disc is! I like The Cure but I can barely handle listening to this disc for more than 2 minutes. Robert Smith's screaming and shouting and there's no melodic songs on here at all. The only thing worse than listening to this disc is looking at the shoddy cover art. Maybe some will find the artwork of children \\"cute\\" but I think something more substantial could have been chosen for the bloody cover. Avoid unless you enjoy listening to the sound of fingernails scratching a chalkboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you!","review":"When I first listened to this album I wasn't bowled over or particularly impressed. A lot of the songs (like Lost)just seemed to drone on annoyingly and not really go anywhere. The only one felt was any good was the single (The End of the World). I listened to the album once and didn't listen to it for a while.I've been listening to it lately though and love it! You have to listen to it a few times to get to know some of the songs but they're all just beautiful. A few favourites are the catchy \\"Taking Off\\", \\"Lost\\", the achingly beautiful \\"Going Nowhere\\", and the impossibly sweet \\"Before Three\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking Off again","review":"The Cure's 2004 album reaffirms their greatness. The stand out track on the album is Taking Off and Alt. End. The whole CD makes a return to The Cure's classic sound that influenced so many band. It rocks hardcore!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pornography Redux","review":"Pornography stood alone in the Cure catalog as their most bitter and angry recording. After WMS and the middle section of Bloodflowers, this album reminds me of why I love the Cure.One major quibble - \\"Tomorrow Morning\\" is my favorite song and it's only available on vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but a for sure upswing!","review":"After listening to two horrid albums in a row, it is nice to hear something that is The Cure. There are drops in style back to The Top, Head on the Door, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. Is it the greatest, \\"NO\\", but it is definately good to hear something which shows that Robert hasn't disappeared. I had my fears, but it made a hell of a birthday present coming out on the 29th!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heaviest Album Ever","review":"Robert Smith said he tried to make the heaviest album ever, and he has succeeded. At first when I listened to this album, I thought the songs sounded generic and some of the songs sounded just weird. But then after listening to it many times, I realized that Robert Smith was creating something that is much more creative and innovative than most people think... but you have to study time signature and music theory to understand. For all music theorists out there, this can be one of the most enjoyable albums you'll ever listen to. This is the best album I've ever listened to. Then my next 2 favorite albums would be Bloodflowers and Wild Mood Swings. Listen to the songs as if you were trying to understand a foreign language.. that's a good start. At times, you may feel you don't understand what Robert is doing and unfulfilled. When you do, you'll be a little closer to understanding what is going on in the music... enjoy.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd imho...","review":"There are many mixed reviews about this cd here. I was afraid to buy it, after reading previous opinions, but the truth is... I loved it! Great cd, and that is typical of this band imho, you can't go wrong with The Cure. Five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Cure's Disintegration","review":"I'm listening to the album right now, not for the first time but yes if a little closer. It is terrible. Sounds angry, uninspired and really like nothing left to say... 'Anniversary' is amazingly different from the rest of the songs, but it is plain to see that this is a commercially aimed release... and even fails in hooking with nice melodies. The 'art', the 'lushness' of previous records give way to a very common rock band everyday's life sound, nothing to do with the originality and distinctiveness The Cure had in the past.I'm starting to think as well that maybe Robert Smith is starting to use the band to release his own personal demons in the way Roger Waters did with Pink Floyd before they split up.A pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but something missing...","review":"I've loved the Cure since about 1984...I love the haunting melodies and Robert's ballads, like This Twilight Garden, Apart, Catch...this CD is good but I guess I was just hoping for more of these types of songs like A Letter to Elise or Trust..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight poop.","review":"Seriously, I'm a rabid fan of everything they did from Three Imaginary Boys to Disintegration (Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me had way too much uninspired and lame pop filler IMO, though), but The Cure should have stopped with Disintegration. It sounds like a farewell album. It could have been their swan song. But no, they continued to make albums, and poor ones at that. The Cure's dark moody pieces have always been their best, and the pop stuff usually the worst, barring the material on Japanese Whispers.I've tried listening to this album on numerous occasions (I own it unfortunately) and I just can't enjoy it. You'll be much more satisfied with The Cure's earlier work, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"save it","review":"This was the first Cure album I bought and I thought it was trash. Now I'm assuming that the Cure is really a great band and this is just a thin spot in their discography, but this was not a very good album. I had to struggle to listen to it once. The songs didn't go anywhere. I mean angst is one thing, but this wasn't angst, this was just being emotive for wads of cash. And other agree, any album that's being resold (103 for sale used!) starting at $3.00, while its single is still in rotation, clearly is a wad of crap. Maybe you (the reader) and I should choose our Cure introductions a little wiser next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no....","review":"I have been a die-hard Cure fan for many years and tolerated some not so great albums, but this one is just bad. I couldn't believe it when I heard it, I was just in shock. This is not the Cure I grew up with...The lyrics are okay but the melodies don't flow. It sounds unfinished and quickly put together. A couple good songs on this album, but they are not worth buying this CD. It truly saddens me to hear it. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Use Records as Therapy","review":"I'm a big fan of The Cure. They have made a lot of great records, but I'm sorry to some of the other reviewers, I didn't think this was one of them. It starts out with a hopeless rant about being lost(no real music involved) that is funny the first time, but hardly enjoyable to listen to a second time. The album then at least attempts to be musical. Unfortunately the songs are just drab and mediocre. Mr. Smith seems to have used the process of writing and recording these songs as some kind of self therapy. I really don't care about some horrible breakup with a woman he insists on telling me about in detail.I do like two songs including The End Of The World. I give the album only one star because after several honest tries to appreciate the album I've decided it was a waste of money and I don't care to have it in my collection. It has to be that bad to get only one star from me. I'd advise others not to waste their money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"How can the same band that farted out \\"The Top\\" years later come back to produce a masterpiece like \\"Disintegration?\\" It's this kind of inconsistent artistry that keeps Cure fans buying their CD's even after having been burned.This self titled release actually makes me yearn for \\"Bloodflowers.\\" The recording is completely disjointed with only 2-3 songs worthy of standing against The Cure's body of work (Labyrinth and Anniversary.) I can tell why Simon Gallup wanted to punch Ross Robinson's teeth in - you can barely hear his trademark bass.Buy it if you're bored, or just desperate to relive your youth, but if you're familiar with The Cure's catalogue, you'll probably agree this is a fairly vaccuous offering. R. Smith tells us more than once during this CD that he \\"can't find himself\\" and that he \\"doesn't know what's going on.\\" Thanks Robert, but the recording stated that clearly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cure disintegrating ?","review":"This record consists of a bunch of jam sessions recorded.I think the Cure is slowly dying away today. I'm waiting for a great, emotional, greatly produced album. I think it's a shame they don't get themselves together to do great things again. Having this platform, having such a legendary band, how can Robert Smith just record some tired and uninspired jam sessions ? I am desillusioned these days. I want some great hymns, psychedelic deepness and proper music.Trying to sound more indie 'rockish' just does not work for them.If they don't give us a beautiful record next, the case is closed for me.However, one song's got some of the old magic:Anniversary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consistently not what I expected.","review":"One thing about this album is consistence. I really want to like it more, but there is just to much of Robert Smith yelling. So he has lost himself, so what. I like crunchy sounding guitars with lots of feed back, but I also like to have a more coherent melody. A lot of this album sounds alike. It is loud and mad. More melodies are needed.I hear stuff I like in this album, but I hear too much I don't. Maybe with more spins it will grow on me. I just don't enjoy listening to it, like I do other cure albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FREAKIN ALBUM!","review":"I've been a Cure fan during the \\"Close to me\\" days. Then the last couple of albums didn't do a thing for me. They lacked the energy and creativity they inspired in me from the day. This albums is just a \\"wow\\"! Comeback albums usually suck but this is an exception. It won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd for depressed people","review":"This was the first Cure album I bought and heard. It was amazing. I was really depressed at the time so I related all the songs to my life, and this cd really helped me. It is full of beautiful songs, my favorites being End of the World, Before Three, Alt End, (I Don't Know What's Going) on, and Taking Off. But then, I love about 90% of the songs on the cd. Since the first time I heard of them, I've listened to some of their other older music and I still find I love this cd the most. A great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album makes the baby Jesus cry","review":"Upon first listen, I was stricken with panic. I thought, \\"Oh my God...this is the first Cure album ever that I'm actually going to sell back.\\" I've not been previously disappointed by any Cure offering. There were bright spots on Wild Mood Swings, and I've grown to love Bloodflowers. This disc, however, is an atrocity. I was actually irritated by it. The Cure depresses me more than Disintegration, not because of its emotional power, but because it forces the realization that my favorite band of all time is capable of creating unlistenable garbage. R.I.P. The Cure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cure is Sick","review":"After hearing the demos of the first five songs I just can say this is the worst Cure album I've listen to!Here, the music is just an unobstrusive background for Smith's choppy phrases. The music is not melodic nor fit for restaurant background, unless the shop tenders want this to work as an eat-fast-and-go-away trigger.I mean, if none of the first five songs ring a bell, you better don't risk your money in this just hoping the rest of the tracks are better. If you don't have them, buy any of their best albums, like \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\\", Wish, or The Head on the Door.Moreover, look at the cover art, it really represents the \\"hard work\\" they put in this album ;-)You really have to be a fundamentalist fan to like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"First off,i truly really truly can't believe someone said this is the best album yet.Did this person even hear anything else by them??This album has absoulutly no depth what so ever.It sounds like a totally new band,not a veteran band that has been around since the late seventies.I can't stand how Robert just sings the same crap over and over,like he could'nt think of anything else to say!What a waste of money and time spent listening to this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cure has reached the end of the world","review":"I'm a huge Cure fan, and was highly disappointed. I classify their music into three genres: happy, sad, and angry. Although this album covers it all, I was hoping for the \\"trilogy\\" to continue. Pornography, Disintegration, and Bloodflowers are the three best albums The Cure has made. I hate their happy pop songs such as 'Friday I'm in Love', 'Mint Car', 'Just Like Heaven'...too much fluff and not believable. Robert needs to get back to the basics of The Cure: bleak, somber, desolate, depressing, sad, and angry. The 'Kiss Me' album produced one track, 'The Kiss' with a bunch of B-Sides. The 90's 'Wild Mood Swings' produced one track: 'Want' which contained a bunch of B-Sides. 'The 13th' had a B-side called 'It Used To Be Me' which should have been on the album. That was their worst album to date, but now it's 'The Cure'. Suggested track includes: The Promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adding a bad taste 2 what should've been a nice occasion.","review":"Ok, The Cure made a really good album. Now here is the problem. The f*ckfaces only released 3/4 of it in America. Why does Japan get three extra songs? Why does England get one extra song? And really, why does the crappy vinyl version HAVE FOUR EXTRA SONGS? I know 20 songs were recorded, so use some \\"non-album\\" material for precious extra cash b-sides. I don't want to buy any more singles. You have made enough money off of me. You want a higher rating? Put up the songs you ripped me off for to download for free on your website (I will download them anyway). Don't try to pull that greedy @ss crap again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need a cure","review":"This is the worst cure album to date, and I have been a fan since The Top.

I think it was a great album but this new CD is just horrible. It's annoying, repetitive and boring for most of the time - I just cant believe how could they release such a bad record.

I got it not really knowing what to expect, but the first track, \\"Lost,\\" totally blew me away and suddenly I was hooked. The CD has left my stereo since I bought it. It's amazing from start to finish. I' totally addicted to \\"End of the World\\" and \\"Anniversary.\\" The Cure is definitely back from their four year absence with an unbelievable album.P.S. If you buy the album you get all sorts of bonus stuff as well as some cool artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"As dispensable as anything since Disintegration","review":"It's not that \\"The Cure\\" is bad. There are some inventive moments (openers Lost and Labyrinth) and satisfying melodies (End of the World, Taking Off); but there is nothing that stirs the soul like their earlier work, and nothing that's nothing like anything you've heard before.Worst of all are the words... how many times can Mr. Smith tell us it's the end before no-one really cares anymore? Sadly the lyrics sound more tired, banal and frankly adolescent with every new release."},{"rating":"1","title":"INCURABLE","review":"Ok, so I thought I was Robert Smith in high school (back in, oh, 1986-7) and i carried the torch a long, long time but I think I have really just about had it with Mad Bob & Co. This album sounds like gothy oatmeal. Two, three, four listenings back to back and nothing...Robert - please just STOP already! Those out there singing this albums' praises - have you actually listened to the back-catalogue?

It is their hardest yet it reminds me a lot of Boys Don't Cry, good but in need of slight improvements (like the frickin 4 tracks on the vinyl version). The cure (i mean Robert) have been going through constant changes from punk (Boys don't cry/3 imaginary boys) hard gothic (pornography) to \\"new wave\\" (17 seconds) to pop (Wild Mood Swings), it was sort of obvious that they had to release a \\"hard\\" album they have and must experiment with new sounds and techniques that's what the cure are about, but stupid people want them to just stay in one niche market and not expand. How many times have I heard \\"this is not disintegration or the next one hopefully will be disintegration\\" well guess what I'd be disappointed if Robert rehashed a disintegration just to appease the fans.

I could tell this was going to be garbage from their shotty video for the single \\"End of the World\\" to the even worse cover art. Now that I've actually listened to the whole album straight through, I must say the music is worse than both the video and the cover art combined.Robert Smith's lyrics have grown trite and boring and the beautifully, dark melodies that we once heard on Disintegration, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Wish and even friggin Pornography are all gone. I don't know whether to blame the band or Ross Robinson. Either way this album is terrible. Oh and I must say that \\"Never\\" is possibly the worse song The Cure has ever written.

That, and I'm not up for buying a $70 pair of headphones any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous sound quality, great price","review":"As a Milwaukee native, I've known about Koss headphones for a long time. I purchased my first one in 1972. I know the quality is 1st class. These headphones continue the tradition. The overall sound quality is terrific. Bass is deep and not muffled. Highs are crisp and clean. There are sounds you can hear for the first time on cd's and yes even albums with the Titanium Pros. The noise cancelling quotient is high, allowing you to relax and absorb the music without extraneous sounds coming into play. Very pleased with the product. If you really like to listen to music, these will satify your needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always.... Stellar product!","review":"Koss Is a real classy organization! Not only have I just bought the best headphones I have ever heard they are right now fixing my porta pro headphones just for the price of shipping!This is my 4th set of Koss. the first were the earlier version of this and the second were an open air model that I eventually stepped on and broke..too bad.The next were my Porta Pro'sMy only complaint is that I have had a sore neck lately and these are kind of heavy so when i got them today my neck still hurts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most impressive.","review":"Not going to write much, as most has been posted on the site, but definitely get these headphones if you're looking in the 50-100 dollar range. Actually these are better than many higher-end(higher-priced)headphones I've tried. Only complaint is that the headphones might be slightly large and heavy - extended use makes for hot ears. Nevertheless,the sound quality is superb. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed with the sound","review":"I have the new koss portapro's and the small koss titatium headphones which I purchased from amazon a few weeks ago. They sound real good and are small enough to take with you any where.So I though, why not order the koss pro4aat phones to use in my house only with various audio devices. I have tried them with a sterio 100 watt amplifier, portible radio, telivision and CD players. After using the smaller and cheaper koss phones first they are obviously much better sounding, and do not weigh a lot.I will never order Koss products with out trying them first.Don't be fooled in thinking these might be great by ordering them thru the internet and being disappointed about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"I had a friend who owned some Koss UR20s, and they were awesome headphones. The bass response was good, they were THE most comfortable headphones I've ever worn, and they've lasted a good many years.Contrasting this, I decided to \\"go all out\\" and buy some Pro4AATs. The statistics on the Pro4AAs were blowing the UR20s out, so I bought it.I've been dissatisfied with my purchase ever since.The Pro4AATs have mediocre bass response at best. The sound quality is thin. They weigh too much! I can't wear them for longer than an hour, because it presses down too hard on the top of my head.3 years later, I'm still using these Pro4AAs, and my friend is still using his UR20s. I did a sound test, and the UR20s still wup up on the Pro4AAs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Sound, No Bass","review":"I wanted pretty design and a coiled cord, so I took a risk with Koss. Maybe I got a defective pair, but the sound was poor, flat with almost no bass. Some reviewers say you need an extra amp for these, but my 100 watt-per-channel amplifier says \\"I don't think so\\", and overall volume was very high, just the bass was missing. My old $25 Sennheiser sounds much better. Returned next day, won't try Koss again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe mine were faulty?","review":"I had my pair of Koss headphones for several months and tried listening to them several times but they sounded so terrible I couldn't stand it; the sound being \\"dark\\" and \\"dead\\". I have an old pair of Koss headphones I bought from Radio Shack and a pair of Grado SR80s and they both sound pretty good to my ears so I don't believe my ears are totally at fault. I gave them to the Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddily Made -- greatly disappointed.","review":"I have a set of 30 year old Superex ProB VI headphones that are still going strong -- the Pro4 line has been around about as long, so I figured to try them out. Audio quality is FINE, but these headphones only lasted about 6 months before something broke. Looks like the sliding mechanism on the top ate the far channel. These have a \\"lifetime warrantee\\", so I sent them back, but that will end up costing about 25% of the purchase price. No excuse for such a poorly designed mechanism... sad to say, these apparently are made in the USA.Would not buy these again, sorry to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but with a minor problem.","review":"I love these headphones; they sound great, don't weight too much, and sit on my head comfortably.My only problem with these headphones is the vinyl plastic ear-pads they use, they stick to my skin and I can't stand the feeling, my solution was to cut a pair of black socks (brand new) and use them as slip on covers. I wish Koss would make and sell replacement ear-pads for this set that were made of a cloth material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful sound clarity","review":"These headphones sound very clear and open. You hear detail in every recording that you never noticed before. They are also surprisingly comfortable given their size. Excellent headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticking with my vintage Koss Pro 4X Plus","review":"I have owned a pair of Koss Pro 4X Plus headphones for twenty plus years and the sound is incredible! I thought I would 'upgrade' after reading so much about the Pro4AAT and could not have been more disappointed. These sounds just awful. I do professional restoration work for Casey Kasem on American Top 40 and sound quality is everything in what I do.I concur with the complaints of other reviewers:1. The bass completely lacks and sounds like a roll-off at 100 Hz and below.2. The midrange is recessed and the highs are exaggerated. Overall the sound is harsh and brittle and really hollow.I could only take about 5 minutes and have to say these are the worst sounding pair of headphones I have ever heard in my life. A TOTAL waste of almost $100.As I said, the Pro 4X Plus has so much more dynamic range and response and I'll continue buying them up every time I see a pair come available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Range and lots of noise...","review":"I have never tried other wireless headphones, so I did not know what to expect. These headphones will only work in the room where the base is...that is not too much of a problem because I use them to watch movies when others in the house need quiet, but the amount of hiss and noise is quite distracting. No matter how I fiddled with the volume of the unit and the volume of the surround sound system I could still hear it.One other thing that may be purely personal: I usually am reclining on the sofa when I watch the movies, with my head propped on pillows--these headphones have a \\"behind the head\\" design that is much less comfortable when you are laying back.The only really good thing for me was the price, but I would be willing to pay more to solve these problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below my expectations","review":"When I bought the headphone, it seemed the best option: light, cheap, good brand.But using it was kind of disapointing. Even at 3,4 feet away you hear a background squeaking.When I had to get new batteries (after 2 months of far-less-than-intense use) I broke the little piece of plastic that holds the battery cover.I am still using (I got used to the squeaking), but as soon as I have a chance I will look for something better.UPDATE (02/01/06): I've lost my patience. It went to garbage. Spend more money and buy something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Infrared Technology","review":"This is the 1st set of cordless speakers I've tried. I was warned about about IR vs radio frequency technology. I should have listened to the advice. RF is much better than IR.I would not recommend these headphones"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Flimsy for family room","review":"We bought these to use for the family room TV so teenagers could play games or watch videos without all the noise. These headphones sound OK, but the construction is very flimsy- headband broke in 3 weeks. Sony wireless phones have more robust construction and lasted for several years in the same application before being moved to a different room. We're goong back to the Sonys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable to wear","review":"First the upsides - price, easy to use, and acceptable sound quality. The downsides for me are mainly comfort when wearing them. Because they are a 'behind the neck type headphone, I believe that the tension of the spring wire that connects the 2 earpieces is to great. There is no adjustment for this (one size fits all). To compound the problem there is not much padding on the earpieces. If I was to buy another set of headphones, I would opt for the over the head design with large, well padded over the ear type earpieces. If you are like me and wear a large hat size, don't buy these as you might experience the problem that I am having. However, maybe someone with a smaller hat could wear them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the one-star reviews with a large grain of salt","review":"This book is excellent, and quite readable if you can think logically. As best as I can tell, most of the one-star reviews come from Landsburg's skewering of the environmental movement. He talks about it as a religion, and the emotional reaction of those reviewers shows he's pretty much on target.Bottom line - if you can suppress your emotional attachment to certain popular ideas and consider them objectively, you'll like this book. If you can't, you'll hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital edition costs more than print!?!","review":"For some reason the publisher wants me to pay MORE for the digital edition than the print, even though they've turned off features and I can't resell it or give it away.I get it, Simon & Schuster/Free Press, you don't want me to buy a digital copy even though that's how I read now. Fine, I'll buy a used copy and you'll never see a profit from my sale in the first place. I just can't figure out, from an economics perspective, why you'd want that. *shrug*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"The book has some annotations near the beginning, but as a student, those are just extra notes. The book is in really good condition and was VERY inexpensive. Great quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Arrogant Defense of Greed","review":"The author of this book finds himself highly clever and amusing. I find him highly smug and pompous. His claim that increased deforestation is good for the tree population is a prime example of the twisted logic of an urban capitalist who simply cannot admit that his comfort comes at a high price. What a load of beans. Recycle at once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"Some economics books read more like a manual of technical instructions, designed only for those with a PhD in economics, yet Landsburg's witty writing and precise examples keep the book entertaining enough that it's hard to put down.Landsburg does get a bit caught up in some heavy-handed language and technical jargon in a few chapters (most notably in the middle of the book), but the rest of the book more than makes up for it. In short, The Armchair Economist is a must-read for anyone who doesn't know anything about economics but would like to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economic logic the way everyone should think","review":"Steven Landsburg takes a number of seemingly absurd statements and shows them to be true. On the surface it seems that everyone hates dirty air and seat belts save lives. But if you follow out all the consequences of an action you see that this is not necessarily true.Should be required reading for all high school seniors.My only complaint is his last chapter on environmentalism. Mr. Landsburg went out on a limb on a subject he seems to know too little about and it shows. 23 5 star chapters and 1 3 star, can't win them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent casual explanations, but I want the math.","review":"The Armchair Economist does an excellent job of explaining why the obvious answer is the wrong answer to many questions about the marketplace. It's a good read; some economics popularizations fail to couple examples to the real world, and this volume explains a lot of commenplace situations in a small space.I would have appreciated more of the math. I realize that mine is a minority preference, so I suggest to the author that he produce a companion volume with the same sequence of chapters as The Armchair Economist. Each chapter of the proposed companion volume would give the math that underlies the corresponding chapter of The Armchair Economist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puzzle solved","review":"I am a firm believer that even the most complicated topics can be conveyed in plain language-- and enjoyed from the comfort of an armchair. This book does an incredible job of presenting the essential tenets of economics in a memorable, witty, and easily understood manner. Equally as important, Dr. Landsberg explicitly defines the realm of pure economics vs. policy. An incredible, thought-provoking read. I would gladly trade three undergraduate economics courses for a detailed review of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but starting to sound a bit dated","review":"While the book has some interesting parables and anecdotes and is an engaging look at some problems from the \\"man is a rational agent\\" perspective, this mantra starts to get a bit tiring after a while (and is also starting to sound a bit dated with recent developments in the field).My main gripe however was the author's style. Arrogant and condescending, I found the book hard to get through at points - despite being interested in the content."},{"rating":"1","title":"The excerpt is fantastic . . . and that's about it","review":"I read the excerpt and the chapter titles and thought this author is brilliant! When I actually read the book, it was horrible. The author summarizes everything by saying, everything balances itself out because the market will revert to where it's supposed to be. For example, if everyone received a $1 increase in salary, then no one would be ahead of the game. He applies this theory to every topic that is previewed in the book.I had huge expectations which the book did not deliver. It's been a pain to just finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled and unconvincing, with some good concepts","review":"There were some good concepts here, but the stories meant to use the ideas all went astray. Each application of an economic principle to the story changed the result, and when he stopped with one conclusion, I always wondered why he didn't take it one more step and reach the opposite conclusion. It seems that any conclusion wanted can be reached. His arrogant commentary left me distrusting his chosen conclusion. Maybe economic theory isn't so useful after all.Much better was 'New Ideas from Dead Economists.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grizzly=Junk","review":"This is the third item I purchased from Grizzly and all turned out to be JUNK. This set of tools is no exception: they are not the standard Sorby tools that are listed, but a short light weight version of same. Grizzly ripped me off for $42.00 (\\"re-stocking\\" charges and grossly overpriced shipping)to look at these overrated weed diggers and they took 3 weeks to credit my credit card after numerous requests. Amazon should dump Grizzly and you do business with them at your peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Organizational Issues","review":"This text is required for my graduate level voice disorders class for Speech Pathology. After reading the text, I found that it was poorly organized and difficult to read. This book does not provide a glossary and never defines many technical terms. I found myself reading the text with a dictionary open. I also found it odd that some of the voice techniques were randomly embedded in case studies. For example, the proper way to shout is located under a case study on phonotrauma in children. I believe that something as important as a vocal technique should at least get its own heading."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Came very quickly, within a few days even, and it was packaged very nicely.

Ended up just throwing the rest of the bag away. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still a mystery.....","review":"The Cure's mysterious rise remains more puzzling than ever after this snip'n'paste rummage through the usual gamut of press clippings. With stunning banality, inter-band frictions are reduced to soap-opera absurdity, and Robert Smith's notoriously quixotic working methods are judged almost entirely on whatever PR line the press were fed at the time. There's a terrific Fear And Loathing-style saga to be written about this boozy, chaotic combo, but Faith is just an overwhelmingly partisan fan-study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Live Album of the YEAR!!","review":"If you've never heard of Armandinho, this is his best album by far. His mellow tunes and reggae beats combined with the energy from the crowd make for a really great album that I haven't stopped listening to. If you're into the likes of Jack Johnson, Bob Marley or Manu Chao, then this album is definitely for you!Cheers! and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"Hassinger does a great job presenting a clear, absorbing story centering on a relationship between an enigmatic priest who has committed himself to supporting the church, and a young woman who finds herself increasingly skeptical. The young woman's voice and the life of the 19th-century French town are convicing, and the author never lets the real-life mystery of Berenger Sauniere lead the story into ridiculous speculation. The pace never drags (a real achievement for a book with open religious themes), and the book's mysteries kept me hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy presentation not worth the five bucks","review":"I was very pleased to find an etext version of this once well-known and now obscure conduct book written during the reign of Henry VIII of England. The text itself makes for a fascinating window into thinking about political and moral education at that time. Less pleasing were the countless formatting issues and textual obscurity. Expect a sloppy, lurching, ungainly presentation. If it were free, I'd recommend downloading it despite these reservations. No one should have to pay five dollars for this, though. Buy yourself (or one you love, or would love to love) a Guinness instead.One day, I hope there are good scholarly editions of texts like this -- reasonably priced, or (better still) supported by some fiat for public good (under the aegis of the Library of Congress?). But for now, welcome to the new past of the future: wonderful breadth and quantity, breathtaking speed, commonly garbage quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, dont get lost without it!","review":"This is a great book.

It's a cute book/good concept, but I was expecting more modern pictures. There are some classic giant-sleeved 80's dresses, but for the most part, the pictures all look like they are from the 1960's or 1970's. Don't get me wrong - the dresses are hideous to someone in their 20's, but those were just the styles back then. The fewer modern dresses in the book just aren't that bad - I've seen/worn much worse. I think this book would be funnier to someone in their 50's looking back than to young brides/bridesmaids today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Images a little fuzzy...","review":"I ordered this becaue I needed a good basic review of standard X-rays.

It lasts all day (I am not one of those people who, when you walk by you can smell the entire room) it is just soft enough that if someone is close to you - they get as slight hint of the fresh light scent. I always get complimented on it. I even spray some underarms and it works awesome with my deodorant mixed together. So for those times where you are really hot - you still smell so GOOD!! lol.

I've had this book for several years on my computer desk waiting for the time to read it. Last weekend an article in the New York Times on rereading mentioned it and I knew its time had come, and was long overdue it turns out. I'll not rehash what others have said to its advantage, but it's a memorable book. It captures a time in history, the Humboltian world of exploration and explanation and discovery. Great adventure story this is, but it's also finely written so that that style of writing reinforces and supplements the action in the story. When the pace accelerates in the action, so does the writing. A wonderful experience. Now I can't wait to reread it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Between daylight savings and Purple America, sleep is scarce","review":"Moody's prosaic characters inspire hand-wringing and a Mary Richardsonian \\"Aw, Lou!\\" at their every foible. You want them to make the right choices, or at least avoid the worst ones. They don't, but the story is not devoid of hope. A fine balance that makes it extremely difficult to put it down. (But what's with the italics?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries too hard","review":"I hate it when an author makes it painfully obvious how much thought he put into certain things. Names, for instance. \\"Hex Raitliffe\\" Oh- I get it! \\"Hex\\", because he's unlucky and things go wrong! Not clever, and certainly not subtle.Just one of the initial turn-offs, but the error sets the tone for the entire book. Many reviewers complain about lack of readability. That's because Rick Moody is very, very proud of his writing ability, and overdoes each sentence to death. Long, windy sentences with lots of colorful adjectives does not always make well-written prose. In fact, it rarely does.The novel got so bogged down in its own ridiculous story that I not only lacked any sympathy with the characters, but felt like I was looking over the author's shoulder as he intended them. The attempts at humor, such as the lovemaking scene, just fell flat. I didn't even crack a smile throughout the entire read, which is pretty bad for a book that really, really wants to be funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving waste in a bath","review":"What a wonderful novel Purple America is. I deeply admire Moody's intensity, his choice of words, his ability to create a consistent character from failed boyhood to failed manhood. I especially loved looking for parallels between the decaying old Millstone nuclear power plant and the decaying old mother laying waste in her tub. Whether it was intentional or not is unimportant. It worked. I believe this novel will be studied and read for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely beautiful","review":"I don't know how people could have found this boring. But everyone is built differently, I guess.I found the lyricism of his writing deeply moving. I was totally captured by the internal workings of mother and son in this story.

Halpern's journeys take him to a North Carolina flood plain, an active volcano in Hawaii, the Malibu country, a barrier island in Lousiana and an isolated outpost in Alaska. Along the way, he meets and befriends some very unusual, but very down to earth people. Halpern's likability is the key to the book's success. It allowed him to get his subjects to open up to his questions and gives the book a good natured tone. In the end, he tries to find some common ground that they all share, but it is the journey itself that makes the book worthwhile.Overall, a quirky and amusing book that will be best enjoyed by armchair travelers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Travel Journalism on the Edge!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Jake Halpern's travel memoir of extreme places and the people who chose to live in them. Halpern's writing style is disciplined and readable--an ideal combination for a journalist--with just enough of a sprinkling of the wicked turn of phrase to keep the reader engaged and laughing. Halpern brings his subjects to vibrant life, and makes me want to know what has happened to them since his writing. I look forward to a volume two. Perhaps Halpern could explore whether those who \\"brave home\\" are a dying breed?

Well Slayer swallowed it whole and has spewed out some of their most brutal, driven works of yet. Boasting the speed that made them The Kings of Thrash, and some meaty slower chops that are as heavy as a five pound steak. Slayer once again has created a masterpiece. Can you digest it???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satan Laughs As You Eternally Rot","review":"a very impressive album. despite all the years and music slayer has been through, they still are amazing as ever. fantastic demonic lyrics and the brilliant 90-sec opening to bitter peace all blew me away."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Return","review":"Wow, they are defenatly back. Get this if your a fan of Slayer. Trust me on it, just short of greatness. This Album is just right behind \\"Regin In blood\\" In my book. It may not be as fast, but yet still VERY catchy. Thank you, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In slayer We trust","review":"This album is no Season in the Abyss, but still very good. It has a little bit of a different feel than past records. the best I could describe the feeling of the record is very consentrated, dark(as usual), and almost a gothic feel to some of the songs; such as the intro to bitter peace. The best songs on the album I feel are bitter peace, love to hate, and In the name of god. I enjoyed this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrash fan","review":"this dosn't sound much like slayer, i did just like one song when i bought this and it was screaming from the sky, but now after like 8 listens is pretty good, u will learn to accept this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting change","review":"Although this was not my favorite slayer album, DIM shows that even slayer, like most bands, will change over the years. I'm glad that they have started experimenting with different beats and textures, and i LOVED \\"Love to Hate\\". If you're a Slayer purist, don't buy it, but if you're interested in a change from the diggadiggadigga sound this is a good one to get (or South of Heaven). I guess eight-odd albums of speed metal is enough? (Not five, goodmuzak.)BTW: If you're in to punk, Undisputed Attitude is AWESOME."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOM","review":"This cd is the best cd i'v heard from Slayer since Reign In Blood.

AWESOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slayers Worst Album","review":"I like Nu-MEtal...But I think bands like slayer should stick to what they do best...Old school sounding thrash/Death Metal.This Record is way to \\"Nu\\" sounding for a Slayer Release.I dont need to Hear Tom Arya Rap.I know that bands like to try new things,but slayer took it way to far on this CD.This CD is bad for a slayer CD...But I would take a mediocre Slayer CD over alot of other Garbage out there today.This CD does have its gems.\\"Bitter Peace\\" is a great old school sounding song.\\"desire\\" sounds like it could have been on the SOH record.But they are trying way to hard not to sound like a thrash band that was born in the 80's on this CD...If you are buying a Slayer CD for the first time I recomend \\"South of HEaven\\" or \\"Hell Awaits\\" buy this one last to fill out your SLAYER collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"slayer are here and will never leave","review":"if a slayer fan does not have this cd yet(what are you waiting for) the bonus tracks .wicked and unguarded instinct are well worth the 26 bux that you spend on it. you might want to buy two one to play now and when it wears out play the other one im a hard core slayer fan and this was one of the best investments i have made in awhile"},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown.","review":"I wanted to love this CD. Just look at the artwork in the booklet and behind the CD! A man shot in the head, his blood all over the wall behind him, a whole line of needles sticking in the underside of someone's arm, and a pair of lips sewn shut! Rock on!But sadly the music just doesn't live up the imagery. Standout tracks are only \\"Bitter Peace\\" and \\"Point\\" which are the two more aggressive songs on the CD.This was Slayer's most experimental album, an attempt to incorporate elements of the popular (and very awful) nu-metal genre which had appeared around this time. It's somewhat interesting to listen to, but the songwriting just feels weak and lacking compared to earlier works. Something just doesn't quite work in most of the songs but I can't figure out definitively what.You'll have to really be into Slayer to jump for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their weakest effort","review":"Enamored by bands like Machine Head and Pantera, whose sound, ironically, owes much to Slayer's classic 80s albums, Slayer decided to unleash Diabolous in Music upon the world in 1998. Talk about poor career moves. Downtuned guitar riffs that could be played by a 5 year old, poor songwriting, and Tom Araya struggling to sing like he used to... this is all anybody should expect from Diabolous.After a killer opening track (Bitter Peace), DiM quickly heads downhill into monotonous borefest after monotonous borefest (STAIN OF MIND?). Towards the end, things pick up a bit (In the Name of God is a good song, as is Screaming from the Sky), but a few redeeming moments do not save this pile of dumpster fodder from mediocrity.The question is: WHAT HAPPENED? How could Slayer fall so far? Who knows exactly what they were thinking when they recorded Diabolous... and maybe it's better we don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about selling out!","review":"If you liked Divine Intervention or anything before it, don't even think about buying this album. Everything is about half speed, and the drumming is just horribly slow. The guitar riffs sound recycled, and are obviously uninspired. Slayer used to have some talent, but I'm not sure where it went. Apparently, judging by the vocals, they just sold out to the rap-rock fad. It's a sad day for true metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rocks!!!!!!!!","review":"In the past, I have listened to many of the previous Slayer CD's before I bought them. However when I saw this CD I decided to ga ahead and get it without listening to it first. What a smart idea. The guitar work on this CD is phenomenal. While it is not like the work from \\"Angel of Death\\", it is just like Slayer!!! Tom Araya's voice always cuts through the speed oriented guitar like crystal. This is probably my second favorite album next to \\"Angel of Death\\" but the new Slayer sounds as good as ever. Keep rocking guys!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another great hit!","review":"whats up every one! if you like metal... THIS is the cd to listen to! as slayer progresses in their carrer they have bekome exceptional musions and have made their sound BIGGER then ever! check this out every one."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"This is a great album. But Slayer already pumped out their absolute best way back when. I love this album simply because it's hard to find anything even remotely heavy thats also good anymore. Death's Head is my favorite song off DIM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated.","review":"DIM is one of the most underrated albums of all time. The songs are a lot slower than on their early albums but they're still very heavy. The guitar has a drop-d tuning which gives a lot of edge and a heavier sound. Death's Head is one of my top 10 Slayer songs, DIM isn't my absolute favorite but it's still decent. It might be a bit nu-metal but after hearing Bitter Peace it will make Slipknot sound like pop. Guitar riffs and solos are good, not the best or most technical though. Paul Bostaph's drumming is great and he comes close with Dave Lombardo. Lyrics are great also, a bit different than their past few efforts and even a bit darker but not like their earliest efforts. Slayer have reinvented their sound and modernized a bit, it's good to hear something different. Bitter Peace, Death's Head, Overt Enemy, Perversions Of Pain and Desire are some of the best offerings from Slayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated....","review":"I think this album is killer!! I don't know why so many people hate this. Sure it isn't as good or fast as \\"Reign in Blood\\" or \\"Hell Awaits\\", but it's still a solid album.And don't listen to people when they call this nu-metal. They don't know what they're talking about. This is far from nu-metal. I'll take this album over \\"Christ Illusion\\" or the horrendous \\"World Painted Blood\\" any day"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but could be better","review":"This cd is alittle more diverse than their previous albums. If it was heavier I would of gave it 5 stars. Still nice speed metal by one of the best thrash/metal bands out there. Just a few fillers that bring this cd down... My favorite song is track 4!! Bad ass riffs and the drums are kicking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good first impression","review":"This was my first Slayer experience. As a drummer, I was really floored by the job Paul Bostaph did on this album. He plays with such ferocity, precision, and speed. The sound of the drums is just amazing! For the album in general, great sound, great chops, great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"slayer is not very good, i bought the album.","review":"Exaggeration is what this band is all about. i still cannot till this day understand what is so special about this band. i bought this album and was surprised that the solo stink and that the rhythm is very slow. one would think that guitar intensity would be alot like american hi fi or like immortal.it does not matter who it is, but anyone who listens to slayer must be in some type of trance (hypnotized)because this band is not that good. but like always, the masses enjoy not the so good stuff. diabolus in musica is a no show. the drummer is not heavy at all. the long hair, the ripped jeans and tattoos is what makes these guys not their music. ohh, diabolus in musica must be latin standing for diabolical being in music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretty weak album - 2.5 stars","review":"Slayer released Diablos in Musica in 1998. This is a decent thrash album, but definitely not up to Slayer's standards. Yeah, some people think Slayer sucks and they say they are over-rated. These people are entitled to their opinion. That being said, Diablos really is Slayers weakest album. Maybe Tom Araya was able to sing in 1988, but his singing 10 years later just ruins the music. His normal vocals are ok, but when he sings or tries a spoken word section, it really shows that he should stick with what he knows (if only James Hetfield took my advise; his voice makes me want to puke now). Songs like Death's Head, Stain of Mind, Love to Hate are probably the worst Slayer songs they wrote up to this point.This is the Slayer album I listen to the least. There are song good songs: Bitter Peace, Overt Enemy, Scrum and Screaming From The Sky. Too bad the rest of the album is rather boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"It seems that Slayer has turned to mush after so many years. I heard this one and i didn't like it at all. The reason was the lack of thrash. They changed from thrash which they're known for and slowed it way down. Like I've been saying before, I don't like when bands do that. If they're known for thrash, don't change it unless I'm happy with it. I was disappointed in this one,they really let me down. If a band changes from a style that sucks to one that's descent that's different but they did the opposite this time. Believe me, this is NOT the Slayer I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF CRAP","review":"SLayer has a loyal legion of fans since their beginning, but the fact is: this new CD is horrible. I don't fear agression, I just think this is bull, this isn't rock, nor metal, nor music itself! The only record they ever did that it was worthwhile listening to was \\"SOUTH OF HEAVEN\\". Skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album is for Chicks Only","review":"Buy one of their first five albums-Thats REAL Slayer-They don't even play any of these songs live at concerts Take it from me-Ive seen them FRONT ROW over 35 times.This album sucks-Buy Reign in Blood instead they play every song on that album live.On the other hand this album is probably going to be out of print soon- so you can buy it as a collectors item.Like garage days.But if you want good music you have to have Reign in Blood Hell Awaits Show No Mercy South of Heaven and Seasons in the Abyss.For anybody into Hard Rock you need these albums.This is one you can skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slayer is Old musically and physically:wrinkled","review":"the cd is not really that good. the music does not compare toimmortal at all. i must say that immortal is the band of the 21st century, and slayer is just as old as the gum that stuck to your show back in high school.the drummer of slayer by no chance compares at all to the mighty Horgh of immortal. THESE BANDS DEFEAT SLAYER ANY TIME, AND THEY ARE: IMMORTAL, OLD MANS CHILD, PAIN. JUST WITH IMMORTAL'S CD TITLED \\"BLIZZARD BEASTS\\" AUTOMATICALLY DEFEATS THIS BAND (slayer).immortal looks good with corpsepaint!!! Immortal is the greatest band. slayer album is no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok","review":"this is an ok cd, ill listen to it if im bored or something, slayer isnt at all a really good band, but they did something here, they made there music sound ok, slayer is getting stronger....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second only to the unattainable greatness of REIGN IN BLOOD!","review":"The heading says it all! Slayer are once again proving that they rule the Earth. No other band even comes close. This time around they return to what made them SLAYER--Tom Araya's awesome, blood curdling vocals backed by the best tandem of \\"Axe-slingers\\" Jeff Hanneman & Kerry \\"Help, I'm Bald\\" King. I recently attended my fifth Slayer show at the Warehouse in Toronto and I must say it was excellent once Paul Bostaph caught up to the rest of the band-They definitely miss the master-Dave Lombardo. This is a must hear!!! five stars.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh wow, what happened?","review":"For the first time I was bored by a Slayer album. Technically, the musicianship and production are great. However, the songs are sort of blah and after several listens I buried in my cd collection. Pulled it out a few months later hoping for something to sound different but it didn't so I sold it at the local used cd shop. But since they are a great band who have done better work in the past, I'll still give the next one a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Slayer, all out gods of aggressive thrash metal. After losing drummer Dave Lombardo, I don't think they fared that badly on Divine Intervention, which actually had some of their fastest stuff on it. Diabolus In Musica however, sounds practically pop. Apart from track one, there are now lightening fast riffs, just easy listening 5mph metal ala Korn or Coal Chamber. You have expect Tom Araya to start rapping at any minute.On the plus side, the first track Bitter Peace is one of the heaviest they've ever done, and would fit easily on Reign In Blood, the rest are very nu-metal sounding. The riffs are okay I guess, but for me they sound too pop. One would have expected Slayer to perhaps pursue a more aggressive direction ala At The Gates or something, not go the opposite way and start making pop. Stay clear of this, go get Reign In Blood or Seasons In The Abyss instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaboluly Good!","review":"This is another good album from Slayer. I am a big fan of them so my opinion is not parcial. From my point of view, it is not the best from them, but still a good and solid album."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE THING IS SLOW DOWN; ANOTHER ONE IS TO SELL OUT....","review":"SLAYER slowed things down for this album, but the songs are still strong, dark, a little bit macabre here. There's no reason to see this as just a band trying to improve or make things slightly different. The lyrics are aheavy as always. It's a very differenet approach than Metalllica did, completingly sellling-out to mainstream MTV and giving the finger to their old fans. (by the way, I despise Metallica now - gave - for free- all my albuns except MASTER OF PUPPETS, just to rembember...). SLAYER is a band with attitude, without being arrogant,a band who respects their fans, a band that doesn't release acoustic records nor orchestrated records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Slayer. Poor Us.","review":"Remember the good old days? Seasons in the Abyss... Reign in Blood... South of Heaven. Slayer was the king of thrash metal. I remember those days too, which why I have to say that this sludgy, droning album must have been made by alien imposters. The tracks are interchangeable, and none are memorable. Sure, it's heavy, but in that phlegmatic Godsmack kind of way. Buy their ealier albums if you don't yet have them, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD.,,,very modernesque","review":"Awesome CD>. not as solo-y and 80's thrashish as older stuff.. but still a great cd.. one of my faves..."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALBUM RULES","review":"A lot of people are whining that this album sounds like slayer has lost their touch, but believe me, they have NOT. I consider this to be one of their best. There are some changes in their sound, such as the bassline is much clearer than before and the vocals are easier to understand, but other than that it is still the same great slayer we love, and it rocks just as hard and just as fast if not more. They have only improved with age. Unless you are some kind of alternative-worshipping neo-metallica wussy, buy this album right now. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S SLAYER AT THEIR BEST!","review":"FOR THE SLAYER FANS WITH THE HEALTHIEST APPETITES,DIABOLUS IS A 20 COURSE MEAL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losin' speed","review":"This album is not as good as these people say it is.

Some of you people are way to hard on this album. While some of you consider it a \\"sellout\\", and some of you don't like it because it can get repetitive, I love this album and still think it rocks hard. Sure, it is a bit repetitive, and it's not the same sound that Slayer patented back in the Haunting the Chapel days, but...is that necessarily a bad thing? Songs like \\"Bitter Peace\\", \\"Death's Head\\", \\"Love to Hate\\", \\"Perversions of Pain\\", \\"Scrum\\", \\"Point\\", \\"In the name of God\\" all rock, some in a different way then before. And while their seems to be more of a neo-metal influence, this album should prove that Slayer isn't dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayer kicks everybody's ---","review":"The most evil,hair raising experience. Slayer can destroy all of those wimpy bands"},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is...WOW!!","review":"This album was probably what got me into death metal in the first place.I especially liked \\"Love to Hate\\",\\"scrum\\",and \\"bitter peace\\". Just this last Friday (April 30)I saw Slayer on their Diobolus in Musica tour. My love for this band has been increased threefold. I think I may just have to buy all their albums now...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly underrated!","review":"After the average Divine Intervention, and the covers album Undisputed Attitude, Slayer realized that they wanted to do something a little bit differently on this release with the excellent Rick Rubin. By adding downtuned guitars, thick grooves, and great songwriting, Slayer slows down (a little) and shows why they are easily one of the greatest metal bands on the planet. Even with the moments of faux-rapping on Love to Hate and Stain of Mind, this is far---very far from nu-metal. This is still angry thrash with loads of ripping guitar solos. Instant classics include Bitter Peace, Overt Enemy, Stain of Mind, and Scrum. This is a MUST purchase for fans of Reign In Blood, South of Heaven, and Seasons In The Abyss."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the best but still great cd!","review":"this is the first full cd to feature the new slayer sound heavier not always faster,the band hinted the song gemini would show the new slayer sound,and with this cd they start the change which I didn't right away like that much but it proves more than 10 years later to be a solid slayer cd.some times this seams to be a departure from old school but it had to be after devine intervention didn't deleive to be the next riegn in blood(also a great cd)but the old school fans lost some interest and it didn't bring more to the table.as the times change,slayer had to evolve too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious","review":"I wish I had seen the other reviews before renting this movie. I also thought it was the other movie, THE black dahlia. This version is uncredible atrocious, with a totally incomprehensible plot, real bad acting and a similar stupid ending.

Whats with that chick dog soldier, and all those YOUNG PUNKS up to chopping up babes and scattering them all over the place, and that Hopscotching all over. What is this. This has nothing to do with the Black Dahlia at all. All this director can do is make a comedy over a serious murder that happenen in 1947 and make money off this con film. If you are a collector of worst films this is the one to get. Go ahead and spend your hard earned money on this piece of TRASH. The movie directed by Brian De Palma is the closest you can get to the Black Dahlia."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLOODY AWFUL WASTE OF TIME","review":"This one is sitting in a landfill someplace.

This film is made by a really awful german horror film director who for some reason, continually pumps out terrible films. Most of them are only watched because he is constantly exploiting other current movies. Like this film which came out close to the time of Brian DePalma's film. This director also made a film called Boogey Man, which not surprisingly is almost a scene for scene remake of John Carpenter's Halloween.

The special effects are terrible, the camera looks like a video camera someone bought in a electronics store, the acting is awful, and I didn't understand the plot at all.

Even in fast-forward, the story was painstakingly slow, thin, transparent, and left the viewer feeling cheated. We will be complaining to Blockbuster for shelving this item. It is not fair to offer this decoy to customers.Amateur acting, no plot, unprofessional cinematography, and devoid of direction. This film sucked.

Anyone who's not \\"right for the part\\" is cheerfully tortured and killed, complete with random nudity and dancing in blood. There's a bizarre subplot with idiotic detectives and an old man to whom psycho girl is caretaker or somehow related, who may have killed the original Black Dahlia and wants to try a new one . . .The whole deal is several shades of rotten, from the z-movie budget to the random Eon McKai-style editing.

Bad story line, really really bad acting, the camera work is worse than most home movies (couldn't they get a professional cameraman?)The only reason I even saw this movie, was that my wife rented it for me THINKING this was the OTHER \\"Black Dahlia\\" movie recently released. When she brought it home I thought that this was about the murder of Elizabeth Short. I was wrong and I feel that Ulli Lommel is a cheap huckster ripping people off!

Obvious advice that you already know, expressed in quite a condescending tone: take responsibility when you do something wrong and make it right, don't be a slacker, etc.2. Advice that might have made sense in the 1950s, but that will cripple your career if you follow it in this century. The author imagines a cozy, predictable, unchanging business world that yields success to rigid, top-down, head-in-the-sand, command-and-control organizations, and to workers who model themselves as square cogs in square wheels, closing themselves off to innovation and to communication, thought and life beyond their own departments and corporations. These attitudes are not what winning firms want in their new hires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master of the Obvious","review":"This book is great for someone who has never been in the work force or has never had any work ethic before. Basically the clueless. Clearly not for someone who has worked more than 5 years.This book is merely a list of traits an ideal employee should have. I kept waiting for the meat. This book is completely unhelpful in these economic times because savvy candidates (particularly those who were successful before and but for the economic downturn) know to say these things already and perspective employers know it.That being said, I would recommend for my children to hear this in high school and then again upon graduating from college. BTW I think my view explains why the Amazon reviewer Thomas Carlyle (England) at age 22 and his brother who just graduated from college gave this book 5 stars.Save your money (particularly if you are unemployed)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old School","review":"I listened to this audio book in preparation for an interview. It came across as very old school. Basically do whatever you can to suck up to your boss, the boss is of supreme importance, believe this and you will make it to the corner office.

Instead of this recording helping me prepare for my interview I found myself incredulously amused at its content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic.","review":"Who wrote this book, Gordon Gekko on steroids? Not only are his suggestions unrealistic, they're sycophantic. I felt like I was getting bullied by frat boys listening to this. Anyone who says these in an interview or implies them in a cover letter would come across as an insincere backslapper. I can't imagine these promises applied in any practical way to a real job, let alone make a positive impression on an interviewer. If you have to promise to sleep over and risk your own health to your boss at the interview, is that really the job you want? Or would be offered?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worst material on job interviews I've ever come across.","review":"I can't imagine anyone being taking seriously in a job interview if they were to actually apply the advice outlined in this material.

I loved the clean, concise language. The writer knows business, and knows what it takes to make it in business.Unlike most books, this is not a tome. Which is good. You can listen to it over and over again.

Instead of talking about intervewier's psychology, tricks, mistakes, common techniques and questions and giving idea of how to better behave on an interview this book goes on an on about \\"I love the job! I get things done! I take responsibility!\\" Such obvious things repeated over and over in imperative, brainwashing tone sound irritating. The book also goes out of its own scope and talks too much about how to change, tweak (or freak, if you like) your personality to achieve some career advancements. This is completely irrelevant to the subject. For professional jobs nowadays it is often the company who is more interested in you, not vice-versa, therefore staying with your interests and personality is very important."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless advice","review":"This book is not worth the weight of tape it was recorded on.The advices are outdated.

Derleth studied the works of Lovecraft but NEVER did he write in collaboration with the master of horror. August Derleth's first story wasn't written until the early 1950's. Howard Philips Lovecraft died in 1937. August Derleth has many failed attempts at immitating Lovecraft and prints Lovecraft's name on the cover of all his books because if people knew that Derleth wrote the stories, they wouldn't buy a single copy. If you wish to read horror by the greatest horror author of all time, be sure to check the coyright lines for each story. Stray from the failures of Derleth and follow the guiding light of Lovecraft."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH GOD IT HURTS","review":"Wow, I never knew books could just drone on and on like this on did. The only reason i gave this book two stars instead of one is because it has it's interesting points. The last half of the last section of the book comes to mind. But other then that this book is not worth the paper it was printed on. This is the first \\"Lovecraft\\" book I've read and am far from impressed. At times i actually found myself dozing off while reading this book. Now I'm about eightteen pages from the end, and decided to save them for before I go to bed, for sure, it will put me to sleep.

Yawn. Lovecraft did it once, and did it better, in \\"The Rats in the Walls\\".Fortunately, Derleth pulls of the repeated plot a lot better here than he did elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read (even if it's not really Lovecraft)","review":"BEWARE! Carroll & Graf are lying to you! This book is really by long-time friend of H.P.'s August Derleth! DO NOT BE FOOLED! I was, and I'm frankly a bit pissed, but nevertheless...It's true: Derleth merely uses a few snippets of Lovecraft's stuff to embellish it with his own. Granted, it is a fine book, but it really should say, at least, \\"by Derleth and Lovecraft.\\" It's false advertising - no more, no less. The text is approximately 2% Lovecraft's!!! But enough bitching, it's a great book, quite chilling.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make the same mistake I did!","review":"I purchased this book under the pretense that it was written by Lovecraft. After hearing so much praise about HPL, I couldn't wait to start reading it. After the first few chapters, it became a chore to read. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. It was like eating a bowl of tofu when you expected Captain Crunch. When I finished it I was convinced all the hype about HPL was blown out of proportion and that he was nothing more than a less than mediocre author. Little did I know he didn't even write it! It took me over 3 years to find this out. When I finally did get my hands on an authentic Lovecraft book I was floored by the way he drew me right into the story-the dark and shadowy world of Innsmouth. Don't buy \\"The Lurker at the Threshhold\\". Save your time and money and be sure to check the copywrite before you buy any Lovecraft book(Derleth is sneaky)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The usual Derlethian mess","review":"August Derleth's \\"posthumous collaboration\\" with his idol H.P. Lovecraft (despite the credit, Lovecraft's contributions are merely snippets of his writing journal) is just all over the map, trying to tie three unrelated plot strands together through the usual Derlethian haunted house mumbo-jumbo. Some chilling sequences, but Derleth has jimmed so much mythos information into the story that it reads less as a horror novel and more like some junior high school kid's diary of all the \\"neat stuff\\" in Lovecraft.

The company gives a free month of service to try it out and then it costs $30 annually, about $2.50 a month. To me, this small fee is worth it when the end-user (without a landline), is a computer novice and wants to make scans into PDFs. EmailThatWorks told me that they plan to continue to support POP before SMTP / LB4S / POP AUTH authentication for a long time to come.

Every question I asked was followed by, \\"Could you hold on for a minute?\\" while he read an answer from the manual I had already read before the call.

They said \\"tough luck, it's outside the 30-day warranty period\\" even though I initiated contact WITHIN the warranty period. So I can't tell you about receiving faxes or print quality. As for sending...it pulls multiple pages, it jams after every page, and best of all, it sends one page and then hangs up. Great when sending a 40-page fax on a deadline.

There's nothing cosier that sitting in a lovely warm living room reading an Christie novel while it's raining outside.That being said, this novel is very odd and uninspiring. It's not one of her typical murder mysteries...and it's all very farfetched and just barely comes together in the end.Fans of her usual material might seem a bit baffled by this 'novel'. This probably would have made a fine screenplay...but there's not enough coherence or guts to it, to make it a good novel as such. The characters also, are rather forgettable.

I almost began wishing Hillary HAD decided to kill herself. I got this book among 8 more books by Agatha Christie, and even though this is the first one I began reading, I know it's the most boring.

Brilliant scientists are mysteriously disappearing from all over the world, and the British secret service races to discover where they've gone and why.Hilary Craven, a strong and lovely young Englishwoman who is traveling to Morocco to escape from the desperate tragedy of her life, finally realizes that she is trying to escape from herself and the pain she carries with her, so she decides to end her life. Hilary's blazing red hair turns out to be a surprising gift, however, and at this point the Secret Service makes contact with her. Hilary is sent off into the ancient cities of Africa on a wild and dangerous mission replete with the near-certainty of failure and death.Destination Unknown is a colorful and vivid spy thriller remarkable for its well-paced character development, as Hilary progresses from brokenness and utter despair to strength and courage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"Kerényi's scholarship *might* include a touch of fantasy, but on the whole, it is well-researched, and he provided documentation for his claims through extensive footnotes.

A closer, archaeological reading would show a high percentage of his \\"facts\\" contradicting each other - how can you support Hellenistic mystery cults with evidence from non-Greek Minoan Crete?

It really is despicable of Princeton to tarnish their reputation with their Bollingen imprint, and I feel like a sucker to have wasted my money on such a preposterously worthless book, and I wish that Amazon.com would put a warning label on the Bollingen imprints, so clearthinking people can be more careful when ordering.

The protagonist, Jack Knight, is a refreshing change of pace from typical comic hero. As the son of the legendary hero Starman, Jack has no desire to take his fathers place as defender of Opal City, and is content to run his \\"antique\\" shop(He sells 1950's Hawaiin shirts, old comics, vintage transistor radios, etc.) But Fate intervenes and Jack must become the new Starman to save his city, his Father, and himself.

It's got science, mystery, romance, cowboys, pirates, and some of the most pure heroism that was presented in the grim and shallow world of 1990's comics. This is one of those great series, Sandman-style, which is loved by comic and non-comic readers alike. This is where I first saw the pencils of Ex Machina artist Tony Harris. I had such a man crush on this creative team, when I met them at a convention in 1996 I giggled Japanese schoolgirl style and averted my eyes. I palpitate at the thought! James Robinson complimented me on my shirt, which I had cleaned especially for the occasion. This is the comic that made me love DC comics, made me embrace my inner collector, and kept me returning to the comic store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"This product is too small to really be able to shake up 5 dice.

You certainly would not walk away being able to set up a PKI, but you would be able to discuss it intelligently. If you are trying to come up to speed on PKI, this is the book for you.

I recommend it to any Big Stone Gap fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The third time's the charm.......","review":"Adriana Trigiani hits another home run with this 3rd installment in the Big Stone Gap novels. Actually the first and third were better than the middle novel, Big Cherry Holler. In Milk Glass Moon, Ave Maria and Jack go from parents of a pre pubescent to parents of a full grown woman and discover their love for each other is still going strong. Ave and Jack weather teen angst, breast cancer in their inner circle, the return of some old flames, and the question of \\"what to do with the second half of our lives.\\" Somehow by the end of the novel, the reader knows that no matter what Ave and Jack decide to do with the next 50 years, they will still be together and still be happy. Milk Glass Moon lets us revisit some of our favorite characters from the series and ends just at the right moment. No hanging on too long to become insipid and boring. Trigiani spins a great tale that fans of the series will want to read again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the first 2, but disappointed now","review":"The first 2 books were great! I couldn't wait for Milk Glass.Maybe my expectations were too high. There wasn't much of a story line in this one. It was just day to day. No big news or anything to keep the pages turning. It was still a pleasant read, and easy to follow but it just lacked the impact of the other 2 books. I'm still a fan and can't wait for Trigiani's next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Two","review":"After reading book one, Big Stone Gap, it was a treat to be able to continue to follow the lives of the characters.

I call this one of my \\"feel good\\" books (Please note, I feel the same way about Fannie Flagg's books) - you want to pack up and move to Big Stone Gap and be a part of their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The third book in the \\"Big Stone Gap\\" quartet","review":"After following the troubled MacChesney marriage in the second book, readers now focus on the adolescent Etta as she struggles with growing up. Her mother Ave Maria, too, has difficulty allowing her daughter this passage, especially after losing her toddler son Joe to leukemia.Yet, like her mother, Etta promises to become a strong young woman. This doesn't make the MacChesneys any easier, though, when longtime family friend Stefano Grassi comes to visit from Italy...This book is the second of the \\"Big Stone Gap\\" quartet; the fourth book is scheduled for release at the end of October 2006."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Third in the Trilogy, different but good","review":"I adore the Big Stone Gap series, and wish there were more to look forward to. This third one was different than the previous two (what fun would it be if they were the same?), and had a different tone all together. A lot of it centers on Italy, and less on Big Stone Gap-- and I missed it. But all the same characters are there, and it is great to watch Ava Maria change and age, as well as her daughter. Lots of good surprises in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"While I didn't completely hate it","review":"it didn't have that special something that Big Stone Gap did. I loved Big Stone Gap, liked Big Cherry Holler, but there was something missing in this one. There is nothing new or exciting here. New characters are introduced then not truly developed, the old ones don't get nearly as much attention. I just don't understand why Ave Maria doesn't make her break out of Stone Gap when she has the most stimulating conversation with Theodore than she's had for months at home and still feels like such an outsider. Surely a pharmacist could find work anywhere she would choose to. We are all set up to see Ave Maria and Jack Mac again, next time in Italy. Hopefully Adrianna Trigiani will be able to recapture the original magic of the first book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've read the first two in the series.

As another reviewer said, there is little to no character development. The protagonist comes off as a shallow whiner who thinks her moronic pithy sayings pass for philosophy. I only finished the book because I paid too much for it On Kindle. I have a hard time knowing how books are priced on Amazon: too often I don't feel I get what I paid for. And then again, I have totally enjoyed older classics and books priced at less than a dollar!Anyway, it's unbelievable that this book got so many 4 and 5 star reviews? Spend your money elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Going out with a thump","review":"I loved Big Stone Gap so much that when Big Cherry Holler came out I grab it without hesitation and enjoyed reading about the evolution of all the realtionships that I came to love in the first novel. BUT Milk Glass Moon is soooo boring I can barely keep my motivation to read it through to the end. Ave Maria is so annoying and still has all the same insecurities as the first novel. I thought that she resolved alot of her insecurities in Big Cherry Holler. Poor Jack Mac and Etta, they have to live with her. There were so many opportunities to turn this book around. With a focus on Jack or Etta and how they have dealt with living in the Gap, the loss of Joe or just living with Ave.Sorry to say, but I just can't recommend this book to anyone. The first and second novels were such hits but this one is such a miss. Please Ms. Trigianni end the series here before I forget why I loved your writing in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Note to Adriana","review":"Adriana - I hope you get the time to read these reviews, honey, because you're really on the right track. As your novels have progressed, your writing has become more eloquent, yet remaining grounded and fully accessible.

Keep it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I really enjoyed the 1st 2 books but found that I had to force myself to finish this one.

What a disappointment. It took a lot of effort to keep reading to the end. It was one cliched situation after another, there was no real story going on, and all of the characters (whom I once loved) were just plain annoying. I don't know what happened with the author this time. It's like she figured the characters were just so endearing that anything they could do or say would be loved by the reader. If you decide to read this book, go into it with low expectations. Then maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"The author is becoming the \\"same old same old\\"...nothing beats her first novel or Valentine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Ah, five scenes and none of them are anything like the pictures on the front, sides, or back of the video box. Instead we get the following scenes. First, Betty gyrating in a living room -- no bondage here that I could see. Second, she puts on very high heels which could be seen as bondage in some form. Third she is kidnapped by a rather silly pair of women. Third she is taken by a woman and complies with being tied up in a pseudo-suspension fashion -- the look on Betty's face is amusing. Fourth, she and another woman kidnap a third, dump her in the back of a car then go no where but the backyard to try and tie her up. Fifth she disciplines another woman. The spanking is silly, the bondage is foolish, and it was very disappointing to never see Betty as the whip-welding dom on the cover of the box. I guess for the 1950s this was hot stuff -- just not today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$","review":"Though a useful tool, for what it is and does......

Unless you're pointing the neck down toward the ground, be prepared for unexpected star power launches. Also, when you're holding down long notes, don't be surprised if they suddenly aren't being held down anymore. And when you write to customer service about the worst gamer guitar you've ever played (and I've got five others), be prepared for them to ignore you. It wouldn't be so bad if they would at least release a downloadable update to make this game compatible with the \\"Rock Band\\" guitars (like there is with \\"World Tour\\" and \\"GH: Aerosmith\\"), which are much better controllers than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"So much fun, but if you want to play on experte mode you'll need A LOT of practice... get a second guitar!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"I love this game!

After a returned it my second controller had issues. The whammy bar was always activated and it is nearly impossible to activate the star power. I need to hold the base of the guitar by the bottom with both hands and whip it around the room to activate the star power. I researched the problem in forums and found out that there are a lot of other people with the same problem. Do NOT buy the bundle. The new controller is horrible it ruins the game.

Wow, really?The only value for me was realizing that it's ok to preview texts before reading (or even instead of reading). But that's a bit of a personal realization and any speed-reading guide probably would've given me that.

Maybe because both languages were independently translated from the original Hebrew and Greek texts into English and Japanese respectively. So sometimes (actually quite a few times) there are no one-on-one equivalents. This aspect makes a bilingual bible less meaningful, especially for English speaking people who want to learn Japanese or Japanese speaking people who want to learn English. I hope one day Japanese scholars will directly translate the NIV English version into Japanese version, just like the Living Bible and the Goodnews Bible having their own Japanese counterparts. Also the print size is way too small. Other than these two aspects it is a pretty good bilingual bible for reference purpose only.

It was adequate but not up to the superlative quality I expect from L. Frank Baum. This book, however, sets things to right. It reads more like the Oz books and even includes characters such as Button Bright and Polychrome who make numerous appearances in the Oz series. It is a fun book that I enjoyed even with my youth far behind me.In this story, Trot meets Button Bright who has a magical umbrella which takes him where he wants to go. Trot, Button Bright and Cap'n Bill decide to use the umbrella to take them for a picnic out on an island just off the coast. Instead of being taken to that island, however, they wind up on and island in the sky inhabited by tow warring peoples. Our characters wind up in the middle and have to set everyone straight.It is a delightful tale which should appeal to both boys and girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sky Island, no illustrations","review":"Probably my fault, but I understood that this edition included illustrations from the original publication, which are wonderful.

I've really liked (loved) some CDs and songs and rated him as one of my favorite artists. I was anticipating this CD and am very, very disappointed. It meanders all over the place, like how Ryan himself meanders all through a performance. I've seen Ryan perform live twice. Each time, I wonder if he even knows where he is. He reminds me very much of a friend of mine who has ADD. I often wonder if Ryan has ADD, but it's probably just the booze and drugs.Ryan Adams is/was/might be a good song writer, good musician, or good singer. However, one CD after another simply meanders across a range of styles and emotions. I bought this CD, but will NOT buy Jacksonville City Nights or any others. After experiencing how he treats (mistreats) his fans at his concerts, I'd rather give my money to better musicians and better people. Check out Neil Young's Prairie Wind for a far superior artist and a much better person!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real snoozer","review":"If you're looking for more upbeat Ryan Adams' songs like New York, New York....well, look elsewhere.

He can either R&R and whisper in his songs and everything in between. To me he tells so many stories I feel in my guts. In his songs he often discribes the way my live is going down the road. I've seen him perform live in a solo set here in Holland in Utrecht. Just him, a piano and 1500 people hanging at his lips. He was ill that day I think the flue but what he brought on stage was amazing. This CD Cold roses again knocked me off my seat when I first heard it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Soundtrack To Your Break-Up","review":"I discovered this album during the break-up from what I thought was my soulmate.

All the songs have a folky, but rocky characteristic. There is less of the mopey 80's sound from his last albums (sans Rock N' Roll). The Cardinals, and Ryan himself, sound a lot like American Beauty/Workingman's Dead era Grateful Dead on Cold Roses. The Dead references are almost too much - Magnolia Mountain? Cold Roses? However, he pulls it off. This isn't some hippie-dippie two chord noodly stuff, but good folky songwriting, just like the two albums I mentioned by The Dead. Everyone knows Ryan Adams is a brat - I once heard he kicked a guy out of his show for requesting Summer of 69' :) - but, you can't help to like him with material like this. I would rank his songwriting up there with Springsteen now, no joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Trouble","review":"The lost highway troubadour is back with another great set of tunes, ranging from rock to folk and alt.country. It is difficult to understand how someone can be this prolific (he apparently has another two sets ready to go) and still find such engaging and tuneful ways to talk about love and life. Magnolia Mountain is an instant classic and Let It Ride is quite amazing.I don't buy this assertion that Ryan is striking back against Conor Oberst's two releases. I say forget the media hyperbole; just sit back and enjoy an artist who is quietly amassing one hell of a body of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is beautiful, it sure is!","review":"'The Man We Call Ryan Adams' has an amazing output of beautiful songs that tingle your spine. For me the instant mark of quality. This reminds me a bit of Elvis Costello's best years of songwriting: a ongoing, incredible lot of excellent musical jewels, created in a relatively short period of his career.Long live Ryan's creative flow! 'Cold Roses' grows on you, give it time. It gets better and better everyday and anyone who liked 'Heartbreaker' or 'Love is Hell' pts. 1 & 2 should buy his latest effort at once and be amazed by numbers like 'When Will You Come Back Home', 'Mockingbird', 'How Do You Keep Love Alive', 'Let It Ride' and 'Cold Roses'. This man and his band are very beneficial for your health. Godspeed Ryan & His Cardinals!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An American beauty.","review":"Will the real Ryan Adams please stand up. This might just be the album alot of people have been waiting for. Past efforts of his have been fairly different and rather spotty, but \\"Cold Roses\\" is no doubt alt-country, and is very consistent. In fact, I don't know how obvious it is, but I detect a huge Grateful Dead influence on this album, on everything from the song titles, to the artwork, and of course the music. Actually when I saw him recently I think he admitted that. I also think the Cardinals are a great band, and I hope they can tolerate him for awhile. Not every track here is a winner, but this is well worth it for \\"Magnolia Mountain\\", \\"Sweet Illusions\\", \\"When Will You Come Back Home?\\", \\"Cold Roses\\", and the great \\"Let It Ride\\".

I have all of Ryan Adams' previous albums, and I love and treasure them all, but there's always been one of two songs on all of them I haven't really liked, but that is not the case with Cold Roses. I rate it 5-stars because I think every single song, from beginning to end is great. The melodies, the harmony, the lyrics, everything. A lot of them sounds really personal too, like Heartbreaker, and it seems like every song is perfect. I saw an interview Ryan did on Much Music and he said \\"I know I'm not the greatest song writer in the world and I'm never going to be- but I really love doing it, and it doesn't hurt anybody\\". After this, I could argue many he is one of the great ones! I hope everyone who buys this album enjoys it as much as me.

If you ever listened to jam-bands and thought, \\"hmmm, I wonder if anyone can recapture that feeling of a 4:51 song being too short?\\", you've found it. 18 tracks and 86ish minutes later, you're glad Ryan stopped by.

It's a waste of your time. Find another book that accurately assesses the scripture instead.

What happened to free choice and how God will not step over that? I will obey God rather than man anytime.

Ultimately what the author is saying is that when he, the husband, screws up, it is HIS responsibility to account for it to God. When WE make our own decisions that makes US accountable. Using submission this way takes us right off the hook with God. Personally that took a huge weight off my shoulders.

But in fact, there is no instruction in the Bible that we must obey our husbands. That is extra Biblical and reading a lot into passages that is not there. The one most often used of course is Eph 5:22, where it talks about wives. Then it goes on to talk about slaves, and the greek word where it does tell slaves to obey their masters is a completely different word than the one used for wives. Paul knew what he was doing.

Or you can try to squeeze the oversized buds into your ear canals, taking them out 15 minutes later when you can't stand the pain any longer. The discomfort does go away after a few days, once your ears have been broken in.Repeatedly removing the buds from your ears will eventually cause the foam padding to come off. I was able to wriggle to foam back over the buds, but after it continued to fall off again and again, I stopped bothering. Since the foam adds to the size of the earbuds, removing the pads actually increased the comfort level.The sound quality is about on par with laptop speakers, which is perfectly satisfactory to me.

The bud was WAY too large for my ears and once in, it was a painful experience. Essentially it was like jamming hard plastic into my ears. I also had to crank my mp3 player all the way up and I still had troubles hearing (I wore them at work, which is a semi loud setting).

I am going to recommend you stay away from this set for two reasons:1) Due to the large and uncomfortable size, my ears would have a feeling of soreness after wearing these for an extended period of time.2) The sound quality is inferior in a way that can best be described as having a lack of bass.I highly recommend purchasing SONY earbuds instead of this cheapo set.

The sound, while OK, especially for the price, is still not very good. I've had headphones of the same price that worked much better than these.

They offer poor sound quality in all frequency ranges. In addition to that, they wear your ear out because of a poor fit and the fact that they don't stay in place. By wearing your ear out, I mean just that. They actually tire your ears out from the fitting, or lack there of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very VERY dissappointing.","review":"While the quality was pretty good, I was distracted by the fact that the output was very little; at full blast, could only hear at normal levels. The earpieces are big and dont seem to be erganomicaly designed for ears. The foam covers were a little helpful for that problem, but fell off very easily, like if you store them in your pocket instead of the carying case, and when the covers are gone, the phones became very annoying to listen through.I recently bought the panasonic RP-HV152 to replace them and all of the problems of the Koss product were fixed by the Panasonic product. At a similar price range, about four to five dollars, it is a much better suggestion and reccomendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"My ears must not be normal...","review":"While I agree with the other reviewer who said the sound quality on these ear buds is great, I was not able to make these stay in my ears, no matter how hard I tried. On the rare occasion when they did stay, I soon had to remove them because of the pain they caused. The \\"bud\\" part that goes into the ear seems overly large, the padding is thin and easily removable, and there is nothing for the ear to grab on to.

I'm not much into heavy-duty home repair but I have used this to build simple box furniture. I've had no problems with the drill, either saws, the sander and have not had the need for the router yet. The one battery did die on me fairly soon so I bought an additional battery and the better battery charger (recommended by amazon customers).

The only attachments that didn't kill the battery quickly were the drill and maybe the saw wasn't great. The other pieces especially the router and jigsaw drained both batteries noticably in about 15 minutes. I've found the router adequate only for edge and laminate work but way underpowered for anything else.Don't even get me started on the safety start mechanism. You must depress a button on the attachments before the trigger will engage. This is especially maddening and awkward with the router.Save your money and buy the real versions of each tool you really need instead of this poor compromise on all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid tool; smart design.","review":"All interchangable heads mounted easily, quickly and securely. Drill: two (variable) speeds; adjustable clutch; nice amount of torque. Router: only mounts 1/4\\" bits; does a nice job edging shelves; worked surprisingly well. Sander: of limited use, but it worked fine; lots of B+D \\"Mouse\\" accessories available. Jig Saw: cuts quickly; buy an assortment of blades (metal, wood, etc). Circular Saw: cuts very quickly with little waste (thin kerf); great for sheets of plywood, mdf board and drywall; only cuts to a depth of one-inch. Overall, this tool is great for the small home workshop. I feel at ease when the kids cut wood for birdhouses using this tool rather than a full-size C-saw or (eeek!) a tablesaw.

The only thing I can suggest to make it better is to get more batteries. They seem to need a recharge rather quickly. With only two batteries, I was killing both before the first one could recharge.

A few remarks: The people whose reviews said that he did not have good evidence did not provide anything better to argue their side. So, without what they consider sufficient evidence for either argument (child abuse is or isn't a social construction), they side with the status quo. In other words, they never even thought about it. Kincaid always told us that he didn't pretend to have unearthed any absolute truth, he just thought it was valid to see things in ways that make you uncomfortable. I hate to sound like a fanatic, but honestly, I've never thought of the world in the same way since having his class. Also, his writing is always well-crafted and frequently hilarious (check out Annoying the Victorians)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly-supported thesis","review":"While Kincaid makes a number of interesting points on the way Western culture venerates The Child (and includes some insightful historical and literary evidence), the book falls apart after the introductory chapters.

Waffles come out with a thin and very crisp crust on the outside with a moist cotton-like interior.

The timer allows adjustments in 15 second increments to fine-tune your waffles. After the timer counts down in blue, the maker beeps and starts counting up in red. This helps you determine how much time to add if your waffles are not yet perfect and need a little more cooking. Once dialed in, the timer retains the set time between sessions, even if the maker is unplugged.Yes, it's expensive, but this is a clear example of getting what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pro Line Pommels The Awful Waffle","review":"This is simply the best waffle maker available.

Adding fruits or nuts?, No problem. No need for cooking sprays, in fact they only get in the way. The only drawbacks are the weight and the cost. It is somewhat pricey for what some would consider a novelty food. However, waffles can made as lunch and dinner entrees too. (Try adding bits of precooked ham or ricotta cheese and basil or a bit of cayenne to the batter.) A small person or one with weak or arthritic hands might have difficulty moving the iron from a cabinet to a work surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This waffle iron actually does make two waffles in 3.5 minutes. The batter works best if it is a bit thicker than normal, one then immediately flips the iron and sets the timer. I found it works best if one waits 2 minutes before adding the second waffle. Once the second waffle is added, immediately flip it, placing the first waffle on top. When the timer sounds, take the first waffle out, add more batter, restart the timer and flip it. When 1.5 minutes have passed remove the second waffle, add more batter and immediately flip it. The key seems to be to immediately flip the machine once the batter is poured.I used a buttermilk (not low-fat), Bisquick, oil and 2 egg mixture in a two-quart mixing bowl.So far I've had two waffle parties (20 people at the first and 5 at the second).

The writing style is unique and pleasant. It is a very interesting, and unfortunately sad story about Indian life on the great plains.

The Indians suffered strategically from a lack of organization, but their whole life style was about independence and in fact a much more pure form of democracy in selecting and de-selecting their leaders. In reading the story with regard to the lies and deceipt of the white men it reminded me that world politics and war is no different today than then.

It is written in the vernacular of a Native American who speaks English tolerably well, and I believe this adds a great deal of character to the writing. The story of Crazy Horse's life is a sad one filled with the mistrust and back-stabbing deeds of his own people, along with the well known deeds committed by the American settlers and soldiers. Crazy Horse's ultimate downfall was aided by the restraining hands of his own people, as foretold by his vision. A sad ending to his life indeed, but Sandoz's re-telling provides a fascinating work of history.

His work is redundant. I would never purchase another book by this man. It is difficult to suggest others read a book when I have heard the message from the man himself. He speaks with bitterness and demeaning tones. He proclaims emphatically...\\"There is no such thing as a learning disability.\\" He declared that 9 out of 10 K-1 teachers are terrible. The presentation was one offensive comment after another. I left his presentation saddened and disappointed. I thought the man behind the words in his books was so much more. Every book I had purchased by this man went in the trash and I will never purchase another book by him. I have to say that the fact that Cunningham publishes with him makes me think I will never purchase anything by her again either.

We experienced nothing but frustration with it until it finally ceased to even receive faxes. Evidently something happened internally and it began stripping the fax tone from the incoming fax call. Consequently, the phone would ring and ring without ever connecting to receive the fax. We sent it back as defective and purchased a Brother machine instead. I do not recommend this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money and Time","review":"All I wanted was to replace in March, 2009 my very old fax (which required rolled thermal paper) with something newer. This monstrosity is not compatable with an answer phone - sooo, my choice is either not to receive phone messages OR not to receive faxes when I'm not here.(I have only one phone line for both because I receive very few faxes but must be able to receive those.) Sharp's \\"help-line\\" people are astoundingly unaware of that fact. My situation now is to turn OFF my answer phone when I think I'll be getting a fax and turn it back on when and if the fax has arrived. How convenient is THAT? BTW, I was also told by the help-line idiots that this was a NEW model, not even shown on their website yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real turkey!","review":"I have to agree with the rest of these guys.

Obviously, the book is dated. The material is well presented, however. It presents a balance of economics, politics, cultural developments, etc. The treatment is broad but (by necessity) somewhat shallow.For the novice, this is a good one-volume history and is worth reading. The student with some background in the subject will probably find it inadequate and superficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sniveling and snarky more than useful","review":"While much of Rothbard's 'analysis' is somewhat correct none of it is original. Far more of it is a matter of snarky assertion having little to do with facts or analysis and his writing is so wildly biased towards his own political world view as to be rendered useless for any scholarly purpose other than a review of this particular economist and his writing. His dissection of Marx is about half correct though blindingly obvious, and half based on deliberate misstatement of Marx's works or of attributing the works of others to Marx. Don't get me wrong, I'm no Marxist, but it would seem to me to be a simple matter to critique Marx on a far more honest and intelligent basis than this 'economist' has done. The parts of this book which are not tortuously boring are rife with willful misinterpretation of viewpoints that are anything other than far right libertarianism. By and large, this book has been a giant waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"This is titled \\"building powder coating equipment\\" but the only directions you receive is to buy one from a local supplier!!

The story flows freely with a lucid style of writing, arresting the reader's attention from the first pages to the last, and touches a chord in the reader's heart somewhere deep, all along the way. Definitely a work of class, more so, it was Maugham's first novel. The old adage 'morning shows the day' aptly describes what the writer achieves in this work and the masterpieces that follow (Of Human Bondage, The Moon and the Sixpence, The Razor's Edge, etc.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"I first saw this at the IMAX located at the entrance to Zions National Park. Of the several IMAX films I have seen since, \\"Treasure of the Gods\\" is still my favorite. There are spectacular views of the park along with a recreation of a significant event in Zion's history.

I do not reccomend this to anyone that is a loyal rap fan. She doesn't know how to write poetry and I think its really sad when i turn on the radio and she is number one or when i turn on Mtv and they have specials about her.

While too much Deep Purple is rarely enough, this set is a ripper. Ten tracks from a festival appearance (plus, confusingly, two bonus tracks from 2000 at the same venue), well recorded, the band in top form, and Steve Morse demonstrating the style that makes him a worthy Deep Purple guitarist. I buy almost everything Deep Purple put out, and I was very impressed with this one. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic band with a fresh sound","review":"Awesome live show. The sound is clear and loud, and the band are playing great. Nice to see the band still keeping on, and they've really trimmed alot of the excess noodling and extended solos from earlier incarnations to now just rocking and jamming away. The addition of Steve Morse in 1994 really shows how refreshed these aging rockers look and play. The new material sits well with the old classic chestnuts. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live Deep Purple","review":"This cd is excellent!!! Steve Morse is great and Jon Lord and Ian Paice are on their best! Ian Gillan's voice is in really great shape and with the combination of all musicians being in tune this is one of the best live deep purple projects. Made in Japan is still their best! But considering all, this one with Steve Morse is great! Well worth the money! I will but the DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"It's a toss up as to which version of Crane's Civil War story is the worst adaptation, this one or the one with Richard \\"John Boy\\" Thomas. Both have all the appeal of moldy hardtack and rocks in your brogans.The basic story is intact, but it tumbled down hill from there. Sticking Audie Murphy in films just because he was a war hero didn't always work. He was only a fair to middling actor and trundling Bill Mauldin out was a major mistake. Mauldin should have stayed at the drawing board. Historical accuracy doesn't exist in either version. Uniforms, weapons, etc are all typical Hollywood, and while this doesn't entirely detract from the story, it does dampen the effect.Maybe a director will re-make this one. It certainly seems like re-makes are all the rage, but when you run out of ideas, fall back on what works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Again!","review":"This looks like a low budget version of a great American story.

The young men really personify a young man's innate fear of failure, fear of death, fear of combat and fear of being a coward. \\"He was a real Jim Dandy,\\" an unknown soldier says of the \\"Tall soldier,\\" who, for the purposes of the movie personifies what a REAL soldier should be -- brave, willing to give his life, going on until there is no energy left in him. But the main character personifies every human -- outwardly trying to act the part expected of him, and inwardly doubting himself. This movied really touched me. Stephen Crane's portrayal is brought to light in such a vivid way."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Hell and Back","review":"It was unclear when I purchased the DVD that it was operable only within the US DVD zone and not in Europe, where it was delivered.

What I received was a LEVITON 7599-W receptacle in a Marinco package. This is a $12 item found at almost any hardware store that Marinco is selling with a more than 300% markup. The item does not match the picture on this site, nor what is shown on the Marinco site. Out of curiosity I called WestMarine and one other store, and they verified that it is a LEVITON 7599 in the package.I wrote to the ABYC (American Boat and Yacht Council), and their response was that there is no distinction between GFCI units used on boats or in houses.In short, DO NOT buy this Marinco item.

I can unreservedly claim that \\"A Wild Thing\\" is the underlying reason that I never returned to that horrid place and learned to make my own way. A sullen, selfish girl is lost in a wilderness she claims as her hermetic home where she discovers the strength and beauty within herself and the power that comes from self-reliance and acceptance. No happy endings, no sap, and definitely NO male hero needed to come to the rescue. Just a powerful adventure that is a vehicle for a profound, life-changing message. A rare and wonderful jewel of a book, if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tick's worst nightmare","review":"There's no need to say much about this product.

They hold up wonderfully well. The plots are scrambled mysteries of economic intrigue, and the characters are memorable and a delight to visit with--at any age.The only other character in science fiction for whom I have a similar, sweet fondness is Pohl Anderson's intergallactice trader and sly Santa Clause of a devilish detective, Nicholas Van Riijn.I recommend ROBOTS HAVE NO TALES as highly as possible. This edition included an early, short, memoir by Kuttner's wife and colleague author, C.L. Moore. Note that this edition of the book is published in soft, magazie format. It is very nicely done with excellent cover and interior illustrations.A fine package, and a must-read collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear calls and no static","review":"I have found this phone to be near perfect.

Like most cordless phones, there will be a time when the handset is not around and the phone is ringing. Without a speaker phone at the base you cannot answer the phone and must find the handset.

The shaker itself is actually larger than I had expected, I'm 6' 4\\" and I would have a hard time shaking this with one hand. So if you tend to make more than one drink at a time, this is perfect in size.The shaker parts fit very well together, they have enough snugness to keep everything together without needing much force to pull them apart either. The outside has a nice chrome finish and looks pretty good on the bar.My only complaint and it's why I removed a star is that it still had machining grease on some of the parts. It took two good cleanings with soap and hot water to remove it all. So be sure to give it a good washing or two before you first use it, most was concentrated around the pouring filter.

After shaking a drink vigorously, we have, on numerous occasions had the top burst off with a loud noise and land across the kitchen. Thankfully no one has been hurt, but we have yet to figure out why this top is so unpredictable.We do not recommend under any circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Shaker","review":"I was setting up my home bar and after viewing numerous items I liked the look of this.

I rinsed this out the day it was delivered intending to use it that night, and in the process of drying in a rack, the bottom began to rust in addition to the inside of the cap. This means that every time I use it, I need to wipe rust out of the shaker before making a drink. That's stupid and I strongly encourage you to NOT buy this.Also, the shaker doesn't look like the picture. I like the way it actually looks, but it's not shiny as the one that's shown, more off a matte finish (not sure if that can be applied to stainless steel, but you get my drift).On the plus side, it doesn't leak when shaking up a drink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shaker!","review":"My husband has wanted a cocktail shaker for a long time, but I didn't want to get one that wouldn't work well.

It is silent and runs cool. It beeps (warning) at times while the engine is not running. This probably is due to low voltage from the vehicle battery, since it won't happen when I am driving and charging. The manual says that if the input voltage is low, it will sound an alarm and when that voltage falls below the designed threshold, it will shut off the inverter for safety purpose. So far so good.FOLLOW UP: This unit is still working after one year of daily use. I used it power the chargers for my company cell phone, camera batteries and an 18-volt cordless drill while on the job. APC is a large and reputable electrical engineering company with high tech products behind its name. I highly recommend this inverter. Prior this buying UPC, I had a \\"Monster Power\\" MCPI 150.

The author gets to his points quickly and concisely. He doesn't waste words in the 20 pages of text. It was a radio interview Mr. Pappadopoulos did earlier this year with a Vegas radio station that peaked my interest. I was considering learning to card count but after reading this book I am relieved that I found an alternative. I've only used the system in simulation but it does make sense and seems to be a sound progressive betting system. Card counters will not enjoy the book, but novice or recreational players will easily understand the book and flat bettors will profit from using his system.

An example of bad journalism","review":"If you take the time to write a biography of a person, isn't it part of one's research to interview their wife? Donya Fiorentino was married to or lived with David Fincher for 5 years and gave him a daughter. When they met, he was directing Pepsi commercials, and when they split up, he was an auteur. For some reason, Sharon Waxman made no effort to interview or contact Donya, and dismisses her in two sentences as an alcoholic and drug addict. In fact, Donya has been sober for 6 years, is a brilliant and creative photographer who has an edgy side to the Fincher story that has never been told. I know the truth; as Donya's physician I have heard her compelling story. Waxman also does not mention that after their divorce, she married Gary Oldman. This was written with my patient's permission, who was very hurt by this book's publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexcuseable, too many errors","review":"I am currently reading this book and came on here because I spotted several errors in the text and wanted to see if anyone else had noticed this. I totally agree with a previous review that says the numerous errors will make you question everything. It is an interesting read, but it is just unforgiveable that even obvious things like plot points in films, casting, etc. are wrong. I noticed a few and let them go, thinking that I must be the one that was wrong. As it went on I thought wait a minute and started checking things out only to find that, in fact, they were wrong! Bad enough that the writer is irresponsible, but wasn't there a fact checker around?! As the other poster stated, when facts that are obvious and easily checked are wrong, it kind of ruins the readers experience and does have you wonder what else might be false. Inexcuseable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire the editor - you said it.","review":"I was going to write exactly what reviewer Howard Lamp has already commented on, so I encourage anyone planning on reading this book to consider Lamp's comments. If we can catch these rather larger errors in Waxman's book, why couldn't the people who were paid to catch them? And what about the author?For what it's worth, the book also features many grammatical errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for film geeks which needed a film geek editor","review":"Waxman's book makes one wonder if she really writes for the New York Times. Any amateur film geek who's actually seen the films she writes about will find multiple errors, strange, unsupported statements, poorly written and edited sentences, and could probably write a better book themselves in short order.That said, Waxman's interviews do give her a point of view on her six main subjects which is interesting, and some of the gossip is compelling. Waxman badly needs an editor. She thanks one in the acknowledgments, so apparently someone held the title, but no one much seems to have performed the function. Had a good editor got hold of this manuscript, it might seem less like it was written in crayon in a big hurry. Which is a shame, because it does have its moments, a few revelations, and a driving narrative. But too much takes away from these strengths to recommend the book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"dont walk, RUN!","review":"...This record is great. Totally fresh and new.

It ends abruptly with a cliffhanger, there is no attempt at closure, there is only an attempt to get you to buy the next book.

The book covers not just the Indus script but also ancient Indian religion and practises, theories of migrations, comparisons with Mesopotamia and other cultures, etc. The readings of some of the signs and seals is tantalizing, although these cannot be as yet confirmed due to the lack of bilinguals or other evidence.Do not be fooled by the low ratings given by some reviewers who obviously have an axe to grind (they were probably disappointed that the book's conclusions do not support their Hindutva-motivated views). Go ahead and buy this book -- it is a must-have for anyone interested in the Indus civilization."},{"rating":"1","title":"A useful resource but not reliable","review":"Asko Parpola has been hawking his theory of the Indus script for close to three decades. As new evidence comes in counter to his claims, he shifts his theory accordingly but without abandoning the framework as should have been done long ago. Paropla's analysis of the Indus script as well as the Vedic texts is very flawed. He is surprisingly not aware of key information. For example, he sees the Gilgamesh motif of the Harappan art as having been borrowed from the Mesopotaminas, but the same motif occurs in the much earlier rock art of Central India. According to the archaeologists, there is a continuity in the Indian culture during 8000-1000 BC; Parpola ignores this to assert his immigration hypothesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves us with no firm sense about the script","review":"The book is more about Parpola's pet thesis that the Indian civilization is derivative to the Mesopotamian than about any real advance in the decipherment of the script.

His approach to these concertos is agile, precocious, playful, expansive, highly emotional, and thorough. He's matched by the orchestra every step of the way. Masur does a superb job of keeping everything in focus. It's great to have all five concertos in a single recording, and to have such magnificent performances to showcase Prokofiev's genius. For this reason I highly recommend it.But the technical aspects are lacking, mostly in the loudest passages of music. Regardless of what volume I play them, the higher dynamic levels are a bit distorted, which is a bit of a distraction and disappointment.Try to remember that, however, when you are confronted with the overwhelming power of the first and final movements of the Second Concerto. I'm not certain any composer has ever approached that level of soberly romantic and confrontationally dramatic writing. Not in my opinion, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Berof's performance of the 2nd Prokofiev piano concerto is one of the absolute most emotional performances I've ever heard. Amazingly, he isn't bogged down by the impossible notes--he sings the melodies, he listens to the harmonies, he fills the movements with personality, and he wrenches my gut with his cries for life. Of all of the several recordings of the Prokofiev 2nd piano concerto and the hundreds of other classical CD's I own, this is my personal favorite recording. If you haven't heard this concerto perfomed by Mr. Beroff, you are missing out on some of life's most human sounds.

This thing was taped and twist-tied down within its own box. It took me 10 minutes to unpack it using a knife and needlenose pliers (for the twist-ties).- Battery compartment screw is inferior. It already looked stripped before I tried opening it. I finally used a straight-edge screwdriver. Another 5 minutes gone.- The arm for opening/closing the lid is partially busted; it only opens the lid.- The special effects (lip open, song, beating heart, etc...) activate when you insert a coin.

Ms. Taylor writes about experiences that are similar to the other stories by mind controlled individuals.

I got confused and though that was his mother until someone tell me it wasn't.This movie is too long, and there are alot of parts that they should leave out. All of the parts where they are getting druck in a bar. That a waste and it's makes the film long and boring.Mostly all of the acting is just plain silly, I laugn at this movie.

The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five is because some of the acting is not \\"top of the line.\\" That being said it is one of my favorite movies of all time. This film represents beautifully the inner conflict of a man whose life has been radically changed by an encounter with Jesus Christ and who takes what he has been reading in the Bible very seriously and yet is called upon to serve his country in a way that seems (to him) contradictory. While he presents an example of a conscientious objector that perplexes his commanders, he struggles through this dilemma to a place of living out these dual roles.

Also this has the excellent soundtrack song \\"Blaze of Glory\\", and the new song \\"Always\\". The only tracks that really seem missing are \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Living In Sin\\". Of course \\"It's My Life\\" came out well after this was released. There is a new hits disc out called \\"This Left Feels Right: With A Twist\\", but that has all the songs reworked.

While it has its share of mediocre material, the really good tracks here are excellent, which include:Livin on a Prayer, Someday I'll Be A Saturday Night, Wanted Dead or Alive [Kickarse], Lay Your Hands on Me, YOu Give Love a Bad Name, Blaze of Glory, and Bad Medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best","review":"Bon Jovi is a band that co-owned the upper half of the 80s.

It is a compilation of the best Bon Jovi tracks. The love ballads, especially, come straight from the heart and tug at your heart strings. The additional cut, \\"Prayer 94\\", which is a slower another version of \\"Living on a Prayer\\" is smooth and rich. This number also exposes the ability of the band to play around with two different sounds for the same number and that is something not very many can do successfully. In short, good music and soulful lyrics make this album an all-time classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Hits","review":"Okay this in Bon Jovi's greatest hits, it's just not called that. Definately some thing to buy, with classics like Living on a prayer, Bed of Roses, Always, Runaway, Blaze of Glory, You give love a bad name...need I keep going? Okay yes I would agree that the cd was a desperate attempt to jumpstart their flailing career and it almost worked. But for Bon Jovi fans it was a gift from heaven.

What distinguishes this style of Gregorian Chant to others, is its gentle, legatic feel; incredibly fuild, and incredibly surreal; unlike the hard rhythmic style of other eras. This style seems especially suited to honor to the Blessed Virgin. Everything about this CD transcends this world. Even the unique tonal inflections of the lead voice is quite moving and intimate; one can sense a sort of longing and anguish to one day meet Our Lord.We are very blessed to have captured this quasi-heavenly exchange in an audio recording, nearly 50 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Gregorian Chant collections","review":"This collection of Gregorian chants by the Clervaux Benedictine Monks, for me, has been one of the two best Gregorian Chant collections I have ever heard.

This was the first Susan Howatch novel I've read, but it certainly won't be the last. The scope and cast of characters is simply huge, and yet is handled in a manner that you're never confused as to what is happening. The way that the author changes narrators five times during the course of the book is fabulous! Just as fabulous is the way that the plot and characters mimic true English history during the 12th to 13th centuries, with some tinkering and creative license, of course! Mark mimics Henry II, Janna mimics Eleanor of Acquitaine, Philip mimics Richard the Lionheart, ect. Overall, the story is a very human struggle where nothing is black and white, life isn't always fair, and the past mistakes of others can have massive ramifications on future generations. This is not the type of novel that can be read in a single sitting, but if you're looking for a passionate and intelligent story that will make you think, I highly recommend Penmarric."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book You Will Never Forget!!!!","review":"I first read this book over 30 years ago.Since then I have read countless books, in many book clubs, Man Booker Prize books, Orange Prize books, Pullitzer Prize books, many excellent books but every 5 years or so I always come back to Penmarric.What is it about Penmarric that I love so much?The 5 different narrators telling the same overlapping story is a stroke of genius. The author ellicits sympathy from the reader for each of the characters who often turn out to be enemies. The historical parallel with King John is fascinating. The Cornish setting is enchanting and romantic.The story is fast-paced and exciting, the change of narrator bringing fresh interest.

The story starts in the late 1800's and ends after World War II. Mark Castellack is a young boy who is most of the time in trouble and as an adult becomes quite ruthless in his love life. He fathers a large family and the book tells his story and the story of his heirs.Susan Howatch is a master story teller. The story is told in different sections, starting with Mark Castallack, and then sections are told by his wife Janna Roslyn and then his sons. The story takes place in Cornwall, England and the descriptions of the bleak country side and the lives of the Castellack family are told so beautifully that you feel you have entered that time and place.This is the second book by Howatch that I have read and Penmarric is well worth reading especially if you like historical family sagas.

McEldowney has an affinity for these gentle and playful creatures that exceeds any other cartoonist (or writer, for that matter) that I've ever encountered. I like the 9 CHICKWEED LANE strip (a quirky strip not carried by my hometown Orlando Sentinel) but the primary reason I read the strip is for the cartoons featuring Solange. I hope to see additional volumes featuring Solange"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Is This Book Out of Print?","review":"I have not actually looked at the book but have read all of the \\"Hallmarks\\" comics online. I personally find these to be one of the funniest set of strips that McEldowney has drawn and do not understand why the book went out of print. The Hallmarks of Felinity are strips that I have wanted to share with others, but without a collection or book, a newcomer to the strip might not appreciate the portrait of feline character that is expressed not in just one strip but in the series as a whole.

Hallmarks of Felinity is my favourite part of 9 Chickweed Lane; I really don't care much for the rest of strip.

I find it very comfortable to wear, it just feels like a textured band on the hand, nothing jagged at all. The stones are small enough to look real and the metal has a nice color to it, not cheap looking like most silver/cz rings you see at department stores. The only disappointment I had upon receiving it was that the stones weren't as pronounced as the photo. The do seem to be a bit hidden by the metal. Even with that though I'm extremely happy with it and I've had many ooh and ahhs of friends and family.

The anecdotes are interesting and for the most part the book is well written.The main problem that I had with the book is the length and the lack of detail about the movies and the making of them. In only a couple of cases does he go into any real depth.

The story takes a comedic twist after the desperados are made guardians of a dying woman's newborn son. This \\"three banditos and a baby\\" plot had been filmed several times before (and survived intact in other genres later on...) but it still has its charms.

Zane can't control his finger anymore, but he can control his arm.

I am a sk8er, or for you older folks that's skateboarder, and I don't read or write much at all. This book captivated me and I couldn't put it down. I had to read the entire series after that. it was good enough that I asked my girlfriend to read it. She's enjoying the series and is on the second book. She said that it really makes her think. Well, if you're reading this then you must be at least partially considering getting it so I should stop talking and let you come to your own conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read but not realistic.","review":"This book and in fact all the incarnations of immortality books are good books but if you are the type of person who likes something a bit more believeable you will spend alot of time on these books thinking that the people could not, should not, or would not do what they do. For instance death is this compationate softy who takes the time to chat with everyone befor collecting them and ends up saveing almost as many people as he collects. But on the other hand the storys are good reads and keep you locked in untill you finish and crave the next book. another plus is that the books do not have to be read in any order they are all pretty stand alone although they do have a slight continuity. on the whole if you want a book that gets you thinking and that has its share of sexy women then this book and this series will hold you over durring the down time between the show stoppers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A contradiction in terms...","review":"Piers Anthony has presented an interesting paradox in writing for quite some time. I still find it fascinating that one author can tackle such complex and intense metaphysical and existential issues, and yet remain so utterly simplistic as to almost suggest the whole thing was a 13-year-old's idea. Our protagonist becomes responsible for the balance of souls, discussing numerous facets of afterlife philosophy and religious issues in the process. This is serious stuff we're supposedly dealing with. And yet, Zane at first seems like a middle-school kid with a bunch of new gadgets to play with. Purgatory and Hell are sketched in with minimal detail rather than being explored and described. Women exist either to lust after the men, or fall in love with them like they're in a Disney movie. With some depth and realism this could have become a wonderful epic on a grand scale. As it is, it stands as mindless escapism - not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imaginative, but it falls flat","review":"Piers Anthony can surely tell a good story with imaginative and original wonders.

Lots of padding in between.I remember in high school several friends had recommended this. Who knows, I might even have liked it... 30 years ago. Reading in retrospect, it seems its target audience is young teenagers who don't have much exposure to \\"good\\" literature.The plot is shallow--and internally inconsistent/contradictory, the characters are one-dimensional, and the setting was annoying (think \\"Xanth on Earth\\"). The writing style is horridly florid, and you can make a drinking game out of how many exclamation marks are used (warning: you'll get hammered a chapter into it.) As if that wasn't bad enough, there are lengthy dialogue digressions that are probably meant to be \\"profound\\" but simply come across as superficial and intellectually pretentious.I'm tempted to give it 1 star, but I'll bump up to two as I can actually see young people liking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"i was looking forward to reading this series and i really tried with this book but it's just awful. great premise, terrible execution. it's very immature and clearly written by and for someone with a below average IQ. don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one weird strange book","review":"Of all the books I have ever read, this one is number #1 in terms of strangeness and weirdness.

Boy was I dissapointed!The dialoge is the WORST I have ever read - conversations with the female 'love interest' were trying at best, and with the Devil were beyond ridiculous. I kept thinking that the words were not matching the characters personalities - shallow as they are.Multiple times I found myself putting the book down in disgust for lack of depth when dealing with major religious overtones. The only reason I finished it was b/c I was on a cruise and had nothing else to read.Needless to say I won't be reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who can go wrong with Piers Anthony?","review":"This is the first book in one of my favorite series.

I've always admired Piers Anthony for the way he is so imaginative when it comes to his writing, and this book is no exception. I first read it when I was in High School, and the magic of the book has not left even to now, ten years later. Without giving too much away, the book is about a normal guy living on the verge of poverty who one day, has a close encounter with Death, the personification of the black hooded skeletal figure with scythe, and pale horse. Magic and science are interwoven in this world, they exist side by side.

I read the previous reviewer's ideas and I understand, however, I'm not sure this bunch of books should be taken very seriously. I think that On a Pale Horse is a very clever intersting take on death, love and life, and anything more than that should probably be left to more wieghtly non-fiction books.

It was against my better judgement to even finish this book.This starts out interesting enough -- main character Zane kills death, assumes his office and is now the Grim Reaper. Cool idea, definately.But after about 2 or 3 chapters, the story spirals down: the characters are one dimensional; the plot murky, predictable and lame; the dialog is as bad as a cheesy 70's porn film.I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy, I really wish I'd stopped it when it went downhill, because I might have been more forgiving that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read in the last 5 years...","review":"Piers Anthony is a hack.

He wrote most of his poetry 15-20 years ago, when many of the members of IAG were very young children at best. I looked through the album to find Mr Fox credited, but his name appears nowhere.

However, the author's technique of skipping from one person to another, then returning to the first, distracts from the flow of the story. It is informative in its detailed discussion of the early days of weather forecasting by the US Signal Corps. And Laskin's tracing of the storm's development and subsequent path into the US is easy to understand. I don't think any reader will experience a windy, snowy winter's day in quite the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"heart wrenching, well told story","review":"The author did a very good job of helping the reader understand how and why so many children died during this blizzard.My wife would like to add that the book was a little heavy on the meteorology. Fortunately, this stuff can be glossed over without losing any of the story -- well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating account","review":"I picked this up on a whim in the library and am so glad I did! This story simply mesmerized me. Anyone interested in late 1800's pioneer life, weather, or American history will enjoy this book. It simply tells the stories of five families and several individuals as they \\"weather the storm\\" of 1888--a blizzard such as never had been seen before. Lives were lost, lives were saved, and lives were never the same. Human error, an act of God, and love, all came together one day on the plains. Mr. Laskin is to be applauded for making history come alive and bringing to light some true heroes of another time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Will Blow You Away","review":"Mr. Laskin's book is a well-constructed narrative of why people moved to and endured this godforsaken part of the United States during the late-1800s. His graphic and forensic descriptions of what happened to some of the victims, especially the children, was interesting as well as very disturbing. I doubt the author's harrowing stories of survival will compel many readers into relocating to the Dakotas or Nebraska. In my humble opinion, calling this section of the country, the Badlands, is downplaying the hellhole. The writing is somewhat technical in presentation and devoid of flowery prose. The style is appropriate to the subject matter, but the people come across as kind of flat. It's a gloomy, but illuminating read recommended only for individuals not suffering from depression. If you're looking for a few laughs, BOY, have you picked the wrong book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Great story I am still reading the book and it keeps my interest and attension. Would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much science, not enough history.","review":"I am a historian, so when I picked up this book, I thought that it would be more about the history and consequences of the blizzard. Alas, it was more about the science of frostbite and freezing temperatures. The book is certainly well written, it just left me cold. Sorry, pun really NOT intended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful history on many levels","review":"I picked this book up at our local library and was really delighted by it. The story of the blizzard is very immediate and filled with details that make you feel as if you were there (brrr). But that's not all. The story of the immigrants is equally compelling; why they came, how they lived, how they survived. And the history of the National Weather Service's beginnings is also interesting. Another government program we couldn't live (literally) without. I took this book on a family trip this summer and ready many of the passages as we traveled. I've also recommended this book to several friends. Overall, a great and happy surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"This book reads like a meteorological textbook. I'm only 24% into the book & am really struggling to stay with it. I feel cheated out the $9.68 I paid for this book. It really should be free. If you're into meteorology, which I am not, you'll like this book. I just hope I can make it to the end. Hopefully, in the future, a better author will write about this particular storm, just tell the story, and leave out all the unneccesary hogwash this author uses to fill the gaps. I will be hesitant to read anything else by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun to read","review":"But you really better enjoy meteorology. (I do) Lately I've been drawn to books about the plains. My Antonia was especially good. What a tough life. Heck, it's still tough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pioneer Tale of Courage and Tragedy","review":"The Children's Blizzard is a fascinating tale of the tragic blizzard striking without warning to the Prairie states in 1888. As an Iowa native I was fascinated by the human stories told by Mr. Laskin. His research is impeccable an he provides touching insight into the life of the midwest pioneer families and most importantly the children. My only criticism would be the sometimes redundant very dry information about weather systems and predictions. It is interesting to a point but most probably only those as fascinated by weather as the author would find it necessary to the degree it is explained. The human story is the more intriquing. Regardless, I loved the book and am incredibly grateful to those hardy souls who stayed in the prairies despite the harshest of circumstances. I can't imagine living then. Thanks to Mr. Laskin for exploring their lives and telling the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic.","review":"This is an incredible natural event with tragic consequences. This is a heart wrenching story of marvel and tragedy. The event of the blizzard is a natural phenomenon. This was a blizzard like no other. The speed at which it strikes and the rapidity of the effects is astonishing. It struck with such quickness that most people caught outdoors barely had time to make it to shelter and safety. And the children that were sent home from school, \\"before it got bad\\", getting caught in a white out and perishing in the frozen storm is very sad indeed. This is an excellent book. Well written, easy to follow and a very good account of this event. I really have no complaints. It is a sad book but also very interesting and educational. Once again, I would like to give it 4 1/2 stars..... but you can't do half stars!! Even if you're not interested in the subject, you would probably still enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a miss for me....","review":"Far too much time spent on background information. It feels like he is using that information just to get enough material to call it a book.Far far far too much time on background informtation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Childrens Blizzard","review":"I would like to retract my previous preview and thank the author of this book David Laskins. He has had email contact with me. He was grateful and thankful for my information. My great grandmother Addie was mentioned in this story. She was wearing thin shoes and held a small child on her lap all night in a hay stack during this horrible storm. Due to these unfortunate events she lost her right leg below her knee and some of her toes on her left foot. She was 14 years old when this happened. Mr. Laskins willingness to listen to my families account show us he strives for accuracy. Thank you Angie Robin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Read","review":"I just finished the Children's Blizzard and I was terribly disappointed. Too much of the book was devoted to detailing how these immigrants came to be living on the great praries, and then the author went on to tell us all about the very boring history of the weather service. I was really only interested in hearing the account of the blizzard, who survived, and how and who perished. Once the author did get to the meat of the story, I was already half way through the book. All I can say is save your money, if you absolutely insist on reading this book go to your public library."},{"rating":"1","title":"LISA RAY","review":"LISA RAY IS ALWAYS BRILLIANT IN ANY FILM- SHE TAKE ON THE ROLE OF WHOMEVER AND MORPHS INTO THAT CHARACTER COMPLETELY.

The text is not \\"easy reading,\\" but it gets to the heart of the matter, and can easily be skimmed for quick reference. To keep in mind that this isn't an in-depth study of art as a whole, nor does it claim to be. Sometimes I reach for this book as a reference, only to remember that fact and have to look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but...","review":"This is a classic Samba CD with many outstanding funky MPB/Pagode/Forro tunes such as Um a Um, Chiclete com Banana (featuring a playful and unusually funky Gal Costa), A Mulher do Anibal (a fabulous tongue-in-cheek Chico Buarque - Zeca Pagodinho duet), and O Canto da Ema (featuring Elba Ramalho). HOWEVER... Track 7 (Meu Enxoval) has dropouts starting around 2:30 into the song; don't know if the pressing or the master was bad. You may want to get the Musicrama/Koch pressing and not this BMG pressing. Have the seller check this track before purchase. In any case, I cut the last 0:30 of this song, and the CD is worth buying for the other 51 minutes of (fabulous) music. -- DJ Arnoldo"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Telling of a Desperate Struggle","review":"\\"Hell's Gate\\" is a meticulously researched volume of a little known brutal winter battle on the Eastern Front during World War II. The writing is clear and unambiguous; the text is supplemented with many photographs, including previously unpublished photos made available to the author by participants of this battle.There are some irritating production shortcomings, such as the occasional line dropping off at the bottom of a page and the seemingly inevitable misspellings throughout.In all, I readily recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"POWERFUL! you will want to read it over and over","review":"Nash does one of the best historical accounts of a massive and complicated battle that I have yet read,The extra time spent on the personalities involved and their relationships adds tremendously to the value of this book. Winning the battles but losing precious equipment and ground was a big part of the German retreat, Sadly the loss of life here is also extreme and the personal stories that delve into that loss are painful and foretell of worse to come.Filled with rare fantastic photos and first person accounts this is the definitive book on Korsun/Cherkassy. I hope that while survivors of battles like these are still living Nash will continue to create works like this that add so much to history and our understanding of WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Definitively a great book, still have not finished it but all positive reviews here are right.It is an impressive account of the battle, masterfully mixing the tactical information with the human view, and showing a really deep research.It is more focused on the german side, although soviet commanders and movements are also studied -but not to the same degree, in my opinion.There are several maps at different stages, however I miss one with only the roads, rails and towns. Sometimes a place is mentioned but you can not find it on the map.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The purest interpretation of Beethoven's piano sonatas ...","review":"Unlike many more famous interpreters such as Emil Gilels, Alfred Brendel, Rudolf Serkin ..., Yves Nat plays so naturally that the sound could even appear rough ... It is also to be said that the recordings were made in the fifties and it greatly contributes to the authenticity of the sound ...You should definitely listen to these discs if You happen to be a Beethoven fan : in fact, You might remain amazed while listening to the latest sonatas, especially the last one, as Nat plays them much faster than any other as far as I know ...It gives an impression of lightness and simplicity even if these pieces are far from being easy and I think that this interpreter deserves the title of most natural interpreter of Beethoven's piano sonatas !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful set","review":"This is a truly wonderful set--Nat makes the performances sound so natural. Not perhaps as profound as Schnabel but great in their own way. The sound is actually quite good--EMI did a good job both in recording and remstering the 50s mono.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I imagined","review":"I've purchased the hardbound editions of 7 books by Tim Newark since January 2011.

Absolutely not but there are 10s of thouands of them and I doubt everyone singleone is bs.Just like the ufo cases,95% are hoaxes,explainable, etc but the 5% of thousands and thousands cases cant beexplained and very credible people were involved too.But Klass would still think the world is flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MUST READ REVIEW","review":"Mr. Klass is a popular forerunner of the skeptics in our society regarding the \\"u.f.o. phenomenon.\\" In this book, he attepts to express his understanding that human percerption is inherently biased and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for accurate data (with respect to the ufo \\"abductions\\"). I think that if you are really interested in the validity of abductees, a thorough understanding of sensation and perception psychology is a necessity. Then, you would be better educated to decide whether there is any credibility to these \\"abductions.\\" Mr. Klass makes interesting points in this book which are worthy of your time; however, dismissing testimony of an alleged abductee because she was not attractive does raise serious doubts as to Mr. Klass' priorities and scientific methods. I say, buy a book on psychology instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Debunking At It's Finest","review":"If you are interested in exploring the truth, you won't find it reading this book! Phil Klass is a government implant whose sole purpose is to debunk any and all facets of UFOLOGY, including The Abduction Phenomenon.

It's written in a voice like a middleschooler - embarrassed or mushy weird. we did laugh a lot, but mostly at how oddly it was written (\\"try this kiss on your hand\\" what the h...), which didn't really encourage a romantic atmosphere. more than half the book is spent on weird buildup to overly detailed instructions (\\"get close to your partner\\" duh?). it was really a waste because even the kisses that i'd never heard of before (which you can easily find on the internet) are unheard of because they're lame (electric kiss = rubbing your hair with a wool blanket and shocking your partner) or something that happens naturally in a normal physical relationship (\\"rub her arms\\" \\"rub your noses together\\"). skip this one unless you're a exnun reentering society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh","review":"Not what I expected.

I read this book because I was actually unaware of the actual mechanics of a kiss in regard to pressure and suction.Giving my inexperience, I feel I should have been able to get some new information from this book, but I was unable to learn anything from it, with the exception of the electric kiss. I was dissapointed because it seemed like the kisses were ordinary, common sense, and simple, the kinds you have seen in movies a million times, and descibed with a level of ambiguity that gives me the impression the author has not tired some of these kisses himself. The author also seems rather prudish (even by my standards) when he questions wether one should kiss on the first date.All in all this was a very dissapointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST!","review":"A friend suggested this one to me and after viewing around the first 15 minutes I found my finger on fast forward many times.The film is shot sort of documentary like and if you deleted the wasted footage of falling snow and trees which has really nothing to do with anything in the film.... it will end up being maybe 40 minutes of what this director considers shock horror??It has the worst effects I have ever seen .. extremely fake. Also the worst acting ever.I hope the team of people who made this piece of junk still have day jobs. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down of an anticipated film","review":"This film is basically a gore film about a fictional Japanese military unit called the Unit 731.

Try it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A deeply flawed movie about a deeply disturbing event","review":"I am quite familiar with Unit 731 and the aftermath and bought this movie in hopes that it would present some topics that I was unfamiliar with. Unfortunately, I found watching the movie extremely painful, not because of the topic material which I knew about but because of the overindulgence on visual and audio effects that were totally unnecessary. This could have been an outstanding docu-drama of one of the more sordid events in human history. Instead, it almost turned into a mockery of the events by making it into a horror movie. I was deeply disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well..............","review":"This movie is an hour of documentary, an hour of bad horror, and 2 hours of pointless cut scenes of snow and none of it particularly good. The monotone delivery punctuated by dubbed screams, fake blood, and bad acting, is only surpassed by the amateur camera angles and ridiculous sound track. I bought this movie on the suggestion of a friend and regret doing so. It takes itself to seriously to even be watched as a good bad movie. Save your self the 4 hours and 20$, read the Wikipedia page on Unit 731 while watching meatball machine with the volume off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensationalistic, sloppy and waaaaayyyyy toooo loooooong","review":"Sorry, but this movie just plain sucks. Maybe if it were 90 minutes (or even less) it might have worked simply in a sensory overload kind of way. But in its current 240+ minute state, it's lumbering, pretentious, mind-numbing bore. That's because it's basically a 240+ minute student film, and most of those are pretentious and mind-numbing at just ten or fifteen minutes. Terrible acting, sloppy and amateurish special effects, about a half hour of footage of snow falling (if I'm exaggerating it's not by much) and in the end absolutely no point other than an excuse to recreate these horrendous crimes against humanity as an aborted death metal music video. A worthless pile self-importance and a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent treatment","review":"I don't know what these other two reviewers are talking about. I was raised Lutheran until high school and studied the Reformation in college. And I think to date this is my favorite treatment of Luther. Nestingen successfully covers the life of Luther, both is personal and public life and paints him in a likeable but realistic light. He pulls together mounds of scholarly info into a very brief account drawing light on things I'd never even heard of before. As for the typeset and the format of the book itself, I work in publishing and I think its fine, even cool! This new way of putting flaps on the paperback cover is different but easily allows you to mark your place in the book. I got used to it quickly. The photos in the book from movie stills add a lot both to the cover and the feel of the book. View a copy yourself before believing these other two reviews!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The One Stars Here are Way Off","review":"I loved this book! It brought to life the amazing events in Luther's life and also beautifully treats the theological and political issues of the Reformation and Luther's life. I truly don't know what book some of these others were reading who rated this book a one star. I'm not so sure they even read it. Nestingen is solid in his scholarship and in no way one sided in his approach.

The book \\"Martin Luther: A Life\\" was obviously slapped together in a hurry and printed very poorly. You do have to just about break the book in half to read the text, it is printed in small hard to read type, on low quality paper, set very densely together. It almost looks to me like somebody printed this on their home printer! Pictures from the movie are slapped into the middle of the book with no rhyme or reason, and the credits are as large as the picture titles, making them irritating to view.The text of the book is written with a \\"snippy\\" attitude of, \\"Oh, well, yes, Luther and all that, but today we know this that an another thing.\\" I was expecting better when I ordered this book. I thought, \\"Oh, come now, the negative reviews can't be right, and I read the positive reviews and thought, this can't be too bad.\\"WRONG it is a very poor excuse for a book.

I thought, \\"Oh, come on, can't be as bad as they said.\\" It's worse!Pathetic to think a publishing company that is supposed to be Lutheran would put out something this poor. But, as I look at other things that Augsburg-Fortress offers, it is not surprising. They are so into politically correct left-wing theology it is not really a mystery why they would give a book on Luther such short schrift.Bad layout, design, printing, formatting and writing.A real bummer of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a lame book","review":"Slapped together, obviously.

Furthermore, there is no way any kid over the age of 1 can sleep on it. It is miniscule. Read the dimensions carefully and be sure this is what you want before you order it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and informative read!","review":"This was the second book I have read on the Laci Peterson murder case. The first was For Laci written by her mother Sharon Rocha. This book comes a close second to hers as far as information and the timeline of events. Of course, For Laci has more an emotional pull but Catherine Crier supplies some information that was not known. The book is a very interesting read if you are interested in this case. The only complaint I have is that there were very many mis-spellings and grammatical mistakes that sometimes interfere with reading. Other than that a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T ANYONE PROOFREAD?","review":"I DON'T NORMALLY REVIEW THE BOOKS I READ, BUT THIS ONE REALLY ANNOYED ME.

However, there are a million typos...almost as if I was reading the first draft of the book. I had to GUESS on some of the words, it was that bad. I am not a picky person when it comes to typos and mistakes but the amount in this book almost made it unreadable. The content was good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detailed, but flawed with errors","review":"I read this book cover to cover. I had found errors even in the first few chapters. Those errors were confusing, such as the age of McKenzie in Scott's affair with Janet. Later, on page 120, the policemen started interviewing Shawn Sibley (Amber's friend) at 11:02. Then on page 124, according to the book, one of the poliecemen switched off the tape recorder at 12:41 PM. Both policemen stretched their legs before continuing their session with Amber Frey. On page 125, one of the policemen said that he was about to start interviewing again at 11:50 AM. HOW WAS THIS POSSIBLE?There are many errors like these, so they made me doubt the credibility of the author and the book.

You simply can't put it down.","review":"Catherine Crier has written the best detailed and most interesting account of this tragedy to date. I have followed this story since it broke on Dec.24th 2002. I learned a lot more than I already knew from this book. Absolutely a must have in the Peterson collection of books.I sincerely loved it. It was if I was hearing about the whole story for the first time all over again. Filled with unsuspected suprises, it was well worth every penny and every second of my time. If you buy no other book about Laci and Scott Peterson, you must have this one!!! By far, the most informative, insightful, suprising , captivating read I have experienced. 5 stars to Catherine Crier and many compliments on a job well done!!! You go girl!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Revelations ?? Hardly !!","review":"It is difficult to fathom what was intended when the hype said \\" The never before told story\\" Excuse ME .... what was never before revealed ? Ms. Crier can't be criticized for cashing in on the notoriety of the case any more than any of the other \\"authors\\" but it was hardly worth the $26 it cost to read her take on the case.It is amazing to me that there are still people (among whom are self proclaimed law experts) who maintain that Peterson was convicted on flimsy, circumstantial evidence. The judge in the case had the ability to lessen the death sentence but instead declared Peterson guilty of such an egregious crime that he should die for it...... and the judge sat through the proceedings and listened to ALL of the evidence. That pretty much says it all !The book was definitely not worth reading in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Deadly Read","review":"To begin, I followed the Peterson Trail on Court TV. It was a fascinating glimpse into the trial, evidence arguments and conviction of Scott Peterson. I got closure from the trial. However, my wife bought this book for me as a treat. Some treat! I found this book to be tedious, tiresome, filled with contradictions and containing many typographical errors. Many others who reviewed the book say essentially the same. It seems to me to be a rushed bit of writing, and at times is mind-numbingly boring. In the last 25 pages, I found it almost impossible to want to read any further. But I did slog through to the end.There were a few interesting observations by Crier, a lot of speculation, some unseen evidence and a lot of police photographs. Crier refers to Peterson as a \\"sociopath,\\" which he apparently is.Most of America already knows at least 95% of what the book contains. You decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"I was looking forward to reading this, but was very disappointed. There is nothing new, and Catherine Crier needs to think a little before writing all this crap. She repeats the same things over and over, and goes back and forth during the entire book, from her point he was quilty from the start and she turns everything around to make her look good in saying I told you he was guilty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing","review":"When the case finally ended anD death row was his faTe, a little voice kept haunting me, \\"what if he didn't do it..he is going to die.\\" After reAding Ms Crier's book there is no doubt in my mind at all. He did kill Laci - HE PLANNED IT OUT, HE KILLED HER 2 DAYS AFTER THEY FOUND THEY WERE HAVING A BABY BOY...I can't believe anyone could do such a terrible thing, and the only apparent reason was he decided he didn't want a wife and a baby-like Mrs. Rocha said'\\"divorce was always an option..\\"Not for Scott Peterson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book.","review":"This book was really good. It was very well written and an easy read. What I enjoyed most about the book was we got a real good insight on what kind of person Laci was, as well as all the people involved. The media has \\"told\\" us who she was, but this book brings it to a new level. At points, I got goose bumps reading some of the details after finding Laci's body. All in all it was a really good book. The only thing that I disliked about this book was there was a little too much dialog, which could of been left out, imo. I read Ann Byrd's book, as well as Amber's and both seemed just thrown together for mere profit. Catherine Crier's book was not thrown together. It was highly researched, and gives us info the \\"average\\" person who have followed this case on a regular basis, would not know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book On The Peterson Case!! Xcellent Detailed Story","review":"I have read 2 books on the peterson case and this book is the best to date.much insight knowledge on all scotts crazy antics and AMBER FREY ,as well.I get the impression the Crier dont like Frey to much and says that her testimony did'nt convict scott alone. it helped sell her book!which I read as well.(sent free or I would'nt have read)I still say all frey wanted was a father for her kids and was after money and she found that in scott.all in all THIS BOOK IS A GREAT READ AND EXTREMELY DETAILED WITH INFO WE DID NOT KNOW. I RECOMMEND!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating info, but typos and errors bothered me!","review":"A long-time fan of true crime stories, I picked this up at the Chicago airport to read on a long flight. And I'll admit, the first half intrigued me; I couldn't put it down. But as I continued to read, certain things--like calling Scott Peterson's Southern California hometown \\"Solano Beach\\" (instead of Solana Beach) several times--bothered me. It's so easy to do city and street fact-checks these days with Google. Since I'm from Southern California (where Peterson's parents still reside), I know many of the areas referred to in the book. If minor errors such as these were incorrect, it made me wonder what other errors were wrong as well. All in all, this was a good, entertaining, and informative read. I just wish it hadn't been so sloppily edited; for what they charge for hardcover books these days, this shouldn't happen--even if it IS your only entertainment on a long flight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well organized information","review":"Nothing too startling here. However, the facts are well organized and will convince anyone with remaining doubts that Scott is guilty. Good information about the families of both Scott and Laci and the ripple effects to so many lives of the decision of one sociopath. I found myself shaking my head at some of the decisions that Scott made. On the other hand, no one caught him committing the murder or disposing of the body. And no one ever even seems to have known that he had that potential. Well written book, easy to read, and packed with well research information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never knew...","review":"I recently read this book and thought it was very informative and interesting. I couldn't put it down. When this story first broke I was pregnant with my first child;a boy due in March. I felt a strong connection to Laci Peterson since we were both pregnant around the same time. I never realized Scott had more than one mistress while he was married. I hope he rots in jail for what he did. No doubt about his guilt! Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!","review":"Catherine Crier has done a fabulous job of pulling together all the behind-the-scenes info. Some of these types of books can get boringly repetitive, but not this one. I was fascinated page by page and found it difficult to put down. Her experiences during her career in \\"the system\\" make this an excellent read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't be worse!","review":"This is definitely the worst true crime book I ever read! I don't even want to go into detail about the author's bias, inconsistencies, conclusions, etc. It's not worth it.Catherine Crier convinced me that Scott Peterson should never have gotten the death penalty; he shouldn't even be in prison. Is this our legal system? Very scary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE REAL TRUTH","review":"I FEEL THAT SCOTT PETTERSON HAD A LOT TO GAIN BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT WITH HIS WIFE OUT OF THE WAY HE COULD DO WHAT HE WANTED TO DO ALWAYS BESIDE CHEATING ON HER ANYWAY AND BY GETTINTG HIS WIFE OUT OF THE PICTURE HE COULD CONTINUE WHAT HE HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO DO"},{"rating":"1","title":"still believe the jury got it wrong","review":"I do believe Catherine Crier got it right: the investigation and trial was a deadly game, but it was perpetuated by Detective Brocchini, the night Laci was missing, not Scott Peterson. The newer book, Presumed Guilty, reveals this telling fact, that Scott was threatened that night with being guilty. Is this responsible investigating? Of course not. Would this have affected Scott's behavior? Of course. I think Catherine Crier would end up with a very different analysis if she had some of the actual evidence from Tales form the Morgue, and the newer book, Presumed Guilty. Evidence, is ultimately what any human being should have their sentence based on. I think all who have followed this case would want the same for themselves. I believe Scott was betrayed in a multitude of ways, which will be resolved in the next trial he deserves to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please","review":"The Queen of NE brings her completely slanted view to the Scott Peterson case. What is really courious is how she managed to get 40,000 pages of discovery when at the same time the defense only had 27,000 pages.And of course, being in a major player in Crimeratainment she is fee to imbellish and suppose (much like the prosection did) to tell a simple tale of murder.Except it's a tale of BEHAVIOR. Nothing new here folks, move along. Some actual proof anyone committed a crime would be a much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"He didn't do it!","review":"Yet another book from someone trying to capitalize on the misery of others. The more appropriate title for this rag should've been \\"The Often Repeated Story of How Scott Peterson Got Reemed by the Media\\".I watched with disgust as the Court TV puppets all put their liberal spins on this inquisitions, oh I'm sorry, I meant investigation. It's so clear that Scott Peterson couldn't have possibly done the murder that it's laughable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I don't know why I'm so obsessed with the Laci Peterson murder. Maybe it is because she was someone that was so normal and easy to relate. I found this book to be a thorough account of the events starting with December 24, 2002. It was a page turner and impossible to put down. Page after page I kept being shocked at the lies after lies that Scott said time after time. Many components you've heard about in the news, but there are others - transcripts of conversations between Sharon Rocha and Scott Peterson that were new to me. There are a few typos that show the book was a rush to press - especially towards the end of the book, but it is a riviting story none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"I loved this book. It was great. I loved how it was very suspenseful at parts and at other parts it was very descriptive on the investigation. This book made me realize how lucky I am to be alive. I'm usually not really a person to read much but I really did enjoy this book. I found a lot of parts in it that I already knew but there were a lot of parts that I didn't. The book was mainly focusing on making Scott Peterson look guilty and that was good because I thought that he was guilty from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"The author does a good job of covering all the bases of this case. I would definitely say it is worth your time to read if you are interested in the Laci Peterson disappearance. While most of the book is very compelling, there are some parts that clearly remind you that she is a former lawyer (think wordy and boring). The upside of this is that she can give insight that someone not in the legal profession would lack so it is worth plodding through the slow parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"indie flick done well","review":"this indie film maker \\"Matt Spease\\" has come a long way. i started working with his company back in 2003 and i produce the soundtrack music for his films and from the first film \\"duel of the assassins\\" all the way to the new one \\"Indestructible\\" each production just keeps getting better and better. indie film making isn't easy especially with low to no budget, but Matt really uses every bit of his resources to the hilt, check out this new film and all the rest.

You continue into softer songs like The Wind Cries Mary, crazier diddies like Crosstown Traffic. You get romantic songs like Little Wing or blues tunes like Red House.

But musical prowess alone does not a good album make, y'know what I'm saying? In my opinion, people were so caught up with Jimi's talent as a musician that they failed to notice (on the most part) that his talents as a song-writer were very simple. Much of these songs are very standard and merely impress with Jimi soloing over them. Add to that that much of what Jimi did was improvisation with little direction and what is left is really rather boring. Purple Haze and Voodoo Child are great songs, but the fact that many people have only heard of them (they wouldn't hear names like If 6 Was 9 or The Wind Cries Mary and think \\"Aaah!

They're too loud, and tuneless,and they even seemed so to this grizzled Boomer when he first heard them ages ago.

Dolly Dagger and Night Bird Flying that are included, are not so good as those tracks I listed above.Of course, to make album more comprehensive, there could have been some Band of Gypsys track in the end. And why not something like Pali Gap? Also Burning of the Midnight Lamp and Long Hot Summer Night (both from Electric Ladyland) would have been better than some tracks included - not to mention the title track from Electric Ladyland, in which Jimi proves how great singer he can occasionally be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"Jimi is by far one of the greatest artists of our time.... his music has a lock on this world that will never stop.. the music will live on forever and so will his spirit"},{"rating":"1","title":"sample silliness","review":"horrible cd - i feel like i am listening to samples of music on amazon or itunes - how could anyone think that they are listening to hendrix? i was suspicious when i looked at the back of the cd and saw the song lengths were so short but i got suckered in by the cheap price for so much music - in this case you get what you pay for - i would not recommend this cd to any hendrix lover - every song fades out - that is not the way the songs end - it as if there is no meaning or originality in the way a song ends - and that is not the way they are in the original recordings"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly definitive compilation","review":"This generous best-of album contains an excellent sampling of Hendrix's best.

His explosive rockers (\\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\") have their place, and his sensitive side (\\"Little Wing\\", \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\") is well represented. Unfortunately (and this is why there should be a 4 1/2 star option)...No \\"Machine Gun\\"!

Its focus is on Colonial, Georgian and Victorian Architecture, but the ideas can be used in any house to suit your taste.The only thing missing from this book, which I missed is more color photos.

The only issue I have with it, is it really restricts the flow of water. I read where some users drill the hole a bit bigger for more flow. A person should not have to 'modify' a brand new product to make it function. I wish Culligan would look into this problem and correct it. I really needed to replace mine ASAP, since the filter was extremely dirty, so I originally ended up paying almost twice as much for one at my local hardware store than the price I paid for it on Amazon. I would recommend ordering the dual pack and always having a replacement for that moment it needs replacing immediatly.

Pour yourself a glass of port(from Portugal of course) or a good sherry and enjoy. With all of the hip edgy stuff coming out in cinema and tv, I guess we are supposed to be smug and oh so knowing about a book written in the 19th century. They'll probably make some new version of it with Ethan Hawke or some British actors. When it's made and sooner or later it will be, don't think of going to it. Instead buy the book.

Some in my group read this book when they were in high school, but are enjoying it even more the second time around. It is not only a story told to perfection, but it's a book that offers landlubbers, as well as coastal residents, a chance to learn about whaling and the majesty of the ocean and it's inhabitants, with an emphasis on whales... the Sperm Whale in particular.

I would not recomend this book for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased book","review":"I was looking for a book to read to my 5 year old for the election this year and purchased this one. However after reading it, I found it was incredibly biased. The information was presented as if one candidate is good because they have good views and the other candidate is bad because they have bad views. This isn't what I want to teach my children about voting or the country we live in. Just because you may disagree with someone doesn't make the other person \\"bad\\".

It was an amazing show. I got to see them twice. \\"Same Boy You've Always Known\\" and \\"Screwdriver\\" are recorded in Brazil to some big audiences. \\"As Ugly As I Seem\\" and \\"The Denial Twist\\" (their latest video) were recorded in the studios at KCRW during their stint in Los Angeles in August 2005.

Perhaps it's the presence of pianist Hank Jones or an all-too-rare appearance on a prestigious label (Impulse), but Sonny sparkles on each of the selections on a varied and winning program of blues, (I Got) Rhythm tunes, standards, and sentimental favorites (\\"Estrellita,\\" \\"My Mother's Eyes\\"--both receiving singing, moving readings by Sonny). For once, the ubiquitous and usually reliable drummer Osie Johnson seems to have trouble fitting into the groove--all the more testimony to the strength of the performances of the other three musicians. Give those insatiable, opportunistic borrowers of Western culture, the Japanese, credit for rescuing this valuable session from vinyl oblivion (though you may save a few bucks if you can locate a used LP version)."},{"rating":"2","title":"PART OF A DOUBLE UP","review":"If you by-passed the Sonny Stitt- Paul Gonsalves SALT AND PEPPER quintet session you better go back to it if you want this quartet session with Hank Jones, with a lovely alto version of Estralita.

Richard Holmes clearly did an enormous amount of research and his attention to detail is extraordinary. His love for his subject comes through strongly yet he remains objective throughout and is not blind to Shelley's flaws. His descriptive writing also paints a fascinating picture of the interesting and tough times during which Shelley lived and his wonderful vocabulary had me reaching for my dictionary many times!. He pays as much attention to the other colourful characters in Shelley's life as he does to the poet himself. His analysis of Shelley's complex psyche is intense and I believe his perceptions are very accurate.

A title is of course what you first take note of in a bookstore. It is not an AA bashing book, it is far too ethical for that.

Fuller describes the desolation of the Outback and the many obstacles met. The railway did not have the significance of the continent spanning lines in the US and Canada.
