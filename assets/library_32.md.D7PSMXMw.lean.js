Also keep in mind that Chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products. All the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the United States.

It's worth every cent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I can't remember where I purchased this (Walmart, etc..), but it was definitely NOT money well spent. I don't know how they can label this as \\"spill proof\\", as that's all it does is spill. It may not spill out of the gas can on its own, but try putting gas into something - gas runs everywhere BUT into the piece of equipment you're trying to fill up.The self-venting/\\"spill proof\\" mechanism works by you rotating it, and then pulling the large outside ring towards you. As you do this, you have to try to get the hard plastic nozzle down and into the item you're filling without any of the gas coming out - MUCH trickier than it sounds. I'd rather spend an afternoon trying to figure out the Rubik's cube than this piece of junk.Save your money and spend it on one of the other more expensive gas cans that got better reviews. I bought this one and the 1 gallon can for my weed trimmer. I haven't even used the 1 gallon can because the 2.5 gallon can is so awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inferno--a great Transformer!","review":"I was always mystified by Inferno's popularity--I always thought that he looked unweildly and clumsy.But then I actually got an Inferno figure.Wow--this toy is great! Even the re-issue has die cast metal. The transformation is simple, and, best of all, Inferno comes with guns. Lots of guns. I can see why Inferno is so popular now.Inferno's robot mode is great, as is his fire truck mode. The only problem I have with the toy is that, like many Transformers of the time, the fists are detachable, meaning that you have to keep up with them seperatly while Inferno is in his fire truck mode. Kids are going to loose the fists (and nothing is more irritating that a handless Autobot or a headless Headmaster!).By the way, Hasbro just put out a similar re-issue--Grapple is simply a remolded Inferno. But if you ask me, Inferno is the better of the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Transformers.","review":"A solid well put together design. A little more durable then other since is simple to transform. Well proportion. Nice casting looks great. A couple of clip on pieces like his head-wing. The arm kind of stick out when in truck mode. The latter works and you can switch his hand with a missile that doesn&#65533;t shoot. Inferno was Red-Alert buddy and I have them both. He is little taller then the other Autobot cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the ignorant traveler who wants to remain ignorant","review":"Yeah, the guide is full of practical information -- the book is after all for people who are afraid of getting lost or discovering anything for themselves -- but when it comes to informing you accurately and knowledgably on archeology, culture and history, it is a real let down.

I've enjoyed it since I was little, and I still enjoy it now.Personally, I don't understand why so many people (especially critics) hate this movie. True, the animation may not be the greatest, but so what? Who says animation has to be top-notch in order for the movie to be good? And the music is great, too. Even \\"Marry the Mole\\" is not such a bad song. I don't understand why it received an award for \\"Worst Original Song\\". I don't agree with the message, of course, but it's still got a catchy tune, and I often find myself singing along to it.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, of course, but maybe you movie critics out there are being a tad too harsh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible character","review":"I am a huge fan of animation and watch one movie weekly w/ my 4 children. This would have to be the worst film I have seen w/ them. Although the animation itself is good, the plot and storyline are horrible and truly boring. To add insult, the title character of Thumbelina is made to be a weak, sniveling, pathetic excuse of a girl. Throughout the film, my daughters and I came up with ways that Thumbelina could get herself out of the situation if she would just think about it. Furthermore, although she is put into bad situations over and over again, only once does she actually have the gumption to say \\"NO\\". Very annoying. We will be \\"losing\\" this film ASAP as this is not a character I want my children modeling themselves after. I just kept hoping that Thumbelina would develop some spunk and some chutzpah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"What a terrible, depressing film. As we were watching, my three year old daughter kept insisting that this was not the 'real' movie, and wanted us to fast forward! I can see what she meant -- the scenes just kept getting weirder and weirder, with Thumbelina just going along for the ride. Evil frogs. Evil Mice. Evil moles. Evil beetles. Evil story. Evil plot. Pink headed dog thing that makes Goofy look good. 30 second love affair in the first few minutes. 30 second marriage to wrap it up. 2 hours of pain in between.Life is too short to spend on this junk. Want interesting, non-Disney heroines that you wouldn't mind your children emulating? Try Kikis Delivery Service or My Neighbor Totoro. Want a beautiful movie with good voice acting and story? Watch Nemo again. Whatever you do, avoid Thumbelina."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!","review":"I bought this movie because I love the story of Thumbelina and it had good reviews. I don't understand how this got any positive reviews. We have a 4 year old, twin 3 year olds, a 2 year old, and a 1 year old. This movie cannot hold their attention for even 5 minutes. I understand why the boys hate it, but even the 3 year old girl will not watch it. We have tried several times to watch this with them for family movie night and they all just run away. I don't blame them. The plot drags on and is odd. The characters are annoying. The only thing redeeming about the movie is that some of the Barry Manilow songs are o-kay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Let me be your wings............... (gag!)","review":"This must be one of the most annoying movies on earth! Thumbelina's brain is germ-sized, and she doesn't even know how to stick-up for herself, and say \\"no.\\" Every time an animal wants to marry her, she'll just let them do it, depending on her big-strong handsome boyfriend to do the rest! (sticks finger in the throat) GAG! GAG! GAG! That \\"heroine\\" in the movie isn't much of a heroine.If you'r sick of those Damsel-in-distress-waits-for-her-beloved-prince-to-come-and-save-her movies, I'd recommend ANASTASIA or MULAN! At least THOSE girls know how to defend themselves!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute movie","review":"I watched and loved this movie as a little girl.

This tale of Thumbelina was wonderful, in story and in artistry. The songs were quite good, particularly the ballad which was definitely worthy of Disney. My 5-year-old daughter fell in love with this movie and in a world where crass humor has become the norm for children's programming, I'm so glad that I found something like this where she could enjoy a purely lovely story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product in not working condition","review":"this CD does NOT work.On one side you can watch for 9 min. and it frose.On another side for 25 min. before it lock itself.Tarrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and annoying","review":"So many times during this movie, I wanted to scream \\"Fight for yourself!\\" to Thumbelina. I am not familiar with the story of Thumbelina - but it just seems like such a bad story if the movie is accurate. I am trying not to have my daughters buy into the whole princess thing too much. (As I say this, our house has Disney princess stuff all over it.) However, this movie leaves me very disappointed. She believes what others think about her and doesn't find her self worth in herself. At the end of the movie, she fights a little bit, but there are other girlie movies that have much better messages."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like a whole T.V. serise combined into 90 minutes.","review":"Dude, Don Bluth. What happened to you man? Why do you insist on telling stories that are just too long and too confusing to be movies? Watching this movie was like watching a million plots combined into one. It seemed like every two seconds Thumbalina would wake up in another stranger's home voiced by yet another celebrity. This movie does get some points for some nice CGI action and good music. Can't recomend this one. It's just too much and not enough at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful!","review":"The main character is a moron. The songs are dreadful. The animation, though, was good.I swear, I could never, ever sit through this movie again. If I had to listen to those chickens screech out THUMBELINA! just one more time, I know I'd go postal.One of the worst animated films I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Thumbelina","review":"I an a fan on animation, but this movie was one of the worst I have ever had to sit through. It was so disappointing, I almost got up and walked out. The story was terribly mishandled, the songs were boring, the characters uninteresting. This is sad considering the subject; there were so many possiblities for a fun film. The animation, no matter how nice, can makeup for the lack of creativity, in the rest of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"My children received this movie as a gift, and I wish they hadn't. Thumbelina is a WEENIE! She is constantly at the mercy of everyone else, and doesn't appear to have a brain of her own. I realize that she is very small, but she just goes along with whatever the other characters want her to do, even to the point of getting married! She is NOT a strong female character, nor a good example for our daughters, or sons for that matter. I would not recommend this movie at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Movie","review":"My daughter LOVES this movie so I was glad to find it here and not have to look at clips on youtube anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure light-hearted entertainment","review":"I am often accused of still being a kid at 17, but that's ok. I love kids and I often babysit. It's a great way to be a kid and earn a little money. Well I was babysitting twin boys one time, when they begged me to watch a movie. Energetically they thrusted one of their favorite movies into my hands. To my surpise it was Thumbelina. I held off my judgment until I had watched the movie. Having never seen it before, I was delighted at the fun characters and wonderful music. If you are a kid, (or just a kid at heart) you will most likely fall in love with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music, love the movie.","review":"I'm fifteen, and I saw this movie just recently while babysitting for some little kids. That was a week and two days ago. The movie and songs have been going through my head ever since. I have to say, I loved it, as much as I did when it first came out. I agree with all of you that those tufts of hair on Thumbelina are kinda funky looking. The scene in the mole's house is one of my favorites. I love the song \\"Sun\\". It is really poetic and symbolic. All in all, I think it is a great movie, although certain aspects of it are a bit farfetched. Such as Cornelius freezing, and the bugs just thawing him out. Hello? How unreal is that? But I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good love story or good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful cartoon movie.","review":"Both my daughter and I fell in love with this film.

There isn't a boring part to this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best shampoo for hard or well water","review":"When we moved into our house, the hard well water made my hair extremely brittle, lifeless, easily tangled, and greasy at the roots. I tried several different shampoos before trying Lanza sun and swim. I was very skeptical after having tried several shampoos (such as one from Sally's Beauty Supply and a Paul Mitchell shampoo) that claimed to remove buildup from hard/well water, but did not work at all. I noticed an immediate difference with the Lanza shampoo. My hair is once again soft, non-greasy, and shiny. I tried several times to stop using Lanza and my hair will be fine for a few days and then once again start getting \\"symptoms\\" of well water. Of note, I can use regular conditioner and just use the Lanza shampoo. If you are looking for a great product to use if you have hard or well water, this shampoo is well worth the hefty price tag!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Printable that don't work","review":"Bought this printable Ridata, can't burn in my computer with a LACIE burner, with a duplicator and in an independent lab, didn't work, I trow away and said good bye to my money.Don't buy it.

The DVD player that came with my computer doesn't like \\"DL\\" disks while playing the 4.7 GB disks just fine. My HP940 plays them just fine. My old DVD player in my entertainment center didn't do well with \\"DL\\" discs either, while the newer one I bought has no problem with them.

The trouble is that the material in this album just isn't good enough ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exercise in Mediocrity","review":"I don't know what these other reviewers are listening to. This is AWFUL. It sounds like some mediocre bar band trying to imitate a 1980s big-hair-rock-ballad-band type of sound but fails miserably because of a lack of hooks or catchiness. The drumming is stiff and wooden, the bass playing is totally unimaginative, the weak vocals blend in so that the lyrics are unintelligible, and the poor production compresses all the instruments into a lifeless midrange muddle. (Rumour has it that some groups who are mediocre musicians actually do this deliberately to hide their mistakes). To top the mess off there is a total lack of energy, intensity, and vitality in the playing. Imagine Huey Lewis and the News on downers crossed with Pendragon with weak vocals, mediocre musicianship, and bad production, and this approximates the sound of this woeful disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"a strong effort","review":"I find this to be a good Marillion cd but not great.

That being said I believe it was a deliberate effort at something more commercial for airplay but should have been released as a single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable, Easy To Sing Along With","review":"This was Marillion's first Fish-less attempt, and all in all, a successful one. Their style was still a little bit \\"Fishy\\", and was to change completely with later recordings such as Brave and Afraid of Sunlight, and their newest, This Strange Engine. It falls a bit flat sometimes, but for the most part keeps the listener's attention. The ballads are very nice. There are some very catchy tunes and lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"An absolutely disappointing album from the brillant 80s prog-band Marillion.Fish's unique voice and lyrics' absence had left Marillion in a desperate helpless situation, where Steve Hogarth's replacement was a poor effort only.I would recommend Marillion's previous albums, especially the perfect trilogy of \\"Script For A Jester's Tear - Fugazi - Misplaced Childhood\\" for the ones who will start listening to Marillion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful if you burn easily","review":"While I have loved Burt's Bees products for years, I would not sleep well at night if I didn't write this review/warning.I have very sensitive-to-the-sun lips and I thought I had found the promised land when I found Lifeguard's Choice! However, I used it for one day while on vacation in Puerto Rico and was sorry for the rest of the trip. I was burned to a crisp. I have since contacted the company to see if the product indeed contains SPF and sure enough it does not (as SPF compounds are not organic - understandably). Though it never claims to contain SPF on the label, it does claim to be weatherproofing. I'm not sure the title of \\"Lifeguard's Choice\\" is quite accurate.I also find it disappointing and a bit misleading that when I did a search for \\"lip balm spf\\" on the Amazon search this product appeared. Careful Amazon.I still love Burt's Bees - I just read the labels more carefully now. Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I should have read the only other review. The DVD indeed only shows a series of female nudes, accompanied by music.

It is possible though that the communications theory at its core could be dry even dull to one with no interest in the subject matter. That is most definitely not the case though. The anecdotal layout of Watzlawick's writing makes for an informative and fascinating read.Through no fault of the author's some of the anecdotal stories are a little dated due to the time of publication such as when he writes about cold war situations in his disinformation sectiom. However this does not take away from the theories being discussed in these parts so do not affect the overall reality of the book haha.If nothing else this book should inspire the reader to question exactly what is reality and muse about objectivity vs. subjectivity in communication thus affecting one's own reality and I think he succeeds admirably in getting his points across in an interesting often funny medium."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!","review":"I really enjoyed reading P.T.

Numerous clips of ceremonies such as Trooping the Colour, the Ceremony of the Keys, the Opening of Parliament, etc. are included. Quality is somewhat spotty of course given the difficulty of adequate microphone placement outdoors with marching bands etc. but all in all is quite good and certainly beats having to jostle with crowds in front of Buckingham Palace. The sequence depicting the Band of the Coldstream Guards in their winter greatcoats marching on to the tune \\"the Voice of the Guns\\" is worth the price alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have","review":"this is a teriffic game and i enjoy playing it all the time. i can't tell you how exiting it is to do a barrel role and shoot down an enemy plane at the same time. this game is awsome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aging....","review":"This is not good game and the graphics are dated.

It is a good starting point for folks who have many months to study. It offers very simple strategies to tackle the most basic problems. However, it does not sufficiently prepare you for any more complicated LSAT questions.The largest problem with this book is the practice tests are riddled with errors. In one section of a practice test I counted 11 different obvious mistakes which would lead a test taker to select an answer that would be correct, but would be marked as incorrect by the answer sheet. As a result, the book does not offer test takers an accurate assessment of their ability to perform on the test, and is likely to instigate false insecurities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever!","review":"Most of my complaints with this book have already been articulated by other reviewers, but just in case you need more convincing, I am another very unhappy customer. I bought this at a bookstore and deeply regret not having checked amazon for reviews, because it was a waste of time and money, as well as a detriment to my studying. The errors found were not things that could possibly be just me misunderstanding--they were blatant like the answer & explanation not matching any of the answer options given in the question.

In the first 30 pages of this study section I have found SEVEN ERRORS that lead the reader to an incorrect answer. This has made studying very confusing. While the methods explained in this book are useful, the number of errors makes it difficult to study and consistently trust the books answers. This is the worst type of book to include errors because the stakes are high (LSAT score) and it discourages the reader from trusting the methods explained. DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!

It will not adequately prepare you for REAL test questions. If you want to do better, look to books that use REAL test questions, such as Kaplan and Princeton Review. LSAC's books will give you actual old tests, but they won't give you advice for how to approach each question. Get the LSAC books once you've worked through Kaplan and/or Princeton Review and just need additional practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book","review":"As mentioned in the other reviews, this book is littered with errors.It is very frustrating to spend long periods of time on problems that you feel you aren't understanding, only to find out later that the question itself is wrong!!My personal suggestion is to buy a different study guide and purchase actual previous LSAT exams to practice for time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure, the answer keys are useless and confusing, but the general advice is helpful","review":"It is true that the answer keys in this book suck, making it impossible to ever really know if you are getting the sample questions correct.

In the end, he was right and the world was wrong. This book captures that wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Churchillians will love this book","review":"The 8 years covered in this book were quite possibly the most dangerous years of the 20th Century. Had Churchill not existed England might well have followed the rest of Europe into Nazi domination.

Even then, Germany had to declare war on the States before America would react to Hitler.Manchester captures perfectly the times and the man himself.

You can understand why Chamberlin was motivated to placate Hitler and why the French felt secure behind their unbreachable defenses.

It is splendidly written and one stands in dismay to read how dangerous and short-sighted the men opposing Churchill were and how right Churchill was in calling attention to the folly of Baldwin and Chamberlain and those who supported them, The years covered by this book are doleful and can only be borne because one knows that all comes right in the end.

The laughter grew so raucous that Churchill could not continue. These are the sort of snapshots that Manchester captures that makes this book such a delightful read.Churchill was written off more than once. This second snapshot describes what happened:\\"Joseph Stalin, receiving a British delegation headed by Nancy and George Bernard Shaw, had bluntly asked her about Winston's political prospects.Her eyes widened. 'Churchill?' she had said. She gave a scornful little laugh and replied, 'Oh, he's finished.'\\" These are just two examples of the thoroughness of this well-written book.

The headphones essentially fell apart and had to be reassembled. Within six months, small cracks appeared on the mounting points connecting the two earphones to the headband. Finally after about seven months, both mounting points broke in exactly the same spot, suggesting a design failure. The product carries a one year replacement warranty, but when I contacted JVC they refused to cover it under the warranty, citing \\"cosmetic or physical damage.\\" The product was only used as intended, and never subjected to any stress or impacts. I recommend that you seek a better designed product, unless you only intend to use it for three months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"Sound quality was just fine, but this one is very handy and takes less space and an easy choice for travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise cancelling? Pshaw....","review":"I have a pair of Sennheiser noise canceling headphones. When turned on, they do the job nicely, so I know what noise canceling headphones are supposed to do. I got a pair of these \\"noise canceling\\" headphones as a freebie service award from my company, with the idea that my partner could use them on a 14 hour flight that we're about to take. They look very nice, and appear to be solidly made. The sound quality is reasonable. But noise canceling? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. They don't even reduce the sound of computer running under my desk. We have a pair of $10, old school Sony earmuffs that do a better job of reducing ambient noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts my ears","review":"I bought these somwwhere other than Amazon, but was not satisfied with the comfort.

I had tested during the 13 hours trip in air from Tokyo to Chicago.Overall it was comfortable set with decent sound quality. But the Noice cancellating is not very good. There is barely any difference between the Noise cancellation mode on and off. Honesly it might only cancel 30% of the noise instead of the 75% labled. Only way I can do was to turn up the volumn to cover the flight noise. You can get the same good sound quality earphone with a fraction of price in US marke which does not have the noise cancellation lable. considering the price i paid, I would rate the deal I have is about 2 stars. But if you can get the price at around $30, I will rate the deal to 3 stars.I had tried the Bose set in the AA's business class. It was much much better set than this one here. If you really want to use one in airplan. I will recommend trying somthing better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until plastic broke at hinge","review":"I had these headphones for about a year now and they served me well until today when the headphones broke at the hinge where they fold.

However if noise reduction isn't the primary purpose, these are fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"First off, the noise cancelling feature is non-existent. So know that going in if you are still thinking about purchasing. Compared to the Bose QuietComfort 15 Headphones, these are tin cans. The bass in the JVC is very poor as well. Don't expect your hip hop or electronic music to sound as it should. I would describe the quality of sound as comparable to the free airline headphones you get on a plane. The construction is one step up from airplane quality headphones though. The self coiling feature on the plug is convenient, but feels a bit cheap. As you can tell, there aren't many good features about these. I would definitely try something else. There are way better products out there for this same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased these to use on a 12 hour plane ride. Unfortunately, the noise cancelling is minimal at best. In fact you have to listed closely to hear a difference. I kept switching them on & off just to detect any differences. Even worse, the sound quality is just plain aweful. Music from my iPod sounded muddled. I ended up using mu VModa ear buds with 100x better results. These were just a waste of money. I recommend spending the additional $$ for a better quality set."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't wear them in public","review":"I don't understand why they would make the arms of these headphones jut out to the side of your head so dramatically. Really goofy looking and actually uncomfortable because the weight of the headphones are supported by the rigid pad that rests top center of your skull. So they look really stupid and they give me a headache from having this dead weight pressing into the top of my head. Why?Trust me, the folding feature isn't worth all of this, because they are still the size of a grapefruit when folded and there's no way to keep the chord under control. If you try to wrap the chord around the folded headphones it all comes apart. Really dumb design. Who tested this and decided that it should be sold to the public!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality - Low Price","review":"These phones work well for my intended purpose.

Steer clear of this worthles piece of equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok headphones but...","review":"I bought these to specifically block outside sounds and I hardly notice a difference when the noise canceling is activated or not. This is the first pair of noise canceling headphones I have ever tried so maybe I am expecting too much from them.

Maybe noise doesn't work in environments such as this but for the price you can buy better, slimmer headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay more for something that works","review":"These are uncomfortable, and do not cancel out much noise at all when on a plane.

She complained that even with the noise cancelling on, she could still hear the TV, even at extremely low volumes. The headphones are comfortable enough for on the ear style, but I'd recommend an over the ear version for better comfort. In the end, I am going to spend the extra money and get her a pair of able planet NC110B. Caught them on sale so the difference in price is only 50 dollars. I own a pair of the NC1000s and they work great.Overall, decent sound, poor Noise Cancelling, and you'd probably be better served spending just a little more $ to get a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this.","review":"I think it should not be called as \\"Noise Canceling\\" headset because it is not.Sound quality is OK. There is one small button to select \\"Wide\\" and \\"Low\\" which do nothing.Its a lower prices product from JVC so, do not expect much from it.Second thing : Seller charge a lot of shipping and restocking fees which cover almost 50% cost for product. Seller is too poor to afford return shipping. If you ever think of returning it, you better do not buy it :)Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Headphones","review":"Overall a good pair of headphones, but I mostly have used earbuds for the last couple years, so this is a big step up. The noise cancelling feature is not super powerful, I have only tried using it in my office, and it maybe is a 50% cancellation. The main noise reduction is just putting the padded phones over your ears snugly. On that note, I had to find a way to seat the earphones so that they didn't push directly on my ears too much, as after a couple hours they do start to become uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for ... i guess","review":"I bought the headphones as a secondary to my bose in-ear headphones. what sold me on the headphones was the noise cancellation ability....i live in nyc and the morning commute is loud and sometimes it's loud to the point that i can't hear my music (i usually turn up the ipod all the way up only to barely be able to hear it). with that said....these headphones did not deliver. the noise cancellation is barely detectable and the over all sound is not as clean as i would expect from the JVC brand. As mentioned the headphone design is poor and makes long wearing sessions impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"When the sound getting through is the same if the power is on or off, what does that tell you?

They worked well until the joint at the headband broke with not much force needed. This plastic part is brittle and this, in the days of cross-linked polymers that are as tough and resilient as leather, is unforgiveable. Then JVC give you an education. The broken knuckle can be removed in 2 minutes and is the only part of the whole assembly than can be replaced, but there are no parts available. JVC says the headphones are \\"replaceable\\" that is they are throw away.My next headphones will be more sturdily built."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise-cancelling--NOT!!!","review":"I bought this strictly for the noise-cancelling feature and was disappointed.

These headphones are incorrectly categorized as over-the-ear instead of on-the-ear. The cups are only about an inch wide on the inside, the headphones themselves are a bit over 3\\" in diameter. They go on the ear, not over the ear.

They are very comfortable, provide excellent noise cancellation, and cost a little over 3 times what the NC - 80's cost. But they are well worth it. The difference between these and the NC80's is like night and day.I have also used the Sony MDR-NC60's for several years. These unpleasantly color high frequency sounds when the noise cancelling feature is active. Noice cancellation is OK, but they are bulky and heavy.I bought the NC 80's because I wanted another pair of noise cancellers to keep in the car. I was disapointed to find that they did not do the job, and so will return them. Instead, I will buy another pair of NC250's, which are the best I have ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"JVC Noise cancelling","review":"I bought these for about $30.

I have a pair of Coby CV195 noise-cancelling headphones, but needed another pair for my wife, and these looked good. However, I found them to be lacking. First, they were uncomfortable - the Coby's are large and sit over the ears, while these sit on top of my ears and press in. Second, they did not do nearly as good a job as my Coby's did in blocking out jet noise. Third, the Coby's had a detachable cord, which was nice when I just wanted the noise reduction without wanting to listen to anything else. Finally, about an hour into my last flight, the headphone jack pretty much stopped working. The Coby's were less expensive, more comfortable, and have worked really well for over 3 years. I strongly suggest you check them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"I am sure there are other headphones for sale with better sound but for the inexpensive price, these headphones will work just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"marginal at best","review":"Based upon other reviews, I looked forward to getting the results I needed at non-Bose prices.

She performs with an A-student proficiency that never adds up to an interpretation, skillfully negotiating each technical challenge in a commendable but wholly unexciting fashion. Time for a new version, I'd say--but considering how poorly she handles Beethoven's Sonatas in her recent multi-disc release, one wonders if age has brought mastery or degeneration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music here!!","review":"Wonderful, \\"desert island\\" recordings. I don't even know whom to praise first! Anne-Sophie Mutter's beautiful engaging, sensual and powerful violin playing is given energetic, warm and spirited support by the greatest maestro ever - Herbert von Karajan. On triple concerto they are joined by the stellar company of Yo-Yo Ma and Mark Zeltser, creating the only competition to Oistrach and Rostropovich (also with Maestro Karajan, on EMI).The whole experience is astonishing, Beethoven's music blazes through the speakers with incredible poignancy and splendor. In liner notes Anne-Sophie Mutter explains that through innovation and revolutionary vision Beethoven created the greatest violin concerto in history. Preferences may vary, but you will agree with her after listening to this incredible album. Thanks to DG for issuing these great performances in a single set, graced by a picture of lovely and charismatic Ms. Mutter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply beautiful","review":"Anne-Sophie Mutter takes the Beethoven concerto to a whole new level. Ms. Mutter brings to your attention a depth to the concerto that you just don't hear when others perform it. Other performers take the piece at face value, and it becomes just another display of virtuosity. Mutter, though (no doubt under the suggestion of Herbert von Karajan), takes her time and thoroughly examines every last phrase, making this the most beautiful recording I've heard. The piece becomes not so much a concerto, but a wonderful symphony with gorgeous violin commentary. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"best recording of Beethoven's Violin Concerto","review":"This is the best recording of Beethoven's Violin Concerto -- Ithzak Perlman's recording is overly loud, monodynamic, and sluggish, not to say it's horrible of course. However, Anne-Sophie Mutter doesn't play the violin solos as well as she could -- there is, like another reviewer mentioned, an overuse of vibrato. However, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra puts out one of its best performances on this CD.I don't much like the Triple Concerto, so I can't comment on it without bias. However, the Violin Concerto is one of my favorite pieces, and I advise you to add this music to your classical collection. -_-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial.","review":"I personally did not like the book.

And reading over this book, I have to wonder if they did that to other stories as well. In many cases, the endings seems to have a different tone than the rest of the work. This experience has really spoiled the Chicken Soup series for me and my family.

After approximately ten minutes, he is all teary-eyed and encases me in a huge bear-hug. He has romantic tendencies, but it takes an act of God (or Chicken Soup, apparently) to inspire actions such as this on his part. I find the book interesting, eloquent at times, and generally worthy of a warm, fuzzy glow. It is easy to steal a glance at one or two stories during a few minutes of spare time, and equally easy to read the entire book in one sitting on a rainy afternoon. That is, if you can pry it away from your significant other's grasp.

SO THE GAME DOESN'T RUN, and I have no emulation software running.This is extremely bad form for a game, and I'm tempted to just ask for a refund instead of trying to work around the problem.

This game has all the aspects of the first one when it comes to unique shading and excellent graphics, however, they didn't do anything new. It was like an add-on pack at best. Also for being such a large game (nearly twice the size of the first one) I would have expected it to be longer. The game is very short, there are many levels with zero body count and the story doesn't really go anywhere. Not to mention there wasn't any new weapons or special moves added. ***SPOILER*** What's worse is you don't even get to kill the two \\"bosses\\", they're just spy missions!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"I have a Sony dru720a dvd rw /xp and this program loaded with little problems.

I didn't have any problems wit the installation, and the graphics were exceptional on my Radeon 9800 Pro. Only downside? Too short. Beat the game on normal mode in exactly 7 days.

The clear plastic baffle portion that flows away from the feeder to keep the squirrels off doesn't stay in place. There's no solid clipping mechanism to hold it as pictured.

However, were it not for the connection to Sept. 11, there would be little reason for this book to exist. While I'm sure these emails were interesting and informative to friends and family, they are really very tedious. I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that the financial situation of the family made it difficult to relate to them - stories about birthday parties filled with nannies and hired companions did not make me feel sympathy for the family.

Hopefully that will go away all together with a little more time. All in all what you would expect from a $10 slipper made in China.

Although the percentage of zinc oxide is not listed on the packaging, it must be higher than other creams, since it really seems to stay on even through the night (her bottom is still chalky white in the morning) and creates a better barrier on the skin. With every other cream, it seems that the zinc oxide just sort of 'melts' away. And for us, that seems to have been the key to clearing diaper rash up. Some reviews have commented on the scent - I would describe it as a strong lavender smell (it contains two different kinds of lavender) that is really nice. Definitely a product worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff works","review":"I received a couple of different diaper ointments (Burt's Bees, CVS brand's version of Boudreaux's Butt Paste, Weleda Diaper Ointment and Balmex) at my baby shower. I LOVED the Weleda cream and found that Burt's Bees was almost exactly the same thing. When I went to resupply, I found that Burt's Bees was a few dollars cheaper than the Weleda so I bought six tubes! The only thing I don't like is the tube its self. It's hard to squeeze every thing out at the end but in terms of healing diaper rashes and protecting baby's skin: A++. And it smells nice. I should also note I use cloth diapers.

Giving it the benefit of the doubt, perhaps it was an allergy to something in the cream. However, we have used several other creams with no reaction, she had no change in diet, and was not actively cutting a tooth. After 2 days use, she had red welts all over her diaper area and we discontinued use immediately. After that, the rash cleared up and she's been fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use if your child has broken skin","review":"My child had a horrible case of diaper rash with broken skin.

Bad bad bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"the only diaper ointment to buy for your baby!","review":"I purchased other types of ointment for my baby before she was born (aveeno & weleda brand)but when she got her first diaper rash I tried the burt's bees and her bottom was looking better within several hours of application. The ointment didn't irritate her sensitive skin and it kept a protective barrier for up to 12 hours without any re-application needed. It also has a clean smell with essential oils.

The only issue that I have is with the plastic tubing and for this reason I rate it as a 4 stars overall. While the packaging is of good quality, I feel that the plastic tube is too stiff/thick and as a result squeezing ointment out is more difficult than it should be. This is especially true when the tube is almost empty. I sometimes feel like I end up throwing ointment away unnecessarily b/c I can't fully exhaust everything in the tube.

It doesn't spread as well though, it's much harder.

This has worked well and is supposed to be less toxic. However, it is very thick and hard to get out of the tube. I end up wasting a lot when I get down to the bottom, and it's hard to control how much comes out at a time. I encourage the manufacturer to release a version in a tub with a screw top lid. Also, the smell gets a bit sickening after being associated with human waste. I would also encourage an unscented version. If not for those two issues, the product would be a 5 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it...","review":"I received this along with the baby powder. I used the powder with no issues and I also purchased Burt's Bees Bath and Shampoo and have not had any issues. The shampoo/body wash works great and smells pleasantly like honey. No reactions or allergies. However, when I used Burt's Bees Baby Bee Diaper Ointment on my baby I found it greasy, sticky, and very odoriferous. My baby did not seem to mind, so I continued to use it.After several applications I noticed that her minor rash was becoming more and more angry. Having not changed her diet and she was not having diarrhea, I could not account for the worsening of her rash. I stopped using the ointment and started using A&D.; Her rash cleared up in a day.I would not recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Fragrant!","review":"Not a fan - I found the smell of this diaper ointment to be far too strong for my liking.Granted, I'm not too partial to baby products with added fragrance, but this one was particularly offensive.

We used it on a newborn and 6 hours of crying ensued. After a trip to the ER and the baby checked out fine it was determined that it had to be the diaper cream. It smells strongly of menthol. Lesson learned to stay with the tried and true Desitin or Boudreauxs. Very sad for a newborn and first time mother to have to endure. Burts should stay with what they know. The best part is that it was a gift and no cost (except the ER bill) and it's now in the trash compactor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's the story...","review":"This book is \\"An official Tiger Beat publication\\". So, that should tell you right there that this is a book for kids. This is not an adaptation of any episode of the TV series, it's an original story. The Bradys go on vacation to Mystery Island (an island off the coast of Maine), and get mixed up in a mystery (of the Scooby Doo variety). Are the Bradys really being haunted by pirate ghosts, or is somebody just trying to scare them off? What do you think? This book is about as good as you would expect it to be. Although a few times a Brady will say or do something that seems out of character. But it's not like the Bradys had well defined characters in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"I suppose it had to happen sooner or later. I was disappointed by a Biscuit book! The art is just as endearing as in previous volumes but the story really misses the mark.In previous special event flap books, we see Biscuit and the Girl-in-purple-sneakers experience holidays and events from a child's perspective. But each manages to say something about how a child experiences the event/holiday. But in this one, there is no information about what is going on other than it is a graduation. After reading it to my kids I had to explain what went on and what graduations are.

I knew I had read about it somewhere in THE RIGHT CHOICE but without an index I never found an answer my question. That experience was typical of the troubles I found with this book. Overall it was a hard book to follow because its thrust was American public schools vs homeschooling not any classroom education vs homeschooling. It included very little about the nuts and bolts of homeschooling and what advice it did include was strange.

This book did a fairly good job with the mystery, but it's a romance first and foremost.

It has a wonderful story, is well acted, and it is very motivational. RM sheds a positive light on the values of motivational instruction. DeVito portrays a down on his luck ad man who needs motivation of his own. He takes a job a basic training base and is given a handful of troops to prepare for the basics of basic. The movie is as much about his need for inspiration as it is about the troops whom he inspires. He uses Shakespeare to motivate his troops, and it works marvelously. Great story, very good acting, and inspirational. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renaissance Man","review":"This movie, Renaissance Man, is an entertaining movie that actually makes the Shakespeare Play, Hamlet, interesting. Danny DeVito is funny as a man who has to take a job teaching the \\"stupid\\" recruits and, through the use of his literary love of Shakespeare, is able to inspire them to \\"be all they can be\\". Not meant to be an epic movie or life-changing, it's just the kind of movie I like; just right for an evening in with family and a bag of popcorn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devito Classic","review":"This is one of Danny DeVito best movies ever, it just shows you can put him in any style comedy movie and it will be funny.

Danny DeVito shows a a great range of emotions in his role as the teacher. Perhaps the most moving part is the reciting of a scene from Shakespeare's \\"Henry V\\" by a soldier from the group while camping with his unit in the pouring rain. Certainly a better picture than the reviews would indicate, this highlights a man who is caught up in the thrill of seeing others learn as a result of his efforts as a teacher.

Renaissance Man has multiple messages and valuable lessons - AND a cool introduction to Shakespeare. There is no sex, no nudity, no violence.

I place the map on the wall by the entrance to the kitchen. On the way in or out of kitchen, we enjoy lingering and talking about kangaroos in Australia, diamonds in South Africa, pandas in China and so forth.

It's like a more watered down version of Nickleback. They sing a verse and then basically just repeat it for two or three minutes until they get tired of singing the same verse over and over again. Paul Simon, he makes it seem not as random as Nickleback does, but it's still pretty bad. It sounds better then Nickleback, but that's still not good.How do you live in the Northeast is a horribe song. I understood what it was trying to say, I don't think anyone wouldn't get it if they listened to it. It was a pointless, political song that just kept asking the same questions over and over again. \\"Outrageous\\" was a good song. It was funny, but it was plagued with the same repetition that most of the tracks seem to suffer from.It's nice and smooth and it goes down easy, but old Paul Simon beats this new stuff anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"fuzzy-headed new-age spirituality","review":"I'm a huge Paul Simon fan. Hated this record.This is basically a spiritual/religious record. In the past, I've enjoyed Simon's satire-flavored take on religion in \\"Duncan,\\" and was able to enjoy an occasional less tongue-in-cheek approach on tracks like \\"Mother and Child Reunion,\\" the folk song \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain,\\" and \\"Long, Long Day.\\" But in a concentrated dose like this, it just makes me gag.

Paul Simon is one of those guys who is easy to dismiss, but then you listen and listen and you realize he's done it again. Usually. And Eno! I'm a huge fan, since Roxy.At first, I was disappointed. No songs really stuck out, and it sounded as if Paul Simon had some U2 envy. I thought it might be a failure, like Rhythm of the Saints. A lot of heavy chords this time around. But now I've listened several times. Now all the songs strike me, and I wait with anticipation for each one; and the arrangements and band are swirling accomplishments. There are many. many little surprises in almost every song. Eno's role...he's a producer with Simon, but I think he doesn't really take this one over. I still really haven't heard the lyrics (!) but it's a real good record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Paul Simon is a very skilled songwriter who has done some remarkable work. \\"Bookends\\" and \\"Graceland\\" were brilliant, and a number of other songs are classics. But he is also terribly concerned with proving to people how serious he is, and how clever he is, and demonstrating how he can write just about any kind of pop song imaginable. And this can get very, very tiresome, as it does in this album. If there were great tunes here it would be one thing, but there really aren't any here. And lyrically it is extremely overdone. What does he mean by \\"I registered to vote today\\" in \\"Sure Don't Feel Like Love\\"? Listen to the lyrics in that song and you'll realize there's nothing there-just a series of semi-clever phrases strung together. It's second-rate stream of conscousness writing posing as \\"poetry\\", something that seems to afflict many older songwriters.

However the Brian eno production was pretty good.The song seem to be snippets of unfinished longer songs they don't seem to go anywhere. Although there are very good sections such as the poignant \\"Another Galaxy\\" or the best song Paul has come up with \\"Father and Daughter\\"(this song seems to have been tossed in as an after thought. It does not fit in with the rest of the songs).There are good songs such as Outrageous and Once Upon A Time There Was An Ocean but they end with no apparent point as though they needed another verse but there wasn't any time.

But after You are the One it seems as if Simon has lost its path, and Surprise confirms such point. No more newly rythms from the end of the world, no more catchy lyrics, no more melodies that you can't get out of your head. Surprise would be Hearts and bones with a twist if it weren't for those electric guitars and misplaced music drilling your head. It's as if someone had taken Paul's voice and mixed it with a modern bands's garage rehearsals. Only when Paul is alone with his guitar and original style you start to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacklustre","review":"Paul Simon seems to have truly lost his way 0n this dirge-like CD - nothing memorable here.

But I do download individual songs. I am a great admirer of much of Simon's work, and was excited to hear \\"Surprise\\" on the evening before it's official release. But it turns out to be 2 or 3 fairly good tunes with a bunch of filler (what used to be called \\"flip sides\\" in the olden days). Very, very little in the way of memorable melodies. Please spare me from the \\"soundscape\\" or whatever it's called. Truth be told, I'd go for another S&G tour with a nice stint of strong Simon solo material, a la the Central Park concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy","review":"I wanted to like this album, but found that lyrics interfered with, rather than added to, my enjoyment of the songs.

After a few listenings I gave up, and won't be playing it much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invest In This One","review":"I hate to admit it, but it's often the albums I don't take to immediately that I end up liking best. It makes me wonder how many great albums I have dismissed too early. If you are a true die hard Paul Simon fan, this is a must buy. But be warned, you may not take to it immediately. It is definitely a departure of sound from his previous releases. Instead of the organic percussiveness that made Rhythm Of The Saints such a masterpiece (his best, in my book), it's grooves are a bit more electronic. But if you are willing to invest yourself in this CD, it will not let you down. I can't stop listening to, and loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"lush and emotional, this music is fabulous","review":"Run, don't walk, to get this CD.

A treasure trove for the ear.Just simply fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star","review":"Okay, I don't think he will ever be able to top Graceland (which I give 5 out of 5 stars) and Rhythm of the Saints was a big disappointment after that. I agree with the reviewers who bemoan the use of electronics here. It takes the soul out of the music. Don't try to be modern for the sake of it. I want real, genuine music, look what Springsteen has done with the Seeger Sessions. Excellent. I predict that Surprise will sink into obscurity. Shamefiul waste of obvious talent.

Cute baby on the cover though, who is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad Paul Simon album....Surprise indeed.","review":"What sounded like the best news of 2006 for my CD collection is sadly the only Paul Simon album I can't listen to. The first three tracks by Eno are just strange and give the album a disturbing eletronic vibe from the get go. Following these first three tracks you have 8 of the most generic bland singer-songwriter songs I have ever heard in my life. And if that wasn't enough, Paul himself will be sure to tell you that he's \\"never been in it for the money\\" nevermind those $200 simon and garfunkel tickets. Do yourself a favor and buy the Damien Rice album. Not this time Paul, please drive through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment!","review":"I've been listening to Paul Simon and buying his stuff from the start.

What a huge disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable?","review":"Not really unbelievable when you consider the quality of nearly all his previous offerings as a solo performer. He had to throw a dud sometime. Possibly this album would have made more sense as a book of prose. Frankly, I would have been disappointed if Mr. Simon didn't have something to say about the state of the world as it exists today, but musically this album is a failure. I applaud an artist's desire to grow and evolve, but this collection is a step in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I'm a Paul Simon fan - I own every single one of his albums.

Similar to other albums he has made like Rhythm of the Saints, you need to listen to the new one several times to soak it all in. There is a lot of information in there but well worth the time to seek it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little story","review":"I've only listened to this cd once (I got it yesterday). I love Rhythm, and Grace, and I've been a Paul Simon fan since he was Simon and--. I got to the point where I could hear the beauty in You're the One, and I know I will get to that point with Surprise as well.But lack of exposure, and surprise that Surprise was (I'm not someone who reads music reviews in advance) aside, yesterday, after listening to the cd just the one time, I found myself quoting a lyric to someone. Then I did it again. And they were perfect, they fit, they added to the conversation--because they were true.And that's why we love Paul Simon. Because at the root of it, he's us, imbued with the genius we all wish we had, and the stories he's telling, has always told, are the stories we would tell if we could. The music, great as it is, is just lagniappe.He makes me glad I was born at the right time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your father's Paul Simon album.","review":"This is a very different sounding Paul Simon album. The influence of Brian Eno is obvious and at times over-the-top. My conclusion, now that I've had this album for a while, is that it's not one that I'm constantly listening to but, when I'm in the mood, this is really an interesting and fun album. Occasionally, Paul reaches heights I don't feel he's reached since Graceland. There are some great songs on here. If you're looking for \\"Still Crazy after all these years\\" or \\"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\\" - type songs, you're not going to find them here. If you're interested in hearing Paul push the envelope, however, this is the one. Paul hits the mark more often than he misses it on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of those CD's you can just play","review":"working on my dissertation, the most important thing, a cd that I can just put in and play unattended.. (and does not add to my anxiety). This fits both.. This is a very mellow cd with lots of fabulous melodies and harmonies. In several places it reminded me of Indigo Girls, where they are making such great harmony and it just wows you.. I think another reason I compare to Indigo Girls is that it reminds of my their last CD All that we let in.. It has a mix of what you would expect, and then also some technoed up songs.. the same is true here.. (Especially Outrageous has a certain Dave Matthews 'I did it' feel to it..)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, But a Good Surprise","review":"This is VERY different from most Paul Simon albums, in a lot of ways. The soundscape created by Brian Eno is much different than most anything Paul Simon's done in the past. Paul Simon's evolved a little, but his music is still there, hidden beneath the production, but I don't think that's a bad thing. It's something different for Paul, and I think the album is very good. I recommend it if you're looking for something different. It's definitely not Graceland."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll write a PROPER review later...","review":"I haven't \\"lived with\\" this one long enough to give this an absolute star ranking but I found it to be \\"edgier\\" than Simon's been in years musically and it was probably the most exciting thing from him sinceThe Rhythm of the Saints. (I thought YOU'RE THE ONE was kind of bland)As such, I'll give an unqualified recommendation that you borrow this one from a friend or your local library if you have any Simon in your library outside of anthologies. It's certainly worth hearing and I'm likely to be adding it to my own collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another Paul Simon title, ANY other Paul Simon title","review":"Paul Simon the storyteller can still be found in this album.Paul Simon the singer and musician is lost to electronica and apparently silly attempts to sound modern.This is not magical Paul Simon.

I had trouble remembering a single track because they all seemed to merge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's Gonna Love You When Your Hooks Are Gone?","review":"First Paul McCartney forgot how to write a pop song, now Paul Simon. Maybe it's the name. \\"Grooves\\" and \\"vibes\\" abound in this sonically interesting collaboration with Brian Eno, but actual, hummable melodies are few and far between. To be fair, I listened to \\"Hearts and Bones\\" a few weeks before this came out, and \\"Surprise\\" kept falling short of my heightened expectations. I should have expected less, after I couldn't get through \\"You're the One\\" without 3 Red Bulls and \\"Songs from the Capeman\\" left me with a permanent shrug. It may not be \\"fashionable\\" to write a catchy pop song in 2006, but if anyone can do it, I thought Paul Simon (and Paul McCartney) could. If we want poetry laid over top of a music bed, we have Bob Dylan and Tom Waits for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest effort from Simon to date","review":"This record is a watered down, rehashed version of his previous record, \\"You're The One\\". That record, while not one of Simon's best efforts, was still an enjoyable listen.On \\"Surprise\\", Simon's songs meander and offer no real structure. The hooks are lacking; very few memorable melodies. The lyrics are forced, weak and contrived. Brian Eno's production doesn't fit with the material and is often quite silly. Thin grooves, too many synths and novelty sounding production.Too many of the vocal melodies are direct rip offs of \\"You're The One\\".I am a huge Paul Simon fan and have been for decades. I really wanted to like this record and have given it several listens - but I just don't like it.Not recommended. Simon may just be out of ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Like Surprises??","review":"It was decades ago when Dylan went electric and inspired the wrath and outrage of the senseless masses. It isn't surprising that Surprise has so many 1-star and 5-star ratings; it's that polarizing with Eno's influence doing no favors to some well crafted lyrics. My guess is that if Simon had been more prolific in recent years Surprise may have ended up just a blip in his portfolio but the wait and the label's hype make this release more disappointing. Tom Waits won't be losing any sleep over the title of greatest American song writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic and Soulful","review":"I may be making too much out of Brian Eno's contributions here, but this CD does not sound like \\"my father's\\" Paul Simon. I'm hearing this dark and tuneful voice singing about things I don't recall multi-mega millionaire superstar singers singing about. And I'm hearing clever, jumpy and at times very funky electronic instrumentation. And I'm hearing a flat-out rocking, kick arse break at the end of \\"How Can You Live In The Northeast\\". And are those sleigh bells towards the end of \\"Outrageous\\"? That small caress of (uh oh, here's that word) \\"sonic\\" goodness? Maybe I've just never \\"gotten\\" Simon before. I do recall \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and \\"The Boxer\\" having these very dense and clever arrangments. In fact, those were probably the first \\"pop\\" songs I recall ever liking. So maybe Simon's \\"leap\\" to Eno-ism is not that foreign a venture. I can see, though, how it could be foreign to people who think of Simon in \\"older\\" terms, but the music must change. Musn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised!","review":"At first I didn't pay close enough attention to the words of the songs, and I felt something was missing. After listening again, It is true Paul Simon words and updated for his life and age. It's really cute how he is able to complain about getting older and not liking it on bit. (the 900 situps a day) Then I realized it was the music I was missing. I prefer his bouncing rhythms and drums from the last albums. Otherwise I catch different songs running thur my mind.

I was wrong. \\"Murder In The Name Of God\\" is a newly embroidered tapestry of the Fundamentalist threat to Israeli Democracy, even to its very existence.

With using longer pool hoses/poles, or in deeper pools it's difficult to determine if it's actually flat on the bottom of the pool because it's so light weight. Even in my 4.5' deep pool, if I try to vaccume too fast, it will lift off the bottom.

I needed the tool that is why I purchased it so I don't want to half to deal with sending it back over a sheath so I will now half to order another one from somewhere so I can tack on another 10% of the cost for a new sheath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for a friend","review":"I already have one of these, and I bought it for a friend so that they would have a multi-tool in case of emergency. The tool is rugged, and works great for what it is... Not as good as dedicated tools, but that is to be expected. The sheath I received was all leather except for the expandable sides, so there does seem to be some inconsistency with the sheath shipped with this unit.The tool and 6 extra bits fit well in the sheath, and the tool, bits and sheath are the good quality I associate with Leatherman.I have screw drivers that I prefer for installing screws around the house, but they ore useless at gripping.I have pliers that can grip things solidly, but as a knife they really don't cut it.I have a saw that can cut through branches quickly, but are useless for opening cans.If I had to have just one tool, it would have to be the Leatherman Wave.

The characters are well-developed and likeable, and humourous parts are frequent, even during suspenseful moments. The author has provided good descriptions of the clothing, settings, and holiday customs of that time, as well as some British history.The political intrigue tended to drag on a little too long, while the ending could have been stretched out more, since it left me wanting for more details.Altogether, I would recommend this book, and will probably read it again next Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"If the scriptwriters were going to change the story to the point that nothing but the movie title resembled the book, they should have just given the movie a different title. This moronic film in no way resembles the book it claims to be based on. Steve Martin seems to be making a career out of ruining classic stories. First he was allowed to destroy \\"Father of the Bride\\", then \\"Father of the Bride 2\\" (otherwise known as \\"Daddy's Little Dividend\\") and now \\"Cheaper By the Dozen\\". I hope the real Gilbraiths at least got a truck load of royalities for this idiot rendering of their family story. This movie didn't try to be even semi-intelligent. It was aimed at the lowest common denominator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly movie","review":"This is a silly movie where it's the Father's job to entertain the kids, and it's the kid's job to run the family's affairs. That isn't what the book was about, and it's not what this movie should have been about either.Oh, and I think there were two jokes in the movie.I thought Steve Martin (the person) was better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I Ever Thought It Would Have Been","review":"This is indeed a surprsingly very good family movie. From the previews, it looked kind of iffy, but it turned out to be really great. Steve Martin did an excellent job in this movie as the dad who has to try to keep 12 kids under control while the mom is gone. This movie has a lot of jokes that had me laughing minutes after the joke was finished. The only downside to the film is that towards the end, it tends to drag and lose steam. It goes from being really funny, to completely serious and a family moment kind of thing. This movie is worth seeing, it has some really funny stuff. It's inspired me to see the second film and the original movie. Overall, something I was surprised about how good it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1 is better","review":"What the hell is Steve Martin doing? Sassy comedies with Queen Latifa and this thing, apparently. Maybe he's in a coma? He's forgotten how to read? He is drugged and brought to sets of movies regularly? I'd like to think any of these, but I'm afraid these roles are concious decisions...But hey, this movie has a few laughs, if you like ZANY comedies filled with ANTICS! I, on the other hand, like another kind of humor. A humor that's smart. This is good if you like Newman from Seinfeld bobbing from a chandelier, crying for help.And I don't think there is any need to summarize the plot. A lot of kids share a house with their parents. If this appeals to you, buy it. If not, I suggest National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1. Seriously...it's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining, but misses the moral of the book","review":"The movie is fairly clean and mildly entertaining, but it misses the whole point of the book.

Not for reality, to be entertained and that is exactly what this movie does. It will entertain you from start to finish.There are some great moments in this flick (I won't spoil them for you)and you might even shed a tear or two.My whole family sat down and enjoyed the rental last night and the movie did not disappoint in any aspect. I think this movie could have been rated G, however, they probably made more money by creating a PG rating it.This is definitely a safe spend on the rental market and frankly, worth my money for the DVD purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A John Hughes comedy without John Hughes ain't much...","review":"This kinda movie makes you realize just what a Master the Great John Hughes was at family comedy. The Home Alones, Uncle Buck, Weird Science, Ferris Bueller, etc... Everything the guy touched turned to gold. Whatever happened to him anyway? They sure coulda used him here. This movies tries hard to be a Hughes type of film but all I could think while watching was how it could have been better scripted, acted, directed, scored, and better jokes.A lame directorial attempt made worse by the lame comedic timing of Ashton Kutcher, a lack of Steve Martins trademark physical comedy, and too many Nike endorsements among others. How many scenes was that one kid wearing that same Old Navy shirt?!?For those looking for a decent later years Steve Martin effort, Bringin Down the House was way better than this schlup, if there is such a word."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazingly funny!!!","review":"If you have children from 6 to 10, you're kids gonna love it.

The parents were completely ineffective and clueless on how to raise children much less organize such a large household.This is the typical Hollywood view of families -- that is a family composed of loud mouthed rude children with a quick response to totally goofy parents.

Non-stop cliched gross-out gags made me want to poke my eyes out within five minutes. The movie basically only sent the message that if kids are bratty enough, they can manipulate their parents into doing anything.The characters, unfortunately even including the father played by Steve Martin, were entirely one-dimensional and totally unendearing. I only wish that I could rate this a fraction of a star on this review scale.If you really want your kids to come away with impressions of family values or moral lessons, check out Pollyanna (Hayley Mills) or the Anne of Green Gables series. Something like The Music Man, either the Robert Preston or Matthew Broderick version, would be more fun and less mind-numbing for any audience than this.

I thought it was excellent. It was hilarious starring people like Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt as the parents, along with 12 troublesome kids. There was never a boring scene, and I think all the actors did a superb job, including those under six even. I recommend this for kids of all ages, along with their parents, and perfect for either gender. I highly recommend it, and I simply cannot wait until it comes out on video/DVD. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You could find better family movies","review":"Cheaper by the Dozen is a hokey, predictable film with very few laughs. The kids generally don't come across as cute and, unless you are a kid, watching their tired antics and their efforts to \\"outsmart\\" the adults gets boring pretty quickly.The one enjoyable thing about this movie is Steve Martin. Still, I wouldn't recommend watching the movie because of him; he doesn't have good material to work with. If you want a great Steve Martin film that centers on family life and raising children, watch Parenthood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I can't believe some people think that this movie wasn't good.

The trailer on TV was enough to make you think \\"Oh, God another Steve Martin Turkey\\". This film has no relation to the real story by this name told on screen in the 50s. I just bought copies of both of the films from the 50s to replace my taped copy. Those tell a more interesting story and the comedy is more genuine (even the slapstick moments), and they even have a nice dramatic story in them as well. Do yourself (and your DVD player) a favor, and don't contaminate it with this movie. Buy both 1950s era films (separately or the specially offered 2 pack, it doesn't matter), and watch a genuine family of 14 and how they lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaper not to buy this Turkey","review":"A truly agonizing experience is to watch this film version of Cheaper by the Dozen starring Steve Martin. The book, based on the real-life experiences of a large family, was one of my favorite books to read as an adolescent. However, this film bears little resemblance to the true story. The film is tasteless, crude, and an even bigger sin for a comedy: it's not funny. Not even faintly humorous.The so-called acting by Ashton Kutcher was amazingly bad. I cannot fathom why his \\"acting license\\" has not been revoked yet. And Steve Martin is old enough to know better than to agree to appear in this stinkeroo film (all he had to do was read the script to figure out what a huge turkey the story is, and without a good story, there is no good film).Huge waste of my time, but I saw it with my wife, who thought it was actually cute at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some movies shouldnt be made over","review":"Im sorry but some movies just should NOT be made over.

The remake (if you can even call it that), follows it's own plot, complete with distracted parents and out of control children. Watch the original, which in my opinion is a class act."},{"rating":"1","title":"why this movie stinks","review":"In Hollywood films, kids are mean. They tell their siblings to drop-dead, roll their eyes at dumb-old-dad, barf all over the floor and run away, and always seem to have a snarky come-back for every situation. They are cynical, jaded, suspicious, and totally lacking in innocence; they represent the worst aspects of adulthood.In my opinion, films like this are like extended sit-coms - although most sit-coms are better written. My family was quite stunned by how nasty everyone was; there wasn't a kind moment anywhere except in the last 5 minutes, when syrupy-violins prompt us to recall how much they really \\"love eachother\\".If you want to see a film where kids act and talk like real kids, try to get your hands on a British film called \\"Melody\\", made in the early 1970's. It'll knock your socks off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disappointment","review":"I've been a fan of Steve Martin since the days when he used to do comedy with an arrow through his head. I've liked all of his movies until this one. This should have been good, light entertainment, but in reality it is a complete disappointment.It is difficult to imagine that they could have put together a less appealling or more annoying set of children. Hilary Duff is the worst of the bunch. Even Smallville's hunky Tom Welling is wasted here.If you think children throwing objects at their teacher, setting people on fire, and roller skating inside at the top of stairs is cute you'll love this. I find it appalling.The idea that children should have a say in their parents career decisions and that they should sabotage the parent's careers if they don't like the parents choices is offensive.And the idea that parents can simply walk away from their jobs and still live in a gigantic house is just plain bizarre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Remake\\"??","review":"The only thing this \\"remake\\" has in common with the original is the title and the number of kids.

In the movie, Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt try to manage their prospering careers as head football coach and author and raise twelve rambunctious children. This film includes many practical jokes played on each other along with comical family situations that everyone could relate. Steve Martin plays his classic father figure role like that of \\"Father of the Bride\\" and \\"Bringing down the House\\".This light hearted comedy is one that that whole family can enjoy. With a rating of PG, this film has no crude or sexual undertones that parents can appreciate. I give \\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\" four stars because of the good wholesome fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family. I would recommend this film to anyone looking to enjoy some clean and practical humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Martin Is Allways Fun To Watch!","review":"I had a lot of fun watching this movie. But then again, I knew I would. Steve Martin is always GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable!","review":"Ok, to start off, THIS IS NOT GONNA BE ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT YOU ARE GONNA BE LIKE \\"Oh that was the greatest!\\" but, it's definately fun and heart-warming. The humor pretty much comes from the chaos the kids cause which isn't really a bad thing. The plot line: a simple big family moves away and life starts to suck and then a happy ending. One thing I really like about the movie is the actors and characters. Each child portrays a different type of person/child, so anyone could probably find a child that they can relate to: the jock, the girl who cares a lot about her looks, the \\"left out\\" child, the tomboy, the chuby of them all, troublemakers, twins and a couple more. Another good thing is that I can totally relate to some kids. They don't like to do chores: what kid does? There are always fights of stupid things. Come on, we all know those moments in our houses with siblings and parents. The bottom line is: its fun. Don't watch it with huge expectations--just chill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Handed, Tired Jokes","review":"Of course, Steve Martin is a joy to watch in almost anything, and I was expecting a reprisal of his role in the wonderful PARENTHOOD. Sadly, this was not. I do not think he makes a believable football coach.But most of all, I was bored to tears and a little disgusted by kids bratty behavior being the centerpiece of the jokes. If you come from a large family, or know someone who does, you know that discipline is the cornerstone of that many people living together. I find it incredibly hard to believe that a parent of so many offspring would calmly accept or condone any of their behavior. I wanted to spank all twelve of them (and the parents for letting them get away with it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"--Bad Script--","review":"The cast led by Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt were terrific in their roles. The children were cute and also did a good job. The problem was poor writing. I expected that the story might be a little funny. It wasn't!

When I heard there was a sneak preview, I had to see it. And ended up going by myself. It was so much fun to see a movie like this on the big screen. It was a genuinely funny film, Steve Martin was great! And the kids were perfect in their roles and added that touch of sweetness. With one kind of unnecessary scene that could have been shortened, but which I found myself chuckling about afterwards. It is a great film which I can't wait to see again and will be buying when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let your kids watch this movie!!!","review":"I'm a Christian homeschooling mom of four. We read the book, Cheaper by the Dozen, that the movie is based on, which we enjoyed (see book reviews) and recommend as a family read aloud. The ONLY thing common between the original book and original movie with this movie starring Steve Martin is the fact that the couple had twelve kids. As stated in some of the other reviews, the kids are bratty and have extremely bad attitudes. Younger children,especially, who may imitate characters shouldn't see this movie. Adults who don't want to waste their time shouldn't see it either.

When offered a job in the big city, Tom can't resist taking it, even if it means moving his brood to the big city. But when Tom's wife also is offered her \`dream job' can Tom cope?This started off as a cute movie. But quickly became stereotypical rubbish. People who live in the city are portrayed as rude obnoxious snobs, and the value of \`small towns' is trumpeted.Also, the children were just rude obnoxious brats. They were far too old to act the way they did. If watching children puke, destroy the house, and play cruel pranks on each other is your cup of tea, you might like Cheaper by the Dozen. For me. I found the movie obnoxious and the message clear: \\"Small towns= Good, Big City=Evil\\" and \\"men are incapable of parenting properly.\\" Sorry, I don't buy either."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it ain't broke...","review":"don't remake it.This is the latest in a long line of really pathetic attempts to modernize some very good film classics.

He was much funnier then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most dissapointing movie of the year.","review":"I saw this film thinking it would be good. It was stupid and offensive not to mention cruel.The story came right out of a crappy sitcom. The parents get a job in the city and have to move away from thier country home. This makes all the kids mad and they all complain that they want to go home. If I wanted to see I could of just stayed home and watched Full House or some other brainless sitcom.Another thing is the kids on this movie. The oldest sister in the family brings her boyfriend to visit the kids. And for no apparent reason they get thier dog to tear off his crotch. Stupid, cruel, pointless.DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! It makes the Dungeons and Dragons movie look like Ben-Hur. Speaking of Ben-Hur, buy it instead of Cheaper By the Dozen. Ben-Hur is exciting, amazing, and morally satisfying. So in conclusion, Cheaper By the Dozen is a piece of trash that no one ever should see."},{"rating":"1","title":"untrue stuff","review":"I live in quite a large family also.

Since when is a dog ferociously attacking a young man's genitals a source of humor. I realize that the Nazis found this funny, but have we sunk so low? Lately it seems one cannot go to the movies without \\"humorous\\" scenes of men kicked, stabbed, shot or bitten in the groin. Since they never show similar sexual injury against women as a source of humor (which I am grateful for), it is hard to not conclude that this is some kind of hybrid of anti-male attitude and sexual sadism.

The problem with this product is that the pellets were either broken or made up of leaf shreds instead of whole leaves and seem to lack the density I'm used to. Part of this may be that the packaging is a thin cardboard box and not a tin. I don't know if this is normal for the brand as it is my first purchase and probably my last. I'll try other new (to me) gunpowder tea marketers or go back to some of my tried and true brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"contains a lot of dirt","review":"The earthy taste of the tea comes from the dozens of rice size clumps of dirt left behind when the leaves are fully open.

This required quite a bit of fitting and alignment. This is not the original intended use for these mounts. I was quite pleased with the results as it gave me a firm and usable scope mount for my KelTec. The base item is a 48302 marked \\"Weaver B2\\". The top bracket is item 48311 marked \\"Weaver S3\\". The combination raises the center of the scope about 3/8\\" above the existing sights which is what I needed. Small washers were used to shim the base to align with the barrel axis and vertical. See pictures I will try to include. I did have to drill 4 holes to get the spacing I wanted. Note: on the KelTec the screws interfered with the barrel and had to be filed down.

So I decided to look here because e-bay's echidna figures cost more than a PSP and a DS, luckly I came across one at a very fair price.

However, I can play DVD and view it in the LCD monitor.If I do not use the attached LCD monitor, but redirect the output to a regular TV, then Casette works with out any problem.When I contacted Audiovox (at probably 13th or 14th month), they told it is not covered under warranty so the flat price is around 100 dollars (did not remember exact amount), plus shipping charges.So, did not opt to repair it and kept quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious quality issue","review":"We bought it for long driving trips but on the first trip out, the unit stopped working after 2-3 hours.

I also purchased the extra screen so each of my children would have their own to view. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this product. Within about 2 months, the second screen quit working. Within approximately 4 months the DVD player stopped altogether. Now we're stuck with only the VHS portion of the player and one screen. It's better than nothing, but for what we spent on both items, it should have held up longer. And we've been very gentle with them too. Our previous vehicle had a dealership-installed system in it and I was hoping to get the same effect with this in our new SUV. Sorry to say, I think we should have opted for the installed system.

There's really nothing spectacular about this book. The process of getting into medical school nowadays for minority applicants really isn't all that different from majority applicants.

They used an inferior type of glue that is brittle and not in adequate quantity to hold the bristles in the handle. The bristles go into the handle about 1/4 inch, and the small black ring in the image is beveled inward, forming a small ring of plastic that is designed to hold the bristles in with the adhesive that they used. The plastic handle is also hollow and the sticker that is on the outside in the image came off as I was using the brush.I highly recommend NOT purchasing this brush due to the lowest quality of manufacture possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was schocked","review":"I bought this shaving brush in DC when I lost mine with my luggage. The first time I used it the base came off, but the hotel had some epoxy to reattach the handle. The third day, bristles started comming out. By the final day of my trip the brush was missing 40% of the bristles. If you think about this brush lasting about a week, then it is very much more expensive than a better quality brush.A couple more dollars to attach the bristles and secure the handle and they could have a great inexpensive product. The quality was so poor that I am actually shocked to see that Amazon os allowing it to be sold on their site.Unless you want a onetime novelity item, avoid this \\"Shaving Brush\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Brush","review":"I will not recommend this brush to any one,the hair keep folin off when soaping the face,atthend of ten shves noting is left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaw Cooking School Guide","review":"Wonderful reference guide to all cooking schools.

Because im aiming for a ~4000 calorie a day diet, I can get the added calories without worrying about taking in too much protein. My only complaint is the creatine. Even though it is a relatively small amount per serving, i dont think there is not enough literature to support the safe use of it. More than anything, the chocolate is not too sweet. It has nearly no taste, which is a good thing. Because I drink it so frequently, if it were too sweet I would surely get tired of it.

These side effects did not make me sick but I just dislike the uncomfortable taste and watery saliva in my mouth, so I stopped taking this product.In conclusion, I did gain 5lbs in a month, but I just can't stand with the side effects.

I sure I'm not the first person scammed out of my hard earned $$$, and won't be the last since peanut's are one of the most common allergies known to man!

However, I thought I was going to lose weight so I ordered another one and the same thing happened today. Just informing you all, real food will help you more in the long run even if it takes longer to make. My kidneys were also weaker.

Thats almost a pound of powder per serving. come on, thats alittle obsessive. Other than that, it tastes alright. Its only gunna last me a week so i probably wont see any results.(im 120lbs - shouldnt be that hard to gain weight) Took 2 weeks to ship it to my house but it was free so i won't complain.

If you are thinking about buying it, here is my two cents:1) Its scoop size is enormous (a giant baker's cup or 8.45 oz/250 ml plus). I've uploaded a picture of it against a generic protein powder scoop (1.8 oz/70 ml). With two recommended giant scoops per serving we are talking about tons of calories here.I only use half a scoop at a time mixed with half of a generic scoop of soy or whey protein to prevent fat gain, but still get a good amount of protein and some needed calories without bloating my stomach. I consume about 6 mixes a day.2) If you are also taking multi/vitamins/minerals/enzymes like Animal Pak while heavily training, be mindful that this weight gainer has some too. Do not overload your liver. What I do is take only one pack a day of Animal Pak against the recommended two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste money","review":"I bought this for my boyfriend as he was trying to gain more mass.

(I hope you have a big shaker)It was hard to dissolve, if not impossible. Chunky!! Very clumpy.Also a side effect is fatigue after 30 minutes or so. I thought it was just because of the high calorie consumption, but no, it's most likely because of the large quantity of maltodextrin (worse than sugar) in it.I would not suggest this product. Rather use an extra serving of something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powder was all over the delivering box","review":"Hi!

You have to use 2 huge scoops to get the max calories. And after addinng 24 oz of milk the shake it so thick that I have to use water to wash it down. I added 48 Ozs of milk to thin it a bit but this filled up the blender and was just way to much to drink. It does mix well in a blender and taste great.

Every time I drank no more than half a serving (one cup) I felt I was going to vomit. I thought it was just me but my friend tried and almost puked in his mouth. Chocolate is slighty better than vanilla but still makes you want to throw up.I can't speak on the nutrition aspect of this product as it was impossible for me and my friends to consume it.Please do yourself a favor and not waist your money on this, there is a lot of tastier product on the market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best - to me","review":"Pro - the shipping was fast.Con - I ordered the vanilla protein and I had squirts both times after I drank the shake.

To me, it is just another concentrated chocolate whey protein with 25g of protein (half serving).A takes less than 60 secs to get it mixed well with water in the blender bottle. However, it is more difficult when I mix it with 2% milk.The scoop is too big (1 cup size) that I can hardly get it out of the 3(lb) container. Yay!!!

For some reason these geniuses included a scooperthat doesn't even fit in the top of the tub. There's no way to get the scoop in or out without turning the entire tubsideways and the powder falls out or going through some other idiotic adjusting. For the love of sanity Optimum Nutrition,include a smaller scoop and increase the amount of scoops on the directions. Use a little common sense because there'sno way this was going to work.

Now I make them everyday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to connect with your kids.","review":"With so much going on these days it is hard to find ways to connect with our kids. I have discovered that finding mutual interests in crafts and activities helps a lot. My 10 year old daughter is interested in string crafts right now which comes in handy because I have always loved string crafts. When I was a kid, we made up our own patterns or got them from friends so having a book to show my daughter rather than trying to teach her from memory makes this so much more fun and less frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got a different item?","review":"Ordered what I thought was the item pictured; however, it was the fancy friendship bracelets version.

We would weave different designs and give them to each other as gifts. It was so much fun.My best friend's daughter is turning 8, and when I saw this book, I knew this would be perfect for her. She is creative and loves jewelry. This book is the perfect starter kit for making friendship bracelets. Along with step by step instructions with illustrations for making simple to complex patterns, this book also provides a handy measuring guide and all the supplies needed to make many plain and beaded friendship bracelets. A variety of colored floss and beads (including blue, red, green, pink, white, and black) means that just about every taste is covered.I highly recommend this product as a gift for any creative or crafty girl (or boy)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this movie.","review":"This is a good movie to watch, I reccommend renting it-or buying it.

A unique investigator who faints at the sight of blood actually sees himself in the shoes of the killer/or accident victim, and so do we, adding to the humorous look at serious human failings. I love the 'excuse' for people trying dumb things, and happen to agree with it. Little 'insults' do take their toll on ordinary people. They saved the best for the end with the two young rock and roll fans involved in a freakish accident. Very different from mainstream comedy and highly entertaining.Chrissy K.

The premise of weeding out the gene pool by finding the people who commit the dumbest \\"suicides\\" (as it were) seemed really fresh and appealing.The execution, though, of this film is repetitive and ultimately monotonous as Fiennes and Ryder simply go from crime scene to crime scene with little interesting connective material.It is an interesting idea for a film, but it simply goes no where and is ultimately dull and lifeless.Not sure that the idea in Finn Taylor's hands was enough to sustain a feature film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a look, pretty funny, great soundtrack.","review":"This was a very underpromoted movie that could have done quite well in the box office, but will likely do well as a cult classic.

Through the whole thing, their trials and tribulations are documented by a masters student recording them for a documentary.Very funny re-enactments, great ones that they chose, and a load of cameos by Metallica, The Myth Busters, amongst others, Definately worth renting, or buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine until Wynona shows up","review":"This film was somewhat amusing and then Wynona Ryder appeared. Her amazingly weak acting skills and sheer lack of charisma made me wince to the point of turning the film off ten minutes after she arrived, which is pretty rare. Normally I'll try to tough it out in hopes of a turnaround, but the pain was too severe.Given the subject matter, this could have been a lot funnier even before La Ryder showed up. Maybe a documentary on the Darwin winners would do the job.

Delaware during the war of 1812. His Captain Peabody is a serious, driven man who is loyal to his country, his mission and his crew. The conflict that occurs when he meet and falls in love with a young lady he meets during a voyage adds to the suspense of the conflict between Peabody and his British counterpart.

Forester work available that I had not read repeatedly when I purchased this book. After forcing myself to slog through this book, I question 1. Why did I subject myself to one of the more poorly written books I have experienced in a long, long time and 2. Did C.S. Forester really, truly write this pitiful piece?This book reminds me of those contests of writing really bad Hemingway imitations, but in this case it is writing really, really bad Forester imitations. I have been a huge fan of the Hornblower series since I was old enough to read and that has been a very long time. Rereading one of the Hornblower books is like visiting a very treasured friend again. This book is such a disappointment and waste of my time and money. Mr. Forester should hang his head in shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's interpretations are very poor.","review":"The author's interpretations of the quatrains are very poor.Some of his interpretations have absolutely nothing to do with the translations.I realize that the interpretations are open to much discussion but he is way off the mark on most of them.This is a very poor book on Nostradamus."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exquisive work of visionary truth and literary triumph","review":"Despite the passage of time, Nostradamus continuesto capture and enslave our yearnings for spiritual knowledge with his insightful writings.His perceptive visions, as they lay before us in this guidebook for the past and future, range from commonly worded, simple to understand verse to hidden parable like quantrains for the more philosophically inclined individual. It is evident that much time and effort went into every aspect of this books infrastructure and with great relish its readers will readily absorb its truths in an identical manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"I only managed to struggle through about half of this. Nostradamus' predictions, all in the form of quatrains are mostly so vague that they could apply to just about anything. When one or two lines of a quatrain vaguely match something in later history (make enough predictions about conflict in Europe and a few of them are bound to match up with the next few hundred years of history) the other two or three lines and any contradictory details are ignored and it is hailed as a \\"fulfilled prophecy.\\" The \\"interpretations\\" given along with the quatrains are so arbitrary that the same verse is said to predict the death of a 17th century noble and of Bruce Lee's son in one instance or the \\"fifth column\\" in Spain and the Rodney King beating in LA in another. With some I can't even figure out what mental leap is necessary to make the connection between the prophecy and the interpretation.

I suppose I was expecting something else from it (having never heard their music before, I guess that was a poor assumption). I thought it'd be more electronic, not industrial per se, but darkwave or something akin to Switchblade Symphony or The Razor Skyline.

Michael's clear, easy to understand instructions take you step by step through the process of creating a beautiful landscape for your home.

They're selected from a complete collection. What's special about this book is that none of the poems are edited, as is done in many other collections of her works - and excellent choices are made for which poems to include. Emily often used simple dashes at the ends of her lines, and this selection is true to her originals - and she never put titles on her poems, or indented lines - as many other collections of her poems have the audacity to do - as if the editors of those works knew better than this greatest poet the English language has ever known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's supposed to","review":"I put this on my CAI and even installed a splash shield over my air filter.

Whether you are looking for a private school,a religious school or a public school, for that matter, this clearly written guide is full of information and easy to use charts that help parents focus on what is really important to them in selecting a school. The book guides parents through easy to follow steps that help them to find the correct \\"fit\\" between child and school as well as between parent and school. The book is laid out in a manner that allows the reader to pick and choose what matters most to them in the school selection process.

Sometimes I would have to click more than once (up to four times) for a click to be recognized. It was VERY annoying. Apple has a number of known issues with mouse clicks; many of these cases involve Logitech products. Apple's suggestions did not help. Upgrading the OS from Lion to Mountain Lion did not help either. I replaced the LX5 with an Apple Magic Mouse (Bluetooth) and the problem disappeared.I have a MacBook that uses a very old M-RM67A Logitech wireless mouse with no problems. There may be Logitech wireless products that work well with OS X, but in my experience the LX5 is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOGITECH LX5","review":"Nowhere in the description of this mouse does it show or describe a clumsy added attachment that plugs into the USB port and requires more counterspace and worse yet, in my experience has to be situated in very close proximity to the mouse. Oh well, you get what you pay for I guess. It was a good deal.. I knew it was too good to be true. Most optical mice have a USB attachment about as long as ones index finger. This has an 18 inch cord (just a guess-timate) with an added attachment thats just as big as the actual mouse... too clumsy! The mouse works ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, returning mine","review":"I own (and love) my Logitech Cordless Optical Mouse for Notebooks, so when it came time to replace my desktop mouse I thought I'd try Logitech again. Not a good choice.Install was painless, although it does take an awful long time. Howver, my problem is that the mouse is \\"skittish\\" (all over the desktop, hard to control) and the buttons are unresponsive (somtimes they work, sometimes they don't). Tried moving the receiver closer to where I use the mouse, didn't help. Maybe you'll have better luck, who knows. But mine's going back to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite mouse","review":"I have two of these, so I can have one at home and work. I'm now buying a third one to go on my Mac. What I love about this mouse is the shape. It fits my hand perfectly. Some may find it a little too wide, but the width is what I like. Many mice are too narrow and I can't hold them or point with them comfortably. The only downside the this mouse is that it has a fairly short range of about two feet. I have the receiver mounted under my desktop at home and right next to the monitor at work, to ensure it is always in range to function. Not a big deal as long as you have a convenient place for it.Both of mine get daily usage and I find I replace the batteries about every 4 to 6 months. I can still get a week of use after the low battery warning comes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech LX5 Cordless Optical Mouse","review":"It picks up on multiple surfaces well, and has quick reaction time. The lack of 5 stars is due to limited range. I got the mouse so I could sit on the sofa and watch movies using my TV as a second computer screen using a long HDMI cable. I found I had to be within 10 feet from the receiver for the mouse to work, and thus my plan didn't work.If you only want to use this at your desk then this is a 5 star mouse all the way. I wanted more distance from and thus gave it 4 stars. I have more recently found out the cordless mice that can be used at more than 10-15 feet are much more expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy, Disappointing Mouse...........!","review":"This mouse is very heavy(after putting batteries) for delicate hands of all ladies......I would not recommend this to anyone, as there are many better, lightweight, good quality mouse are available in the same price from the same brand, Logitech.Also this mouse contains device with unecessarily long cable which you have to put in USB/PS2 port....It works properly but it's heavy to handle, so better to go for another good, lightweight Mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective mouse","review":"I was very disappointed by this mouse. First of all, the receiver looks really ugly, which is itself as big as a wired mouse, with a long cord. Then, the mouse does not work at all. When I put in the batteries (yes, it uses TWO AA batteries), only the green on/off light lighted up. You would expect red light showing from the bottom of an optical mouse, but it doesn't for the one I received, which shows the mouse is defective. Of course, it does not work.

This mouse is actually part of a keyboard/mouse combo that together costs about $50. I was able to get a great sale on it, but that is the normal selling price. Simply put, the mouse alone presented here is more than half the price of the FULL COMBO. In other words, this mouse is NOT worth the price it is being sold for.As far as comfort goes, it is a little lacking. The way that it is designed, it is tricky to hold for a long period of time. It is not awful, but it is annoying. The buttons for the mouse are very long, which means that there may be some problems with holding it for a long period of time.It is a decent mouse, but not fabulous enough to pay the high price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freezes Often, Requiring Reboot","review":"I have had a lot of problems with this mouse. It will work for a few days, and then will suddenly stop working. Hitting the \\"connect\\" and \\"reset\\" buttons on the mouse won't fix the problem - all you can do is reboot.

Let's leave those minor things like create a good story to those stupid gringos, we are beyond that.Unfortunately, this movie follows all those guidelines.Which is a pity, because the acting is, in general, acceptable (except for Adriana Aizemberg, who manages to bring the movie to a stop by overacting in her only 30-second speech).But in all justice, no character is engaging, and there is only so much the actors can do.I enjoyed the voice-over by the protagonist (performed by Daniel Hendler), with his cultivated, yet young and typically River Plate accent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glow sticks review","review":"The glowsticks did what they were supposed to!

If the book only included numerous details on archaeological ship sites with photos and diagrams of the sites and finds (and it does) that would be enough. But the author also includes concise and useful overviews on the sailing, building, design, fitting, rigging, navigating and whatnot of period ships. All in all a quite valuable reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"More class grooves...","review":"Like their Austrian peers, Kruder & Dorfmeister, Thievery Corporation know how to mix and, like K&D, their \\"DJ Kicks\\" album is a class act in both its production and its selection of tracks. More down-tempo than K&D's offering but equally interesting in its sequencing, it scans a broader palette of styles from bossa-nova, through Indian sitars to deep Jamaican dub. Sounds like a disaster waiting to happen?... well, not here, because in these guys' hands each track is integrated seamlessly into an hour long musical journey that's held together by lock-tight beats and overlays. Genuinely interesting and perfectly crafted it's another example of just how good \\"laid-back\\" club music can be in the hands of people who know what's out there and how it should be delivered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucid Groove","review":"This compilation proves that Thievery Corporation are not only great DJ's but also one of the best groove \\"Grippers\\" around. Thiers is a background groove that has its way of pleasantly getting under your psyche. This CD contains eclectic mixes that are wide in diversity,... engaging in East Indian, peace inducing Trace rhythms down to Funky spy themes. Interspersing them with Brazilian Bossonova tracks and choicy reggae loops.The 7th track, Up, bustle and out from Emerald Alley is just out of the world,... so is the 13th track, Pronoia from Janine.This CD is a 'must buy' if you prefer the sub genre that fits snugly between the Lounge, Acid Jazz and Trip Hop genres."},{"rating":"2","title":"ExtraSpectaculary","review":"Thievery Corp. does it again.

After listening to and loving a lot of lounge music, this album does not stand out; and that is saying it gently. From an empty CD you get the same sound sensation, or better. You will forget this while you listen to it. Only bearable as a background noise, do not try to really listen to this. Does anybody want to buy my copy? Sorry too late, already in the bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, as usual.","review":"Here's a general rule of thumb:Everything the Thievery Corporation touches turns to gold. These guys are incredible. The CD starts out slow, but really gets going as things progress. One of the other reviewers was definately correct in saying that the last few tracks (from 12 on) are worth the price of the CD. If you're into downtempo house/bossanova music with indian influences, or just need some killer music to chill to after puffing the boom, check out this CD, or any of their other stuff (esp. Mirror Conspiracy).You won't be disappointed.**NOTE** Sounds from the Verve Hi-Fi is another compilation they put together, but it sounds nothing like their other offerings. It's incredible too, but very different. You've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a crime that this is so unnoticed!!","review":"Geez - not ALL the SST catalog was hippie drivel! This album is easily as good as his others, and 2 cuts on here went on to appear in the reunited version of Mission Of Burma (although I prefer this version of \\"The Set Up\\"). The lyrics are clever, guitar playing is superb and original, his vocals are better than ever (his voice takes a little getting used to), and some songs like \\"No Warning\\" are deeply evocative and hypnotic, probably more so than any material that's come before. I love everything this guy does, and this is probably his most straight-ahead rocker short of his Mission Of Burma output. After this, he delved into experimentalism that still borders on complete genius. If you like the modern Mission Of Burma album, you owe it to yourself to give this a chance. The rhythm section isn't as punchy, but the songs are solid classics across the board. A bit more poppy, but oddly picturesque and heady."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: This is not the same No Man where Steven Wilson appears","review":"Amazon pages have confused two No Man -bands together.

I decided to test this one at a low cost before investing in something better, and I'm glad I did. There's no denying that this does the job. It holds up to high heat, and food just won't stick! Cookies slide right off, and anything that gets stuck will wash right off with ease.That said, it's flimsy. In an annoying way. It doesn't roll very well, and no one wants a creased liner. Basically what we have here is reusable parchment paper. Of course, given that a roll of parchment paper will cost about what this liner costs, it's a good buy to start with. But me? I'm looking to upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff!","review":"I was looking for something to replace parchment paper and this was the cheaper alternative compared to the other brands. I decided hey for the cost of about 2 boxes of parchment paper, I'll give it a try. I've recently made a few batches of pigs in the blanket with sharp cheddar cheese and when I used aluminum foil in my previous times of making this, my blankets all ripped and the cheese stuck to the foil but when I used the reusable sheet liner, it came off with no effort what-so-ever. Best thing ever! It felt like I greased it sooo much but I didn't do a thing.The funny part is on the product's packaging, it indicates that you should not crease the liner but it comes folded in the packaging. Other than that, everything worked as advertised and I didn't get any weird after taste or anything. The color of the liner is brown so after cooking on it, it doesn't stain much. Cleaning was just a matter of sponging some soap over and rinsing and drying for the next use. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookie Sheet","review":"I enjoy developing cookie recipes.

If you are an occasional baker/sugar artist and don't really require the thickness of the overpriced alternative, you will be very happy with this product. Poured sugar works fine on these but if you need to spread, they are thin and tend to move about a bit on the sheet. If you put a little water on the baking sheet below the liner, you can manipulate your poured sugar some. Excellent product for the money; I would recommend these without hesitation. I have been using these for years, they hold up well so I just bought 3 more."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe the product has changed","review":"I see many rave reviews, but my experience doesn't match! I baked oatmeal cookies which have lots of butter and sugar, and while the cookies didn't stick to this sheet as badly as they do to my steel tray, they had to be cooled slightly to avoid tearing them apart when sliding off the sheet. My main concern, however, is that the butter soaked through and permanently stained the sheet. Can't wash it out, so I wonder how sanitary this will be in the long term. I also bought theFox Run Silicone Baking Mat, 11-3/4 by 16-Inch, and it is impervious to oil, more non-stick, and stays in place on the baking tray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This is the most disappointing item I have ever purchsed from Amazon.

In their brochure for this product they describe green tea as a tea that can \\"circulate freely within the teapot\\" without a specified infusing time. This simply is not true.

Finally, I found the way the distances were indicated extremely irritating, e.g., the 6th army only advanced 274m (300 yards)???? Where did all these signifcant digits come from?

While im sure the many many expansions might add more to options, i didnt go that far with it.While im not afraid of randomness, i found that how the game splits the board into 3 sectors and you had to play cards to move in each sector just meant that this mechanic just limited more of your options.

The next step will be to get my wife involved.You will find these rules easy to understand but still offering a challenge to mster as numerous options are given to you based on your card draws. The different battles offered give you a nice array of possible battles. Also, it seams through some early attempts that creating your own battles is quite easy.I recommend Memoir 44 for all who enjoy a light wargame that provides a nice evening of family entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"KIller Cult Classic (1959) DVD","review":"Warning!

This is by far the slowest. Expect to wait 10 seconds between shots, 17 if you used the flash. 10 seconds between paging through the pictures you took. The movie mode has no sound by the way. I purchased it for $40 and it is not worth that. Steer clear of this one if you want to keep your sanity. The only good thing that I can think of is that it is small. My main camera is a 6X optical zoom, so it is larger. I purchased this one so I could throw it in my pocket on vacations. After how much I like it, wouldn't kill me if I jumped in the water with it.

This one was good, but didn't have as many concrete problems as the civ pro book did. Because I needed help drawing out doctrine (my course was policy-heavy), I would have liked more of that. However, the summaries of various issues in Con Law were clear and concise, and it did a nice job of placing various cases within the different strands of the law and explaining what they had accomplished.Also, the book is organized very differently from how my professor taught it - if you're covering separation of powers as its own unit later in the course, you might have the same problem, because the authors put some separation of powers stuff (but not all) in the section on Justiciability. You just have to kind of skip around it, but the section headings are clear, so it should be easy to recognize when you've fallen into uncovered material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply, cheap and awesome!","review":"I'm a simple gal, and only needed something to play music.

The tips are simple and consist of things men normally take for granted.

It is an easy to read book, consisting about 200 pages with large type face. It however requires a lot of imagination for readers outside America, as the author seems to address situations only in America. In my view, this is not a book for a general reader, as the examples given are rather boring and may not apply in other parts of the world.

After one month of emails and phone conversations, I was able to determine the source of two separate problems. The first was related to a known driver problem on their end. The second, was due to a mechanical high pitched sound that developed with Showbiz DVD recording. Finally, someone directed me to the audio sampling settings. It seems so obvious now.

If anyone knows of a concert/symphonic band or wind recording of it, let me know!Having said that, I thought Tomita's interpretation was a travesty.I felt that \\"Mars\\" was very emotionless and antiseptic. It did not come close to capturing any of the tension or emotion that Holst was trying to convey. Also, I felt Mr. Tomita destroyed Holst's intention of conveying each planets' astrological definitions by combining (previously separate) movements into single movements.I am always looking for different interpretations of \\"The Planets,\\" but I was so disappointed in this album that I returned it to the store and demanded a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I installed the replacement and After 6 months the lamp Went out again..

Also, you can't play via the Net, unlike the PC version."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is terrible","review":"If you're thinking of getting this game, DON'T! For one thing, it's impossible. I was playing Skrimish mode (where you build up your forces and the last man standing wins) and I got overrrun by large enemy forces before I even had time to build a War Factory. I coulnd't possibly have built as much stuff as they did in that short an amount of time.

The controls are different and the graphics aren't the best, but you get used to them. It's just as fun as the PC version, with the tesla-coils frying people and soldiers screaming when they die.

If anyone is interested in learning more about Church history but has very little knowledge of it already, this book is an excellent place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, readable overview.","review":"In very few pages, the author manages to give an excellent recap of the key events and forces which shaped church history in the first 6 centuries. He goes into enough detail, howwever, that I'll bet even avid readers of church history will still find here material previously unknown to them. His organizing the material according to topics rather than by a strict chronological order makes it particularily easy to understand how the church grappled with its' earliest issues and crises. He does not seem to hold any partisan view: he even seems to regret that Arianism did not take hold in the mainstream church!This book can be recommended for readers at any level who wish to learn about church history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amplifier is defective.","review":"I have had this amplifier less than six months and the right rear channel is not working at all.

Find a book by someone who actually respects women, who has been single for any appreciable amount of time, and who can grok that this isn't 1950 anymore.

On the face of it, it makes perfect sense. Nelles also makes some good suggestions to help candidates resurrect various \\"proofs of performance\\" from previous jobs or at least brainstorm various possibilities for visually displaying performance.

The nuke truck can be easily blown up killing only infantry and power plants, the mad tank takes too long to fire its shockwave and is lightly armored so it is also easy to blow up, and tesla tank is only good against infantry leaving it vunerable to tanks. For those of you who haven't played C&C Red Alert on computer. This game is by far lame. You are not allowed to save in the middle of a mission, the mission starts over when you load it.

As the last books in this series are not yet out, I am not giving this book a one star just in case in some way this book serves some function in advancing the thirteen novel series. At first read, this novel is only loosely connected with the other novels.As a stand alone novel, this novel is a complete jumble. While I guess it is supposed to reflect the madness of the Malkavian mind, this does not make for an enjoyable read. Nothing in this book makes sense separate from a vague connection with the previous novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clan Novel : Malkavian","review":"I am an avid reader of all things Vampire, I have read all the Clan novels as they are released. This latest entry into the series is the first one I felt was just not very good. I understand that Malkavians are all mad but this book is enough to drive you over the edge. The story line was not advanced in this piece except to kill off a few more characters. Perhaps I'm missing something but you could of told this story in two pages, the rest of the book was just a wordy jumble of confused prose written in the first person then switching over to dialog between an ego and his ulterego. I know this is fantasy but give me a break, this series has been so good what has happened? I hope the last four novels in the series are as good as the previous eight, I guess thirteen great novels was just too much to ask."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clan Novel: Malkavian","review":"This book was the worst of the series. It is an extreme task to write a series of 13 novels. As a writer, I know this to be true. The writers must continue to hold the interest of the readers and they had done a great job up until this novel. Each novel took the reader deeper into the World of Darkness and made us interested in that world. The novels were easy to read and easy to follow. This one sets us back. I undersatnd that the writer tried to show us the \\"madness\\" of the protagonist but he forgot that this is a series and not a stand alone novel. It can easliy be skipped.

While true the Malkavian are hard to figure out and understand, did the book have to be page after page of gibberish? You have to fight to even care what is in this book in the hopes that it makes sence later. It doesnt... Other than a few, VERY few parts that are even understandable it was not worth the paper it was printed on. Oh yea, and those few parts... they dealt with non-Malkavian topics.I read this book hoping to get someting for the series out of it, but if you skipped it, you would not miss anything. I think that the idea that to be Malkavian, you had to write pages that could not be understood was a terrible idea.This is tragic considering how much I LOVED every other book in the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadness... not Madness","review":"As I feared after finishing the Horribly written First Novel in this lamentable series, Clan Novel Malkavian is even WORSE than Wieck's first foray (Clan Novel Toreador). This book is completely incomprehendable. The style is neither clever, nor insightful... it's just BAD. This may very well be the single worst book I have ever had the displeasure to read.The saddest part of this is that, in general, I had begun to enjoy this series. Parts 4 and 8 by Kathleen Ryan rose to such heights of excellence that I had hoped (vainly) that there was finally some plot to this plodding embarrassment of a series... Alas... it seems I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was sadly dissappointed","review":"Unfortunately I thought the product was overpriced for the quality received.

Alabina is a complete band, with HOT Latin Gypsy guitarists and passion. There's passion in this CD alright, but it's strictly Ishtar's...reserved FOR Ishtar! A self-indulgence that is largely devoid of the energy and FUN which made Alabina such an addictive, happy sound. \\"The voice of Alabina\\" says it all...she definitely has a fantastic voice, but this music is dull, dull, dull. If you want a Mariah Carey or Cristina Aguillera re-hash, done up in \\"exotic\\" French, Arabic, etc...fine. But just be forewarned, that is what you're getting with this CD.

Not only is she beautiful, she is also talented. She is not like the pop singers out there. Her music clearly stands out and I will never get sick of listening to her. Most of her songs have a great beat to it (for to dance/exercise to) and the slow ballads are very sensual. Doesn't matter what language you speak, she sings in Spanish, French, English and also Arabic. She is like Shakira but ONLY BETTTER. PLEASE give this CD a try YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.

The majority of the songs, I believe are in French. Ishtar has a beautiful voice (a musical instrument in itself) I feel better than Celine Dion's. I heard her on a PBS radio station and found her album only available here. I feel it is money well spent and enjoy listening everyday. It just doesn't seem to ever loose its appeal. My only criticism of this product is when writing the words to the songs on the enclosed brochure that some of the pages and lettering doesn't have enought color contrast to make is easy to read (only on two songs).

Without the sound of Alabina to cover up Ishtar's rough edges, what you're left with is a very uneven collection of songs which are themselves very unevenly recorded.

Musicals are for people that can sing, not whine and slide their way up to the preferred pitch. I'm a native of Arkansas, by the way, and it hurts my ears to listen to Reba's voice.

I liked Mitzi Gaynor and Glenn Close in prior roles playing Nellie Forbush but Reba Mcintire was simply phenominal. Her country twang better placed her character as a hick from Little Rock and her voice was simply incredible.I am a product from the sixties and the song \\"You've Got To Be Carefully Taught\\" was created 15 years before the civil rights movement began. This fact merely confirms the brilliance and mastery of Rogers & Hammerstein.I wish there were more performances of musicals in this format.

I like some other reviwers here tuned in expecting to tune out in short order.No way, it really was an Enchanting Evening from start to finish. The music was revitalized in this concert performance and each of the performers were oustanding.The ridiculous comments regarding Reba McEntire's performance by the previous reviewer makes me wonder whether he even saw or heard the performance. I was dubious of the casting as well but the woman was absolutly enchanting as Nellie. And she didn't fake one line. My major love is opera and she SANG the role.

Chorus members use the stage to bring the large production numbers alive with action so the overall becomes a hybrid between a pure concert and the full show. Kudos to PBS for making this unique concert performance available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautful and Exhilarating","review":"Like so many people who treasure memories of South Pacific I played the DVD looking for faults and reasons to hate it. But from the moment the orchestra played those famous first notes of the overture I was transfixed. The sumptuous sounds from the orchestra were just the begining as we were taken on a musical journey with one of the greatest Broadway musicals. Having played Jerome and Emille (there were a few years in between) I treasure my memories and althogh I missed the full production, when I closed my eyes I was taken right back to my earlier years. This is DVD is one all lovers of R&H should have. I loved Reba McEntire's quirky performance and Brian Stokes Mitchell was glorious as Emille. Alec Baldwin was a little out of his depth but gave a bravura performance if even if lost his place in the hand held script! The performance was beautfully filmed and the sound track fabulous. I just wish I had been there."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an enchanted evening","review":"As others have mentioned the actors are holding scripts throughout the production, but it is amazing how connected they were to the emotions of the characters. Brian Stokes Mitchell was wonderful and Reba is superb in this role. Even when she is just watching and listening to Brian Stokes Mitchell sing you feel that she is totally in love and in awe of him. Their chemistry was amazing. I was fortunate enough to have seen Reba on Broadway in Annie Get Your Gun . She was magnificent. I was always saddened that the production was never recorded. Well at least now I have seen another brilliant performance of hers and this time it is on DVD. If you love South Pacific you will love this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"South Pacific in Concert from Carnegie Hall","review":"This is a fantastic DVD - a powerful performance by all performers. Brian Stokes Mitchell has an incredible voice and is a great actor. His \\"This Nearly Was Mine\\" was awesome! Reba McEntire was fabulous. She made Nellie Forbush very believable. Her \\"Honey Bun\\" was especially great. Lillias White was all you could ask for as Bloody Mary. She has a powerful voice. I have singled out three of the preformers, but all the rest were just as impressive. The best way to appreciate this performance is to watch it many times...as I have done!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reba McEntire South Pacific","review":"This Carnegie Hall production of \\"South Pacific\\" was wonderful.

She murders Nellie Forbush!","review":"Sorry, Reba, but Nellie Forbush is a young, educated nurse from Little Rock, Arkansas, with a pleasant, southern accent...and far from the backwoods hick with a hillbilly accent that you portray in this production! Reba KILLS this entire concert, and, besides the outlandish, out-of-character and out-of-place accent...just doesn't have the singing and acting capabilities to do justice to this role! Both MacEntire and the director of this concert need to be arrested for the murder of Nellie Forbush, American Nurse!

The overture alone was so stirring I nearly cried. When Brian Stokes Mitchell sang \\"This Nearly Was Mine\\", I did. And do so every time I watch it again. Yes, there are parts that are dated and treacly, but the songs are delightful, and the cast is charming.

If you enjoy listening to Reba then you will love to watch South Pacific. The songs were phenomenally performed, and the acting was wonderful. The main piece of information one should know before purchasing this DVD is that it is a live concert performance. The actors had their scripts in front of them the entire time; however, they all seemed to know their parts at a comfortable degree. Alec Baldwin's character was extremely funny and Alec's slight mess up only added to the magic of the concert.

Not that every book needs to have a happy ending, but to create likeable, hopeful characters, only to trash them at the end, seems perverse. There is no resolution to any of the characters' problems. Also, the character of Louise did not come together for me; she does not seem like a real person. I was heartbroken about the dog at the end, and for what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and pointless","review":"Usually, a story has a beginning, a middle and an end. This book has no end. Nothing gets resolved, none of the characters change or grow. Everyone in the book is so depressing and so jaded that it seems none of them can find a single good thing in life, no matter where they look. And what was the point of the dog? Did he represent something? Was it necessary to have him lost at the end, never to be found? Was it necessary to even have the dog at all? Boring book. Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful rehash of same stock characters","review":"Do not read this book first, as the earlier works are fresher, wittier.

I liked how you can hook the camera right up to your crib for a great view of your baby. BUT there was way too much interference, to see the \\"great\\" picture for more than 2 seconds at a time. There was so much static. I tried all the channels and they were all equally as bad. We live in a townhome community, so even though our phones are 5.8 GhZ, and we do not have wireless internet, it's possible our very close neighbors may have 2.4 Ghz phones, (the same frequencey as the monitor), or maybe wireless internet.

I completely agree with the other comments that this is a horrible monitor. It's very noisey due to all the static it produces. Definitely not something you could use at night while sleeping and forget about using any other electronics while it's on, especially the cordless phone.We were able to exchange this monitor for the Summers Infant video monitor. This one is much better and about $30 cheaper.

I was excited about getting what I thought was a better monitor for my son. It turns out that the thing gave me static the whole time it was on.

However the reason I know this is because I had to return the color view video monitor twice. The interference was terrible because we have several other 2.4 GH electronics. The sound had to be turned down because it continually made snapping and popping sounds. The video itself was not great, but you could see. I also have the safety 1st audio monitor that works well, but the frequency is different. After trying the video monitor twice I called safety 1st again and they refunded the entire purchase price.

With my first child I bought the Sight and Sound Assurance Video Monitor. We love it. It gets awesome reception and I like the additional cordless sound monitor. Our only complaint was that the video monitor is a bit bulky. When we were expecting our second child we decided to buy this color view monitor. We liked the fact that the video monitor was compact. We tried it out and the reception is fine as long as we are no more than 10 ft away. The sound is horrible as well. It's very \\"crackly\\". I called the company and they stated there was nothing they could do. We unplugged our cordless phones to see what the difference would be...there wan't any difference. Not a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Monitor, Not Great","review":"We purchased the most expensive video monitor thinking that we would \\"get what we paid for.\\" I certainly hope there are better ones on the market. The sound on this monitor is not clear, there is a constant electronic-type hum. Pretty annoying when you're trying to catch some much-needed sleep! Also, while advertised as a color monitor, beware that the color is very \\"washed out\\" (reds look pale pink)and not significantly different from a black & white video monitor, even after adjusting the brightness. Additionally, the rechargeable batteries run down rather quickly (3-3.5 hours).Having said that, it IS wonderful to be able to \\"peek\\" at the baby without waking him/her. A video monitor is the way to go, but perhaps there is a better one out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I returned this monitor after testing it for a few days... and the only reason I had it THAT long was because I was testing it in every room of the house and at different times of day. The picture was terrible, and with all of the static, the audio part was worthless. It didn't matter what room it was in, the range level, time of day, whether the other household electronics were on or off (although I must say any monitor that requires you to unplug your telephone is worthless).

My monitor also will not run with my wireless devices in the home, yet unlike all other unhappy customers before me, BABYAGE REFUSES to take it back, won't even give me a refund, all with much attitude on the phone!

The static and interference with this product was not acceptable. I called the number listed to \\"trouble shoot\\" and they wanted me to turn off everything wireless to try to solve the problem.

I have now purchased the Summers video monitor and it works great. Its cheaper and so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intro to linguistics","review":"This is a very clear introduction to the various fields of linguistics (The chapters are: Pragmatics, Semantics, Syntax, Morphology, Phonology, Language Variation, First Language Acquisition, Second Language Acquisition, Written Language, Language Processing, The Neurology of Language). The book explains the basic concepts and gives some examples. There is a \\"Supplementary Readings\\" section at the end of each chapter with recommendations for specialized books on these topics. The exercises the first reviewer is complaining about are mostly very basic and it seems to me that they are designed to give additional examples rather than to challenge the reader. The text focuses on English, which is OK for an introductory book. One thing that may make you think twice before buying this book is its price, which naturally reflects the ideology of the textbook publishing companies - \\"Students are _required_ to buy textbooks, so we might as well charge them a fortune.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect condition/like new!","review":"This book was $193.00 everywhere and to get it brand new for over half off the asking price does my wallet good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Starting Point","review":"I like this book because it focused on Proverbs. If I and my children could memorize the whole of Proverbs, I think we'd be better for it. Its a good simple book. I appreciated the sequence of topics. I liked the pictures at the beginning of each chapter. I actually made copies for the kids (8,6 and 4) to color while I read them the story. Every morning was a short reading (which is good for small children's attention span) with questions. Sometimes I asked the questions verbatim, sometimes we discussed other questions we thought of. I liked the activities in the back that related to the lesson. Every Friday, if the children had the memory verse memorized, they got a treat. So, I think this book is what you make of it. You can make it into a good bible study or perhaps just a reference book. Either way, its a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little tool ever!!","review":"I purchased this product a couple of months ago and it works beautifully around beds as well as along sidewalk and driveway. It cuts through \\"crab\\" grass which grows over every barrier that exists. I love it - it is quiet and no exhaust smells. I can edge almost as fast as my husband with his noisy, smelly high-tech edger - even he was impressed. If it ever breaks or bends I will purchase another one - it has earned its place in my tool collection already and FYI - no one paid me or requested this review and I don't usually write reviews, but this has worked so great that I was inspired to take the time to review the Hound Dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does less than half the work","review":"It seems to cut. I developed \\"good style\\" with it. But when I went to remove the grass I edged, it appears that the blade only pushed down the tougher \\"runners\\". Yes, I removed the blade guard! Yes, I edged 3 times, trying to get as close to the concrete as possible.Still, I had to use a short-handled shovel to scoop it, and it would lay over itself. That is when I saw it wasn't really cutting it all. Maybe the blade needs to be deeper. So, I had to really hit it with the shovel to cut it.I could've saved my money and used the shovel itself. Funny, the shovel is made by the same company!"},{"rating":"1","title":"be cautious","review":"I sort of like this product but don't love it. It does as promised to a point -- you step on it and it edges -- but i had to go back over my grass with a power edger to clean up what i missed with the steppin edger.The nice thing is it requires no gas, makes no noise and emits no smoke.

Totally useless on a regular lawn, maybe if you have a golf green lawn with a sand foundation it would work great. If you have normal 2-3\\" lawn grass it doesnt work worth a damn, you practically have to jump on the thing to get it through the grass.

However, this tape is completely mislabeled; it's not stand-up at all.

It starts out sort of easy but it get's way harder the further you go the storyline is good. This would also be one of the hardest games I've ever played. I would really recommend this game to anyone that is at least eight and older. Unless you're are a hardcore gamer I would recommend this to anyone. I really like this game I'm sure you'll like it too that is why I gave this game five stars. Also the graphics are really good a the powers you get are cool. It is sort of flawed at the end but it's still the bomb, that is my opinion on this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave New Hero Musashi","review":"Musashi is a long game in which you don't get bored, why?, the reason is that Musashi gets new habilities during the whole game, he also can absorb his enemy's power with a powerful sword called lumina, the other sword can absorb the elements scrolls like water, fire, earth, wind and sky.I recomend this game because you will get a lot of fun and never get bored with it.Buy it this is one way to spend your money rightly"},{"rating":"2","title":"A ver y good game","review":"Alright it looks like a Zelda clone on the surface but it has litttle in common. and another thing, it may look like a easy game but its anything BUT!!!!!!!! this game would have been perfect if it wern't for a couple of problems: the game is not long enough, fixed camera angles. aside from that its perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best playstation game ever","review":"I love this game.It is very realist.It,s fun too.The only thing I don,t like are the bosses.But otherwise you should buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't compare to Zelda!","review":"I bought this game because Square is my favorite developer of video games. Too say the least I was very disapointed. A very short game, took me less than 12 hours to beat it. Mediocre story line at best. Voice acting decent but not inspiring in the least. In my opinion there is little to no replay value. Where are the days of Secret Of Mana? I asked myself many times when playing this so so game."},{"rating":"1","title":"otaku","review":"Brave Fencer Musashi is one of the most horrid things ever to come out of Square.

I cringed the first time I heard Musashi's HORRID voice, and every other time I heard it. Big disappointment. The game was promoted as an RPG, but it doesn't remind me of an RPG. It's an annoying adventure game with annoying voice acting. The \\"hero\\" looks and sounds like a bratty ten year old. Definitely not for everyone, especially someone expecting a typical RPG.

I hadn't played it in years. I ha a copy when I was a kid and lost it. Fortunately for me, Amazon exists. I got to relive childhood memories and had a blast. One of the great PSX games that got overlooked in favor of Final Fantasy VIII. Musashi is an action RPG were you take control of a young boy brought to a kingdom to be its savior. It's loosely based on the old story of the real swordsman Musashi. If you're a fan of action RPG's I highly recommend you pick it up. Well worth the price.

Any person opening the book will immediately know that Kammeraad is not only a poet/author/artist, but more importantly a teacher! The Tomato Collection is a brilliantly illustrated collection of poems. Kammeraad successfully manages to use both whit and humor to bring across the author's vision of the sometimes \\"not-so-pleasant\\" world around us. I hate to steal a phrase, but this is a book for kids of all ages. The collection of peoms are visually stimulating that help to maintain the short attention span of younger readers (my two year old son).

The stories are more interesting than before and will get people hooked.

It is my new favorite card game. It requires quite a bit of strategy in which order you lay your cards out. Fun elements I like is the winner gets to slough a card he/she does not like but the loser of each round has to give the winner their highest card. Play reverses order each round. You must play the same number of cards of what the 1st person to lay down plays ie pair, full house, 3 of a kind, unless you have a gang of four or four of the same number which trumps everything.

I owned another Tatung television and tried to have it repaired under warranty. The TV, however, must be shipped to the company for repair - at the customer's expense. So their warranty requires $200+ right off the bat. So after my first disappointing experience with their customer service, the set quit altogether. Of course, the warranty period had expired now, but we still had only owned the TV for 2 years. I contacted customer service again and was told I could have it repaired by shipping it to them and paying a mere $700. So instead of wasting my money repairing this lemon, I plan to take my money and purchase a TV from a reputable company like LG.Congratulations to those of you who enjoy and appreciate the products and service of the Tatung corporation.

I called customer service and they told me to do a reset and that it was probably my cables. I got tired of calling them and them not helping me so I just lived with the problem. Now, just a little over a year of having the TV, it just won't even turn on anymore. I paid 798.00 for this piece of crap and they won't honor their product. I guess its ok for a 798.00 TV to just stop working as long as its been over the one year warranty mark. This company should have stuck to making microwaves.

You cannot save the game when you want to. Every time you die and reload, you have to start in town. Every time you reload the game, the monsters regenerate in the levels that have been completed. This makes the game very tedious. In Blizzard's efforts to make the game harder they have added unnecessary tasks that take the fun out of the game.

The first 26 books were written by The Reverend Wilbert Vere Awdry, OBE, and the next 14 by Christopher Awdry.Another thing: The illustrator is said in the heading to be C. Reginald Dalby, but from the picture it appears that one of the books in the set is Thomas the Tank Engine (#2 in the series), which was illustrated by Reginald Payne. Dalby illustrated books #3 (James) through #11 (Percy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas the train book set","review":"These books were a BIG hit for my son's fourth birthday. He adores anything Thomas! I like them because they have great illustrations from Rev. Awdry. Another great characteristic of this set is that when the books are all lined up inside the box, there is a different segment of a train and coaches on each book spine and together they make a completed 'picture'. The only semi-complaint I have is that the books aren't quite as big as I had hoped they would be and some of the pages don't have full illustrations, but segments. However, overall I (and my son) are very pleased with the purchase and I would buy them again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitney Houston: the Biography By James Robert Parish","review":"This was one I could not put down untill I finished it. Completely up to date, covers her life,rise to fame,and ends on trip to Israel. Mr. Parish has walked the tightrope of keeping his feelings out the book, but still gives warts and all. Has a couple of pictures I never saw before, and is very quick moving as books of this type go. Learned some new things about my favorite DIVA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when you thought you knew it all","review":"Whitney Houston is rarely out of the tabloids,so you may think you know all about her. Leave it to Mr. Parish to get beyond the headlines and give us a well-rounded look at this diva. This is not the just the story of Whitney Houston, but of her family, esp. mother Cissy and of the era of pop in which she came of age. From the projects to mansions, from ups and downs, it is a fascinating look at a great talent. It gives an in-depth look at her marriage to Bobby Brown, a marriage that continues to defy predictions of doom. Whether a fan or not this is a very enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Redpath","review":"I've always been blessed and helped by Redpath's writings and this is no exception.

My son is 14 years old and this book has come so handy and the information invaluable. I learned the mistakes I've done along the way and ways to correct and improve my parenting techniques. The book \\"God's Design for the Highly Healthy Teen\\" has brought to me the biggest Aha Moments I've ever had. Currently I am sharing this book with my husband because he is more of a Dictator Parent and I want him to realize the emotional and behavioral damage that can cause to a teen who is already going thru so much at this age. I feel fortunate to have read this book while my son is 14 because I still have time to correct and implement great parenting skills that will last a lifetime. Not to mention, I have 2 other sons that are younger and I will do it all over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one great album you should have if you like ska music","review":"This album was out already a few years ago but it is still really good to listen to it.

The only brand it would play were some cheapy DVD+R's. It would list all 12 files on the disc.

So, I did not make the 30 day cut off and had to deal with Samsung. The first customer service rep was sooooooooo slow and clueless. The 2nd rep informed me that I had to send the machine back for REPAIR?! Repair?! They should be sending me a new one. I just bought it and it does not work! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE....

But then, when I tried to switch from the VCR function to the DVD player function, nothing happened. For some reason the DVD function had failed, and now I had a unit that was effectively only a VCR. I couldn't use the clock feature either because that was controlled by the DVD side of the unit. At the time I had a Playstation 2 so I could still watch DVDs, but I've since gotten rid of that.I took it in to a local home electronics repair shop, and the estimate to get the DVD side repaired was $340!!

We have noticed that MOST DVDs (rented from Netflix or Blockbuster) won't play at all. The screen shows \\"loading....\\" and simply stays there. It plays less than 1/4 of the DVDs inserted into it. Buyers should also note that the DVD player does not fast forward or reverse frame by frame, but by chapters, so if you want to see something you missed 5 seconds ago, you'll have to reverse to the last chapter.

As I look back on the entries, I'm surprised at how much I've grown, how much I've learned, how tolerant I've become & also how I have very much stayed the same. This book guides you thru some of the bad things that can happen to a woman who doesn't plot a course for her life. Some of the myths of being a woman are debunked (can't do math, can't be a trucker, or a construction worker, etc). What I liked most is that it doesn't push any specific feminist ideaology - just asking the question - what would you do? The message is clear - don't count on anyone to \\"take care of you\\". It tries to teach us to take care of ourselves. It is true that this book (at least my edition) is geared toward working / middle class teens. But as a middle class teen, it helped me enormously!

Boy was I wrong. They kept the concept of the original but gave it all new moves, 22 playable characters, and beautiful animation. With all it's stages and many weapons to master, this game still provides a ton of fun just as it did when I got it a year ago. Every one of my friends who played it are now heavily addicted and we've all developed in depth fighting strategies to use on one another. Contrary to what some might say, there is little luck involved in the one hit kill system of this game. Skill and timing always defeat luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"This game was great, but there were some flaws: 1st was I hated how you had to return to your stance after you struck, this could get you killed. 2nd Some of the physics were messed up, like if the computer threw their sub-weapon, and it would hit your knee as you were trying to jump, it kills you..., or it hits you in the foot you die. 3rd To few weapons, the first had better weapons, like the hammer. Other than those reasons this game was great, it's much better that games with life meters and timers and super-move meters. Plus being able to cut down the background was fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bushido Blade 2 Rules!","review":"This is really the coolest, and funnest fighting game on Play Station.

So I went to buy the second one, and gues what? It sucksroyally. Of course, it was cool in the beginning, but I quickly got bored of it. There are fewer weapons, which is the major drawback when comparing with the first BB, and the story game is a total bore. There are many more characters, but most of them have very similar moves anyway. The best parts are probably the school vs. school fights. Anyway, I sold it to some gullible guy I know. Don't get this, get the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Origional, but The First Bushido Blade is Better!","review":"Busido Blade 2 is as original as fighting games get. One strike one kill style Asain sword fighting. As for how that translates to game play though, give me a boreing old overhead life bar anyday. The rounds in Busido Blade 2 last seconds. It is near imposible to block a sword strike! In the origional you could at least defend yourself a bit making it a much better game. So only play this if you are the most die hard fighting fan.

It's a straight-up fighting game that pretends to have a story and a purpose--but basically you go from fight to fight, and that's about it. I hardly ever play fighting games, or any games really, and I finished the game with one character in about a half hour. Supposedly they expect you to play through with every character, but hearing each character's voice or slightly different way of fighting is hardly a reward.

I boiled the pacifier three times (which is difficult) and washed it several times before the smell went away. My daughter does not like the pacifier at all. She repeatedly spits it out.

It doesn't seem to hold the weight. Also, if the grass gets a little longish, I find it difficult to scoop the poop into the bag. The rake part doesn't seem to separate the poop from the grass very well. The first couple of scoops go fine, then I end up with the old two-piece shovel and scraper thing I have been using.

Now I liked the book a little better. It is about an African-American boy in the racial early times of America. The boy does not have a great education because the school is far away. So one day his father gets accused of stealing a pig and was sent to jail. When they took the dad away, Sounder, the boy's dog, got shot in the side of the face and shoulder and then he ran away. Later on, the dad gets sent to hard labor and the boy searches for him. Before the boy went to search for his father Sounder came home.

This has got to be one of the most boring and depressing pieces of work ever written. The ending is about as negative an ending as has ever been written and with no apparent moral to the story or silver-lining to balance the resolution. If it claims anything in this regard it would be some absurd religious clap-trap philosophy that by my estimation makes this book even more offensive and stupid. That it was written by a caucasian makes it even more if not wholly suspect and ridiculous.

Teachers that make their students read this book is really bad.One reason is that the southern language and vocabulary make students see those words and use them which we all know are bad. Like the word \\"aint\\". This word does not exist. Also the pronunciation.This book really has no story. The title is wrong because sounder really does not have anything to do with the book.

While his father is in jail the boy has to fill his fathers place in the sharecropping business. The main character in Sounder is a boy in a sharecropping family living with his father in jail. A strength of this book is that it was understandable; it is not needed to know much about the share-cropping time period to read this book. A weakness is that William Armstrong did not have any names for the characters beside the general names such as mother, father, he, she etc. The type of reader that would enjoy this book is one interested in the history of sharecropping times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film school project gone horribly wrong","review":"Leaden acting, wooden directing, self-indulgent hubristic art garbage.

In retrospect buying this book was a mistake anyway because the songs of tell their own stories and part of what makes them so magical is that they are ambiguous.

This new formula is a big disappointment. I'm estimating it takes about 30% more of the new product to get the same taste as before. When I used my usual amount it was very bland tasting.

It has also made it easier for those non track-pad users to jump on to my computer without a problem.Although it took a few uses to adapt to the smaller size, I wouldn't trade it for any other mouse. The cord can adjust to any length and has never tangled.

Only problem is the Kensington website doesn't work. So, at least until this is fixed, users can't upgrade unless they have an old installation disk.

The damage that a fasle accusation from CPS leaves behind is also abuse. Many are quick to judge and believe that CPS can do no wrong. I USED to be one of those people. Now being a victim of the system I no longer believe that. CPS is not always right and is a lot of the time WRONG!

Experience has taught me that this is so far from the truth. These type of books should be given to all parents in the hospital as they are leaving w/ their newborns. Think it can't happen to you because you're not abusing your children?

Even with the lack of instructions, it would not have been terribly difficult to assemble if it had not been missing pieces. The bag with the wooden dowels and the screws for the connectors (for stacking one on top of another) was missing - I hope to have those pieces in 2-4 weeks. Hopefully the wobbliness of the shelves will disappear once the correct sized dowels are in place - I am improvising temporarily because, yes, I am going to keep it for lack of a better option.Also, this shelf will not hold 19 adult shoes - at most 15 when using the floor space underneath.Edit: I did receive the missing parts in about 2 weeks, and it is sturdier now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what i needed","review":"I bought two of these and stacked them.

A child can sleep at a daycare or at school, but can't go spend the night at dad's house. How else can a child get the benefit of having both parents share in the raising of that child. The non-custodial parent would never get to help the child get ready for bed, wake them up in the morning, take them to school, make them dinner, and the list would go on forever.

And after 10 years of a steady Mystery Science Paycheck, they needed something to put food on the table as well. Their first post-MST3K foray, the Film Crew movies, are unfortunately just a limp, not-terribly-funny retreat of the MST3K concept. The host segments are downright painful to watch. OK, it's fun to see what Brain Guy looks like sans makeup, but their hearts just aren't in the host segments. When they get into the movie, you can imagine that it's Mike and the bots, what with the voices and all. But this movie is such a stinkbomb that even a MST3K-lite treatment can't keep you from pressing \\"info\\" repeatedly to see how much of the hour and 18 minute running time is left.

There is much more in this book than just vocabulary and grammar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly impossible to look up a name's meaning","review":"A very scholarly and authoritative work to be admired by academics everywhere - almost useless as a quick means to look up what a botanical name means. If you were to take a semester or so studying this work, it would probably turn out to be very useful. For example, the chapters are broken down into Habitats, Geographical Names, Colour Terms, Greek words, Descriptive Terminology, Chemical Reactions and Tests, etc. So, if you happen to already know that sagittatus is a descriptive term, you can go to the chapter on Descriptive Terminology and find out that it means arrow-headed.

The vintage (often high 60 & 70s) graphics are charming and the wit is there. The Pop ink series is pretty consistent in terms of both satire and image quality and I honestly found this terrific.A word to the wise; it really isn't about goths per se. It's mostly classic Mike Nelson rants about Halloween-type things (Frankenstein, Haunted Houses, etc.)If you're looking for a more 'Goth' specific send up, check out Voltaire's \\"What Is Goth?\\".

It's the best I've ever seen on the N64. The graphics are very cool and the animation is superb. My only knock on the title is that the pace is a little faster than you'd expect in real life. For that reason, you get a lot of ping-pong, back and forth action that you don't see in real soccer games.If you find that you're getting beaten by the computer too often, just call Manny.

Along the way, we meet such things as the Turing Test to see if a machine can mimic a human. Also, we see MIT's Eliza. Famed since the 70s, despite its primitive text interface.For current applications, the authors give a good survey of the field. From manufacturing case studies to finance.

Fabrice Luchini delivers them rather fast, no talking down to 8-12 year olds. My French is minimal, but I'm sure these are great examples for Americans who want to polish their French pronunciation. And if I choose, I can milk some translations off the Internet.Addendum: O, pardonnez moi! After a night's sleep, as I returned to consciousness this little album cover fluttered in my head and I realized the title is not \\"The Fountain\\" but refers to the great 17th century fabulist Jean de La Fontaine, a pillar of French literature. While a child might be charmed by one of his stories, they resonate infinitely to pique the most sophisticated of minds.

It will only fit on my larger triple LNB dish (which doesn't work for me). I did just do a quick test on it though to see how it picked up the reception and it worked pretty well. Got all my locals in with no major problem and even got a station from about 60-70 miles away that is not in my local area. So if you are putting this on a triple LNB system go for it. if you are trying to put this on a dual LNB (like the description says), then you need to look for a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"I live on the ground floor of a four-floor condo building, so naturally I thought this antenna would give me better reception than a powered antenna in my living room. Wrong! First, the patch cables they send you with the product are too short to install on a 3 LNB DirecTV dish, so I had to make a trip to Radio Shack (the 4 foot cable is just right). Second, the coaxial connectors on the antenna show their poor craftsmanship (Made in China) since the threads are not flattened on two sides, making in near impossible to screw on all of the connections in such small quarters without stripping the threads. But all of that would have been worth it if the product actually worked. It doesn't. At all. Really, I went from receiving approximately 50% of the HD signals in my area to receiving just one.

Frequently, he goes so far as to suggest that believing Christianity is not real is similar to believing that the Holocaust never happened. He spends most of his book instructing the reader on how to use a person's argument against them and then to continue to push what that person doesn't want to hear.

The story mode is a little cheesy, but fun nonetheless.- The music and sounds blend in with the game well.- You can get this game very cheap, compared to other racing games.- It is a lot of fun to race against other players (unfortunately, more than 2 human players are not supported), but the AI of the game is also challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocobo Racing","review":"I have played this game for 4 or 5 months now and even though I have never played a Final Fantasy game, this game is excellent!!

You race well enough to take the lead, only to get hit with a cheap shot? There's certainly no place for such anti-rewards in a game aimed at anyone over the age of five, and those younger won't be able to handle the twisty tracks anyways.Breeding and raising Chocobos in \\"Final Fantasy VII\\" was fun.

One may argue that the musicial notation is somewhat accurate, but the tablature seems to indicate that it was produced only by translating the notes, not by listening to the recordings (e.g., by listening to the recording one could determine whether a note was played higher on a low string or lower on a higher string).Pass on this book if you wish to play a Rush song exactly as recorded. Instead, look to back issues of guitar magazines (especially Guitar for the Practicing Musician, no longer in print)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush Guitar anthology","review":"I read the previous reviews, but decided to go ahead and purchase this book anyway. I find it quite interesting how some of the previous reviewers were quite quick to critisize the transcriptions in this book. To some degree they are correct in that some of the the chord inversions may be suspect or perhaps a certain articulation wasn't indicated. True, but in most instances if you listen to the recording while checking the book at the same time you can get to the right inversion or articulations by ear. On the other hand, if you truly want to play Rush songs 100% correct, you would have to take personal lessons from Alex Lifeson.

Its quite stable once the legs are wrapped properly. The build is quite strong too, it will require a very strong force to break it. The only problem is that its difficult to set it up for portrait shots (unless you have a vertical bar or something). Also, once its legs are tightly wrapped, small movements are impossible.

I haven't yet tried wrapping them around a fence post. The level on the attachable mount is helpful. You can take panoramic shots, if you loosen the ball head just a little.

However if you use a ball head or pistol grip head from another tripod, the setup problem is eliminated. The bouncing is easily cured with the timer or a remote.It sure beats carrying my large tripod around during my vacation. I am able to make it grip on various objects and maneuver the camera with the pistol grip head to get the desired shot. I am using it with my Nikon D90 which I know is not the heaviest of DSRLs but I think for most people it would do just fine.I don't know if I would be happy if I did not have the pistol grip head to use with it.

First of all, there is no ball head included, so adjusting both the angle of the camera and the position of the legs is challenging, and sometimes impossible. The only situation where this tripod works just fine is placing it on a flat table to shoot the subject perfectly positioned in the horizontal plane (but then who needs a tripod anyway?). Real life is seldom this simple, especially outdoors. My other problem with this product is the mounting screw which is hard to access and to turn. The slot in the screw head is wide and shallow, so using a coin to drive the screw does not work as it is supposed to. Other than that, GP3 seems sturdy and of good quality.All in all, as sold this is pretty much a dysfunctional piece of gear. If you want to make it useful you will need to consider the cost of ball head which is sold separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product if used with ball head","review":"The best features of the tripod are its ability to stand on its own as well as mount to small objects.

The main cause because whereas this is one of those things that look good on paper it just doesn't translate that well in to real world use. Getting the pod gripping tightly on to something while yet at the same time framing the shot you want is surprisingly frustrating. It should be noted that I had the SLR version of the pod, using it with an SLR camera.

The problem is that the Gorillapod is made out of plastic and it is not stiff enough to prevent camera vibration, instead, it amplifies it and makes it worse. The only way to use the Gorillapod is with a 10 second timer to allow the vibrations to settle out...Nice try, but I'll stick with my miniature collapsible metal tripod...."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks like a good idea but terrible in practice","review":"I hate using this thing.

It would NOT support a D300 with 24-120VR lens--and this combo weighs much less than the 6.6 lbs claimed. No matter what I tried the gorilla pod collapsed, sagged, or tipped over. Absolutely a joke! I am not even convinced it would support a small DSLR like a D50. I returned it and instead bought a short center column for my regular tripod. Do not buy this expecting it to support an SLR. It did work nicely for my husbands prosumer super-zoom (Canon SX30IS) and I think that is the maximum size I'd use this for.

What is not mentioned is the Ball Head is NOT included with the camera, but costs an additional $40. Sure, if I would have read the fine print I might have found this out, but I find that to be misleading... so buyer beware.Besides that, the legs on the tripod are rather stiff, making it difficult to easily level the camera (without purchasing the Ball Head add-on).

Clichés permeate the page, the characters are 2-dimensional and belong in after school specials, emotional impact is conveyed through insultingly obvious explanations, the narrator is supposed to be stoic yet she cries every five pages.

There really is nothing special about this book. It does offer SOME insight into how hard it must have been in the 1960's living as a homosexual, but the accounts are short and redundant.

WELCOME TO LIFE is the next step. Dave has amazing chops, beautiful tone and incredible time. His compositions are singable, yet completely intricate and ingeniously crafted. On \\"Welcome To Life\\" he uses the same band that is on SOUTH with the exception of Craig Taiborn sitting in the place of the amazing Uri Caine. Craig fills Uri's shoes and then some. Chris Potter's solo on \\"Frez\\" is totally amazing. Adam Roger's slide guitar solo on Lisliel could be my favorite part on the album! Scott Colley is featured on Enchantress.

Unfortunately it seems to be lacking some swing, partly due to the sometimes annoyingly stiff drumming by Brian Blade. Binney himself is a very impressive saxophonist with a great expressive range, while his compositons are very elegant and refined, though this may also be the cause of the rather stiff drumming parts. Potter is at his usual peak, Taborn is great. In all a very fine record, but it could do with some extra fire, bringing it somewhere beyond sheer elegance. The short spell of chaos in 'Ici' is of a rather predictable nature. Also some compositions do rely a little too much on the repetition of themes. So...do I even like this record? Yes, I do, remarkably, but it could be much better still."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fractured Plot but Readable","review":"I enjoy Steven Saylors choice of topics and his writing style, however for me this was not one of his best books in terms of plot - the mystery does not even start until late in the book (this is a mystery isn't it?), and it seems overly contrived that Gordianus becomes a first hand witness to so many major historical events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Disappointing!","review":"I so wanted to enjoy this book but found it lacking in the plotting, mystery and verve that the other books in this series had.

Had this been the first book of this series I read, it would not inspire me to read the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Tired","review":"Unfortunately, Steven Saylot's series seems to have run out of steam and is very tired. The entire thing-the plot, the characters and yes, the historical accuracy, are very tired. Frankly, I quit reading about half way (no mystery introduced and I was tired of wading through labored prose) and just glanced at the ending, which was pretty silly and far fetched."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big step down...","review":"I enjoyed several of the earlier books in this series, both because the mystery was well thoughtout and because the sttings were interesting in their own right. But as the action has become more intwined with historical figures, the mysteries have suffered and the prose become, like most novels revolving around historical personages, very stilted.[...] The historical events and personalities seem to be acting as a crutch more than as a setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleopatra, Caesar and Gordianus: a fun threesome","review":"'The Judgment of Caesar' is the latest of many historical novels by Steven Saylor involving his ancient Roman sleuth, Gordianus. By now we know Gordianus quite well, and now we are entertained by having Gordianus caught up in mischief, mayhem and murder in ancient Alexandria. Emperor Caesar also has issues with a sibling rivalry between Cleopatra and her younger brother. Caesar ultimately decides which of the siblings would actually rule Eygpt. While we all know the outcome I found the entire story to be very engaging. Saylor does a great job weaving in Gordianus, thus seamlessly blending in fiction into the non-fiction.My only complaint with the story is the \\"cutesiness\\" of Gordianus and his family. Earlier Saylor novels portrayed the family as individuals with backbone. However they now have gone spineless and syrupy sweet. I suggest Saylor goes back to his old ways.Bottom line: a fast, fun and educational read. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent option for laptop users","review":"This thing is sweet.

In fact, there wasn't ANYONE in the book I found really likeable or to whom I cared what happened, with the exception of Lizzie, the cute little five year old, and the two great aunts.On the plus side, Ms. Greene does know how to write.

I bet you had both VHF and UHF types on your roof before you got cable/sat service. Anyway, HDTV antennas are MERELY UHF antennas. Nothing more. The Channel Master 4228 is a SOLID performer and sells for about $50. Oh - keep it OUT of your attic!

This performance is only acheived with amplification. A signal sent to a second tv is actually better on non-digital stations using an indoor antenna relative to this outdoor antenna. Take my advice and look elsewhere.Later tried an Antenna Direct DB2 and it easily out-performed the Terk from inside the house.

The charger was also missing.My choice was to send it back (and pay the 2-way shipment) or living with a \\"new\\" cellphone that looked like it was roughly used for a year.At first I though the box was opened on the way here, but unless someone in FedEx put his really mistreated cellphone (identical to the one i bought) in the place of the new one, I doubt it could be accidentally (or even on purpose) damaged that way.Since the shipment from my country was waaaaay too expensive I had to keep it, so don't let it happen to you.

The lessons of 40 years of physics education research have totally failed to penetrate this bastion of didactic exposition.

It is structured as reference, not pedagogical, material, but it is at too low a level to be usable for that purpose like Goldstein or Jose and Saletan. As such, it is neither fish nor fowl. The overall problem is that junior level classical mechanics is a black hole for physics texts -- there are no good ones, but this is among the least effective (and expensive to boot)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much digression.","review":"If you like a large amount of digressions by an auther; this is the book for you.

I started playing the original tribes back around 1998, before Tribes 2 came out. The original tribes was extremely customizable on your equipement setups and allowed for easy server side modifications to the game. Tribes vengeance you cant... You have 4 slots of equipment to choose from and thats it. You cannot add equipment or special features to make your games unique. You can however make different game rules. The only part of the game i enjoyed was the grapple, being able to act like spiderman and sling shot around was fun for me and I enjoyed it.

Only some of the things good about this game are the Ski Mode, Vehicles, Packs duel capabilities, that were implemented."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GAME RULES!","review":"Okay. Let me tell you all, IGNORE ALL COMMENTS DISSING THIS GAME. In short, this game rules. The graphics are awesome, the storyline is fantastic and there is nothing else like it, and it isn't that confusing at all. And if it is, it's supposed to be. The battles are intense and usually hard, and they really get your heart going. By the end of the game, you really feel for the characters, and there are many parts where you stare after a non-interactive part goes through, saying, \\"WHOA! What was that! \\" or something like that. Aya isn't such a great name, but you can change it, after all!

It takes place in the Big Apple and revolves around Aya Brea, a cop, and starts in Carnagie Hall. The game has a good solid story line, the only problem is that it might be confusing for some people. The cinema is the best that I have ever seen in a game. I feel it beats Final Fantasy 7's cinema, but you might disagree with me. The PRG elements are easy to understand, which makes this game a good game for beginning role players, the elements are also very unique, allowing you to customize Aya and her equipment, which is very sweet. Some problems I felt the game had were that it was too short. I bought it on a Friday and had it beat 10 hours later. The monsters were cool but fighting the same thing over and over sucks. Well I don't want to spoil the game anymore, so go out and buy the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"Square's \\"cinematic RPG\\" is game with not much excitment in it. The game starts off with a new concept for its plot, which has great potential. But the game lacks in its other departments. First the game is slow, and very boring. It's nothing more than to chase the boss around the city trying to prevent the game's boss from doing any evil. With that said, now everyone pretty much knows the premise for the game. The gameplay isn't that great, and there isn't too much on characterization for the one person you control. As earlier said, the plot held great potential but the game just could carry it off. On the plus side the game did have some of the best FMVs (Full Motion Videos) not seen anywhere else (except Final Fantasy VIII), and the graphics were pretty good. But besides its eye-candy Parasite Eve was not much of a 'good' game and there are certainly plenty of others to look for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I got this game expecting a lot. I was very disappointed. But first the good. The game is innovative, being a departure from the standard RPG by Squaresoft. The battle system was a good attempt, but didn't work too well. The cinematic features of the game were not disappointing. The cut scenes were wonderful and the overall graphics were pretty good. The storyline was interesting as well.Unfortunately, that did not make up for the confusing nature of the game. The weapon modification system did not work well, and as I said before, the battle system did not end up being as good as it could have been. The gameplay was not immensely fun either.Call it my opinion, but I did not enjoy this game at all and couldn't wait to trade it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not great","review":"This game has an interesting storyline, and some good cinematic sequences, but I was disappointed with certain aspects. For instance, you aren't able to bypass the cinematic scenes....this can be annoying when re-doing a level multiple times. Also, most of the dialog is read-only (rather than spoken on the soundtrack). For a game with it all, I'd suggest Metal Gear Solid as a far more superior game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor.","review":"Too short, too easy, very boring, really. The storyline makes little sense and is rather inconsistant (to free the mitochondria... huh, really, bad attempt at bio sci-fi here), Aya is somewhat cool but pretty boring. The FMAs are almost all gratuitous, they very seldom have anything to do with actual story elements, and it seems Square relied only on that to sell the game. The graphic engine is good but poorly used: the pre-rendered backgrounds are no match for Resident Evil 2. If you want a good RPG, get Xenogears or Final Fantasy Tactics, but avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye Candy","review":"Don't let anyone fool you; Parasite Eve is pure eye candy. The game itself is extremely sub-par, and most of it you will spend watching FMVs.

Other than that, this game was barely worthwhile. I like corny storylines, but this one was way too corny.

You also have to comb the same scenes over and over again to make sure you picked up all of the invisible weapon upgrades. But it wasn't challenging at all. Just redundant redundant.

Songs to put on repeat:'The Ballad of Booth', The Ballad of Csolgoz', 'How I Saved Roosevelt', the dialogue track, and my favorite, 'Unworthy of Your Love'.

Many people talk about the beauty of \\" Unworhty of Your Love.\\", but in my opinion, \\" Everybody's got the right is where the show really shines, listen to it once, and I dare you not to have it stuck in your head, or sing it outloud.

I have been in and seen productions that decided not to use Something Just Broke. The song may be one of Sondheim's biggest mistakes. It doesn't work and it kills the flow of the show.

As Stephen Sondheim has proven over and over again (e.g. West Side Story and Bernstein's Candide) he does his best work when he allows someone else to write his lyrics. Even with its decent cast, and a touching moment between Booth and Oswald, nothing could save this musical from the crushing fist of the Balladeer, the single most puerile study in forced narration in the history of musical theatre (and I use the word theatre VERY loosely).

Yeah, the graphic stills look great, but just try playing the game for more than an hour. It has the most obnoxious 3rd person camera I've ever seen. It zooms in and out whenever it feels like it and you have no control over it. You would think that when the evil boss's gigantic super tank pops up to splatter you that the camera would shift so you can look at it, but nope. You get to fight most of your enemies off screen. Luckily, you are equipped with an auto tracking device that renders any aiming skills you may have useless, and makes it basically a dodge ball game with a plot. Sound like fun? Just wait until you're trying to track down that helicopter firing missles at you and the camera keeps zooming in and out and spinning! Yeah, it's cheap, but so is sticking your finger down your throat, and that's more fun.

A plea for balance and exegetical equitability: what about 70AD to 2004AD?!? Does an accurate reading of Revelation omit this entire New Testament Church Kingdom Age of real life in any prophetic, historical, spiritual, parabled, literal, apocalyptic, fulfilled, ongoing sense of value to day-to-day Christian struggle as Wheat vs. Weeds in the Field until Harvest Day? What's missing in much of the speculative debate and fictionalization of End Times is close study and harmonization with Jesus' Kingdom Parables.Please try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever wasted my money on. The title and the cover description would lead you to believe it is about John or at least about possesing a copy of Revelations. It's not. The first 3/4 of the book just follows certain characters around without any hint of a plot. The final 1/4 finally starts to put together a plot, but then the book just comes to an abrupt end. Not a well crafted cliff hanger, it just ends like the author just got tired of writting. Even though the authors disagree with the Left Behind theology, they obviously are copying the strategy of stretching too little story over too many books in an attempt to deprive the readers of their hard earned money. I honestly don't care enough about the characters to pay for another poorly written book just to find out what happens to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this on CD","review":"I am a big fan of HH radio program ( though our Christian station dropped him ).

Because it misses the point. Instead of obsessing on one particular Roman emperor and his human political throne of causing Lamb followers to suffer, Revelation emphasizes it's all about Satan's throne as the underlying cause of all Christian persecution, temptation, spiritual warfare and worldliness assaulting the Lamb's throne (Christ's Kingdom) throughout history.Come on, guys. It's about Jesus vs. Satan, Lamb vs. Serpent, NOT Jews/Roman believers vs. Emperors. This book comes across like saying Pilgrim's Progress is about a dangerous nature hike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, no matter what you believe.","review":"I just happened to pick this book up in my local library, I was browsing through books, and some of my favorite authors were out, and this one caught my eye, so I picked it up. I knew the book went along religious themes, but I didn't realize how much the authors would go into it. I really enjoyed it. Weather you believe Jesus was the Messiah, or the Messiah is yet to come, or if you don't believe either, the book weaves a tail and brings the reader into the days of Rome, emperors, gladiators, love and betrayal. The book also seems to show a fair picture of the pagans (sorry folks if I've chosen the wrong term...I mean no offense) of Rome, the Jewish faith and the Christian faith, clearly the authors believe that the Christian faith is the correct one, but they present a fair picture, I believe. I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too violent","review":"I did not like this book at all. It's completely not my taste.

While the theology is a refreshing change from the works of LaHaye and Jenkins, the writing quality is surprisingly poor. The plot rambles through the first three-quarters of the book, with ancient Roman names abounding and no real story unfolding. The pace does quicken at the end, but there is no real point made other than the Beast of Revelation being Nero.After reading this title, there is still a need for a top-notch, end-times thriller that presents an \\"Exegetical Eschatology\\" (a term mentioned in the author's afterword).

I love the approach taken on the title track; blending more contemporary views on religion with old-style country crooning. I also love the punked-up, rip-roar of tunes like \\"Miss Caroline\\". If you grew up avoiding country music at all costs and tended to opt for the The Clash before Kenny Rogers, and yet feel that country longin' from time to time, this album will make you very happy.

In fact, I woke up in the middle of the night recently and couldn't get back to sleep so I picked up this book and started reading. It worked great in helping me get back to sleep. This book is NOT for the average, normal person. It's pretty much for Derek Rowntree alone. He's the only one who would really find the things he's written of interest. He makes statistics a bore and I normally love math. DON'T get this book and if you're a professor/instructor PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE don't make your students read it.

See, I learned something!In all seriousness, the book does accomplish what its sets out to do: Explain the most basic concepts in stats in rather plain language and without the supporting derivations and equations. But, in the end it is useless to anyone but perhaps a high school student looking for an introduction. It takes nearly one-quarter of the book to finally arrive at definitions of grade school topics such as means, medians, and modes.The treatment is so simple as to be insulting at times, and it lacks explanations of those topics that actually make stats complicated. Instead it sticks to simple half-baked explanations of topics that are simplistic to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful text, appalling price","review":"I've used this as a supplementary text in Kellogg's EMP (executive MBA) program for more than a decade.

If I don't then the whole house smells (I have a big house!) and then I have to burn scented candles! So it's not really a money saver in my opinion.

So after running the wash cycle (we have a front loading machine with a high spin setting) we found our diapers completely shredded. In addition to the mess it made (took my husband hours to clean it all out of the various parts of the washer) we were left with 7 of 24 diapers.

It worked really well for us for about 6 months then the little deoderizer disc lost it's smell and my husband got tired of fighting with the disc holder. It was quickly removed. We did spray the can with a bacterial spray and that seemed to work well. Our daughter is almost two with the second one on the way. We don't keep the pail in her room because it doesn't always hold smell like it says it does. It stays in a closet. I do have to agree with on of the other reviewers in that if you don't receive it as a gift like I did, go out and buy a nice looking lidded trash can and save yourself the $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last.","review":"I have three major problems with this product.1) The bags are hard to change because the lid doesn't stay open while you are trying to change them.2) The small lid where you are supposed to put the diapers in does not open anymore because the springs broke.3) The pail does not reduce any of the odors from the diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well be a garbage can","review":"We received this as a gift, and threw it away after two weeks with our newborn.

We are much happier with our Diaper Champ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay the extra money to avoid the stink!!","review":"This item is inexpensive and I thought it would be a good buy since you didn't need to buy extra bags and could just use the same bags for both this and your garbage..but I was wrong this diaper pail lets all the smell out! My son's whole room smells like Pee and Poo as soon as you place more than one diaper in there. You end up buy twice as many garbage bags just so you can quickly replace the one filled with only a few diapers. Totally a waste of money since I am now on the hunt for a better smell resistant diaper pail. Don't learn the hard way as I did just buy a good one the first time around..hope this helps all you mothers and fathers out there :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"hate it","review":"I got this pale b/c it was cheap.

This diaper pail is not the best, I can still smell some odor, but for me the simplicity of it is worth it. I hated the turning pushing, special bags, installations difficulties. This pail is easy, has a large capacity, has a space for deodorants and is not too expensive. So, you will have some smell leak out, but it's worth not having the headache from the counterpart."},{"rating":"1","title":"absorbs odor","review":"I have used this diaper pail for fifteen months now, about half of the time without the use of the inner plastic flaps that the diapers go through since two of the springs broke. I like that it uses regular trash bags and it does an OK job of containing odors (I have yet to hear of one that really contains it all.) But my complaint is that the thing absorbs and stores odors! It smells worse than any diaper ever did! I have tried bleaching it out, adding deodorizors to the little compartment in the lid, lysol wipes, air freshener spray, everything I can think of and the thing absolutely reaks! I think my son's diaper stinks, but then I open the diaper pail...even freshly cleaned and emptied with a brand new bag!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy again","review":"From the beginning the lid would not stay closed. I have to keep a wipes container on top to keep it from popping open.

I wanted to buy a diaper pail that wasn't too bulky and this seemed just right. It can use any standard trash bag which is a plus. I certainly didn't want to buy special bags for something that holds dirty diapers! We have twins and the pail holds enough for a few days. I wouldn't want dirty diapers hanging out in a room for more days than that anyway so this is just right! The colors of the pail are not the same as what is pictured. Instead of white/blue, it is tan/ivory. It's a diaper pail so the color does not matter to me. As far as odor goes, if you change it often and not let the diapers steep in their own grossness, you won't have issues with odor. Overall a great diaper pail!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it for any amount of money","review":"We bought this diaper pail because of price and I did not want one with inserts, had the genie and hated it, had to push diapers down and most the time they didn't fit anyway. This diaper pail broke the first month. The dome that the deoderizer fits in broke and then the lid stopped staying closed. We had to put a toy on top of the pail to keep the lid down. The pail does not keep the smell in, so I bought seperate small bags to wrap each diaper in before we put it in the pail and the pail still smelled. Tried bleaching the pail and that worked for a day or two but then the it smelled even after just two days of diapers. Good luck finding the perfect diaper pail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odor isn't a problem and my boy is STINK-ay!","review":"We bought the Diaper Genie with our first child (had to go all out with the first, right?;) I wanted another diaper pail in my newborn's room, so i wouldn't have to go back and forth between the two. I opted for this b/c of price. I wish I would have just bought this one with my first child and spent the other $15 bucks on something else. Seriously do NOT have a problem with odors. I bought those Arm and Hammer tabs that you can get at Target and Amazon and stick one in the top compartment. It's clearly meant for that purpose. For good measure, I also throw in some loose A&H each time I change a bag (inside the bag itself). I love that I don't have to stop in Target to get Genie inserts.

Twice.","review":"We bought these diaper pails because they use regular garbage bag and are fairly inexpensive. We have 1 year old twins, so we go through A LOT of diapers and controlling the stink is important. This trash can did a lot better than the regular kitchen step can (that we purchased to replaced it) at controlling the stink. The step can did fine when the lid was closed, but every time it was opened, WHEW it was gross. That was not the case with these can. The problem with these cans is that with regular wear and tear, the spring on the lid snapped. Twice. Rendering it unusable (unless you want to open the whole can each time which defeats the purpose). The first time it happened the twins were six months old. We thought maybe it was a fluke. The second time it happened was a few weeks before their first birthday. Same exact problem: snapping spring.

For the first 5 minutes it worked perfectly. I was able to aerate a small area pretty quickly, but then the clogging started. I would remove the clog (which is not easy at all) and then start up again only to get another clog shortly after. I thought that maybe I was getting clogs because the soil was too moist and I decided to try it again on a dryer day only to get the same result. It seems that the clogs can be caused by grass or grass roots as well as moist soil, so unless you are working on an area that has never had grass and at the perfect moisture, you will get frustrated with the clogs.

The plugs of dirt popped out obediently enough for the first two plunges, then got massively jammed full of dirt. Once jammed full like this, the tool simply punches holes that you could do with a piece of rebar or something similar. I thought perhaps the soil was too dry for this to work so I waited until after a nice rain to try again. After clearing the holes and going out post-rain (but not too wet) this thing still jammed immediately. Worse yet, it pulled up large chunks of soil when withdrawing the tool from the dirt. The soil in my yard is wonderful, loamy stuff- I only need to aerate a couple of areas of high traffic- I am not expecting miracles here, but this just did not perform. I ended up sticking an old hay fork into the groud repeatedly.

Second, the blades are not replaceable, so you have to replace the whole head assembly. Third, the cleaning system is bulky, and cumbersome. What ever happened to the simple Norelco technology: open the head, brush them out, and replace the blades when the shave gets poor.

The heads also appear to have less clearance and pivot than previous models, and does not cut longer whiskers as well as older models. Furthermore, the trimmer on this one is a joke, no where near as good as on previous models.

Since I could not shave without a replacement I bought a replacement head. This one lasted one month before not working. Also Philips did not honor the rebate.

Would never spend so much on a razor but I now understand why people do. Great shaver. Easy to clean. Close shave. Cool look. Most people are familiar with the Norelco design by now, which has different heads pivoting individually to really get the contours of your face. This one does that and then some. Better than other Norelcos I have used in the past, although this may be because it's a higher-priced, better razor.I'm knocking off a star because I feel the price is a bit high for what it does. Razors at 30% of this cost do just about the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great","review":"I have owned several other Norelco Razors in the past and this one just doesn't work as well. It gives you a very uncomfortable shave, misses areas all together, and doesn't work nearly as good as their previous razors. Also - you basically have to clean it every day which is an awkward process because you have to individually lift each razor head and wash it out. Fortunately, this razor got lost on a cross country flight so I am now forced to spend money on something else. Sadly - good riddance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Norelco keeps making a poorer and poorer product","review":"I've owned 4 Norelco's over 15 years and each new one is worse than the last one.

As long as you use it every day (and won't your beard grow too long) you will think of shaving as... just another thing to do in the morning instead of \\"O my God, I still have to shave\\". It doesn't require cream, or water, so you can even shave on a couch while watching morning news. On few occasions I even did it while driving a car. The head remains sharp forever, and battery lasts a lifetime (I charge it 2x month max). There are newer models of this shaver, and you should probably go with them, as I predict that they can only be better. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even around the neck?

Since I got mine at Xmas, it's been trying to equal my last regular electric Norelco (Spectra 8892 XL), but falling way short. I mean, really, it just doesn't cut it. I've had to return to my old Norelco for a truly close shave. Come on, Norelco, you used to be a contender! Too much style and no substance! And it's hard to clean, too.

Anything longer than a five o clock shadow and this razor can't handle it. I addition this model is messy; there is no chamber for the the clippings fall into. Thus your shirt, the floor and counter will be covered with clippings. Also on the downside, the side-burn trimmer is completely inadequate; it too tiny to be functional.

I am really disappointed with the results from this shaver. As other reviewers point out, this razor is very harsh on my skin and in fact the third time I used it it gave me a bad case of razor burn in my adams apple area that resulted in scarring (since healed). I now am very careful when I use it and this results in it taking longer to shave than my old razor. It can give me a smooth shave but it requires care and patience. I feel that the 1050 is a step backwards for Phillips. In the end I replaced the batteries and heads on my old Quadra and use it more than the 1050. I would recommend that if you are buying this shaver, make sure you can return it if you need to. One final thing.

The manual tells you to remove the shaving head when using the trimmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must clean after each use, and it is 3X harder to clean!","review":"Not much better than the conventional old style Norelcos without the \\"neck.\\" And, worse, must clean after each use, and it is 3X harder to clean because you have to individually open three compartments, using two fingers, after every use or two, compared to the old style where you can just flip it open, easily, with your thumb and clean it every week or two. That is many hours extra work, over the course of a year or the shaver's lifetime. Not worth the extra trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arcitec makes me mad at myself when I shave.","review":"I am a Norelco shaver user for at least 20 years.

It leaves hair all over my neck and face. The trimmer is a minuscule idiocy with the head in the way. So it is of no help.

I've looked to buy the heads locally and haven't found anybody who stocks them.Bottom line. I would not recommend this shaver unless you like to throw money at it every year.

I found a nice little Panasonic wet-dry shaver on Amazon that gives me a nice close shave and costs $30 or 1/4 of what I paid for the Phillips shaver-shame on you Phillips for selling a shaver that should just be a desk sculptue, but should never be used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product!","review":"This is a complete waste of money!

Same thing.So I bought one of the cheaper Norelco Lift And Cut models. Immediately, my shaving time went from seven minutes to 90 seconds.

It will take you at least 20 minutes to shave if not longer. Nice design and the engineering of the model made me believe it would be a superior product. No such luck. In a word this razor blows. Norelco never even answered several emails about the product. I get the feeling they've heard quite enough + will keep it on the market as long as people are stupid enough to buy it.

Nothing about it is better than my 5 years ago Norelco, last one I bought. And one thing is definitely worse. I use the clippers on my old Norelco to trim sideburns, mustache, and ears.

I like to use oil before I shave and the 8240 allows me to remove the heads, dump them in a container with some rubbing alcohol, and easily clean them with a few shakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"my father likes it very much","review":"The product is perfect.

It is not only the worst shaver I ever tried, It's the first bad Norelco I've ever triedIt doesnt give a close shaver, even though I spent twice as much time shaving.

I had thought that these two conditions were mutually exclusive, but Phillips has managed to put them both in this razor. I would not recommend the purchase of this product. The battery life is excellent between shaves, other than that it really is an inferior product.I replaced it with a Norelco 8240XL which is excellent and half the price.If I were Phillips, I would do what Ford did with the Edsel and withdraw it from the market before it damages their reputation any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit 97 dodge ram 3500","review":"The item I received said it was for a 97 dodge ram 3500, and I assumed it would look like the picture, red and white, like all rancho products.

It's frustrating because they are selling the product as a bolt in replacement and it's not. Why would I want to cut off my factory mounts and weld on a new one?

I would even go so far as to say that her latest books haven't even been written by the same \\"ghost\\"...some are so shallow and silly I am amazed the publisher let them be attached to the Lindsey name.Johanna Lindsey used to be on my \\"buy hardcover\\" list. Now I won't even buy paperback...either I get a book from the library or used...preferably from the library so I'm not paying for a book I won't finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another rapist hero","review":"If I could give this zero stars I would.

He even offers to make amends for raping her by not turning her over to the police.After raping her, he chains her to a wall after making sure he had taken away the ability to rescue her father.I couldn't finish this book. I knew the heroine would forgive the rapist and I just wanted him dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen far better from Lindsey, but also far worse","review":"I love Johanna Lindsey. I will read anything that she writes, even if I do occasionally get burned. That being said, this book burned me badly. The hero and heroine have little, if any chemistry. The story lacks depth. The action/turning point is virtually nonexistent. And even the bad guy doesn't do anything to make him so terrible. Really, it's a waste of your time.I firmly believe that since Lindsey started writing in the late 70's and has continued to be a prolific author for nearly 30 years, that she's just churning out nonsense now. She's told all the good stories there were to tell, and her best work is right around the midpoint in the late 80's and early nineties. Don't believe me? Check out Prisoner of My Desire and Love Me Forever. Then check out her newer works like Heart of A Warrior and Captive of My Desire. The truth will be as plain as day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captive of My Desires","review":"Dear Readers:Ms. Lindsey and her editor were sleeping through this installment of the Malory family saga. Not only does Ms. Lindsey not deliver with her usual witty dialogue and description, she leaves the reader wondering where the plot went. Captive of My Desires has few redeeming qualities. You're not sure if Drew and Gabby are truly even interested in one another or being manipulated to fit into the author's plot when it's there. The dialogue is stilted and forced and the plot trite and full of holes. The ending is contrived and unrealistic. Sadly, the only interesting part of the book was catching up with the Malory family. I'm sorry to say this book is a shipwreck and not worth the $25.00 I had to pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened!!","review":"I could hardly believe that Ms. Lindsey wrote this! There was nothing to this story... To me it read like, and then they, and then she, and then he... the characters were ALL 2 dimensional. Was it even believable that the hero really fell in love with the heroine at the end? I really didn't care, since it read more like a manual than a romance. Disappointment doesn't begin to describe my reaction to this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Sadly, this is the most disappointing of the Malory novels. I found the characters undeveloped and rather boring. Johanna Lindsey's previous Malory novels were much more exciting and the characters were very likeable despite their flaws. In this latest installment, Drew was mostly morose, brooding and not very likeable at all and I found Gabrielle shallow and silly while the dialogue between her and Drew not very exciting. The best parts of the story included the characters from her previous novels like James, Tony and Georgiana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard","review":"I was very disappointed with Johanna Lindsey and this book. I've read all of the other Mallory novels and was looking forward to the excitment of another regency romance with strong-willed heroines and the men who love them. What I found was a silly girl and a rushed plot line. The writing was more like an outline and did not draw me into the story. I would love to read more about the Mallory's and will probably take the chance and hope Johanna Lindsey takes the time to write a good book the next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I'm a big fan of all of her books and found this one really interesting.

First the \\"hero\\" tries to take advantage of the heroine/victim after getting her drunk. Then later in the story he rapes her in her sleep.The disgusting part is the writer excuses his behavior by having the victim take the blame for the rape. Then he chains her to a wall. I was nauseous and had to stop listening.I will never buy another Johanna Lindsey book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captive of My Desires","review":"I have read almost all of Johanna Lindsey's books and really have never been let down, until now. This one is a must miss!! The plot is unbelievably boring. The charactors are dismilly underdeveloped, and the love scenes are luke-warm at best. The back and forth banter between the Malorys and the Andersons is beyond boring. I found myself skimming through this book just to get through it. If this is what we can expect from Ms. Lindsey she needs to take a long break and refocus."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to Lindsey's writing?","review":"I have been a fan of Johanna Lindsey ever since I was in HS.

Gabby is out for revenge.... but what will it cost her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable but not recommended. I didn't admire or enjoy the heroine.","review":"She had no qualities to make the story interesting. I found no interesting reasons for Drew to want to give up his bachelor life for her. There was also nothing special about Drew, causing me to see why she would want to marry him. This was about two people who were good looking, who saw each other and then immediately loved each other. There was no build up of interest or the growing of a relationship.CAUTION SPOILER: I hated that she stole his ship from him. I don't care what her reasons were.Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting: early 1800s London and the high seas. Copyright: 2006.

COMD sees a return of her previous writing. Not quite on par with what she used to write but certainly better than some of the books over the last few years. I look forward to reading her latest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I generally enjoy Lindsey's novels, but this one was terrible! I can't believe it was even written by her - she must have churned it out too quickly. The dialogue was boring and at times absurd, and the storyline disjointed. The basic plot was fine, and could have been quite exciting. And there were some humorous additions, such as the smart-talking parrot. But so many elements seemed to be just tossed in without any conclusion or flow: Avery's appearance as a villain, Wilbur's defection, among others. I can't believe I made it through the entire book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Don't bother","review":"Wow - but not in a good way. Possibly the worst romance novel I've ever read, and that is saying something. Stick to Lindsay's earlier Malory novels. Most of them are delightful and worth revisiting. \\"Captive\\" skims over parts of the story that could be exciting and dwells on the boring, predictable and outright unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh so disappointing . . .","review":"I was very disappointed in this latest installment of the Malory family. I loved the previous Malory novels, but this one really lacked in development and likeability. In this book, Drew seems more of a cad than romantic hero. He doesn't seem much like the fun loving Drew who had been introduced in the previous novels. The hereoine, \\"Gabby\\", isn't likeable either. The characters just don't seem very believable, and the relationship seems strained to me.The best part of the book is that you will revisit your favorite characters from before, like Georgina and James Malory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"The majority of this book felt like it was rehashing stories from her previous books. There was barely any room left for an original story... and that part was confusing and poorly written.If the author can't think of anything new to write about the Mallory family, she should pick a new subject. I miss the stories she used to provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I knew by the second chapter, I should have waited for the paperback. (Much cheaper} As a long time fan of Johanna Lindsey. I was bored, story was dull, characters were simple and somewhat idiotic. Not her best at all and I will have doubts if will buy her next. Sorry Johanna this fan has jumped ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short but negative","review":"This book did nothing for me and I recommend that you not waste your money on it. It is written for the simple-minded reader with not much excitement at all. Too bad that Ms. Lindsey has fallen so low in her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a typical Malory Novel","review":"Like everyone else I could not wait for this book to come out. I was so excited because I loved the Malory family. This was disappointing because of the focus of the book. I would have preferred it had been longer if that meant it would go into more detail about the family. In Gentle Rogue you first meet Red, the female Pirate. She is reintroduced here but with no exchange with James or George. Also I did not care for the young pirates' interest in George. I was truly disappointed, and hope her next Malory Novel is a lot better. There was also little talk about the rest of the family and of Drew's brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Mallory??? Please no more!!","review":"I should have given this book a one star, but I actually finished it. If it was that bad, why did I finish it?? I don't really know. So, I will justify myself by giving it a two stars. I think the Mallory novels were good for about three books (Regina, Anthony, and James) after that it just becomes a lot of repetition. I used to LOVE Johanna Lindsay - but I just think some authors only have so many books \\"in them\\". Maybe she is all written out. It is too bad, especially now that her books are being released as hardboooks. It is a lot of money to spend on a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has Johanna gone","review":"I didn't even finish this novel. The characters are flat. Their emotions toward each other are horribly written, or non-existant in the case of the hero. The plot is more suited to a novella that she strung out over waaayyy too many pages. I honestly thought I had mistakenly picked up the wrong author. All I can say is, \\"Wow. Where is Johanna Lindsey?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"Usually, when reading J.Lindsey's books, I fall \\"in love\\" with the hero. Not so with Drew. I did not even like him much and there is no way I would want him to be my man.. I hated that he bought necklaces for women in each port, I disliked how he so thoughtlessly 'ruined' her and repeatedly insulted her. He practically rapes her. He just does not seem like an honorable, hero type like I'm used to getting from Lindsey. It is a so-so read at best and my least favorite of her works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malory family novels used to captivate","review":"Unfortunately this addition to the family story does not captivate. There was little character development, the story line seemed to be hurried along and was quickly and easily resolved. The romance was flat, I felt like it was a forgotten line in the book and Ms. Lindsey had to throw the resolution in at the last minute. I bought this book, after reading it I decided it was not worth the full price of a hard back and returned it for a refund. I'll be checking Ms. Lindsey's books out from the library in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captive of my desires not","review":"I usually love Johanna Lindsey but I couldn't even finish this book. The hero bothered me till no end. He was mean and rude to the heroin through out most of the book. And the heroin, I just couldn't identify with, if anyone was ever that rude to me the way the hero was I wouldn't happy with her planed revenge. In most of Mrs. Lindsey books I am hooked until the last page and I feel the romance all the way through. With this book it was just so bad, I now read five reviews before I order any of her books. I will have to say that I do love the most of her other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Customer Service an A+","review":"I am very happy with your customer service. I did not mean to infer that I was unhappy with you. I was disappointed in the fact that I received my book later then the other book I ordered.

Thank you so much for your excellent customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Choppy, Choppy, Choppy\\"","review":"I have read past Malory books and the writing in this book was just too choppy.

However, the story and plot was a bit boring and corny."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Doll That Came Apart","review":"I gave this to my five year old granddaughter who is our Tinkerbell fan.

After all, what is Tink without her wings in the mind of a five year old?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the movie","review":"Hammer films did a film version of this novel. I believe it was shot under the title INCENSE FOR THE DAMNED but that is not the title of the copy I saw. The book is written in a sort of \\"British Drawing Room\\" style. Fans of old school horror will enjoy the book but those into more modern horror fiction will no doubt be bored. It takes forever to get anywhere but once it does it has a few moments of frisson. I recommend the movie which is absolutely a relic of the 60s \\"Swinging London\\" scene and features horror legends Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Games for Ps1","review":"Iv'e played many Games on PS1 but this is my Favorite.

The arranger(s) had probably hoped that by replacing the original instruments [voice, violin, piano, etc.] of the original music with the flute, it would give all the works a new skin and dimension/insight. Unfortunately, it didn't work quite as planned.

Poppin' wheelies over cars, pounding your competitors off their bikes at 130mph. Wow.Jailbreak gives you several different modes to play: The escaped con, the cop, or the dual player, fun as heck sidecar feature. -They're all a blast.Bike to bike combat is exquisite, requiring just enough skill to feel proud when you pull up beside somebody and beat them silly, but not so much as to drive you insane. What you say? You want wrecks? Jailbreak's got 'em to spare.Wiping out in this game is half the fun. Slides flips tumbles rolls and human flight can happen at any turn.-I've spent almost as much time laughing with friends at wrecks as I've spent winning races.Alone or with other players, this game is pure, unadulterated fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Road Rash Since the Sega Genesis!","review":"This version of Road Rash is the one to get. The racing feels realistic, and the races are challenging, but not impossible. This game has great fighting between bikers too, with a huge variety of weapons including a tazer stun gun that the cops use. The race courses vary from mountains to seaside to city driving, which keeps it interesting.While there are pedestrians that can be run over (with entertaining screams), there are no animals. It was always fun to run over a deer and jump up into the air in Road Rash 3 for the Sega Genesis. Its just too bad that they got rid of the mooing cows in this one.This game has great replay value, because the racing feels so realistic. It is fun to race the courses repeatedly, even without following the \\"plot\\" of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouch!! This game clubs down any other","review":"This game is so cool. What could be bad about riding a motorcycle and trying to knock other people off their bikes? That's right. Nothing!! The story line of this game is about your friend is stuck in jail and you eventually need to free him by gaining respect by your fellow posse members. But this is road rash. Does their really need to be a story line to be fun. There are a huge variety of weapons like clubs, lead pipes, baseball bats, 2x4s,pepper spray, taser, cattle prod, chains and much more. Also new to this game in the fighting aspect is there are tons of combos (At least 45 different ones) that do massive damage. This is a must have for anybody who likes fighting or racing games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jailbreak is great!","review":"My mom even liked this game and she never plays video games. She enjoyed controlling the side car passenger,Punt, who bashes any bikers who come by on the right side during the two-player version of this game. The side car two-player option is the most fun. Great sound effects, hilarious dialogue, and lots of fighting. You have to know how to ride and fight with this version.

I keep trying to be optimistic about her, but this book finally sealed the deal. No more Victoria Alexander for me. All her books are so formulaic and cookie cutter. It seems I've read all these words before. I could barely make it to the midway point. Her male protagonist, Marcus Holcroft, is a dull bore. There's nothing exciting even lurking in his past. Gwendolyn Townsend, our female protagonist, is slightly more interesting. But, the plot just didn't keep my attention. And, most importantly, Ms. Alexander needs to take a college course on how to write dialogue. Very ho-hum. The main characters might have kept my interest more if they had some snappy dialogue. All in all, very disappointing. Don't bother spending the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"This is the first Victoria Alexander book I've ever made it through - and believe me it was a struggle. The plot was okay and the characters were okay but that's about the best I can say about it - just okay. I thought the dialog was too modern and the explanations given by certain characters to explain their behavior were [weak]. It seemed to me that these [weak] excuses were inserted to give the story a more suspenseful edge to it, but overall I thought they were silly. I couldn't believe how oh so insightful the hero, Marcus Holcroft was. Ladies! We all know how dense men can be but Marcus H. seemed to always know what was going on in Gwendolyn's mind.If you are a fan, I know I won't change your mind, but if you are new to Victoria Alexander books, you may want to borrow her books from a library instead of buying them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful!","review":"1800's Great BrittanLOVE WITH THE PROPER HUSBAND is a very enjoyable book to the Effington Family series, actually one of the best so far!

I used it this past weekend to texture the walls and ceiling in my master bedroom. I have a 60 gallon air compressor with 6hp motor. The one thing I don't like about this gun, and probably would have went with a different product if I had known was when you turn on the air valve, air continuously blows and when you pull the trigger mud is released into the air stream. So you can't just turn it on and flow air as needed by trigger pull. I can't imagine someone using this hopper gun with a small compressor as it gave mine a decent work out. At first I thought there was a problem with the gun, so I took it apart to make sure something wasn't missing or not functioning. But it looked like it was set up properly.

Chemicals just didn't do the trick. When I saw this item advertised, I decided to give it a try. It was a great decision. Using the steamer, along with a good scraper, the impossible job became simple. It has a long tubing that allowed me to sit the water container on the floor, and easily reach the top of the wall with the steam applicator. The water container is large enough that you can work for a long period of time before having to add water. This product did a great job and I chalk it up as money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I am pregnant and saw one of these used on HGTV, so I thought it would be a great non-chemical solution for me to strip the wallpaper in my daughter's bathroom. Sadly, I had a miserable experience. I followed the instructions \\"to a tee,\\" gave it all the time it needed to get going, used a professional scrapper, and I made sure to score the wall well. Including its 15 minute start up time, it took me a total of 30 minutes to clear a 2x2ft area of wallpaper. Damage was done to the drywall because of the drips, and I had to hold the steamer in one spot for over two minutes to get the wallpaper damp enough for removal. Maybe my device was defective or the wallpaper was too well applied; after my experience, I returned it and would not recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superior product","review":"The Wagner Power Steamer is a great product.

It worked great. I just got it back out to do the bath. It ran for about 1 hour then quit. I'm pretty sure the heating element is bad. Of course, it's out of warranty now so I'm screwed. This unit ran long enough to do one room. Very unhappy with the quality and performance of this unit. I strongly recommend you look for a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've got to have it","review":"All of the wallpaper in my house is OLD and PAINTED OVER, so removal is no easy task. When I tackled the first room, I rented a big, bulky professional grade steamer from the local machinery rental store. What a horrible experience. Yes, I got it all off, but it took 30+ hours. The weekly rental was $50. After reading reviews on this steamer I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did. Everything is lightweight and so easy to move around. The hose is very long. If you put hot water in it, then it heats up quicker than the specs say and the steam lasts longer than the specs say. Maybe the wallpaper is different in this room, maybe fewer layers of paint, I don't know, but this removal job is going much faster. I'm mad that I wasted $50 on the rented one the first time around. This is my best home improvement purchase in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little worker","review":"When I first opened the package it didn't look like much to me.

One disadvantage: Wagner needs to offer an attachment so that you can get into tighter areas where the included steam plate can't fit. Overall, I am pleased with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT!","review":"We recently purchased a \\"fixer upper\\" which is a fancy way of saying a home where every wall surface is covered with 50 year old wall paper and every floor is covered with shag carpet. So, while the steamer couldn't help us with the carpet, it was a lifesaver with the wallpaper. We encountered every type of wallpaper known to mankind and this steamer was able to handle all of it. We got much longer out of each cycle than we expected and the start up time was less if we put hot water in to start. Also, considering how much it would cost to rent a steamer, this was a bargain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work very well for me.","review":"I ordered this for a big weekend project tackling my daughter's ugly papered kitchen walls. Opened it, It looked fine, threw out all of the packaging and took it over to her house. Unfortunately the base was cracked and water leaked out everywhere. We tried to patch it up to get it to hold water, (we were determined to get this paper down) but my daughter, holding wet towels against the wall, and them scraping, accomplished far more than I did with this steamer. My caution about this product is that you inspect it carefully when it arrives, BEFORE you need to use it and throw away the packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Timesaver","review":"The steamer makes wallpaper scrape away like butter.

I rented one from a hardware store for about 30 bucks and it was beat up, heavy, dirty and didn't work nearly as well as this thing. I think I paid $58 with free shipping.

The entire rest of the room took me 1 HOUR with the steamer!As much as I love Amazon, I do have to say that it's only $49.99 at Home Depot and comes with the smaller head for tight spaces. I would recommend checking out your local Home Depot before buying it here, just to see if you can get a better price with the extra head."},{"rating":"2","title":"work saver","review":"I had started taking down a room of wallpaper only to find out it was not going to come down.

Well worth the price, plus it stores away very nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I have used the Wagner Power Steamer for 2 different types of wallpaper removal jobs, and I was amazed at how fast it worked each time.

I bought mine not to remove wallpaper, but to help in removing old linoleum and adhesive.

Stop giving yourself blisters with the hammer and scraper!Like others, I priced rentals and they were more than the cost of this steamer and huge. All in all, a great little machine to have around the house for various projects. It's very simple, and if you are realistic about what you're buying (this is not a commerical/industrial steamer) then you'll be pleased as punch with this steamer.I'm almost kind of bummed that I don't have any wallpaper to steam ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steamer review","review":"The Wagner wallpaper steamer works very well.

Be careful about the steam - boy, does it burn! Also, don't just drop the hose on your floor with the steam coming out or else it'll warp your linoleum.

We tried different ways to get it off and they didn't work. I searched Amazon and found this steamer. Wow! It is making it so easy! You fill it with water, turn it on and place the plastic plate against the wall for about 10 seconds and the wall paper practically falls off! The plastic plate thing is about the size of a sheet of paper, so it takes a while to do a whole room, but it is well worth it. For being only a 1-gallon tank you would think you would have to keep filling it, but you don't. One tank lasts quite a while. I would highly recommend this steamer!Wagner Power Products 282018 1-Gallon Wallpaper Steamer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does A Great Job","review":"I used this product the day I received it to remove wallpaper borders in a bathroom. The hose was long enough so that I could keep the steamer on the floor and still reach up around the ceiling. It really made the stripping job go very quickly.

Obviously, there are questions of real cause and effect, insanity, reality, etc. The movie is generally well done, good production values, high image quality, etc., such that it feels high-ish budget (and that's a compliment). The mood throughout is creepy, and almost relentlessly so, never abating to anything else. The problem though, is that the film is never really scary. Sequences occur in which I think the director intended to elicit a scare among the audience, but it fails to do so in every scene. Not sure exactly why, but the climactic build just didn't work, and I do scare fairly easily. Bottom line, its a worthy rental, just don't expect an earth shattering horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame mirror","review":"Very simple. The movie was ok, but the copy was like a good vcr.

By appearances and performances alone one would think this movie's budget was much more than the shoestring budget it probably had. Lisa Vidal is exotic and interesting as a bored housewife moving into a new home. When she takes a photo in a mirror, she soon realizes there are abnormalities in the glass reflections. She's tense throughout, but there is no tension. She's rattled enough to frantically search for, and compulsively suck on, numerous cigarettes. But it's never really that bad. Her limp, and stereotypical skeptical, husband is no more than a seat filler.It's one of those movies that has a lot of unrealized potential that would have been better in more competent hands. As it is, however, there are no scares, zero dread, and a feeling that it's much longer than it really is...which is not a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Dark Mirror","review":"The movie has alot of twists and was very enjoyable.

But this one sets it apart from the others.It hasthe usual racing game setup. Like you have to unlock cars and tracks. But what DOES set it apart from others is that you can get chased by the police in a mode called 'Hot Pursuit Mode.' You may also to choose to be the cops. Once you arrest ten speeders within the time limit, you unlock more varieties of cop cars. Like, you may start out with being able to play the BMW5 cop car, but soon, you could unlock the Porche 911 cop car. One thing that I find really neat, is the fact that when you drive the speed limit, and stay in the right lanes, the cops will never start to chase you. The graphics are exellent, the sound is superb, and the gameplay is fabulous! I would highly recommend this game to racing fans, and even to those who don't like racing.

Graphics are solid and driving conditions (brakes, skidding, and even damages from crashing) are very realistic. I not only like the fact that you can choose a number of cars, but also the fact that you can customize and upgrade your car depending on the amount of cash you have in your account (another realistic point). Several different driving modes (Hot Pursuit, test drive, tournaments, etc.) will keep you interested in this game for a long time.

Most of the chapters jump from one part of the main character's life to another. This makes the book semi-difficult to follow. In addition, throughout the entire book, the main character, who is the only narrator, is never given a name. The book starts out being slow and the point of the story is not understood until the end. However, the end was done very nicely and portrays that the story is about a young man that finds himself and overcomes his guilt and sorrow that he has felt for years due to losing the two people he cares about most- his brother and father. Winter in the Blood also demonstrates the difficulties of life that a Native American must face and how a person of this background can learn not only to accept, but also to be proud of this heritage."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY bias","review":"Though informative, this book is VERY partial to MPLA's organization.

I couldn't find a recording by the band (turns out they haven't released anything), so I thought I'd pick up this recording to see what I thought of Brazilian music. It's quite fun. It has a wide range of styles, from what I'd have to call Brazilian rap, to zydeco, to Paul Simon-esque tunes. It's very rich from the percussion side of things. Track 6 bugs me, as the singers voices sound artificially high-pitched. Virtually every other tune is pleasant to listen to.

I know, way too young to understand, right? Wrong. I went into an old fashioned book store and bought every single John Saul and Dean Koontz book they had in stock (literally, no joke, they were on sale for a dollar each). And out of all of them, this one ties with 'Shadows' by Saul as my favorite book of all time.It is an incredibly haunting tale of a girl's worst nightmares coming to life. I haven't read it in years because I lost my copy, but I still have an image of the scene between Keri and the family dog. I don't want to give awqay any spoilers, but if you've read it, you most likely know what I mean. And I still have nightmares sometimes about a girl with no hand chasing me down the beach.Honestly, words cannot describe the depth of this novel.

They have very little vibration and provide excellent visibility around our 26' 5th wheel. The only downside on the mirrors is that the passenger side mirror has too much magnification for my taste. It's very difficult to judge how far a vehicle is behind you. That's not an issue if you don't tend to pass, but with my 2003 GMC Duramax/Allison I put the hammer down and walk right up most hills and frequently pass slower traffic.

I attempted another call standing right next to the base unit and I STILL could not hear anything.

The driving is really floaty and bogus. The sound effects aren't anything special either. On the upside, pursuit mode is a blast. Unlike GT Interactive's Driver, the cops in NFS3 use intelligent strategy, boxing in the player with multiple units, or forcing him off the road rather than simply ramming with brute force.

Along the way, they coach each other about family members and women. This is just one of countless films where white men and black men learn to cooperate and like each other through sports. This movie has no nudity and does not mention any sex between prisoners. The film is full of the white character making all these corny but hilarious, \\"Guess what I did with your wife last night?\\" jokes. The funniest thing about this movie, which is supposed to take place in the late 60s or early 70s, was that every person with an Afro obviously just went to the five-and-dime wig shop and bought the phoniest Afro they could find. I enjoy prison flicks, that's why I liked this.

I'll use on of these sticks to play against my son, and it works perfectly fine for me as well (5'11\\").The adjustable Franklin sticks are way too thin and break very easily. These babies will last. Probably forever. And that's all you're really looking for with an indoor hockey stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for kids","review":"this stick is only 36 inches and it works great for little kids.

So for the show it is easily a 5 star rating but this complete series product to me is ridiculous because of the price. you play $90+ and yet you get nothing extra for the money. you can buy all four seasons right now individually and pay only $57. As far as i can tell there is no exclusive bonus features to buying the show as a \\"collection.\\" Once again to re-iterate this show is an amazing show and is deserving of 5 stars but this specific \\"collection\\" in my eyes is a waste of money since it is nearly twice as expensive as buying individual seasons and therefore gets a two star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing IT Crowd","review":"The IT Crowd has to be the funniest British series ever.

Positively enjoyable. A show you could certainly watch many times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply awesome","review":"this serie is just amazing.

However, one might reasonably expect more from this video than the same video over and over and over with nothing more than a change in music played in the background.What a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"Even to this aerial view and space buff and classical music enthusiast, this product with its minimal and repeated ad nauseum video loop is, I am sorry to say, a total waste of your money. A big zero ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh well....","review":"I've watched hours of space shuttle video in real time. I was hoping for something like what I'd seen on the NASA channel. It wasn't to be. Personally I prefer to see recognizable land masses instead of interesting cloud formations. Also the colors of landmasses were often unnatural. It isn't far into the video that you will realize, \\"hey! I saw that earlier\\". It isn't an hour of video, it is an hour filled with watching the same disappointing short video over and over. Actually, the DVD was worth the price for the music alone. The music is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Buyer beware. I expected an hour of HD images from space. Instead, a viewer gets a blast off sequence and a 10-15-minute loop of images from space repeated four times. I also wanted \\"a view from space\\"--not long, hand-held shots of the shuttle's empty cargo bay with a shaky moon in the background. Also, there are distracting blobs, spots, and smears on the camera lens and on the viewing portals. The fourth time you watch the Sahara (or whatever desert it is) through what looks a big bug splat on a windshield, one really wishes that the video was a rental instead of a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving movie","review":"Images and videos are, that's true, breathtaking. High-definition from there is gorgeous but it's not 60 minutes of unseen footage, but only 10 minutes in a loop, sometimes with different color filters, so you're buying 10 minutes of space views, amongst which 3' are the liftoff part. Pictures quality is great (taking in account where and how it has been shot) but it's not worth that price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff!!! This is not a good purchase!","review":"This DVD is a ripoff. It only contains 14 minutes of video, which loops over and over again.Then the soundtracks don't correspond to what's on the cover. They mix a bunch of music played in a classical style and call it Bach.For less money you can get the Blu-Ray disc Blue Planet - filmed in Imax with much higher resolution, Walter Cronkite narration and over one hour of unrepeated, unlooping high resolution video from space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great picture, lack of content.","review":"I agree with the previous posts that the picture quality is excellent and the music is also very good. The only thing I don't like is that it is only about 10 minutes of footage which repeats, and repeats, and repeats... It is good but I was expecting something a little different with city views, night views, or atleast something recognizable. I haven't figured out where any of the shots are from yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Content Length is Short and Quality is Moderate.","review":"Loops the same video at least 4 times (perhaps 10-13 minutes of footage). I saw this footage in a Discover HD documentary about the space station Discovery HD version was stitched together a little bit more nicely and they corrected some of the exposure problems.This footage suffers from occasional exposure control issues as the brightness of the earth changes rapidly from desert to snow/clouds. The footage is frequently unsteady and the windows need to be cleaned on the station.The music is a good collection of freely available classical content. Eight sound tracks at about 55 minutes each. I suspect the video is also freely available open source NASA footage. Music quality is good. video clarity is HD quality.I would have been more satisfied with a price point of about $10 for this content. At nearly $20 the footage length and exposure quality detract from the overall experience significantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not One Hour of Video","review":"I purchased this video expecting stunning views from space, and I got that. But it was not \\"one hour\\" as advertized, rather it was a 3:45 launch sequence followed by 14:53 of original footage from space, followed by three repeats of about 14:30 each from the space view footage. Despite the claim in another user review, this repetition has nothing to do with consecutive orbits, it is merely re-use of the same footage. Even the most casual observer can notice the repetition of such distinctive scenes as a zoom-in on Mt Fuji, or the dumping of the urine holding tank. I would have given this disc a five-star rating if it had the promised hour of original video. As it is, the crystal-clear views from space and the 8 hours of great 5.1 surround music warrant a four-star rating. As a relatively new Amazon customer, I have found by experience that it pays to check out the customer reviews, as they will tell you things the promotional information will not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I Expected","review":"I compared this camera to the five others owned by members of my family and found it to be on par with the best of them and significantly less expensive than most.

A good thing: its very nice LCD and menu interface. Two bad things: USB seems no working on my Intel D815EEAAL motherboard, and it renders awfull colors and details when trying to take pictures of flowers and plants (that's why I bought it). Thou its macro feature is fine, it seems the camera cannot balance colors when the composition is very colorful. It has customizable and automatic white balance option that behave weird, and your setting is not saved on the preferences, it changes to \\"automatic white balance\\" each time you turn it on. I think its a great camera for fancy pictures, portraits or any image with diversified colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor battery storage","review":"This camera look good in the page, but it's big and the manufacture is poor.

I've shot a good 600 pictures from a 120 degree Arizona summer to a -22 degree Massachusetts Nor'easter. It's been bumped, knocked, and dropped and still takes pictures as good as when it came out of the box.The use is simple enough for even a manager (like myself) to use. Most of the time I just point and shoot and the pictures come out just fine. I like being able to manually adjust the exposure because I find myself inside and not allowed to use the flash. Most of these indoor pic's come out fine.I'm about to graduate to a higher pixel camera but will pass my faithful Kodak onto my son. I just hope I can find another unit as tough and reliable as my 280."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works just like it should!","review":"I have owned 3 or 4 of these cameras, my first one was quite by accident, received it in payment for driving for someone.

It was interesting to photograph all around this boarding school, many things had changed, but many were similar or the same.

Opp (thoseopps@yahoo.com)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great camera but could be improved","review":"This camera takes very good pictures and by itself is very easy to use. However, the linking software of the PC side is not very user friendly. One complaint is the optical zoom on the camera is a bit weak.Having the rechargeable battery and charger included, fast USB link, and both PAL and NTSC output format was what made me decided to buy it since I like traveling overseas. Otherwise I was strongly considering the Olympus and Nikon models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera-- but Adobe Problems","review":"I love this camera! Shipped with USB cable and the transfers are super fast. Photo quality is excellent, and I was taking photos only minutes out of the box. The trouble started when I loaded the Adobe PhotoDeluxe 1.0 that shipped with the camera-- I can't seem to transfer photos to email, and frankly, this is the major need of the camera for me. In fact, when I try to transfer to email, the program locks up and so does my computer, which was 192 megs of RAM and Pentium II at 350. So, buy the camera if you want ease of use and great photos, but watch out for the Adobe software. If I can't get this fixed, it's all going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Question","review":"Does anyone know if this camera has a timer setting so you can set it up and take pictures automatically?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed in the DC280","review":"I've had the DC280 for a little over a week and am VERY disappointed. Maybe I'm doing something wrong?, but I've yet to take a photo that resulted in a high quality image. In particular, shots taken at medium distance are fuzzy, grainy, and generally unsatisfactory. I'm just totally perplexed. Everything I had read said that the images were excellent---but mine are just miserable. I've spent hours studying the manual and reading the photo tips on Kodak's web site - but nothing seems to help. I gave the camera a \\"one star\\" rating, which, under the circumstances, is very generous. Maybe it's a defective item?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great point and shoot pictures!","review":"After several months of research and a friend with a Kodak 265, I decided to buy the 280. I am very pleased with the overall quality of the pictures. The red eye feature does a better job then the point and shoot 35 mm I had before.Battery life is better than I had expected, I have taken over 200 pictures, and only charged the batteries once. The camera came with a charger and one set of rechargeable batteries, so there have been no extra costs.Picture quality seems great so far. I have ordered prints online from my digital pictures, and they look great, even the 5x7.The zoom is a little lacking, so if you use a zoom lens all the time, this may not be the camera for you, but Kodak does make an adaptor to go to 4x.I am very pleased with my purchase here on Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"This toy was given to my dog by my sister.

This is a fun movie to share with your kids. One scene a kid pulls on his prized PF Flyers ands my son asks \\"What are PF Flyers?\\" \\"The Air Jordan's of my day\\". Adults will not be bored. The humor captures the strong imaginations of kids. Kids love the story and how these friends solve their own problems.

I watched this at school when it was raining one day when our team wasn't able to go on a field trip because it was raining. At first I liked it but then, the next day I started thinking about that Old Man Merkel story from the 1940s and when the gang chewed tobacco at the carnival and threw up while they were on that spinning ride. That part was scary and got stuck in my head certain nights and I was sometimes afraid to fall asleep. And now, sometimes when I enter the computer room, I remember the movie or when I hear the song Brother Louie-Stories which is a good song but that song reminds me of this movie.

The setting is a happier, more innocent, pre-Woodstock America that maybe never existed except in our memories and imaginations, but that I think we all can't help longing for. The story is about the adventures of a ragtag group of kids who play baseball together in an abandoned lot. It does a great job of capturing the essence of the way kids think and see the world. Sure, it's not a genius work of art, or a deep social commentary, but it's pure fun and even inspiring in a strange, inexplicable sort of way. Aside from a little bit of mild profanity, there is nothing objectionable in it. So, if you're looking for a good, fun, family view, or just a light hearted pick me up, this one's a keeper.

He talked so much about that great movie with the big dog that I finally sent him one of his own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic film.","review":"I remember being a 7 year old kid back in 1993 and watching this movie and when your a kid who loves baseball and plays baseball with your friends this automatically becomes one of your favorites.From the cast of characters of kids who play in the sandlot, to the story of the monster dog behind the fence, to the rivarly with the well established little league team.To chewing tobacco to trying to catch the attention of a hot lifeguard and to a shy kid who is just trying to fit in.The Sandlot is a classic film and 12 years later i can still watch this movie and enjoy it and remember how it was to be a kid.So if you want a great film with sentimental value and humour and especially if you have kids who love baseball purchase this!--The Opinionated One Has Spoken"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another favorite","review":"This movie is right up there with \\"Stand by Me.\\" As a 20somethingyear old young man, I fondly recall my childhood fascination with creative insults, lewd jokes, baseball and trivia, and just the innocence of being a young boy and new to town. This film rekindles those memories for me, through the recounting of a whimsical fantasy experience involving an oversized bull mastiff, that while contrived in some ways, accurately presents the situation in a way that kids that age would see things. This mirrors how I experienced the world as a boy, too, and there's nothing quite satisfying like really being able to relate to characters in a film.There isn't much else to say that hasn't already been said, but if you enjoy gilded nostalgia about childhood, especially boyhood, baseball, and summer, you can probably relate to this film, and will get swept away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful tale of adolescent struggles","review":"Scotty moves to a new home during the worst time of the year for a kid to make a move; summer. Since he hasn't been to the new school, he's had no time to make friends. He desperately wants to fit in, and like so often happens, gets himself into trouble with the effort.I especially like a scene in a treehouse where a spooky tale is told while the kids make Smores. I'm sure this movie will bring back many fond memories for a lot of older viewers and be an enjoyable flick for younger movie watchers as well.Chrissy K.

Besides the cool movie the casting was excellant. I have a lot of favorite characters, but my favorite is definitly Benny. Mike Vitar was perfect for the part. I love him. The people playing the part are really good because they fit their part. Who ever casted you did a great job. I think that this movie will always stay with me.

We went around and around with this issue until we bought this gadget and put it on our phone line. We have not had ONE problem since, and we were getting 20+ disconnects from DSL a day beforehand. The phones are GREAT. The problem is the Bellsouth DSL filters they supply and the way they are used, is not very effective.

I got it for Christmas a few years later and it became and has been my favorite album for 20 years. The combination of Debussy's composition with Tomita's arrangement really paints beautiful pictures with haunting yet sweet emotions. This music evokes real images in my mind, and he is very tasteful in his use of what I call comedy (in Arabesque No. 1, for example, I imagine a boy and a rabbit-blob playing and sliding in the snow). I have other arrangements of Debussy's music on standard instruments and have listened to other works by Tomita and neither is as good as this one. Thank you Mr. Tomita, this fine work has provided me many hours of pleasant listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the worlds most beautiful music.","review":"I bought this on a record years ago.

I loved it and wore the record out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electronic Debussy","review":"This CD was purchased because it was not available on Itunes at least at the time.

Not only does her book explain the workings of this dreadful disease, it also has a supplementary booklet that has FAQs to help parents with any questions their children may have.Unfortunately, Dr. Frantti doesn't have the benefit of Ms. Shriver's \\"star power\\" in terms of getting publicity about \\"Grandma's Cobwebs,\\" but her book is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for kids","review":"I wanted some sort of book or story that would help my two grandsons understand why \\"granpa\\" was so angry sometimes.

In this book Prince Corum travels too a different plane to try and end the hegemony of The Queen of Swords, and thus save his own plane from the forces of Chaos. With him is the eternal companion of Champions,Jhary-a-conel and his winged cat.I don't know if this story was originally written for a magazine format, but it certainly reads like it. This is probably the weakest of the swords trilogy, and like all three books in the sword trilogy, the pace is breakneck. One has no time to appreciate the dangers Corum finds himself in, before he is immediately rescued and moved on to the next predicament."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK.

It lets you know the facts about how crooked our justice system is, and how powerful our government is. I would like to say \\"Thank you\\" to Mr. Klaber for writing such an enlightening book.

This book is a must read, five star acomplishment, and possibly one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desire Bound","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read by Thea Devine. It is so boring and convoluted I couldn't even finish it. I have tried twice. I agree with another reader it is so fast paced you never know where you are. Also the characters are weak and the sex scenes are poorly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sex was great but the plot and story line very weak.","review":"By Desire Bound left me feeling lost and not knowing in which direction to go. The plot was weak and confusing. I have read other books by Ms.Devine and was spellbound by her natural ability to tell a story(a very steamy story). To say that I was disappointed is hard for me because I love to read paranormal romances, but while reading this one I could not suspend my disbelief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steamy as always, but what happened to the plot?","review":"Thea Devine used to write sexy psychologically interesting novels that introduced some unusual characters with fantastical plots and settings. Although I certainly believe in willing suspension of disbelief Ms. Devine has gone too far and provided too little plot to back up her wild wanderings. Pengellis is found naked in a brothel with no sight and no memory. He regains and loses his sight for seemingly arbitrary and ill explained reasons. Darcie strikes me as a poorly formed character. Her relationship with her husband is bizarre and only barely alluded to. The elements of fantasy and horror that permeate this story are not what turn me off. She has successfully used them in other books, but not this one! They are wildly overblown here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steamy eroticism is NOT romance!!!","review":"The sex in this book is the steamiest I've ever seen. . . and I've read Bertrice Small and Susan Johnson! But the word \\"love\\" is only mentioned on the last page; the rest of the book is pervaded by a desire by both parties to enslave the other with lust (the title is an apt one). The characters are admitted adventurers, both USING the other--she needs him to find the priceless diamond, he needs her for eyes when he is mysteriously blind. The plot is thinly devised to bind the sex scenes together. . . I found myself skipping through from sex scene to sex scene to see what new perversion comes to light. . . like an adolescent reading a dirty book! Needless to say, this book is NOT a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexy, but vague & confusing plot.","review":"This was the first book I've read by Ms. Devine. I was intrigued by it although you definitely have to suspend belief and be able to constantly switch your train of thought to keep up. I plan to read others by her to compare. I enjoyed the erotic portion, felt it was originally done in parts although excessive to the point of ridiculous in places. I felt like telling the herione to \\"take a (real) bath already\\". The supernatural element quality was mixed and confusing although promising in sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desire Bound Where?","review":"I have read many historical romances and this is one I wouldn't recommend. I picked it up just because of the name Thea Devine, but was disappointed. I had a hard time finishing it. It could have been good, their \\"adventure\\" spans the middle east, including India and Russia but it felt empty. The \\"adventure\\" was stupid. The characters were empty also. Lots of \\"love making\\" but the scenes were written poorly, usually rushed and without sensuality. Try another Thea Devine book is all I really have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightmare Mountain","review":"My favorite book I read this year was Nightmear Mountain. My first reason was because it was suspencful. You did not know who was trying to kill Karen or if anyone was going to kill her and you didn't know what would happen next. Next, I liked the characters. They seemed to have different personalities and I just liked the characters in general. Last, it had a good setting. I liked how they described it in the book and how it was in the mountains. In Conclusion, it was a good book because it was suspencful, it has good characters, and I liked the setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"I really like this book.

I got through 3 episodes and turned it off. The shows themselves are animated ok but the voices of the characters and the plots behind the episodes can only be described as excruciatingly painful. I mean the 2nd or 3rd episode had some \\"ninja koopa\\" theme. That has absolutely nothing to do with super mario brothers 3.

Super Show) only had baddies from Super Mario Bros. 1 and 2. This show, however introduced the seven Koopalings, though it is never mentioned who their mother is or what happened to her. In the game it was all right, but on the show it didn't translate quite as well. Nonetheless, this is still a fun show, and a must for any Mario fan. The Koopalings did add humor to some of the episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mario Bros 3: finally on DVD!","review":"though i do agree the milli vanilli and final two episodes are a little annoying, i'm still very pleased dic entertainment finally licensed this show to shout factory for dvd release. and yes it may be true none of these nintendo inspired shows were remastered before being transferred to dvd the quality is still very excellent! i've bought a couple cheap looney tunes and old time cartoons that have looked way worse on dvd than anything i've seen from shout factory my props to everyone involved with these dvd releases, it's better than none of them never having seen a dvd release at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson loved it!","review":"My Grandson has watched this video everyday since he got it for his birthday in November.

That was because at the time I did not take into consideration how much experience to level up that gave :)However, the only other thing I didn't like was how there wasn't an available 2 player RPG mode for this. And yeah, that's true, people overlooked this game all the time because it was not popular like \\"Tekken\\" or something of that nature, but so what?

To begin first with a compliment: the picture quality is very good. However, the buttons are difficult to press and are slow to react. Everytime I use the camera it requires new or completely recharged batteries (the time I use it is under an hour). The editing application seems good, but ultimately makes it difficult to share the photographs. Whenever I purchase a digital camera for my personal use, it definately will not be the Koday DC290."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First and Only Digital Camera...","review":"Although I have only a friend's Olympus 2500L to compare to, and although I've never used any other digital camera before, after lots of research I bought the DC290 for my husband's artwork. I love it. Great quality. I didn't use the 16MB card it came with yet; I needed more space so I bought a 64MB card with the camera. Fantastic images with the 'High' setting. Battery eater, but aren't they all? Very easy to use, if you're new at it. I really like the Review/Magnify mode. I haven't even touched the surface regarding features. I'm searching for better photo-editing software though...I'm not impressed with the Adobe bundle, but it's free so worth a try. The viewfinder is a little oddly placed, but easy to adapt to. I definitely recommend the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome camera","review":"This is the camera used at Disney World by the staff members to take pictures of the guests. It is a excellent camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DC 290 IS THE BEST LOOK NO FURTHER","review":"I bought the DC290 and instantly started taking great pictures right out of the box. Don't listen to people who say the lag time is long after you press the shutter button. you must first hold the button down half way just like all cameras and when the green light illuminates press the button all the way the picture fires right away. you do however have to wait a little between shots. But I think the picture quality is worth the wait. I did find the camera to be a little big. So I bought a FUJI 4700/zoom. It arrived yesterday. let me tell you the DC290 blows the FUji out of the water. Yes the FUJI takes quick time movies and the camera is very small but the picture quality sucks and so does the battery life. I am returning it today. Out of all the Dig Cams I have tested the DC290 is the best. I have not tryed the DC4800 yet. If you want a great camera thats very very very easy to use buy the DC290. IT ROCKSSSSSSSS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kodak PC 290 is a good digital camera","review":"Overall, I am very happy with this selection. The kodak lense insures top quality photos. I think the detail of the pictures is superb. Also, even though there are a lot of bells and whistles, they are easy to learn and use. It is small and light weight, so it's easy to carry around. The only bad point, in my opinion, is the delay time between snapping the picture and the camera actually taking the picture. I've read this is a feature with all digital cameras. Very annoying. Often, a good picture is gone by the time the camera takes the shot. As with all digital cameras, the batteries drain very quickly. Also annoying. However, if you are taking indoor shots, there is an AC adapter which you can attach to the camera and plug into a wall. The power is then not supplied by battery but an electrical outlet. I'm looking for that to buy. Then you can continously take pictures and keep the LCD supply on to your hearts content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome","review":"I researched digicams for 4 months before I made my decision to purchase a dc290. It has a wide range of options...jpeg compression, ease of adding audio, clarity of the optical zoom, bursts and video mode, etc. It takes outstanding quality pictures and it's the only camera which has upgradable drivers. By using a card reader, 84 pictures can be uploaded from a 16mg card in a matter of seconds. It does go thru batteries quickly if using the LCD as a view finder. I gave a dc290 to my daughter for Christmas 2001 who lives 1,200 miles away. It is a pleasure to receive pictures from this camera regardless if it's an event, landscape or my 1st grandchild. It's almost like watching my grandson eat his first cookie, beginning crawl or capturing an awesome expression in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"My DC290 Kodak Camera","review":"I have had my Kodak DC290 for two years now. I have taken pictures from Alaska to Florida and have never been as thrilled with a camera as I have been with the DC290. The pictures that it takes are beautiful. I have printed out my pictures on plain printer paper as well as high gloss Kodak Photo paper. When I print out on Good, its almost as sharp as Best. Friends are amazed at the pictures. My Daughter liked it so well, that she bought the same camera and can't say enough about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on U2","review":"When I purchased this CD way back when, I thought it was incredible although short. Now that the internet has come along, I downloaded the COMPLETE concert, and now I know what everyone has been missing, over 90 minutes of a really incredible concert. The \\"commercial\\" version is a rip-off to fans. Gloria, which opens the commercial CD, actually was the 14th song of the set. I always thought \\"40\\" was a great closing song.

To end my spiel, seek out the complete concert and you will be amased at what you have been missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good account of live U2","review":"I became a devout U2 fan after watching their performance at Live Aid in 1985. Bono genuinely captivated the crowd in a way only great entertainers can, Edge's guitar rang out in sharp, crisp notes, and the rhythm section of Larry Mullen and Adam Clayton kept everything in tow. This album goes a long way towards capturing what early U2 sounded like live. The band is full of energy and fire; these fellas had something to prove and did so with zest. \\"Gloria\\" and \\"The Electric Co.\\" crackle with intensity, \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" is urgent, and \\"40\\" (based on Psalm 40) is more alive than on the studio version from War. This album is packed full of exuberance that makes the best live rock and roll a truly transcendent experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"great encapsulation of U2, part I","review":"This record is a snapshot of a band that was still young enough to create music as pure energy and experienced enough to execute it well.

When the CD was released about 10 years later, \\"The Electric Co\\" included one of the most awkward edits I've ever heard in order to omit that brief snippet of \\"Send in the clowns\\". Ever since then, I've hoped the original version would be restored. This is not the case with this release. Rather than restore the orginal EP version of \\"The Electric Co', they've cut another 20 seconds out of the CD version. It sounds better than the previous version but is still not complete. If you want to hear this release in its entirety, you still need to find the EP from 1983, pitiful as that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"U2 was so much better at the beginning of their career.

A must to own for the versions of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" and \\"40\\", but also for the inclusion of the obscure songs \\"11 O'Clock Tick Tock\\" and \\"Party Girl\\". \\"Under A Blood Red Sky\\" does need a good remastering job, and why not toss on the live tracks from \\"Wide Awake In America\\" as well?

Soal of a New Machine is their heaviest but not best, and Digimortal was awful. Transgression is just above Digimortal. I love the opening track \\"540,000 Degrees\\", but after that everything goes downhill quickly. The cover songs are just horrific, and the rest of the tracks are average to below average.

There are excellent reproductions and the texts are varied and fresh. An easy read, it is a great introduction to Kippenberger, dealing with his work and life in chronological order. I would say it is a bit better than the other \\"Kippenberger\\" from Phaidon, as it sees his work from the perspective of influence, or life \\"after Kippenberger\\". A wonderful artist, a life-changing thing to come to know his work and learn about this man who made funny, great and awful work by not trying to be a \\"serious\\" uptight artist. Not trying hard.Nice texts included. Yep, pre-requisite Diedrich Diedrichsen text enclosed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"The Kamehameha Schools are well-known for their music program, which dates back more than a century. As a big fan of traditional Hawaiian music, I was thrilled to see this DVD advertised. I felt taken, though, when I played it and found it had more to do with boring self-promotion of the festival and its leaders than with the music it presented. Don't waste your money on this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid for year subscription, got two issues.","review":"I paid for a years subscription through amazon and got two issues.

It did not flow at all. Lee Majors was good enough in the role but he wasn't given much to work with. Definite feel of a low budget TV movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most movies no match for Three on a Match","review":"Three on a match is truly a great movie. With stars like Bette Davis, Joan Blondell, Ann Dvorak and Humphrey Bogart what else would you have. The story is of three school girls and what path their lives take. The one who has it all is the most unfulfilled of the three. She gets involved with gangsters and ends up making the ultimate sacrifice. Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This pre-code has a lot going for it.","review":"It's loaded with stars: Joan Blondell, Bette Davis, Bogie & more. It gives you a bit of history while the history of the main characters unfolds. A pretty good story of three girls: a good one, a not so good one & a practical one. Their lives evolve through the 20's & what a fun times it was. The fun comes crashing down of course but nobody in the movie at first, recognizes it. Happy days are gone. The headlines as they continue in the thirties are hilariously optimistic, & wrong. The story they give as the three girls light up on one match is one will die. The origin of that was if three soldiers tried to light up on the same match on the battlefield, it gives the enemy enough time to aim & fire at the flame. This is one of the better movies fron the era & highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell Needs to be Bigger","review":"The book was excellent as far as it went, and the writer seems to know his material very well. The main improvement that could be made would be to increase the number of examples of the artwork, perhaps in an enlarged format, and include examples of the use of the Devil in political cartoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing collection","review":"The book contains a large number of black and white reproductions of various demon and devil imagery in comics. One sample per random artist, generally. The images, many poorly reproduced, low contrast, and small, appear on one page faced by a paragraph or two of commentary.I found the images to be largely uninteresting. Banal.

I am a crafter and painter (I hand paint roses on vintage items...eBay seller shabbychicartist), so I have tried EVERY brand of spray paint on the market (I use the spray paint for the backgrounds of my items). Krylon is, by far, the BEST spray paint on the market. It dries quickly, the odor isn't too bad, and the color selection is unbeatable. This PISTACHIO color is just too cool...not only do I use it on my craft items, but I've also painted all my outdoor plant pots in this color (so the pots would all match for a change). It's a lovely sage-green type of color, very pretty. I recommend Krylon sealer after the paint has dried, especially if you're painting something that will be outside. A great product! (I can't always find this Pistachio color near where I live, so Amazon is a blessing when I found it for sale here!) You won't be disappointed in this color!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!","review":"I bought 5 cans of this for a project... Horrible!! It's not the paint, it's the sprayer. I sprayed it on the ground to figure out what the heck it was doing and it made two lines... With one spray? Three of the five cans did this. The two that didn't do this had the normal spray top on them. The chalkboard paint by Krylon was perfect and so easy to use. Good product if you get the regular spray button top thing - check before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not 6 each it's 1 and it's $1.00 more expensive then Lowe's","review":"False Advertising at it's best.

They kick my ass on a daily basis! METAL RULES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal is forever!!!","review":"This is one scorching album. Primal fear are masters of old school heavy metal and this album proves it. Sure the ballads aren't all that and the very last track is just plain weird but the rest of the album is pure fist pumping metal! The last two PF albums were more modern sounding then their first two albums but having Tom Naumann back in the band seems to have injected more of an old school flavor back into the band and that is fine by me.In my opinion PF can do no wrong. If you like kickin' heavy metal go and get this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but not GREAT like Black sun or Nuclear Fire","review":"Well, I have to say when I put this cd in I was very dissappointed. Don't get me wrong, its a pretty good metal album, but not nearly as strong and powerful as PF's past releases. It starts off with a cheesy Judas preist sound song \\"Metal is Forever\\", then there are a couple filler tracks that could easily be on a Sinner cd. Towards the middle and the end it gets a lot stronger, but still not quite Primal Fear(in my opinion). Then you get to the last song, track 12. Wait a minute! Where the $#@! is the last song??? Not here! What you get is a couple minutes of narration telling you what happens when you go to hell(which is below the earths crust, by the way!). I would have given this cd 3.5 stars, but that piece of crap at the end made me want to never listen to Primal Fear again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointment","review":"I love Black Sun And Nuclear Fire, But This One really sucks!!

This CD was missing in my library and I like it very much. Especially The Healer is my favorite song. The only and the biggest disappointment was the cover. I didn't suppose Amazon will send damaged cover - almost 1/4 of title page is completely missing!!! As it was properly wrapped in the plastic and the box is ok, I suppose some mistake must have been taken during the primal packaging. I don't complain Amazon for breaking it but I supposed Amazon's quality control should be better during completing the package.

See how the bag in the picture is crammed full of beach stuff? In real life, not so much. The bag is actually quite small -- it holds maybe one beach towel and perhaps some very small beach toys. The handles are sewn on wrong, or something, because you can't get the bag to open wide as shown in the picture. (The handles on both sides are actually attached.) This might be good for laundry or something small -- but for my purposes, it just wasn't what I thought it was going to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good bag","review":"this bag is not AT ALL what is pictured. and unless you have some sewing skills, be prepared to have to relocate the handles. I don't know what idiot designed this thing, but the handles are located in such a way that you need about six people to help you hold open the bag. WOW! I didn't return this bag, and just relocated the handles because we needed it ASAP for a swim meet on the weekend. It worked great once the handles were in the right place. They make it look like it holds so many things too. Make sure you read the dimensions on this item!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Photograph is misleading.","review":"This bag is SO SMALL.

I would have been disappointed even if I found this at the dollar store. Do not buy...don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"This bag is absolutely useless. I usually read reviews before buying anything online, but for some reason, I didn't before buying this bag. Big mistake. It holds nothing - the dimensions are totally off and the picture appearing in the add is totally deceiving. You would be lucky if you could get a single towel in it. Also, like other reviewers, I found the straps to be sewed on in a ridiculous manner, making it impossible to even stretch out the bag to get items inside. Will not but from this seller again. Totally deceitful advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pool bag","review":"The bag is a nice size -- it can hold a towel and bathing suit, goggles, etc. It has a drawstring at the top of the bag to keep it closed, but after less than a week of use the stitching began to come apart.

The information presented has been covered many times in other films, with just a little different twist, so really no new information is presented. There is an \\"evidence\\" section of the dvd- I was interested to watch that- and it was a joke, it showed a document that couldn't be read, and a picture of the Texas School Book Depository.

The main character is Paula who is invited to come on the expedition by her dad, and she has a hard time adjusting in the jungle for quite a while.I didn't really like this book because it wasn't very interesting.

No? Me either! And I live in Tempe, AZ, which is where they're from. For some reason, this perfectly-good album is getting little to no exposure. I just sort of stumbled on it. So congrats to finding this album!That said, \\"Major Lodge Victory\\" is quite good. I was pleasantly surprised listening to all 12 songs. They're all consistently good - no really awful must-skip tracks on here. Just a lot of good upbeat catchy songs here. I would throw this in the genre of \\"Power Pop\\".It sort of reminds me of Fountains Of Wayne breakout success \\"Welcome Interstate Managers\\". There's also some hints of another Arizona band, Jimmy Eat World. I'd also throw in a favorable comparison to another great band, the Jayhawks.Overall, I think it's a very solid album, with lots of good catchy hooks. This is good pop/rock music. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did they wait so long, Just as great as they were 10 years ago.","review":"And their it was, Finally arrived in the store, A New Gin Blossoms album. I saw them live over about 2 years ago and heard rumors of a new album then, but nothing materialized. But now it's here, and they have not missed a beat since the last one. Just as fresh as the day they first hit the scene, the gin blossoms have put for their Rock/Pop sound that made them popular the first time round. Learning the Hard Way, what an apporpriate song to start the album with, I suspect it is a reflection of their feelings about the waiting so long for a reunion. Take a listen to the previews here on amazon, there is no mistake that this is the gin blossoms at their best.

Unlike \\"Congratulations, I'm Sorry\\", this CD flows smoothly from song to song showing a more mature group that can craft songs with the best of them. Standout tracks include \\"Come on Hard\\", \\"Someday Soon\\", and \\"Jet Black\\". The only negative is \\"California Sun\\" sung by guitarist Jesse Valenzuela. Good song but not a good vocal performance. Everything else gets better with each listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Major Lodge Victory","review":"The CD is amazing! There are so many songs that I can identify with... just stuff about life. Very perceptive and insightful lyrics and beautiful harmony. I can't get enough of this CD! There's a song on there called Jet Black Sunrise. I heard it was written by the bass player, Bill. It's my favorite on the CD.

The lyrics are pretty weak throughout the album and the albums lack those songs that made the Gin Blossoms stand out in the mid-'90s. These songs are all drab, mid-tempo, half-brained attempts at what they used to be able to do.But then again, why should we expect anything different from a band whose creative peak was realized over 10 years ago?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If we wait 20 years, can we get 6 good songs?","review":"Let me start by saying that I LOVE the Gin Blossoms. Anytime a band takes 10 years off from making a record it has to worry you as to what they will sound like.I will say this, \\"Someday Soon\\" is an awesome song.

It's not that they are totally bad, it still sounds like the GB minus Philip on drums, but the songs just aren't that good.I'm with that other reviewer who asked why don't that record \\"What\\" and put it on a record.And for those reviwers who said Doug Hopkins isn't missed must be on crack. Yes, the Gin Blossoms still sound the same but the lyrics aren't even close. Hopkins wrote words from the heart. They were real, genuine, not words to make something rhyme.Too bad Robin couldn't have written some more for this record.My high hopes were crushed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gin Blossoms, better than ever!","review":"I had the privilege of seeing the Gin Blossoms a couple of times this year, heard them play \\"Heart Shaped Locket\\" and \\"Fool for the Taking\\" sprinkled in with the other hits, and couldn't wait until Aug 8 to pick up the new CD. What a well put together recording! The guys have a more layered sound with some uncharacteristic effects. The songs have hooks that just grow and grow on you, but there is enough variety in the song structures that you hear something new every time you listen to them. Robin's vocals are right on the money, Jesse and Scott's guitars are awesome, Bill is all over the bass, and Scott K is a perfect fit. Buy this CD - it gets better the more you play it."},{"rating":"1","title":"tips to enjoying \\"major lodge victory\\"","review":"1. steal it2. delete every song except the first 3. if you feel cheated, you can keep number 4.3. listen to these awesome songs over and over. do NOT listen to the rest. ignorance is bliss."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this book","review":"I read to my kids every night and I cringe when I come across this one in the rotation.

It honestly seems like a japanese book that was poorly translated to English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful work on very insightful work.","review":"In my opinion, \\"Angels in America\\" is the greatest American play of all time. The blend of realism, fantasy, scenes of almost cinematic magnitude, and monologues full of stunning poetry, make this the most incredible theatrical experience ever. So it was with mixed feelings that I picked up this book. I was a little weary about spoiling the experience of the show with too much analysis. Fortunately, though, I was pleasantly surprised.This book is not just scholarly babble. These college-friendly essays actually provide some very useful analogies to the work. It helped me to better understand, and therefore appreciate, Tony Kushner's amazing epic.If you are a fan of \\"Angels in America\\", and want to gain more insight, then this is a definite buy for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent and technical","review":"Very few books exist on this topic.

All have found this CD soothing and lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soaring loneliness","review":"Listening to Michael Hoppé's music is like being transported and flown by the altitude of the notes. The sound of the flute, viola and piano are so magically peaceful and calming. I would like it more if it doesn't have synthesised music there though, as the earthy sound of the flute and the viola would have come stronger.My favourite album by Hoppé and Wheater is still \\"Afterglow\\", though.

This book ignores the truth and ignores many other facts sourounding the unfortunate event. This book sadly, and regrettably, completely ignores the similar massacres of the Etzion Block where 100s of Jewish civilians were also murdered. Hopefully a second edition of this work will carry the name 'twin massacres' Dier Yassin and The Etzion Block.

Those who catch it will die, but the symptoms are mistakenly confused by a belief that an evil wolflike spirit called the \\"Vorvolaka\\" possesses its victims until it drains them of their strength and blood.

I was constantly wondering while reading them if some of these are very early efforts, (they remind me of college freshman level writing) which were dug up for publication. I expect better from Sherman Alexie.Also, he seems to be rehashing the same themes and ideas that have been used in so much of his other work.One of the stories entitled, What You Pawn I Will Redeem, is a great story. The others really were disappointing in both style and content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Alexie's best","review":"I have read much of Sherman Alexie's work, and I found most of the stories in this collection to be mediocre, and frankly, disappointing.

Every story made me laugh at some point, and every story touched me deeply at some point. The characters have to deal with poverty, others' preconceptions, their own deeply held stereotypes, good luck, bad luck, and just life in general. One homeless man tries to find $1000 to buy back his grandmother's pow-wow regalia. Another man honors one parent's death by giving up basketball and the other's death by taking it back up in middle life. Every highly readable story grabbed me from beginning to end.

What a mistake! The phone does not hold a charge. I talked on the phone for a little over one hour and sent a few text messages, and the battery died! It doesn't even last one whole day. Also, the phone shut off for no reason. I also could not check my email; I kept getting error messages. The phone was an AT&T phone, and even after I configured it for my carrier, it still didn't work right. I suspect this may have been a refurbished phone, even though it was advertised as \\"new\\".

Since I was so familiar with this product I wanted another one and foundit on Amazon. What I didn't realize was that, although the product was \\"new\\" and packagedas such, it was an old model of the razor and even less capable than the one I was replacing.Many of the short cut features of my old phone are not on this one and I find myself constantlyfrustrated that I have to do extra steps for the same result. For instance the texting requiresa couple extra steps as does the ability to find numbers in the address book. I can hardlywait to get an Iphone.

For the simple fact that the battery has to be recharged every night. For the money I spent on this thing, the battery should be a whole lot better than what it is. I did not buy my phone for this seller so I don't know about the quality of his stuff (By the looks of it, not very good either). I bought mine at a Verison store (brand new). IMHO, this phone sucks!

Years ago I owned a 2-LP collection of Mantovani's Christmas music, released on London Records. Each song had its own track and the sound was glorious. When I saw Amazon's listing on this CD, I thought I had found, at last, all this wonderful music on one CD (how marvelous!). As it turned out, the music on this disc is done in medley form, and crammed onto four tracks (I don't blame Amazon for the misinformation, for they most likely printed what was given to them by the record company, Eclipse). The arrangements don't even sound like Mantovani (none of those famous cascading strings), and the choir could use some work (my church choir could do a better job). On top of all this, the sound is blown out with industrial-strength treble.For people with a cheap mini-system stereo, who wants to put some music on while trimming the tree - and are not serious music lovers - this cheap disc might be right up their alley. Otherwise..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Memories from Childhood","review":"Does one purchase a Christmas album released in the 60's for anything but nostalgia? I loved this album as a girl, my parents loved the music, and at a time I was developing my own taste in music, I was introduced to singers whom they enjoyed.

Quite honestly, I had been hoping to hear some of these songs again for decades as I never found them recorded anywhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"a Fraud. Not by Mantovani And His Orchestra","review":"In spite of the album name, the recording is not by Mantovani And His Orchestra.

I immediately tried to find everything from them that I could after hearing their debut release.With their latest release,Human Nature,Harem Scarem have stayed true to their style of music while modernizing their sound.This band,as well as bands such as Gotthard and Jaded Heart,are proving that melodic rock is alive and well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of weak","review":"I have all of Harem Scarem's cds and this is kind of tired and forced. Seems like they've explored some of these avenues before and there's not enough enough guitar work, which is a shame 'cause Pete Lesperence is really brutal. To me, the fizzle started a few cds back. The backing vocals are too low in the mix. Another real calling card for HS. Maybe I'm still looking for another \\"Mood Swings\\". The band seems to have lost their attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"B-A-N-A-N-A-S!","review":"Gwen shot to fame with pop-ska band No Doubt, however this song is nothing like the material she released with that band. It may be called pop but in fact it is hip-hop. Firstly because it is produced by The Neptunes (renowned hip-hop producers), and secondly because it uses a rap like chorus. So obviously everything points to the fact of its generical origins.On to the song, this song will instanly remind those 80's obsessors about \\"Mickey\\" by Toni Basil and rightly so! It has the same cheerleader themed video and beats. Gwen seems to be aiming this song at a younger audience urging them to just get up and have fun. You may accuse this song of being commercial pap however Gwen is just having fun with her career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nyeh,...","review":"The lyrics to this song are inestimably poor. Their vulgarity is more tiresome than provocative in this day and age. They are sung with a fake lisp. The song cries out for melodies, which never arrive. There is the hint of a melody in the background chanting, so for that reason alone I'll give it two stars instead of one. But I do not recommened it. Gwen Stefani is capable of better records (like \\"Cool\\") that don't try quite so hard to be hip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Um Hm this my sh...","review":"Ofcourse the song Hollaback Girl makes no sense whatsoever.

I don't see why either song was so popular, it's just, \\"I ain't no hollaback girl cuz this s!#@ is bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s.\\" It's great you know how to spell bananas, but that doesn't do jack s!#@ for the song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously!","review":"How old is Gwen Stefani?? She acts like she's 15! Plus, this song is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, and what bad songwriting! She doesn't know how to write a proper song.

Where she says \\"That's my sh**\\" no less than a million times, and 2. She demonstrates that she's hooked on phonics by being kind enough to spell bananas for the rest of us.If this is supposed to be rap, Stefani failed miserably. If it's supposed to be dance, again, she failed miserably. To be honest, I don't know what the hell this is supposed to be because it sure isn't music.The fact that it was Number One for so long proves that perhaps people don't have any requirements for their ears. - Donna Di Giacomo"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the cost for the \\"rmx\\"","review":"Guess what? The remix is two minutes and 47 seconds long! It almost feels like it wants to be a house mix, but it's not--it's just a less rhythmic mix than the original, with a steadier beat. Unless you are a diehard fan, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Either Hate It Or Love It","review":"I heard this song on the radio the first time many months ago (and then for months and months it's been played nonstop). I instantly hated it from the horrendous beat to the fact that Gwen Stefani is a 35 year old dressed up as a cheerleader with pom-poms and about 95% of the song is spent on the chorus \\"I ain't no hollaback girl\\" or \\"This s*** is bananas\\" section. Pharell is a master producer and I chuckled because I thought that even the Neptunes can produce an occasional flop. To my horror this song became the number one single for multiple weeks and became the most successful single of the entire summer (maybe even the entire year). I don't see what people like about this song but apparently there is something I'm missing. Like I said you either hate it or love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going bananas!","review":"Gwen Stefani isn't singing an ode to Woody Allen's Cuban Revolution comedy,but teaching the her teen&preteen; fans to get hooked on phonics. Unfortunately for the rest of us. \\"Hollaback Girl\\" is yet another disposable bubblegum song.\\"Hollaback Girl\\" is an infectious song,catchy in its own insidious way.

This s#!@ isn't bananas, it's just plain ol' s#!@."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's Doubt!","review":"This is unquestionably one of the STUPIDEST songs that has ever hit the top 40, but yet I have to give it more than one star. It's SO absolutely ignorant (I still don't get the bit about Bananas) and ridiculous that it has a strange appeal. You don't WANT to like this admittedly dumb song, but it's catchy in an odd way and difficult to resist the chanting and the beat.Clearly inspired by the chanting of African-American college stepshows and marching bands, listeners who are familiar with those styles will wink at being in on an inside joke of sorts. You will find yourself wanting to make like a frisbee or target practice with this enhanced CD, but something strange will keep you from doing so. Why? I guess the same reason that groups like Freddie and the Dreamers and the Fat Boys bring smiles to those who recall their music. Dumb music that's so bad it's good will always have its place."},{"rating":"1","title":"All is vanity","review":"Now let's step back and think about this for a minute. The principal repeated lyric of this song, \\"Hollaback Girl,\\" is \\"this is my s--t!\\" (Vulgar expression partially blanked.)

The premise that the film works on is a good one, that's what initially grabbed my attention (along with some well edited trailers), but the execution is laughable. The cast are OK, the special effects are OK, but the script is terrible and the ending unfulfilling.

In fact, they remained so undifferentiated it was often difficult to tell who was speaking during the meandering patches of dialog. The bathos-laden ruminations on Art, History, and the Meaning of Americanism were truly cringe-making, and I couldn't tell if the author intended them to be taken seriously or was demonstrating how sophomoric JuJu & co. actually were. I admit I only made it halfway through the book. In light of the glowing reviews, I can only assume it does a brilliant turn-around and out-performs Tolstoy on the home stretch.

However, it was the top rated exapandable cordless by Good Housekeeping magazine so I fell for it. I purcased the base and one handset. The base phone was defective and would not hold a charge. The additional handset charged very quickly and we used it for a day and heard the annoying \\"white noise\\" so many reviewers mentioned. It would not go away no matter where we were in the house. I returned it and exchanged it for the Panasonic comparable model(#KX-TG1050N). It was more expensive,but we are very happy with it and do not experience the interference.

The worst part about this is that it makes a clicking sound that can be heard on the handset.Now I have to decide if I want to keep my 'investment' (2 other handsets) alive and buy another 2461 or a 2431 (if so I may buy the extended warranty)...or put it to bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST PHONE","review":"This is the BEST PHONE I have ever purchased.

Other nice touches are a fully backlit display and keypad, very easy to use answering machine that even my grandmother knows how to use, and a loud usable speakerphone!

As you've read here, the sound quality is worse than a cell phone. 2. The answering machine would not record many of my incoming calls, probably due to the poor sound. After taking it back to the store, the salesperson told me Vtech phones are known for being poor quality. Too bad they can't fix these problems - the phone itself looks great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this model VTech","review":"We have used VTech phones for years with excellent performance. However, this model/unit was a terrible disappointment. The answering machine base unit failed within 1 month after purchase.

Don't waste your time on this system - there are other systems out there that are just as good and a lot more reliable!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of VTech's better efforts....","review":"This manufacturer of excellent telephones stumbled with this model. I disregarded Consumer Report's comments that there is a persistent white noise in the background, but CU was correct. Despite all of the excellent features, small size and price, it's simply not a good phone. Also, the VTech customer support is dreadful. When I needed to purchase an extra battery cover, I was told that there weren't any available, but to try calling them again in a month or so. Customer support, indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Sound Quality","review":"I was excited to get this system (2461 + 3 extra handsets). I thought there were lots of great features -- good ergonomics, the ability to intercom among handsets, good battery life, etc.All the good features were overwhelmed, however, by the very poor sound quality. People thought I was on a cell phone, and in some rooms of the house, it was almost impossible to have an intelligble conversation. I'm reluctantly returning it -- I tried for almost a month to make it work -- and trying something lower tech."},{"rating":"1","title":"cordless junk","review":"I did own this phone but traded off for a panasonic KX-TG2583W.The vtech has very bad sound the speaker phone keeps breaking up all the time you have to clear all caller id off all phones every time you clear them in my case thats 3 phones. You cant use the page on the base to talk to the other phones. even when I would go across the street I at times could not answer a call and I never had that problem with a 900 mh. Save your time and buy a panasonic or any thing but a vtech. I thought it was great at first untill I had to use it a few times and try to correct the proplems with it I just gave it up. I should have read what other people thought of it instead of a sore employer that sold me on it. Then I had 90 days to return it but to me it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Noise, UGH!","review":"I just bought this phone and discovered much to my annoyance that it doesn't matter where you put the base you get static. It is irritating to say the least. This over-priced phone will be heading back were I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - Good Reception","review":"After only one day of testing, both handsets work well. We can speak and hear from anywhere in our house or yard with absolutely great clarity, a first for us with cordless phones. We really love it. So far, only two dissappointments: 1) the manual isn't as clear as it could be, and 2) you can't check messages from a handset. I thought the 'remote' feature would include being able to get messages from one of the handsets, but it turns out you have to go to the machine or leave your house and call from elsehwere.Otherwise, it's a great little phone, with fabulous clarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked OK for a year then broke.","review":"This phone worked well for a year before the base station and answering machine went out.

I was shocked -- It actually worked!!So, with this in mind, I thought I'd give the VTech 2.4 GHz a try as our main phone. I'm SO glad I did. After I got over the sticker-shock, I'm happy to report: it's sleek (though the compact size of the handset feels a little unnatural without that belt clip on it), light, VERY easy to program, has all of your standard features, the base unit doesn't take up much space on your kitchen counter, and oh did I mention that it sounds great on either end?! Yeah, yeah! Finally one more thing off my list to do..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality. My old 900mhz was a better phone.","review":"The Vtech looks nice and has really cool functions, but the problem is that the sound quality is really bad and choppy. Also is has lesser range than the Panasonic 2.4 Ghz phones. In fact, my old 900 mhz phone has better sound quality and greater range than the Vtech. Please do not buy this phone...it was a complete waste of money. I had to sell the phone (with the 3 additional handsets) on auction just to get rid of it. Vtechs only look nice...but thats about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Walker-20 Greatest Hits","review":"I bought this CD to get a few of his MGM hits that I did not have. However, I discovered when I compared the tracks hereon with the original Columbia and Monument hits that I have, this is a rerecording of Billy's hits. The rerecordings are of high quality but they just are not the original hits. As a result, I was disappointed because a couple of reviewers had indicated otherwise. I would recommend instead Billy Walker Columbia Hits and Billy Walker Greatest Hits On Monument for original recordings and in the meantime I will look for another CD that has his original hits from his MGM and RCA recordings made between 1970 and 1976."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-made but not for someone with wide sit-bones.","review":"I really wanted to like the saddle as it looks to be well-made, and for many of my friends they will ride nothing else. For me it is easily the least comfortable saddle I have ever ridden. The issue is that for someone with wide sit bones you end up riding on the little metal rails that suspend the leather and not the suspended part of the seat. If I try to sit forward on the seat my sit-bones miss it entirely. This makes the seat unrideable after about 3 miles. I gave it 2 stars because I know it works for many but for me it was a waste of $200. Defiantly try before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream became a nightmare","review":"The promo video and testimonials on the manufacturer's website intrigued me, and it fit the style of my Calfee bamboo bike. First rides were so comfortable I ordered one for my S-works Tarmac too. But then the leather started stretching and spreading so as to rub against my thighs. Then riding a Century in a rainstorm it really stretched (even though it had the waterproofing underneath.) Also, the tension bolt kept sliding. The first call to Tom the owner was helpful, but as the problem wasn't resolved and as I kept emailing with the problem he stopped returning emails. I even tried cutting away some of the leather on the sides towards the nose so it wouldn't spread like a hammock and rub, but that didn't work. Both saddles ended up in the garbage can. Don't put your money there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they still in business?

I recently had increased my riding time. This combined with having absolutely no \\"natural\\" padding of my own caused the onset of significant problems with piriformis muscle and sciatic nerve pain to the point where it was bordering on chronicity. I tried numerous moderately priced saddles without success. Out of desperation, I decided to splurge (at least for me it was a splurge) and pop for the Selle An-Atomica Titanico. The difference was immediate. Upon returning from a four - hour ride it was clear I had none of the persistent symptoms that were a major \\"pain-in-the-butt\\" in the past.

The ending really let me down."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word - Monotonous","review":"I bought this book because someone compared it to the absolutely outstanding \\"Gates of Fire\\" by Stephen Pressfield. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. Although the book is fairly well written, the story itself drags on and on with seemingly little purpose. Xenophon and his troops encounter one obstacle after another on their trek home, but each obstacle is exactly the same as the previous one; only the locations and opponents have changed. Needless to say, this gets old rather quickly. The \\"surprise\\" ending is both anticlimactic and irrelevant, leading one to wonder whether it was employed simply because the writer knew the story was about to fizzle out and needed to try to salvage it somehow. I could not put down \\"Gates of Fire.\\" To the contrary, I could not pick up \\"The Ten Thousand.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak and disjointed \\"me too\\" Gates of Fire","review":"I am amazed by some of these reviews. Anyone comparing this with Gates of Fire must have some other motive. (A better comparison is Pressfiled's much weaker book about Alcibiades). This novel creates and abandons plot elements (the Boetian engines, for example) en masse and the ending is abrupt and highly unsatisfactory. The rest of the Anabasis may have been boring but isn't a novelization supposed to fix that? He'd made up enough silly relationship material... he could have easily had those elements be part of the last part of the book. Seems to me that Huck Finn on the river would have been described as \\"not worth novelizing\\" by some ot these reviewers.

You can almost smell the blood, dirt, and sweat of the battlefield. The story focuses on the great Greek warrior, Xenophon, as told by his servant Theo. Xenophon joins an army raised by Cyrus, a man who wants to rule Persia. In this army there is a large division of Greek soldiers.

Feel the glory and the dispair, the heat and the cold, the companionship and the hatred. I liked the book so I bought the second. This one is worth buying in hardback and bringing to the front of your bookshelves. All forms of war are awful I suppose but there is something glorious about horses and spears and shields and brute strength and courage that is appealing.

A tale of mythic proportions, it describes the exploits of a mercenary Greek army duped into engaging the Persians. The protagonist, a freed slave, mirrors the main character and gives a first-hand account of the action and thoughts of the army. Although a novel, the book has a scholarly air, combining mythology, anthropology, history, and philosophy. Although some have objected to the expanded introductions to the chapters, I enjoyed the presenting paragraphs of the chapters to be very well written and at times even poetic. This writing is a cut above much of what is being published today and I am eager to read the author's other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"As a fan of history I enjoyed this book. It was interesting to know what life was like for a Greek Hoplite on campaign.The battle scenes are done well as are the characterizations. I never realized how much rivalry there was in the Greek city states. The Spartans were incredibly different from the other peoples of Greece and it shows in this book. The things these men had to undergo in the deserts of Persia fighting is amazing that any of them returned home. A great read for people interested in historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"**Update**","review":"I wrote a review of this book 7 years ago when my son was 12 weeks old (scroll down -- July, 1998).

As if that wasn't bad enough, it's by two women whose only stated qualifications is that they're moms who are married to pediatricians- !!! -- and advises some practices that we now know are not healthy, such as stomach sleeping and giving 4-month-olds bottles of glucose water overnight. Leave this relic in the attic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical advice for a variety of sleep problems","review":"My well-worn copy of this book has a place of honor on my shelf. This book specifically addresses the various stages and common disruptions to sleep at each stage.

It is divided by age group so you can jump right to the section appropriate for your child after reading a brief introduction. It did include information on eliminating nighttime feedings, developmental factors affecting sleep, and getting baby to sleep in his/her own bed, but overall, I did not find it to be as comprehensive as West's \\"Good Night, Sleep Tight.\\" It is a less gentle approach, but I think it would bring results faster. It also seems slightly out of date. I chose to modify techniques from both books."},{"rating":"1","title":"worrisome","review":"I have to admit I haven't read this book. Reading the available excerpt I found much common-sense advice, until the part about putting your infant to sleep on his stomach. This is dangerously outdated advice - used to be the accepted practice until about 15 years ago (the copyright is 1985!) when research showed much higher rates of SIDS (crib death) in babies sleeping on their stomachs. This makes me concerned about whether the other info is similarly outdated - babies' sleep needs haven't changed much in 20 years, but safety recommendations have."},{"rating":"1","title":"helping your child sleep through the night","review":"I bought this book based on the other customer comments. It is not the book for me and my four month old. This book has not been updated since 1985 and recommends that the safest position for baby to sleep is on their stomachs! It also discourages co-sleeping or baby sleeping in the same room with you. The authors start \\"the program\\" at about 5 -7 weeks; which in my short experience is too early to get your little angel on any kind of \\"stretching\\" schedule. If you read Dr. Sears or Penelope Leach, you probably won't like this book either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"We bought this book to help us with a three month old who's got some bad sleeping habits (probably because of us!) I was expecting some solid answers to our baby's sleeping problems and was instead presented with a book full of wordy rhetoric and philosphophies, and NO hard answers or tips for babies who are MORE than a few days/weeks old.The book categorizes by age group \\"birth to 4 months\\", etc. making it difficult for us to follow guidelines that according to the book should have been established from day one. If first time parents KNEW they were going to have sleep problems with their newborns that would continue for months, they would find this book useful. For those of us without that foresight, this book leaves you cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked for my older kid","review":"I bought this book when my first child was 2 and firmly entrenched in her own bad sleep patterns. I started in the infant section and implemented all the suggestions that I could; bedtime routine, focal feeding (bedtime snack), etc and moved on from there. It took longer than the book suggested, but it worked. I have since used it from day one on my second child and have reapplied the priciples when the older child began waking in the night and wanting to crawl into bed with us.

The set-up information does not cover everything. The unit is louder than I remember from my Delta. The blade guard works, but is very flimsy and wobbly. I know I was spoiled on my twin laser; but that being said.......this unit's laser disappears when the blade is half-way lowered. The laser will not \\"wrap\\" around to the front of the board to be cut like the Delta. So when doing a miter the laser will not show on the front edge. Only on the top.

I started out reading Robert Doherty's Area 51 series (who in fact is Greg Donegan and vice versa), and I couldn't stop reading it. This series was just as good. The ending battle scene was a bit too short and abrupt. It could have been drawn out and described in more detail and excitement as the other two historical battles of this book were (gettysburg and isandlwana). But overall the book was great and the series as a whole was fantastic. What can I say, Donegan just writes great stories. Pretty cool who the Shadow turned out to be also."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully ending","review":"GregGreat ending! I could not put the book done.

I am half way through the Gate series and it's a good read BUT the proof reading is non-existent and it effects the readability of the text greatly in some places. I don't know if it's Mr. mayer's, fault or Amazon's bit it's not acceptable. It's so bad on occasions that it takes 3-4 read throughs to understand what's actually being written.

So when I picked this up and started reading about the earth being in trouble because of the lack of ozone and the radiation in Russia I thought I had picked up the wrong book and was reading it again. I had to hop around a bit to realize it is the same story as Assualt on Atlatis; but told from different perspectives. I thought it was better than Assault on Atlantis in that regards however, there was very little new stuff (which I'm not sure the last book left room for anyways) but I think the author could have combined these last 2 books and made one good series ending book. There is stuff covered in the last book that is not covered here, however of the two I think this one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Historical Novel","review":"While I agree with the previous reviewers that this is a historically captivating story, I must take issue on a couple of points. This is not a \\"scientific\\" text. The author's explanation of volcanological phenomena is rather shaky. At one point he talks about \\"underground lakes\\" within Mt. Pelee. While that may be his most egregious transgression, there are others. I was also dismayed by the excessive liberties he takes in the spelling of local geographical names. Assier for example becomes Acier. Normally not an issue, but there are just too many. I couldn't help wonder what other liberties he has taken in recounting this event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy & Read this Book!!!!","review":"An exceptionally well written and documented book.

He covers the human side of this tragedy with accuracy and compassion. Zebrowski has drawn from many sources and put the accumulated information into a very readable book.

You get to the installation instructions about 3/4ths of the way through the manual. They are incomplete and unclear. The onscreen instructions are just as bad: they don't even tell you to insert the second of the discs at the appropriate time. It was only after hours of trying things that I finally got Windows XP to run at all. And that's when I discovered how slowly it runs. I mean crawling, not walking, slow.

He does a very, very poor job of setting the scene and introducing characters -- if you don't already know a lot about 17th century life and the geography of London, you'll likely find yourself lost. His extremely dry writing style doesn't help matters, either.The book also suffers from a lack of depth -- it's fact after fact with almost no attempt made at interpretation. And the lack of detail when compared to other books about historical fires (such as Von Drehle's \\"Triangle\\") is disappointing. Still, Tinniswood clearly has a very good knowledge of this interesting subject, and that's what keeps me from giving this book 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto vent shade for Bonneville 01'","review":"I really like this product, the assembly was simple (clean surfaces and solid assembly pressure are always critical to good adhesion).

To be honest, so far, only after listening to their new album a couple times, I admit I only truly like a few of the songs, with \\"In My Dreams\\" as one of my all time favourite tunes. Despite I have only learned to love a handful of their songs (out of their greatest hits CDs that I own) so far, as a 'Mavericks newcomer fan', they still have earned my top 5 place for my favourite country artists. They will never change their style of alternative country, which should be admired. I would see them live any minute.

There are way to many similiarities. I suppose it is entirely possible that they lived an almost identical life as it's a big world. Based on copywrite \\"Journey to Topaz\\" was written first.

Thank you so much Ms Otsuka!"},{"rating":"2","title":"exercises in creative writing?","review":"I enjoyed this novel, but I sometimes felt as if I were reading exercises for a creative writing class. Julie Otsuka's writing is vivid and often makes you feel like you are really there with her characters in their worn but sunny California house or choking on the Utah desert sand. Otsuka's use of different narrative voices is what made this feel like a writing assignment to me, almost like a gimmick or showmanship. The first three chapters of the five in this slender volume feature an omniscient narrator that mostly narrows in on one character per chapter (the mother, the daughter, the son), the fourth chapter is narrated by \\"we\\" (the children) and the fifth is the father in first person. She also didn't name her main characters, which seemed like an odd and studied choice. Overall, however, I give this 4 or 4.5 stars. I'm curious to read her newest book to see what writing style(s) she chose to use within it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Insight","review":"Quick read with good insight into the life of one Japanese-Americanfamily displaced by the internment orders in California during WWII. Having read a few novels and accounts based on this topic, I have come to the conclusion that responses are as varied as the people living through this tragedy. This provided additional details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prose Haiku","review":"A jeweled haiku of a book (even if the ending does stumble a bit). Worth re-reading. While not especially written for children, this would be great for high school American history class (short, inclusive reading level because of the spare language, but high thought content). Would be excellent paired with Alastair Cooke's \\"The American Homefront,\\" his 1942 unsentimental prose snapshot of America at war. \\"Emperor\\" is a marvelously American book."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't make 'em like this anymore","review":"There are a lot of bad country singers out there, so it's hard for one to really stand out from the crowd. But Mel Street had the goods in a way that few other did. It's not just that he was bad. He sang honky-tonk in an unctuous, cloying style and performed songs with lyrics that were so bathetic that he simply grabbed you by the lapels and forced you to listen to him--if only to try to figure out \\"Is this guy for real, or is this a goof?\\"This disc is a pretty fair sample of Street at his best/worst. It's not quite as good/bad as the 20-song Street discs that are still available, but it's probably enough for all but the most masochistic listeners."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!

This style seems to fit her to a tee. What a great talent she has. What a shame it was, you know her death, at the peak of her career.The main concern I have for Susannah's cd is the repertoire. Susannah has stated that she likes to sing the old standards, but also likes to sing comtempory songs, too. Please folks, don'task me to contribute to this comtempory music fobial that everyone is talking about, for I won't.I am a desciple of the old composers, you know the names like Porter, Kern, Berlin, Rodgers at el. This kind of music is where my roots are and where I seem to fit into the music world the best. I would prefer Susannah sing more of these old songs.I trust that others will agree with me in this matter about traditional music being by far the best music out there. It is tried and the dues have been paid on it.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegy","review":"I was in my car, listening to a program that plays \\"standards\\" on a local NPR affiliate on Saturday, 5/19/01, about noon-ish, east coast time. The host came on the air to say that he had just gotten word that cabaret singer, Suzannah McCorkle had died earlier that morning after having leapt out of her apartment window in NYC. (Until that point, I had never heard of her -- a NY Times article a few days later provided greater detail about Ms. McCorcle's life). The host played \\"Waters of March\\" as a sort of tribute -- a song (I later learned) which she used to use as an encore piece in her cabaret act...and sometimes left her crying. It is a song that, on the surface, sounds lilting and pleasant enough, but whose words seem to vascillate from cozy to ambivalent to somber. In a way, the song itself was rather like someone who fights their demons in private -- apparently cheerful on the outside, but quite troubled on the inside. Indeed, it is a song that haunts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SINGER GONE TOO SOON","review":"I just discovered Susannah McCorkle two months ago.I have purchased three CD's since my discovery.I find her style and choice of songs in all three CD's I have purchased satisfying and enjoyable.So far her consistency in creating great listening CD's makes it very probable that I will be purchasing a fourth CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow what a range","review":"This album highlights just how great s vocalist Susannah McCorkle was.

Maurice Bryan, has done an incredible job researching and profiling many of the rastamon who came before us, and their contributions will be remembered for all time. This book has been read 3 times by myself in a span of 48 hrs because it was so excellently documented. It covered not only the root of Rastafari but the ongoing movement into the 2oth century.

One must be noted: THIS SHOULD NOT BE IN YOUNG CHILDREN'S REACH!!!! Very adult themes were included, so it is wise for one to keep this from kids. However, if you have teenagers in high school, this is ok with only a few bits shown. After all, this is for Madonna fans only.

This is as enjoyable as Mel Torme And Friends without the benefit of guest voclaists and in spite of more Torme idiosyncrasies.

The problem is you have to loosen the screws to tune one key and in that you might make other keys out of tune, and you can't test how you did till you have screwed them back on (and that changes the pitch as well)It's not a big deal, that's why it still gets 4 stars, it's only slightly annoying =p.

It's an example of good intentions, bad results. I speak Spanish fluently, and wanted to share it with my daughters through music. These songs are strangely translated, difficult to understand, and for both reasons, hard to sing along with. My girls cannot imitate the sounds and words, like they can on other Spanish CDs for children (for example, the Orozco CDs are fantastic).Furthermore, the background music is digital/mechanical/metallic - grating.Good things I can say is that there are melodies the children recognize, and the woman's pronunciation and elocution are pretty good.However, I do not recommend this CD to other parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like my neighbor singing","review":"I speak Spanish, and thought I would give this a shot for my music loving daughter, but neither one of us were interested for long.

It then provides one example that actually works.It is after that that you begin to see that there is a great deal of synergy required between GLSL applications and OpenGL itself. The examples provide (mostly) working shaders without even a hint of the OpenGL code required to interface with them properly, or even what some of the required parts of the shaders are (largely textures described by name only). Also conspicuously absent from this tome is any CD of examples, a common feature of computer texts.

I have never been to the south of the United States but his well-written story is vivid enough to let me feel it. This book takes the readers to the South!

The security problems only became worse when before the attack on Pearl Harbor, MacArthur authorized the defence of the entire Philippines and not just the Bataan peninsular. As a result of America's fear of a native force to protect the Philippines and MacArthur's overly ambitious plans, the United State suffered a humiliating defeat to the Japanese in 1942.

Yes, the problems are good.....but they'd be better if the text supported their difficuly, in which a good 90% dive into concepts that students have not encountered in the reading.Lectures are short and most are taught by individuals that could care less about intro physics students, so the student must learn a bulk of the course outside of the classroom.

I am particularly impressed by the way it handled Rotational Dynamics, Gravitation, and Simple Harmonic Motion. Its Electricity and Magnetism sections are equally grounded. However, the same cannot be said about Optics, Heat, as well as some of the chapters that belonged to Sound.

Am I the only one who has noticed the unusual smell of the print in this book? To be sure that I wasn't imagining things, I had my wife smell the book, and she too found it to be unpleasant. As a matter of fact, after handling it for a while, we both had to rinse our palates because of an unusual taste we had begun to experience. Did the publishers use an different type of inking process or glue for the binding? I look forward to hearing from anyone else who is experiencing this phenomenon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Limited but interesting view of the subject","review":"I like this book - it takes an interesting perspective on the subject based on economic forces in the supply chain.

I bought it because of the high reviews on this site, and then felt like it was not what so many had raved about. I think the author just wanted the excuse to play with words, which he does well, but the need for a plot is a major factor in a well written book and this just doesn't work. An island with no technology--an idiot savant to read the letters--a group of leaders (not just one man)that are crazy, or cruel, or who knows what their motivation was? Just not that great of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curiously Fascinating","review":"In Ella Minnow Pea, the creator of the sentence, \\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog,\\" is elevated to deity status by the residents of an obscure island nation. This sentence (which contains all 26 letters of the alphabet) is inscribed at the base of his statue. When letters begin to fall off, the island's High Council decrees that those letters be banished from print AND conversation under penalty of flogging or exile. Not surprisingly, the book becomes progressively stranger as more letters are outlawed. Dunn, however, manages to weave a compelling story around these grammatical restrictions. The result is curiously fascinating. If you're a fan of wordplay, creative use of English, and the like, this is a fun and surprisingly uncomplicated read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is very intersting, you want to keep reading to see what will happen next, and how they will be able to get by as more and more letters get taken away. It was a fun read and keeps you thinking after the book has finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and entertaining!","review":"If you love a good read that is written in a wonderful letter type style, this one is for you!The town of Nollop has a sentence supposedly created from their great founder. When the letters start dropping off, they take it as a sign from Nollop that they should stop using them. First offense you are outed publicly. Second offense you get your choice of corporal punishment. Third time and you are OUT! They will have you at Pier 7 within the hour.Along comes a journalist, Nate Warren, from the states to save the day! He proposes that if someone can come up with a sentence using 32 letters, 26 of the alphabet all being in there, maybe they might be being a bit hasty?You will find this book very enlightening and delightful! Mark Dunn has a way with words!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Play on Words","review":"Both the title and the conclusion are very clever. However, that is about all there is to this book. The author is able to play with words. I commend him for being able to find words that do not use the banned letters. With very shallow characters and a banal plot, even the word play becomes tedious about half way through the book. Perhaps Reader's Digest could condense it by two-thirds and use it in their sample give aways. I plan to donate my copy to the local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of my all time favorites, before finishing it!","review":"I don't want to ruin it for you ,just read it.

It was a quick but enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wib waste","review":"Waste of time, waste of space on my Kindle, and although it didn't cost much, a waste of my Kendle account Christmas gift! Preposterous and silly premise so inconceivable to interfere even with attempts just to slog onward through the chapters. Save your time, space and money - buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Thought-Provoking","review":"This was an excellent book. The letter format made for quick reading while the subject kept you constantly thinking. I found myself trying to resolve the challenge set forth in the story before I allowed myself to read the end. Although the vocabulary is quite challenging, I am considering using this story with my middle school students. It is a great exericise in developing a broader vocabulary by learning terms in context. The story also created a sense of political awareness and caused me to ponder the needs of a successful society. This is a book that should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'must read' for anyone who loves the English language.","review":"From the title right through to the fabulous climax, this epistolary tale will grab you and hold your attention.

This is a very slight book that you can read in a couple of hours, and it is OK, nothing more. It is somewhat clever, but built around a cheap gimmick and as such is rather one dimensional. I might have given it three stars but I feel the need to counter all of the excessive praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived, perverse, and yet readable","review":"In order to make the story work, so many bizarre assumptions had to be created that the whole thing feels very contrived. So it was very hard to read this book in the beginning, where all the contrivances were being laid out, particularly as they were laid out in an inelegant fashion. But once that was established, it was fairly good, not great, and something I did actually finish. Still, things were a bit too neat, everyone finding love and all that, the real baddies being deftly punished after realizing their failings, etc. Overall, I can't say I didn't enjoy it, but it was a relief to finish it. Books I really love leave me wishing they were longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ella Minnow Pea","review":"The book plot was novel; however far too preditable of an ending. The play on vocabulary was an intriguing puzzle at first, then became tiresome about half way through the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different but nice","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it is very different from the usual.First of all, it is all written in letters (mail between people) So you have to infer a few things. The second thing is the language used is extraordinary. I learnt a lot of new words from it.The fun part of this book is that it looses letters. Part of the story is how letters are forbidden from being used by the high official of the town and people have to use synonyms and ways around to not use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative, but not very interesting","review":"Ella Minnow Pea has a clever title, and in fact is very creatively written. I am sure it took hours of concentration to get everything right. And if you are interested in word play and word games, this is the book for you. The characters and the plot are just incidental. It could be a great allegory about Nazi Germany, but if it is, I missed it. If you are looking for a message or character development, this isn't the place."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing concept.","review":"I am in awe of the mind that conceived this premise and then put it in into words.

I learned a lot about the various tribes in Namibia, about the history of South African control of the country, and what life was like in the township of Katutura that the South African government moved black residents of Windhoek to. The reader also learns about how life changed there after independence.It was fascinating to read about life conditions before and after independence, and then go through Katutura myself in 2008. In Katutura today, you really see a huge disparity in incomes that has developed from the days of SA control.The book is based on surveys and interviews, so the conclusions appear sound. It's written in a very readable manner, so it's appropriate and educational for any traveler going to Namibia. I'd also strongly recommend books by Colin Leys to anyone traveling to that country.Paul"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Enya, Dead Can Dance, etc., consider this disk.","review":"A solid, listenable \\"best of\\" album.

These performances fall far short of those by the Aurora Quartet and the very different but equally attractive ones by the Henschel Quartet. Before you dismiss the Mendelssohn quartets--especially those numbered 1 through 5--as pleasant but mediocre works, listen to the Auroras and the Henschels. Unlike the Emersons, both the Auroras and the Henschels show that Mendelssohn wrote at least five quartets that rank with those of Brahms and Schubert. In sum, there's much much more to these quartets than the Emersons reveal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislabeled","review":"This album has a mislabel. CD 2 is said (on the album cover) to contain Quartets 4 and 5. CD 3 is said (according to the album cover) to contain Quartets 3 and 6. However, when CD 2 was played, the reading from the disc said that what supposedly was Quartet 5 was Quartet 3. So I had two Third Quartets. But the keys were different, and, listening to them, they were obviously not the same. Which was which? I wanted to know, of course. So did my iTunes, which was as confused as was I. After a couple of hours on the Net I finally unscrambled the mess and found that the CD 2 Quartet 3 was indeed Quartet 5. And the Quartet 3 on CD 3 was indeed Quartet 3. If this were a Honda, the cars affected with malfunctions would be recalled. I think Deutsche Grammophon should do the same here. I do not remember evaluating this album but I should give it a 1/5 at this time for the annoyance.

The copy I bought was dubbed, and it was done quite well. Judging from the credits I can imagine that the subtitled copy must be hard to read.

You could cut it down to a quarter of the size and probably not lose any essential facts. But it would still be incredibly boring.While I sympathize with Melanie's loss of her friend, I find it amazing that she spent so much time on her own feelings, responses, actions, etc. during this time, and very little (and that little so chopped and flashback that your opinion of Bibi was not at all admiring) on her friend.Actually, by the first 60 pages, I had concluded that Bibi was rude and a spoiled brat, and Melanie was a neurotic cry baby. After that, I flipped through just to see if the boyfriend was guilty, and what the verdict was at the trial.I notice it's listed as something like $.21 used. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bloated book!","review":"This book quickly hits rock bottom then digs all new lows! It's an extremely wordy non-account of the death of a California student. I say non-account because a majority of the book is a digest of the writers emotional rollercoaster as she lives through the death of a friend. Too much time is spent on her and not enough time is spent on the real story, Roberta Lee. The cover boldly proclaims \\"Better than In Cold Blood\\", a quote from Harold Brodkey. Apparently Brodkey has never read this good work by Truman Capote or he wouldn't have made a statement like that. Save your money and read the back cover. You'll learn the whole story quicker that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too wordy","review":"I started out liking this book, but by the end I couldn't wait to be done with it.

Very long and drawn out.And I was pretty disappointed to learn that Bibi's family refused to let the author use any actual letters from Bibi for her book and the author just wrote all these fake ones for it.A disappointment, especially after following this story in the news.She left out the part where Bradley Pages returned to the body and had sex with it a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"JOURNAL OF SORROW","review":"Roberta \\"Bibi\\" Lee was murdered by her boyfriend in 1984. She was a close friend of the author and this book is about her murder and subsequent trial and sentence of the boyfriend.Melanie Thernstrom does a sterling job of researching Bibi's murder and including letters that, according to her, \\"sound like what Bibi would have written.\\" The only drawback is that this book is very verbose and could have been cut down in places.I also felt the author's description of her devastation over her break up with her boyfriend Adam was extraneous. As bad as one felt for the author, her love life really had nothing to do with Bibi.It is to Ms. Thernstrom's credit that she cared so much about Bibi that this book was ever written. It is a loving testamony to the strong bonds of friendship. Had this book been less verbose, it would have gotten more stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't a True Crime Book","review":"If you are hoping for a true crime story, you will be dissappointed (and probably annoyed) by this book. I wish someone would write a true crime book about this particular murder, but unfortunately The Dead Girl is more of a long, self indulgent journal entry- I learned way too much about the author's own emptiness and overly abstract,needy, and self-referential thinking style and not enough about the tragedy the book was purportedly about.I read the first third, skimmed the second, and then skipped to the epilogue.

Systematic child abuse, demonising of babies and a series of techniques guaranteed to produce neurotic, distressed teens and adults. The techniques advocated here are nothing short of sick, and do more to reflect a basic insecurity on the part of the author than they do a realistic, sensible manual for raising a child.When an author believes a baby is capable of \\"defying\\" a parent simply by wanting to get down and play, something is very wrong with that parent's sense of self-worth. Bradley seems to have done nothing more than externalise his own prejudices and fears and dressed it up as a useful resource for parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It!!!","review":"I was recommended the book and regret I ever bought it, and especially regret ever reading it. The person that recommended it to me spoke so highly of the book that I bought several copies off amazon before reading it, thinking I would give it away to friends since it was so good. What a waste of money! The author sounds convincing, but even Satan can quote scripture. Please don't buy it, don't buy the book or the ideas in it, they are greatly in error.

What a waste of paper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aiding and abetting a crime","review":"Child abuse is a crime. This book sounds like an instruction manual and rationalization of this crime.

I was never hit as a child and I do have a lot of self discipline problems that I don't wish upon my child, but I really have a problem with \\"chastizing\\" (spanking my baby with a light rod) whenever she steps out of line. The ladder (according to reb) would be damning my childs soul and body to hell forever... It just doesnt sit right with me and I wish I had never picked it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child Training Resources","review":"This is an outstanding book! Bradley balances his approach with what the Bible teaches about child training - goals of self-control, responsibility and Biblical wisdom. But the book is literally filled with excellent and down to earth advice on how to apply Scriptural principles in our homes in specific situations. The book is very adept at lovingly pointing out our blind spots as parents and giving solutions that are both grounded in Scripture and practical. However, Bradley does not see raising children as just following a recipe. Rather, he focuses on pointing them to God and His love in Christ. Every parent with children that are precious to him needs to read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too harsh","review":"It seemed to me that the author's approach produces a child's obedience much like what I would describe as a dog's submissiveness. It appears that a child can't approach their parent unless their head is bowed and their tail between their legs. Even the picture on the book doesn't look like a happy child to me, but one who is timid. I do agree that children need consistently enforced boundaries, but some psychological liberty with it. I much preferred \\"Love and Logic\\" by Jim Faye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad people blindly follow false interpretations.","review":"This books tells not to allow inappropriate language in the home. It also suggests the parents call the children inappropriate demeaning names. Isn't the number one rule of parenting that children learn what they see. If a parent is calling the child a little beast, that what they'll think they are, and that's what they'll learn to call others. Basic parenting 101 out the door. Children are not puppets to be controlled, but small people who need to learn. Discipline does not mean \\"chastising\\", but it means to teach. Also, not hitting your children and choosing not to have them be little puppets does not mean they walk all over the parent and have no rules as another reader suggested. My children have wonderful manners, yet the methods in this book seem like a hitler regime to me. I am not raising a nazi, but a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Child abuse, horrible","review":"This book is horrible. It is purely describing how to physically and mentally abuse children until they are numb. Its unbelievable that these books actually get written and sold.The book states that children are never to young to use the rod for whipping them.It quotes all the negative pieces that can be found in the bible to an extend which is totally sick. But it forgets to state all the huge pieces on mercy & forgiveness and kindness to children as per Jesus words.To me it clearly states that the writer fully misunderstood the bible and has no sense on children and how to care for them.Its totally appaling and I cannot stress enough to not buy it or use these ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advocates the use of a rod on young infants","review":"The use of a rod on a baby, let alone any child, is not sound parenting, nor is it truly advocated by God. I wonder, in following the Old Testament, if the author advocates stoning someone for gathering sticks on the Sabbath, or declaring your children unclean if they eat pork? The use of the Bible to defend physical punishment on a child is deplorable, and any Christian should remember that Christ put an end to much that was practiced under the law of Moses. Consider instead books by Dr Sears, Dr Greene, or Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child Abuse Wearing a Bible Mask!","review":"This book as well as others that suggest spanking and using the rod on children are blasphemous in the face of Jesus!

Amazon is encouraging child abuse by selling this book, and profitting from it. This is immoral.Anyone who thinks the Bible, or God, recommends beating infants is misguided in the extreme. Old Testament punishments are not generally accepted anymore, and were not encouraged by Jesus. Furthermore, the \\"beat your son with a rod\\" verses in Proverbs, when properly translated, mean to hit a youth, not an infant.Christians and others need to learn the art of compassion, of forgiveness and mercy. It's what Jesus wanted, and exemplified. To continue to claim God wants infants beaten into submission is not only misguided, it is risky, immoral, and unChrist-like.Try books by Sears & Sears, Pantley or Whitehurst for wholesome, gentle Christian parenting, or any parenting book about Attachment Parenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abuse 101","review":"If you want to know how to abuse your child and make them fear and ultimately despise you, this is the book for you.

He is a very loving child, always ready with a hug and kiss for those close to him. I don not want to dominate or control my son, I want to teach him right from wrong. I do not see the logic in telling him it's not ok to hit his friends at daycare, then turn around and spank him at home? Hitting is either ok all the time or it's not.

It is obvious that the negative reviews come from people that have never read the book. Reb speaks of obedience and discipline WITH THE LOVE OF JESUS CHRIST.Abuse is an action taken when a parent gets angry at their child, but what this book teaches is to love the child and discipline out of love for him/her not out of anger. If you discipline your child by spanking out of anger...Yes this is a buse. But this book does not promote that.

No child deserves to have the type of constant, physical punishment that he advocates in this book. It reeks of physical and emotional abuse.It nauseates me to read the constant them of breaking the child's will, and hitting children at every chance possible.This author's methods are abusive and sickening. Any child raised in the type of environment that he advocates will be in jeopardy of permanent physical and emotional damage.How about raising happy loving, smiling children? Effective discipline such as talking, redirecting, teaching, sharing, leading by example, will produce healthier, happier children, and in turn these children will age into better parents. I shudder to think what it would be like to be a child subjected to this type of torture that is outlined in this book.Amazon should not be in the business of promoting such garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I had this book years ago!","review":"This book will help you identify and correct areas of parental weakness in child rearing.

By considering the difference between an institution and an individual, the difference between what is right and what is admirable, and the implications of human limitations, Shaw gives a version of utilitarianism that is very simple to state, but surprisingly nuanced and complex to apply.This text is ideal for an introdutory ethics or consequentialism class that intends to consider utilitarianism seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting to know Barbra","review":"Through this interview you get a good view of Barbra Streisand.

What a truly amazing artist and what a welcome break from so much of the shoddy musicianship that exists in this age of Pro Tools where it's more important to know how to edit than to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time and Place for Everything - How about a Sequel?","review":"I've had this book for over ten years and still flip through it. When I recently moved, it now sits on the coffee table for anyone of interest.Especially after living in different parts of the country it makes it even more interesting.Are you curious if that new city you're considering has many people your age? Or maybe you want to know if it's too liberal or there's no demand for coffee or pizza by the locals. It's in there.Where do they eat donuts and enjoy woodcrafting? Is the town 100 miles away from there the opposite - with expensive wine and international travel the popular hobbies?My only suggestions are as follows:1. How about a latest edition (of course, some of the subjects can change too if need be)?2. See above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great HRM for price","review":"I wanted to more accurately record the calories I consumed and burned so I decided to get an HRM. I wanted one with a chest strap because they are more accurate, and I wanted one that had more features than the cheapo ones but not as many as the super-whamidine ones that look like mini computers on people's wrists. Long story short, this is just what I was looking for. My only complaint is I wish it had an audible alert when in workout mode telling you that it isn't getting a good signal from the chest strap. Sometimes when I'm running I'll look at my watch and see I've been going for like 1/2 a mile with no signal and no calories/heart rate being calculated. This alert could also let you know when the signal is getting weaker (maybe a signal strength meter that gives an audible alert when it's 2 bars or less) so you know it's time to change your chest strap battery. besides that, great HRM. I use it every time I workout or play a sport."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for a Runner's Watch","review":"Got the N5 for a birthday present. Never could get the heart rate monitor to work. Operation Guide refences wetting two electrodes but none are visible. Ran three miles and worked up a good sweat and still no heart rate. Instead use the Chronograph like my IronMan Timex. However - NO WAY TO READ BACK YOUR SPLIT TIMES! Whaaa?? NewBalance website has a flaw and no way to get to the N5 description directly. Have to go to the store so no additional information is available. It would be nice to have some background on how to effectively use all of the features. The Operation Guide only shows you how to push buttons. On the positive side, nice big characters - easy to read while running.

A great deal of the information is inaccurate and poorly translated. Reading several of Huntemann's work, I would have to put the criticism on his translator, Huizinga. To say the least, Huizinga needs to take more time in studying his German before humiliating such an excellent author.

They also seem much shorter than the picture and with the waistband turned down would sit a good ways below my navel.

I work for a Wireless Company and everyone in our office uses the Scala because it works the best. The sound quality is awesome, the battery life is outstanding and I can carry it in the clip or on the lanyard so it is not always on my ear, which is nice.

I do alot of bike riding and wanted something so that people on the other end can hear me, not..well, you get the point. There was even a recording of what other blue tooth headsets sound like while bike riding, and what this is supposed to sound like. I was pretty disappointed, first time out all my friend heard was noise and not me. Other than that, it's a pretty good set up. It looks good and I don't feel like an automoton walking around. I like the fact that there is no name on it, since I wear it on my left ear. With a written name it would be upside down there. I'd somewhat recommend this, but not for the advertised noise reduction. It has an optional silicon ear piece extension, I would get that, mine didn't have it. I like the clip and lanyard that came with it, nice that it's included."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one you need to try","review":"With bluetooth headsets, there is much to be said about individual comfort and I have found this Cardo to be very comfortable for me. It functions very well also."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can Do Better Than This","review":"I got this headset about 6 months ago. It worked fairly well for the first four months, although the volume control was somewhat erratic -- nothing that I couldn't live with. However, in the past two months the bluetooth connection drops out unpredictably even though the phone is no more than three feet away at all times. I know that it's not the phone (LG enV) since the connection between it and my Motorola stereo headset never drops.Aside from that (which is a deal breaker in my book: if I had known that this would happen, I never would have bought this headset), the earpiece is fairly flimsy. I haven't broken it, but I've come close several times. I also noticed that the price on this headset has gone way up since I bought it at $29.99. Why? -- I couldn't tell you. But it's not worth it -- for $43, you can do a whole lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and affordable, easy to use...","review":"I am enjoying this headset.

My cat started vomiting after eating the Salmon Greenies. I compared them with another package only to find that they had yellow-orange spots instead of being entirely green. I smelled them and they smelled different too. Normally Greenies are great treats for my cats but rancid products are not acceptable. EntirelyPets and other suppliers have to be aware of the age of the product they are selling according to when they buy it fromGreenies. I could not find an expiration date on the packages. Greenies is manufactured by S&M; Nutec and they should be providing expiration dates."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought they were great until I learned about menadione sodium bisulfite","review":"Thanks to another reviewer, I learned today that Greenies contain a synthetic, controversial ingredient, menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB), that is highly questionable and considered by many experts to be toxic. I will no longer take that chance with my pet just because the FDA hasn't gotten around to banning it. Based upon the information I have read about it, the only apparent reason to add MSB to pet food is to claim it as a nutritious ingredient, namely, the k-vitamins that come from green plants. In other words, the basis of \\"Greenies\\" is a cheap synthetic version of the real thing. That must be why the ingredient label describes the stuff as \\"source of vitamin k activity.\\"Furthermore, although my 3 year-old cat has been eating between 6-12 Greenies every day, he is currently in need of advanced dental work. I see no evidence that these so-called dental treats are effective and they may very well be harmful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poison for your cats!","review":"We received a free sample of Feline Greenies in the mail today from PETCO. Our 13 indoor cats gobbled the entire 1-oz. package in less than 10 minutes. Even our finicky eaters loved them. We are very careful pet owners, double-checking every ingredient in anything that they eat (in the same way that we watch our own food). Unfortunately, I fed first and checked later (something that I have NEVER done before and will never do again)!Imagine my dismay when I found menadione sodium bisulfite in this product. This toxic, unapproved ingredient has no business in our pet food. Its use is prohibited in many European countries, and our own FDA won't approve it.We have requested that PETCO discontinue the sale of this product immediately, until the manufacturer removes this poison.If you love your cats, you will not feed this product to them.

I looked at several of the individual pods to check for expiration dates (because they do go bad) and couldn't find any. So for all I know I could have been preparing old and expired espresso.

Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz is inspirational as a poetess in particular and Paz salutes this woman with his hefty biography filling in the blanks as to the influences that surrounded and imbued Sor Juana with her colourful figures and joyous sufferings that inspired her to dig for gold in the mines of the baroque affectations of her time.

Well done and could work as a good coffee table book, but understand - there are few actual skater/skate shots, or anything about trucks or wheels.

The text is a classic example of a male pandering to the liberal feminist perspective. The women in the stories are transformed into heroines (yes, even Lot's two daughters are heroines) and the male characters are generally vilified, along with the scheming misogynist Rabbis who perpetuate the \\"traditional\\" readings and the nefarious scribes who emended the texts to suit their personal agendas. Kirsch questions everyone's motives but his own, injecting salacious interpretations all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harlot; Honest, interesting insight into the \\"hidden\\" bible","review":"Harlot by The Side of the Road was not only an interesting read that kept my attention throughout, it was a refreshing viewpoint which challeneged religious boundaries and censorship. The book focused on stories from the bible, well researched and explicated, which are not usually included in biblical texts. Kirsch has taken taboo subjects and explored them as part of human nature. I found that Kirsch retained a great sense of respect for ancient texts while trying to keep such sensitive subjects open to speculation and exploration. This was a great book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to biblical scholarship","review":"This is a fun way to get into biblical scholarship. The author starts with Biblical stories that can be hard for us to understand because they seem very immoral and strange (Why did Lot offer his daughters to the men outside his door? Why did Tamar want to seduce her father-in-law? What was the night attack on Moses?). He then provides some history and understanding of the era and what may be behind the writing. I came away from this book thinking of how much richer the Bible is than I had ever imagined! For example, two stories may have been combined by an editor. Or the author may have had a personal axe to grind(attacking the Benjaminites in another story). Or the translator may have mistranslated some of the words. It helped me to see what a fascinating subject this is---combining history, language, customs and a lot of detective work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but not quite Biblical","review":"Kirsch has a very vivid imagination, almost too vivid.
