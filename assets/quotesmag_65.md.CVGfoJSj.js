There's no doubt Dabney Coleman is very good, but Bittinger's not as odious a character (and therefore original) as I'd been led to believe.

The bile is only diluted by the brightness of a beautifully-young Geena Davis and the smart sexiness of Joanna Cassidy. By the end of Season Two, Bill just seemed plain vile and mean-spirited.Although there were some moments, the overdone caricatures of the milk-toast producer, continuously- obsequious stage manager and stilted/ dated writing makes Bill into buffalo chips.

It has a few cuts that feature percussionist Andr�� Ferrari, but he plays trap set here rather than the small percussion he plays on later CDs. An early experiment with louder electrified versions of V?sen?

These tunes, recorded relatively early in Burke's impressive career, may seem somewhat less-refined than his later work with the Bothy Band and Patrick Street, but his extraordinary talent on the fiddle really stands out with no distraction from accordians, uillean pipes, etc. in the background. The selection of tunes is excellent, and whether your passion is Irish traditional music or blugrass, you'll likely recognize and appreciate many of these numbers.

On a philosophical level, this is one of the most realistic films I have ever seen. The theme of this film will touch you deep inside.

So we adjusted and now pull the unit as far away from the cabinets as possible. And what you've read about the carafe is absolutely true. This is so thin and fragile, I'm certain it will be broken before I get a chance to buy a new machine. We have not used the water purifier and don't think we need in our area, however, the coffee is extremely cloudy using PAPER filters. I couldn't be more dissatisfied.

I felt too guilty to trash it...My number one reason for disliking it is that the carafe is designed in such a way as to always spill, drizzling coffee down the side of the carafe onto the counter every time I poured a cup. The second thing I disliked about it was the fact that the control buttons for the time, etc., would constantly jam. They were little push-buttons and would get stuck \\"in\\". Also, did I mention that every time I made coffee, the faulty carafe was a hassle because the water had to be poured into the top and of course, water would get all over the counter.It sure made coffee fast, though.

I took it in to the official Braun representative in our area. They wouldn't replace it, but they said they would repair it. After three phone calls and three months I finally got it back. According to the repair place they had to repeatedly ask Braun for the parts. I guess since it was a manufacturing problem and wasn't making them more money it wasn't a priority.

Now that we own this coffee maker we found that we are really satisfied. The coffee does indeed taste very good. We especially like being able to control the hot plate temperature. Programming wasn't as difficult as [they] and others have said. Simply hold in a button for a couple of seconds for the feature you want to set. Once the light starts flashing use the \\"H\\" & \\"M\\" buttons to set the time. Once you do it you'll understand and it's easy to do. We also found that the Gold filter wasn't worth using.

I am buying a new one, even though my old one still works great. I appreciate the ability to control the hot plate temp, the programming, etc. I also prefer paper filters because of the mess with the reusable one, but that's something I learned long ago. Still, it's nice to have that to fall back on since I sometimes run out of filters! I brew 3 to 7 pots of coffee each day and have never had a coffeemaker last this long. I'm only replacing it because the water from our well tends to do nasty things and decalcifying will only work so many times. Another thing I learned long ago. This is a great coffeemaker and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a serious coffee drinker, look no further","review":"After making our first pot in this machine I was amazed at the difference in my coffee.

If you buy premium coffee, buy a premium maker.... this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth coffee","review":"I looked at many coffee makers on the web and the Braun seemed to out shine all others.

I also like to be able to remove the grounds basket and carry it over to the trash before emptying it.

I bought KF 187 12-cup FlavorSelect Braun coffeemaker 1-1/2 years ago because I wanted a coffeemaker that would brew good full-bodied coffee. This coffeemaker does the job as long as the filter basket remains shut. I had trouble from day one keeping the filter basket locked in place. Now I stand over the coffeemaker continually locking the filter basket until my coffee has finished brewing. I am looking for a new coffeemaker that will brew coffee as good as this one but cheaper. I paid[a lot] for this Braun.

After wearing them on two 30-minute long walks, they were already falling apart and had a huge hole in them, rubber grip on the bottom flapping off.

The seller shipped them ridiculously fast. However, as I sent my puppy (he's 60 pounds at 8 months) out in the rain, I was surprised that he came back with these still on. As tight as you can velcro them, he \\"could\\" use his teeth to take them off. Also I noticed after taking them off, his paws were wet. UGH! Not waterproof as the water went right through them. Defeats the purpose of wiping off his paws. They will be could for avoiding mud \\"if\\" he comes back with all 4 boots on.

He did hate them, and they fell off before we could snap a picture.There's no elastic in this material and it's very thick and stiff, so it was difficult to get them on him securely. We did our best to wrap the Velcro band around them well enough that they'd stay on, but the material just bunched up a lot in the back. Because they bunched up so much, snow and water could easily get in through the top.They lasted about 2 seconds on my dog and as soon as he jumped up, they slipped right off.

Usually I don't like the Voyager books as much as the TNG novels, but this one was the BEST! I loaned it to a friend of mine, and we both agree it is at the top of our Star Trek lists! While the characters do act out of the first season, the story, action, and humor made up for any inconsistencies. A few gripes: Janeway gets mad way to easily, and threatens to demote various crewmembers and throw them in the brig! Yes, B'Elanna's competence crisis did seem a little out of place, but more in line with season one, and her latest problems dealing with emotional difficulties made it seem a little more plausible. Tom Paris NEVER called Harry \\"Kim\\"Except for those few mistakes, the book lived up to and in fact passed my expectations.

I just hope my 8 month old enjoys just as much as everyone else says their children do. I guess we will find out when Christmas gets here. I do think that the toy (for its size and all that) is a bit pricey. I just hope it is worth it. I bought it because I love the neurosmith products and already have a pretty decent size collection of their products for my children for Christmas also. I know I like the toys (seeing as how I played with them in the store first); I hope that they both will too. The only complaint I have about this toy is that I wish that the cartridges were compatible for this toy as well...so that way there would be a little more variety for the music concepts with this toy. Other than that the toy sounds great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neurosmith is out of business. Do you really want their deeply discounted leftovers?","review":"I was going to write a review chastising myself for having been stupid enough to have overpaid for their Sunshine Symphony. Since then, I see Amazon has dropped the list price to $35, and has discounted it further, down to a sale price of $9.98.I have noticed other Neurosmith products with similarly high product mark-ups, and wish I could be a shareholder of a company that is so adept at exploiting the pocketbooks of new parents. While trying to research some of their other overpriced toys, and those toys' declining price histories, I found the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has recalled a Neurosmith toy (the Pet Me Platypus), and that the manufacturer is no longer in business.So, Amazon is giving you a 71% discount (complete with free shipping!) on a toy that is leftover from a manufacturer who no longer exists.

Sooo... long story short, the package is set up for people to press a button in order to hear a sample of the music. The instructions inside the box say to remove the wire before giving the toy to baby, so I just snipped it right at the battery case. The instructions should clarify that the wire must be pulled out completely in order for the music to play on mode 2, the touch mode. It is a wonderful toy and I love that the music is real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Buy!!!","review":"This toy was given to my little girl at around three months. I wish I would have conceeded to spend the money sooner for it. She was able to activate toy at any early age. All it takes is a gentle touch or brush of even a floor vibration. She has loved this toy and still loves it at 10 months! I love it too- it is not musically annoying like so may other electronic toys on the market. It also has been very safe for her, even at an early age, because it is plush. We highly recommend it to anyone. Especially those who loves classical music as we do!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST Buy! Great durable cute baby toy!","review":"WOW, I can't say enough good things about this item. You must buy this for yourself or it would make a great gift. The music is calming and not too loud. The lights and design are adorable. It's durable - my son is about to turn three and it's still in his room. Plus the batteries last a long time. I think I've only changed them twice.

A definite good choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neurosmith out of business","review":"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She actually got to listen to the music once. It just won't play music more than one time on a set of batteries. It will play and then all the lights get stuck on. I contacted Neurosmith (don't even bother with the phone number...use email). I was told that they were going out of business, and they couldn't help me. They said to contact the store I got it from. Well, they had closed too (Discovery Store). So, I have a $40 teething toy that to be honest, she would rather play with anything else.

My baby does like this toy, the music is pleasant and has a great sound quality and the toy is soft and bright and easy for my baby to hold. However, my baby likes just as well a Fisher price stuffed puppy that plays the alphabet song and was less than 20 dollars. If your baby likes music, this is a great toy, but so are half a dozen cheaper musical toys that are made by equally respectable companies like Fischer Price or Leapfrog. It's a nice toy, but is it worth paying double what similar items cost? I'll have to wait and see--for now my baby loves the alphabet song just as much or more than he loves classical music....Even classical music can become grating to a parent if you hear the same selection play over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money and a piece of junk","review":"I bought this for my son based on the glowing reviews hereit was a mistake. My son wouldnt play with this toy and ignored it for the most part unless I place the toy into his hands or gently place a flap in his mouth so he can bite on it. I wouldnt buy it if it was on sale for 1 dollar.The music quality is very good however because of the very few notes it gets quickly annoying. Imagine trying to hear one note from Mozart however great, over and over and over againThe unit would hangup numerous times, and I have to do a manual reset for it to start again. Save yourself some money and get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun For Babies","review":"My little boy doesn't play with it a whole lot but I do like it. The music has two switches for volume so you can have it low or high. Everytime you touch the sun it plays music or lights up which is great for babies. I like the idea that you can leave it on and when my son does want to play with it all he has to do is touch it or roll over on it and it plays for him.

He is Autistic and half blind, so it's tough to find something he will play with for any length of time. He loves music, and the sound quality is great. He also loves things that light up. Because his vision is bad, he has to mouth objects and such, and this is right up his alley! He can chew on the plastic chew top, and finger all the different textures. It is easy for him to activate, and it shuts off by itself when he is done. The price was great, I love this toy company. We have had it for 3 days now, so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"I bought this for my grandson when he was born and took it to the hospital for him.He was premature and had a few health problems among them acid reflux. From the very beginning the music has had a very calming affect on him. The nurses even let my daughter keep it near his bed and played it for him quite a bit. Now at 3 months he still loves it and it works like a charm to calm him down when he's fussy. LIke one of the other reviewers, I to thought it would be larger than it is but---its still a good size toy. It is brightly colored, has flashing lights to get the baby's attention, each sun ray has something different for the baby to do, there's a sound adjustment and the music is the clearest I've ever heard on an infant toy. This is absolutely worth the money (I now have one at my house to) and I would advise anyone to purchase this--(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a sitting baby","review":"When I first read the reviews for this before buying it there were a lot that said that a downside was that it was too heavy for the baby to really manipulate, but I bought it anyway because I really liked it and because it was on sale. For the first few months we had it my son really wasn't interested because he couldn't play with it on his stomach or back, but when he turned 5 months and learned to sit it quickly became one of his favorite toys. He plays with it everday for 10-15 minutes at a time, a long time compared to his other toys, and hasn't shown any signs of tiring. The music is wonderful and the colors are bright and attractive. The heavy weight of the toy, I have found, is actually a plus because it helps it to stay sun side up while he is playing with it.

Many psychologists supported the idea, but many of teachers in the book integrated their classrooms with vigor, which inspired some children to embrace diversity. For example, a Jewish student asked her parents if she could celebrate Christmas and they said yes. Yet, some schools lacked the understanding of diversity - one school's idea of a diverse classroom consisted of a special needs student in a class. The book sets in the 1990's evokes deep questions about race and its place in the American classroom, which are still being answered.Steven C.

To play, you string up a net like for volleyball or badminton.

You have to catch and immediately throw the ring, and only one catch per side. Server stands at the back boundary and frisbie-throws over the net. These rings are great because you can't throw them excessively far so they go over the fence a lot less often than a volleyball. And two people can play as easily as 6 or more.

It's almost too quiet, especially when the kids are plotting, and that makes the tone feel kinda dark and scary when it should be more of an engaging adventure. The editing is also slow and with the way the dialoge is cut it feels unnecessarily drawn out. Also, after the gang solves the mystery, the movie takes a strange turn into some sad domestic issues. A little too heavy for my kids. I rented this movie for my boys, 7 and 5, because the dvd got good reviews, so we were disappointed that it wasn't that interesting. The 5 year old lost interest after 10 minutes, and the 7 year old wasn't impressed and checked out after about 40 minutes. We won't be renting the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS!","review":"If a bowel movement could be recorded and put to music, it would sound worlds better than this crap. Who's the IDIOT that decided to record this lunitic?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the wallflowers series so far!","review":"I think the contrast between Evie and Sebastian can't be more pronounced and that what makes this novel a real great read. I read one not-so-good review and the other two novels although also very well written seemed more on thr typical of current novels were women are somewhat stubborn headed. But what makes this truly my favorite is how love can transform a person into loving something that one didnt expect. This is purely magic. As for that one reviewer who said that Evie is boring. There are still few girls around who is quite like her and they are also quite rare. Need I remind you that Sebastian fell in love with Evie because she was different and innocent. He was already bored into having affairs with women who are exactly her opposite because they seemed to be quite common!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, interesting characters, with complex relationship","review":"One of my favorite romance novels. The hero and heroine are both imperfect in their own ways, but somehow, they make for a believable couple. A lot of interesting characters from previous books and a few new ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"the charmer and the socially inept","review":"I awaited this book with bated breath. Although Lisa Kleypas did not disappoint, I do believe I let my imagination carry me off in an entirely different direction to what she portrayed. I was hoping for a FAR more devilish hero, one that I would love to hate, but with whom I would eventually fall in love (at the same time as the heroine, naturally). I awaited internal conflicts between the pair, rather than those of an external variety. The Sebastian of my imagination and the Sebastian of the story were two different souls.Evie was reserved, shy and beautiful, with an immeasurable depth of empathy and caring for others. Sebastian (not the wicked rake of my dreams), the fallen Angel, was jaded but rather easily affected by Evie.Despite my expectations for something else entirely, I still found myself enjoying both hero and heroine immensely. They meshed well, and played off of one another beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, Great Characters","review":"However the WORST inside cover art I have seen in ages. Who are those people? They have nothing to do with the characters in the book. And what's with describing the heroine as having \\"Glassy doll-like\\" eyes?? Gave me the creeps."},{"rating":"2","title":"WallFlowers!!!!!!!","review":"JUST LOVE THOSE WALLFLOWERS......THE SERIES JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.

SHE'LL JUST HAVE TO GET THE LAST ONE PUBLISHED ASAP CO'Z I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHO DAISY WILL END UP WITH.....2 THUMBS UP FOR CAM!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my absolute favorites","review":"I love kleypas, and of her series, I love Wallflowers. And of the Wallflowers, this is my favorite! I have even purchased it in paperback and online version.How to sway other's that this is a good book? The heroine has qualities that are unattractive in her day, has lived through difficulties that have given her psych issues, and she is determined to run away. You can see the slow progression of the hero's interest, respect, and eventual love of her. She deserves it but doesn't demand it. There wasn't fighting between them, but there was his confusion of him becoming a refromed rake without him meaning too. It was great to see. I always like it when an author makes you see something develop rather than just announcing that something has happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh turn for a traditional setup","review":"This romantic pairing -- the shy wallflower and the irredeemable rake -- is traditional in historical romance, but Kleypas manages to make it fresh and have her characters stand out from the crowd. Evie's home life is so horrid that one can understand why she'd approach Sebastian with her proposition (and one can even understand, if not condone, why her family might treat her that way). Sebastian has more of a transformation over the course of the novel than does Evie, but it seems a reasonable one, as his restless energy finds an outlet and a focus. With only one book in Kleypas' \\"Wallflower\\" series left to go, I'm eager to see what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read, but not that good","review":"Evie Jenner is about to come into a lot of money. The only problem is that her relatives a terrible lot that would not care if she was death. Sebastain, Lord St. Vincent as a title, a known rake and very little money. So Evie thinks that marriage is a idea that will help both of them. But there are still dangers out there that could mean the end of these two.\\"Devil is Winter\\" is the third book in the \\"Wallflowers\\" series by Lisa Kleypas. I am going to from the start that I read book one last, didn't finish book to all, but with book still on my bookshelf gathering dust I thought that it was time to read and get out my way. It was an ok read, but I thought there wasn't really much drama in the book and the characters were not the interesting. This doesn't give much hope for book four, which I have to still read. Overall while some people seem to loved this book and series I was not one of them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading book 1 & 2 in the series I was really disappointed in the lack of believability in the story.

I didn't finish reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have quite a few of Kleypas's books but after reading the last two I am becoming less of a fan. The first \\"Wallflower\\" series books was definitely the best of the bunch. My main gripe with the book is that there is no sexual tension, no teasing buildup to the big love scene. Evie and Sebastian elope and do the deed within the first 4 chapters.Additionally, the backstory is a re-tread of the gambling house from Dreaming of You - a much better book.Worth a read only if you are a Kleypas fan and you get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet!!","review":"Of all of Wallflowers Books, this is the best one yet! I am in the process of reading all of Lisa Kleypas' books, and so far I have loved everyone of them. This is like the 10th one that I have read and I enjoyed this one the best so far. Keep them coming Lisa!! I believe she has a wee too much sex in them but I just skip the parts that go on and on and on....."},{"rating":"2","title":"SURPRISINGLY DELIGHTFUL!","review":"Something that I haven't found in a book in quite a while--a pleasing pace. The story moved along beautifully without getting bogged down by the heroine going through chapter after chapter of self perusal (which I really hate). It was a fast, light read that was entertaining and pleasant.I had not read any of the other books from 'The Wallflowers' series so I had no preset expectations about the main characters. I found them realistic and delightful. The story did start to fizzle out toward the end and could have been wrapped up a little sooner, but it's definitely worth a reread on down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Notorious Rake? YES, Pleeeeeeez!","review":"So far, this is my favorite of the Wallflower series. I liked both of the main characters very much, and enjoyed watching them develop. I know that it's unlikely a notorious rake like Lord St. Vincent could fall madly in love with a shy, stammering girl like Evie (especially so quickly), but you can always hope.Most of my enjoyment came from St. Vincent's character. I don't know what it is about bad boys. In real life, I do my best to stay as far away from them as possible, but I know I would be doomed if I ever came across someone like Lord St. Vincent. You can only resist raw passion and intense animal-magnetism for only so long.The Devil in Winter is a satisfying read and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded My Very High Expectations","review":"I don't believe I have ever anticipated a book more than I did Devil in Winter, and the reality exceeded all my expectations. St. Vincent is the most amazing character Lisa Kleypas has every created (and there is some substantial competition for that title in her extraordinary catalogue of heroes). And Evie is his perfect match in all ways - so very much substance beneath that shy exterior. St. Vincent grows and changes without losing any of the devilish charm that made us love him in the first place. Buy this book. Buy a copy for your sister and your best friend (and don't lend it to them because they are never going to give it back)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...although it seems very familiar.","review":"This book is very entertaining...but the hero seems very like Derek Craven from \\"Dreaming of You\\", not that I'm complaining because is one of my favorite characters of all time! So I still thoroughly enjoyed this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been a five star book","review":"I enjoyed this book! I hated Sebastian to begin with and I almost didn't finish reading the book. But I continued on and I liked him. It could have been a 5 star book for me accept... when he changed I felt he changed too fast as bad as he was, and I really didn't see what she did to change him that fast either.I would have liked to see Sebastian put into a tempting position with a gorgeous other woman or two, to see if he could be faithful to Evie or not. It is easy to be faithful when there is no temptation in sight. I would also have liked to have seen him develop a little more unselfishness towards Evie and others in general. Sebastian's jealousy of Evie was really another form of selfishness. But all in all it was pretty good, worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa's best yet!","review":"I'm a big fan of Lisa Kleypas and this is by far her best yet! From the moment I opened the book to the time I read the last word it was nearly impossible to put this book down. The characters are so fun and exciting that I couldn't wait to turn the page to see what would transpire next! Lisa gets better with each book that I only wish she could write 3 or 4 at once so I wouldn't have to wait so long between them! Two thumbs up and 5 BIG STARS for Devil in Winter!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I love anything written by Lisa Kleypas and this book is no exception. I really like it when writers do a series of books. I found all of the other \\"Wallflower\\" books at used book stores, but not this one. So I was glad when I found it on Amazon.com.

WITH LOTS OF ADVENTURES!!! A MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite of the series","review":"The Wallflower series is my favorite series of books that I have read in a long time. The devil in the winter is my favorite of the series. Evie is so brave to go to St. Vincent after he just kidnapped one of her best friends. Also the way St. Vincent tries so hard not to fall in love with Evie, but does any way. This story is sweet and I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit boring for me... Not as good as her first two books","review":"Was it just me or am I the only one who found it boring? I am more than half way through and am trying to force myself to finish. It's not as fun, and light-hearted as the first two in her series. I loved the first two, and I loved the strong and fun heroines. I found Evie to be so morose, unemotional, unexciting, and a drag. I don't see what St. Vincent sees in her at all. If I were him, I'd go after someone else. The book seems so serious. I don't want to read about her abuse in a romance novel. It's depressing. The only funny part was when they were getting married at Gretna Green. That was cute. But other than that... I did skip a bit to the end and I think it picks up a little there. I hope so. So far, I don't like it very much, and I usually love Lisa Kleypas' work, especially her two Wallflower books. They were fun reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dissapointing","review":"I thought this book was so formula and boring I could not wait for it to end. When I finished it I was very glad. Ridiculous formula and predictable plot. I don't understand why there are 4 and 5 star reviews for this garbage.

On privatization, this book praised the successful gradual approach of the government. On institutional reform and liberalization, the market forces and foreign investors seem to be transforming China into a \\"rational\\" and democratic system.Although the author distances himself from the neoliberals on the issue about privatization, his logic on institutional transition and modernization nevertheless make him more of a neoliberal than otherwise. This book described the policy reforms and changes of social control mechanism nicely, but not the social problems and challenges resulted from the reform.Optimism is fine, but downplaying the uncertainties and social ills associated with globalization is not. The excessive optimism of the book make it like an English version of a Chinese official textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilkin lunch box products","review":"We ordered this lunch box, and the space lunch box too.

Washes clean with soapy cloth. Very cute design, with purple background and colorful butterfies. Right up my 8 years old's alley! My son loves his astronaut bag too. They are made exactly the same inside, but with different colors on the outside. Very durable, and worth the price! Also comes with a long attachable strap for the over the shoulder carrying, instead of just using the handle by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"This is the 3rd Wildkins lunchbox I've purchased and the first one I've been disappointed in. It's very cute but it has no real shape. When my daughter picks it up, it just sags like a shapeless bag and does not stand up in the space at school where she needs to store it. Even worse, if I put the largest cold pack I can fit in the provided slot, it is melted by lunch-time and her food is only slightly cool; that's less than 3 hours.I do not recommend this lunch box - sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a female author...","review":"who isn't just out to bash men.

A must NOT read","review":"This book was so horrible and poorly written that it took me over 3 months to complete reading it. I couldnt get into the book because there was to much useless information not even pertaining to the plot and the characters were all one dimensional. I had to force myself to read a few pages a night,after the first few nights I realized that this is something you should read if you have difficulty falling asleep because its a very boring book.I dont reccomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The plot line intitially piqued my interest when I settled in for an interesting thriller with a theatrical backdrop. What I got was a flat, poorly written thriller \\"wanna-be.\\" The characters were uninteresting and all written in the same voice...much of the dialogue did not ring true to the character speaking it.

I was so hoping for another ending that didn't develop (those of you who've read the others know what I'm talking about.) Will give her next one another shot and hope for the best, if not, I'll pass on the rest of her 'formula books.' As an aspiring author, I know how dangerous getting into this rut can be.

Because, hey, at least this woman has the discipline to finish a manuscript and someone thinks her work is good enough to publish. So, does that change my mind about giving this book two thumbs down? Nah.A less promising beginning might have prepared me for the truly awful and unbelievably anti-climactic and waaaaay drawn out ending that lead nowhere. Tied up while her captors argue about....well, she never said what they were arguing about....the heroine says, \\"Two hours later I was even more tired.\\" Nothing compared to the stupor your readers are in by that point, Ms. Fairstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORRRRRRING!","review":"I seldom don't finish a book I start, but this book was an exception. Three quarters of the way through, I realized that I didn't care how it came out, who did it or about any of the characters in it.This book reads like a detailed list of someone's day, with all the minutia intact. Pages and pages go by with nothing happening that contributes to the plots of the story. The characters are one dimensional and talk in dialogue that reminds you of a bad B-grade movie from the 1930s.Ms. Fairstein is obviously taken with the higher society of New York City but she comes across as a snob in this book, yammering on about the ballet, opera, trendy restaurants, etc.This is the second book by her that I have read, but there won't be a third."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FAVORITE SERIES","review":"I absolutely love the characters in this series.

Though I once read only mystery books, it is rare now that I read a mystery. Last year, out of the 158 books that I read, only two were mysteries.So what would make me, a rare mystery reader, pick up this book? The same things that would make me pick up any book. I look for characters that interest me and a story that is compelling. The blurb on the back offers up the story in a way that appeals to me; I was intrigued by the idea of dancers. That's enough for me to pick up the book, but it's not enough to keep me reading. To keep me in the book, the author has to surprise me. Death Dance did not surprise me.

I new the answer to the mystery after the introduction of characters in the first few pages. Why it took the author 350 pages to tell this tale is simple...poor writing.She tried to string you along with a variety of likely criminals, but the story was just too obvious - and all that happened subsequently was just too boring and/or totally unbelievable.

As one review said, it probably would not be very stable if it was filled with knives.Well the first thing that I noticed was it missing one of the rubber feet on the bottom and would tip over easily so I returned it hesitatingly to Amazon for a replacement.I say hesitatingly because the quality of the wood and workmanship is not up to the Wusthof knives that it's supposed to hold. It's made with \\"slapped together\\" veneers and it is not even sanded smooth on all sides. I haven't decided if I'll keep the replacement if it's of similar poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"I ordered a replacement to determine if the poor quality of the first block was an individual issue rather than an issue with others. Both blocks had quality issues. The knife slots pictured on the box did not represent the sizes and placement of the slots on both blocks, which can be an issue with longer knives. The slots on the second block were significantly crooked. Will return this as well. Wusthoff and/or Amazon should improve quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are these real?","review":"Was just checking out the actual Wusthof website, and these look nothing like the ones they sell.

The only thing that makes me uncomfortable (and therefore did not give 5 starts) is the fact that this 'experience sharing' became a profit-generating tool. I would much rather see it online and share with everyone like a discussion group or something.

More frustrating than the old bike rack I was looking to replace. The strap and buckle system on this bike rack is not reliable. Without an additional double knot of the straps, they will begin to loosen and the rack will become unsteady and begin to slip away from the car (the very first time we used it, one of our three bikes dragged along the highway for a few miles, destroying the bike tire!).As tight as you make the straps, even with the double knots, once you load the bikes, the extra weight will loosen the hook connection with the car. Then you have to undo the knots, pull the straps even tighter and redo the knots, all the while negotiating around the mounted bikes. Takes forever!! Not the rack to get if you need remove rack for access to the trunk. And one of the plastic tie-downs broke the very first time we used this rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and good quality for bike mount.","review":"I had this I believed three weeks now and I like it I am just happy I purchase this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bike Rack","review":"The bike rack works really well with our Cavalier, not so great with our Suburban. We used it the day it arrived with two bikes on the back of a Suburban and it held for the few miles we needed to travel, but would have fallen off if we had further to go. The back wiper blade assembly was in the way of mounting the rack correctly. The rack does work great on the smaller car with a trunk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with my purchase","review":"Pros: Inexpensive, solid bike rack. The \\"hold downs\\" will make you think twice before you back out of your bike with two 1\\" straps holding your bike to this. However, our first trip with this was a 60 mile trip over bumpy and horribly maintained Louisiana roads. The bikes arrived and nothing was out of order.Cons: For those less mechanically inclined, it could be easy to make a mistake and not secure everything properly. This is partly due to instructions which are not the best in world and partly due to difficult to tighten straps.This bike rack is a great purchase. It is lightweight, secure and fairly easy to install (compared to other bike racks). It also fits on a wide variety of vehicles (my wife's car with a spoiler and mine without). If the instructions had been a bit better, I would have given this 5 starts easily.That being said, the value in this rack is IMMENSE. Don't pass it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good bike rack","review":"This rack is easy to put on the car. We traveled about 600 miles with 2 bikes on the rack. The 2 bottom straps tend to loosen up a bit after putting the bikes on, so it's a good idea to check on them when making stops. We also used some bungie cords for some extra security to keep the bikes attached to the rack. We had no problems with the rack or the bikes moving around. Overall, a good product for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"No grip...no fit","review":"I am difinitely not happy with this product. I attached it to my Outback station wagon and put one bike on it. Before I had gone far the straps had loosened and the bike was bumping up and down. It was dangerous. I stopped at a rest area and adjusted the straps again and tied them into knots to avoid this problem. The clasps should have teeth to dig into the straps to stabilize the rack. I still don't feel comfortable about using the rack and always watch it as I am driving. Who wants to do that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Saris Sentinel -3 Bike Rack","review":"This product is not rigid at all; it's just too flimsy, especially if you want to put on a couple of beach cruisers and a kid's bike.

I soon found that saving my NFL2K season wasn't working. After scrounging around online, I read an article stating that the card was unable to handle large saves, which appears true. I've had absolutely no problems saving/loading with House of the Dead 2 or Ready 2 Rumble, but as soon as I tried saving from NFL2K or NHL2K, the info was corrupted.

No warning, no error message -- I just turn on the machine and find that it says I have no save files. *Extremely* annoying. Even if it did this only once every couple of months I would send the thing back; if it's going to be losing my games once a week I may as well not even have a memory card.Don't go through the frustration of spending hours working through a game like Sonic Adventure and then find you have to start over from the very beginning -- twice. I've now seen in other Internet discussion that my experience with this product is common, and the usual advice is to use the Sega VMU instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is terrible","review":"After using it to store about half a season on NBA 2K it showed that files were corrupted and no longer works at all.

Talk about shooting people down in flames! I can speak from personal experience, yes, I received many rejection slips (this was two years ago), but I didn't give up, and WITHOUT ANY CONNECTIONS I was able to have my book published by a small firm that brought my novel into publication. The amazing thing is, a few weeks after I signed the contract, Simon and Schuster wrote me a letter expressing interest in seeing my entire novel. By then it was too late. In some instances it is beneficial to have an agent, but it is not impossible to get your book published on your own without connections if it is a quality novel.

I received this book as a gift and read through it, hoping it'd give me a good foundation in the writing experience, but truth be told, all it gave me was a bunch of phone numbers and email addresses, and a few tips here and there about writing. Don't get me wrong--several of the book's words of wisdom are invaluable, and it provides an excellent example of a book proposal. But if you're a newbie to the field--like me--and you don't even know what a book proposal or a query letter is, then I suggest you look up some other books first be4 going straight for this one.To sum it all up, if what you're looking for is an in-depth analysis of the writing/publishing process and have no idea know where to start, don't stop here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Music From Two Giants, Sound & Picture Quality is Poor","review":"Carmen and Sonny are two of my very favorite musicians.

I was working as a broadcast engineer when this material was produced, and the everyday technical quality of video and audio was far better than what appears here.

His unscrupulous taste for refreshing women like Darcie leaves no side effects from his infidelity.Darcie lives with her Grandmother and her Grandmothers wicked cat, who among other things keeps Darcie on her toes.

I was sorry I even finished the book. All the negative reviews this book received are correct. Some of the sub plots, ie, the grandmother, Claire, the relationship with her mother, her sister moving to NY had nothing to do with the story. Additionally, the author never fully developed those characters. Too much sex throughout the book and I actually had nightmares picturing the old grandmother having sex with someone more than 1/2 her age. The book was predictable from beginning to end and I should have skipped the entire middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly chick lit","review":"More of a romance novel than RDI's touted \\"chick lit\\", this story is amusing but falls short: 1.

This book was just awful! I can't understand of the life of me how the editors thought this book was a \\"Chick-lit\\" book. I could care less what happen to either Darcie or Dylan.

However, though I'm not in the habit of reading romance novels, I wouldn't have minded that aspect of this book if it had been well-written in any way. Obviously, it isn't. It's dull and shockingly unfocused. The contrived dialogue strains to hit all the necessary plot points and sounds totally unnatural. And why so many characters? Does the author really expect us to care about them all? I couldn't even bring myself to care about the main character--I hated her almost immediately.I was initially excited to read this book because it takes place in Australia--a welcome change of pace from the New York setting of most chick lit. Too bad the book was so terrible. It needed a serious editor to cut down the length and smooth out the writing. Too bad Red Dress Ink doesn't seem to employ any competent editors--and incompetent writer plus incompetent editor equals completely lousy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart, Ambitious Woman seeks Smart, Modern Novel","review":"If you're looking for a book about an empowered woman getting ahead in the world while keeping her love life in check, do NOT pick up this book. Not only was it frustrating every time the main character referred to herself by her full name, but the entire book could have been narrowed down to 2 pages. The relationships between characters were flimsy and narrator's point of view shifted unnecessarily. Let the knight in shining armor go rescue a character in a Judith McNaught book.

I love the Red Dress Ink series and this one had a great pitch. It was hot and fun and flirty, not the same old husband cheating or 30 something story we've read again and again. I thought it was a great cross between Chiclit and Romance. Isn't that the audience that RDI is looking to market to?? I just really connected with Darci, career going nowhere, trying to make it on your own, mom bugging you to come home,the once a week boyfriend, the friends, etc. She finally sees her chance to break through!

This book seriously lacks the usual female companionship found in the RDI and other chick lit novels, I really felt like this was some re-titled and beefed up Harlequin book.

However, her life is about to change when she gets sent to Australia on business and meets Dylan Rafferty, a sexy Australian sheep farmer.This is a quick read that borders on the ridiculous, as the plot is unrealistic for most of the book, and often seems only to serve as a lead to one of the many, many sex scenes, many of which are also ridiculous and implausible.Darcie irritated me, as she is always complaining to her friend Claire about her lot in life, but appears to do nothing besides sleep with multiple men, whine, and talk back to her boss. The male characters have no personality at all; the only interesting characters are Gran and her cat Sweet Baby Jane.Only recommended if you're stuck on an airplane for a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of my least favorite RDI books.","review":"This was just an OK book for me. Darcie and her 84 year old grandmother having detailed discussions about their sex lives was just too over-the-top and unrealistic. As well, I was put off by Darcie's continued relationship with Merrick. The storyline had great potential, with an exotic setting, which could have been better developed.

Beyond that, you need interesting characters that the reader cares about, set in a story that moves with a compelling narrative. Perfect example, ATONEMENT. Sadly, SHADE joins the pile of books I put down after wading through more than 100 pages. I could not finish it even though I was trapped on a long airplane flight with nothing else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a miss","review":"Plodding and boring I could barely make it through this novel. Would not suggest anyone read it unless they are a diehard Jordan fan or wants to be tortured by slow moving text and dull characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Pace was ploddingly slow through the first 14 chapters. Characters weren't engaging enough to warrant finishing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This book reminds me of a false advertisement: pick it up and it sounds interesting, even those first crucial lines pull you in and then... Then we are pulled along on a tortuous journey into a writer's ego. This book is written in the kind of style that you want to be beautiful, even lyrical - Instead it's more often confusing. By page 17 I was skipping forward in hopes that it became more compelling. There is a languid air to Mr. Jordan's writing, which is fine as long as we care about what happens or why. Why the main character is killed by her childhood friend (no suprises, we know the killer's name on page one)is perhaps the clearest paragraph and half of the book. Unfortunately this doesn't happen until page 268, by then I was just glad to be done with it all.Mr. Jordan's screenplays are wonderful, but this book is pure self-indulgence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made cheaply!","review":"Grips fit the gun perfectly.

And unfortunately..... First off its already falling apart. Seams are coming undone, things you would understand are normal wear and tear but you'd also expect it to last more than three months. Secondly; I've noticed this comment made, it doesn't come w/ a strap. Funny thing is it has a ring on each end of the bag for a strap to connect to? Third the quality isn't strong enough to withstand knives that are in fact sharp. The material itself is to fragile to place sharp knives into w/o having blade savers or a soft cover, which will dull the blade anyways.This is a great bag though if you don't travel a lot w/ your knives. If your using this knife roll for storage than this would work fine, otherwise I'd recommend spending the extra money on something that will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my money...","review":"7 days after purchasing the item, the zipper wouldn't close.

If you enjoy the traditional jazz of the 50s and early 60s, you'll love this one. Joe has a very full sound with some very nice right-hand work. His vocals portray the cool sound of the 50s.To my ear, Chris Clark is the best bass player in the business today. He's been playing jazz professionally since the mid-fifties and played in Les Brown's Band at the age of twenty -- that's how good he was then. Now, after decades of practicing his art, he is PERFECT. Pefect rhythm, very creative solos, brilliant bass lines -- you'll love his playing.If you're into 50s-style jazz, you'll thoroughly enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samples of Very Good Jazz Bands","review":"This CD features three samples of each of six Dixieland bands, including Muggsy Spanier's \\"Great 16\\", Pee Wee Hunt,Kid Ory,and Jack Teagarden. One of Spanier's numbers \\"Dippermouth Blues\\" was recorded under its alternate title \\"Sugar Foot Stomp\\". The bands listed above are the better ones, with Hunt's \\"After You've Gone\\" leading off. These bands and selections represent some of the better Dixieland stuff out during the 1930's-'40s. Pee Wee Russell's and Jonah Jones' selections are not as well known, but are well handled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but far from, the best.","review":"Road depiction is very vague.

I use the Delorme \\"Utah\\" with my AAA maps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like all Delorme Atlases, it's great","review":"I'm planning a trip to California shortly, but I lived there for many years as a child. The Delorme for Northern California joins my collection of about 10 other Delorme maps for other areas I have lived and visited. Being a birdwatcher, we in the birding community often give directions to birds by Delorme pages. Makes life SO much easier. Although it doesn't have every little street in some areas, it does have MUCH more detail than the average road map, and makes it wonderful when you're like me and just want to head off in a general direction to scout for bird territory, but not necessarily follow the same path back. Love Delorme Atlases... wouldn't travel without them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Pocket Reference","review":"I bought these for use in backpacks and bugout kits. They are enormous measuring 11 x 16 inches. Perhaps not enormous, but a pretty large reference for a backpack. Perhaps NOT ideally suited for those looking for a pocket reference.They are printed on nice think paper and soft bound to a thick cover. These should last for some time. I agree with what others have commented that the roadways are not as prominent as a roadmap may be, but the roadways ARE pretty clear. No less prominent than the other features the map illustrates, such as terrain and landmarks. Where the AAA map mostly portrays roadways the USGS map portrays terrain. The DeLorme Atlas & Gazetteer seems to treat both equally. If one is just looking for a roadmap, they may find these a bit bulky. If you ever have to take to the \\"back roads\\" or find yourself in unfamallier territory - then this is the map for you. I will be buying more of these fine maps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delorme Disappointment","review":"We are knee-deep in genealogical research including location of real properties bought and sold by our ancestors in Northern California as well as other States. The Washington State Atlas and Gazateer has been an invaluable resource for us in Washington since it provides a range and township system so one can zero in on an actual piece of real estate given the land description. We were very disappointed when our Northern Cal. Atlas and Gazateer arrived to find it had no such system. If one is looking only for detailed maps, this atlas and gazateer would be o.k."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hat!!","review":"This is a great hat. It can be folded up and stuffed in a backpack. But most importantly, it actually fits loosely. It looks good and would be great for fishermen with large heads. My only complaint is that it's a bit hot for hiking.

So I left everything boxed up for months after it was received. We knew we were moving so we did not bother unpacking it. After the move we didn't have room for it at first so it stayed boxed up on a shelf. I finally got around to unboxing it and it literally was falling apart in my hands as I picked up parts. the glue had failed on all the plastic parts, so the \\"stainless\\" finish fell off the handle and worst of all the actual holders too!

She says it opened up so much space in her cabinet and she no longer has to shift things around to find the right spice. I'm back again ordering two more for her. Her only complaint is that the auto-measure dial is incredibly stiff at first and needs to be worn in a little bit, but she prefers the shaker or pour holes anyway. Other than that, this is a great product!**One Year Update**The product is not as great as I originally thought. It is not air tight, allowing spices to be exposed to moisture, and become clumpy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of cheap","review":"This is not at all what I expected for the money I paid.

Not happy with what we got to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"received returned damaged product","review":"So far I like the spice rack. I mounted it under the cabinet. It works well and saves me space. These are not air tight spice containers but they are for my commonly used spices so that is not a problem to me.My gretest problem is that I received one that had been returned damaged. The seller shipped it back out with a broken collar. Also it was put back in the box upside down so it was very hard to get out of the box.I glued the collar back on and because of the cabinet mount the crack cannot be seen. Still I think that the seller should have managed their property better and they should not have reshipped a returned product without inspecting it.The decorative collar came off my new dispenser as well but it was not broken and only had to be reglued."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad design and hard to maintain","review":"I got this because of the positive reviews but i hate it.

The item description misrepresents this spice carousel. I bought 2 of these so I could stack them. Pulled the first one out of the box and knew right away this is not what I expected. The front of one of the canisters came off. The handle would not go on flush. THIS IS PLASTIC PAINTED TO LOOK LIKE STAINLESS STEEL. The concept is great but the manufacturing quality is NOT. It is flimsy and not sturdy at all. Sending them BACK. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! If Amazon is smart, they will take this item out of their inventory or at least, correct the item description.

I didn't even get to use them. They leaked garlic powder all over. The front part is made of plastic (its all plastic) and it comes off...easily (no glue). The window is not attached, it is loose and there isn't any glue holding it and the front together. Boo. Good idea, bad manufacturing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very leaky. Cheap plastic, ugly when mounted.","review":"Very dissatisfied with this product. The main problem is that the containers leak horribly with anything powdered. Cinnamon and Paprika were the worst in my containers. If you shake the container over food without opening it, you can easily apply a good amount of spice. That's a problem. The plastic is really cheap feeling. It feels like you could break the containers into 5 pieces if you squeezed it too hard. I initially mounted the rack under my counter, but it was hanging at least an inch lower on one side because of the cheap warped plastic. This product is a great idea, but absolutely horrible delivery. The auto-mesures don't work for larger spices, and the smaller ones leak. Tightening the bottom screw will NOT solve the leak problem. Mine are leaking from all seams, and not just a small amount."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, efficient, elegant design.. terrible containers","review":"The negative reviews here said much (if not all) of what I would say.PROS- Love the spinning design, mostly efficient use of space- Looks beautiful, rotates wellCONS- Cheap, crappy plastic- NOT airtight, spices will leak- In hot, humid weather, you run the risk of your spices solidifying. I lost a full thing of garlic powder and onion powder to this unit, once those powders solidify, they're never the sameThis item would be perfect if not for the inattention to detail in the actual design of the containers. I'll be switching back to something sealed sealed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchenart Spice Rack as a gift is a big hit!","review":"One of my wife's most dreaded kitchen activity is trying to find a spice in her spice cabinet. I had seen the K/A rack while searching the internet and decided it looked like it would be a winner. It was, not often do I find a gift that is a hit. This one was and it was out of the park hit. I bought 3 total hoping that the stacking feature would work on our counter. I think it would have, but my wife likes the three lined up on the bottom shelf our the cabinet. She is so excited to not have to reach over 2 rows to find the right spice. all are neatly alphabetized and accessable with a quick spin. The only comment I have heard is that the 'shaker' spout pours rather quickly on some finely ground spices. so, you need to watch that you don't shake too much too quickly.My concern before I bought them was would it be a high quality item, I believe it is. well built and worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of trash","review":"The KitchenArt Pro Auto-Measure Spice Carousel is a worthless piece of trash. I put my spices in it and with days they were as hard as a rock. I could not get most of them out. The product is cheaply made, does not keep moisture or humidity from your expensive spices. The plastic window on the front pops off, at least it did on three of mine. If it were possible, I would give it less then the 1 star it got. I ended up tossing it and a lot of expensive spices in the trash.

The way it works now is the USB cable plugs directly into the printer, and the base is just hooked up to the power adapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS LABELER!","review":"I have tried several other labelers because I was hesitant about spending the money on this gem of a product. Well, that was all a waste of time because this time saver is worth every penny. As a professional office organizer, I use my labeler a lot and need it to be reliable and efficient.

A hired handyman who did several tasks to get the house ready installed it in the metal door between the house and garage and said this was a good product. The cats learned how to use it easily. Only minor complaint is that the little lock lever will slip and let the door open when my biggest cat gives a forceful push. Sometimes the door will open, the lever wil move to open position, and he gets in anyway. But overall I'm satisfied with it and would recommend for cats or little dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat Door","review":"We have a small dog, and wanted a door between the garage and house for her.

I used a cordless drill and a key hole saw, and got it done pretty quickly with a hollow interior door. I have 2 kittens and 1 cat. They all got used to it within the night. However, I advise not to use it for a bedroom door, or near a bedroom because the swinging door is pretty noisey as thy go in and out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'NO FEAR' DOOR FLAP!","review":"Good quality, easy to install, and clear visibility! We have two of these door flaps. Because we seal off our home to save heat and /or AC, this was a great way to let our cats get to the basement while keeping the doors closed. We have a cat similar to the one shown, that is a bit over weight and very timid. This pet door is large enough to see what's on the other side with plenty of room to get through without a struggle, so even he isn't afraid. Our energy bills have dropped considerably by using these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"We purchased this door so our cat could have access to our basement. We installed it in an inexpensive, hallow plywood type door. Because our door was not a great quality wood, I would recommend people use a jigsaw to cut the opening as opposed to a reciprocating saw (aka sabre saw) that the instructions recommended. It creates a more precise cut. Even still, we had a little minor splintering, but nothing a little touch up paint couldn't resolve.Our cat quickly got used to his new door and it allowed us to put his litter box in the basement. We have had no problems with tails or paws getting caught. Because our cat is an indoor cat, we have no need to use any of the locking mechanisms, so I can't say how well they work.It took us about 30 minutes to install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"This is one of the best pet doors available, based on my purchase of 2 others from Petco, which were sub-par and promptly got returned. Although my cat is not fat and I didn't need the larger size, this larger door is much better quality b/c it includes brush-like weather stripping around the door preventing drafts or air loss if you're using the door as a gateway to your basement or outside. It includes a magnet which keeps the door shut (good) but also creates a little tension so a cat must use more force to get through it (and probably doesn't enjoy their tale nearly making it through! - If your cat really hates the magnet-effect I think you could pry it out with a screw driver). Also, if your cat is motivated by treats it should be no problem quickly training them to use it. The 4-way lock is much easier to use than other doors I bought. Easy-install with nice template. Over all great purchase, and now we don't have to keep the litter box out in the open!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cat door","review":"I love the cat door. It allows me to keep all the heat in my apartment and allows my cat free access to her litter box in the basement room. It is neat and clean and only took her a few tries to figure out how to use it. My 35 lb dog goes through it whenever she wants to, but my little pug hasn't figured it out yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless. My cat easily defeats the lock","review":"I've had the same experience as Cecelia, another 1-star reviewer who said it well: \\"When the cat door is locked (can't go in or out), the cats can still get their paw under the outside edge of the rigid flap and wiggle it until they get it free because there is only one locking mechanism, and it is in the center of the cat door. In addition, the piece of plastic that stops the door from opening is only about 1/8 of an inch tall, so it's very easy for the cats to maneuver the flap out of the locking mechanism.My solution? I taped the cut-out pieces of the aluminum door back over the cat door and went back to leaving the door ajar.This door is absolutely useless for keeping cats in or out.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Pet says it all !!","review":"This is the one if you have a large Cat or small dog, (like a pom) has LARGE opening...not like others on the market that just say they are large... it works great, easy to install, locks the animal in or out or unlocked both ways.. easy for pet to open..my Puss just loves it.

I usually get 10 minute solution DVDs which I love. This one sounded similar so I thought I'd try it.I tried it once and it's unlikely I will use this DVD again. Denise Austin is soooo annoying! She talks NON STOP, and uses the most sickening cutesy terms. Also she only does maybe four reps at most of most of the excercises so it doesn't seem very effective. I didn't feel anything the next day at all. The excercises themselves did not challenge my body at all, however they still seemed way too complicated. I also didn't like the way a lot of the moves were quite 'dancey'. This DVD is ok for beginners, as long as you can stand the constant annoying talking of Denise. Personally, if I never hear the words 'zip up your abs!' again, I will be happy. I'm going back to 10 minute solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST TAPE EVER!!!","review":"This was by far,hands down, the WORST workout tape I've ever purchased-EVER. I actually threw it out.

It was terrible, please, take my advice - do not waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about","review":"a great work out! This one targets the areas that I certainly have problems with. I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Denise- chatty, but effective!","review":"I bought this not having any Pilates experience- while she does explain some of the basic Pilates moves, she adds her own twist to a lot of them.

I recommend this disk for anybody with a knowledge of Pilates, a training in ballet, or an interest in smoothing and toning muscles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Custom Workout Option!","review":"I'm really enjoying the Hit the Spot Pilates-I love Denise Austin's style-she's so positive and encouraging. The customized workout option is awesome, really allowing you to mix up things so as not to get bored with the same order and selection of the 10 minute workouts. The only thing I was disappointed in is that there is little for the arms on this video. But that was my fault-I didn't notice that it was focusing on the lower body. All in all it's a great DVD and I look forward to doing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs work","review":"I like Denise Austin and have many of her videos and DVD's with regards to strength training, fat busting and cardio work but she needs to stay away from Yoga/Pilates. She goes too fast and misses the idea that this type of exercise program is a slow, easy, relaxing method that allows one to work out and yes break a sweat but isn't done in a rah,rah style that Denise Austin is known for. As I said I am a great fan of hers for that but she needs to leave the Pilates and Yoga items to someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety...customize your workout!","review":"I have Denise's Pilates Mat Workout DVD that I've been doing for months. I got this DVD as a present and love, love, love it!!! My buns are sore as I type this. I know I'm working parts of my body that I wasn't hitting with her other DVD, though I love that one too!I love the variety and fast pace of her workout. I'm finished before I know it. You couldn't ask for more in a pilates workout DVD...pick whatever area you want to target ~ abs, waist, thighs, buns.And it's perfect for those who lack time on a work day and have more time on the weekend. It's all in one DVD! What a great buy. Better yet, it was a present! :)For beginners, I strongly suggest using her Pilates Mat Workout first before moving on to this one. This is a quicker paced workout and could discourage beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Challenging enough","review":"I have always been a big fan of Denise's and generally enjoy her workouts. This one however, felt like a waste of time for me. I am in pretty good shape, and it just didnt challenge me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing to follow!","review":"I ordered this DVD along with another pilates dvd by Brooke Siler. I did not enjoy the way Denise Austin instructs and teaches the exercises. I felt she moved too fast and some of the exercises were not very safe for someone who has had a history of back issues. She goes too fast. After two years I just do not use this DVD. I do not recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denise Austin's Pilates Hits the Spot","review":"As usual, Denise Austin has produced a great exercise routine.You can choose from 7 targeted workouts,using the Pilates method of core strength.Short enough to squeeze in to a tight schedule,but difficult enough to raise a sweat.I recommend any of her workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to do REAL pilates, this isn't the DVD for you","review":"I've done quite a bit of pilates via classes and dvds. Out of all my experiences, this was the WORST. While I'm not the greatest pilates practitioner, I do know that doing one more for a couple of seconds and then going into the next movement is not the right idea. She doesn't promote good breathing OR posture (VERY important elements in pilates). I only bought 1 episode and I'm glad I didn't. Save your money. Want a good workout? Check out Ana Caban or Suzanne Bowen. You won't be disappointed with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pilates Video","review":"This is a good pilates video. She is very thorough in her instructions and I definitely felt some \\"good\\" muscle pain the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denise does good again!","review":"This DVD is great in that it has lots of exercises tailored todifferent body areas. I have found it cumbersome to workthrough because each set of exercises has a different segment tochoose on the DVD, so you must stop periodically to click on anew segment.However, in fairness I have to say that they DO providean option for creating your own program, which is probablythe best way to do it.Denise does her usual excellent job of giving precise,simple-to-follow directions, and provides lots of varietyhere too. A beginner could probably negotiate through this butI would rate it as being better for an advanced beginner orintermediate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD","review":"Have to say - this is a good DVD. It is my second DVD that I have purchased on Pilates and this is by far a better work out thean the other one I have. The exercises are clear and quick moving. You can really feel the 'burn'! There is a good selection of different exercises and I have to say that, most importantly of all, I feel it is working. Denise Austin herself can be a touch painful to listen to over and over again but there are options where you can mute her! So, presumably she realises that she sounds painful herself! Overall, I would really recommend this DVD to anyone wishing to pursue Pilates at home on their own schedule. I wouldn't say that this is a DVD for absolute beginners since some of the exercises are quite tough and since it is fast moving it may be hard to really get the benefit if you are the whole time trying to work out which leg goes where."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denise Austin \\"Hit the Spot\\" - Pilates","review":"I usually like her stuff, but I don't think for a beginner her pilates is the best choice.

I'm new to Pilates, so this disk challenges me still. What I really appreciate on this disk is the ability to create your own workout line-up. I was able to pick the spots I wanted to focus on and work through them in my own order. I hope future Denise disks move in that direction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-rounded and well edited","review":"This DVD gives you the ability to cut and paste together an individual workout or simply to pick and choose \\"tune-up\\" workouts that focus on a particular body area. The individual workouts are fast and easy to follow. I took this DVD on vacation so that I could do maintenance everyday which I harder to do when away from my routine and the short program format was easier to squeeze in than a long form workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"hit the spop pilates","review":"A good mix of different exercises that you can do together or individually. This was recommended in our local paper by some fitness experts and I am not disappointed. I have been doing pilates for over 3 yr and have used other tapes - this probably being the most comprehensive. I have to say Denise is also easier to take on this one than on others I have owned. Another plus is the tropical background shots are welcome in the middle of a cold midwestern winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Dvd ever!","review":"She is way annoying.

Her exercises are fantastic & are helping me get into shape after having a baby (I'm now 30 so she still looks pretty good for her age!). Only problem with this DVD is it assumes you wont want to do all the segments. I wanted to work 30 mins on my stomach to flatten it post pregnancy + hips, thighs, bum & cardio challenge. Every time I do the workout I have to select all 7 segments as there's no option to PLAY ALL. I still like her style as she's very encouraging & challenges you to go further each time so you can watch it over again and not get irritated like with some other instructors. 'Loose an inch!' However, I would like a more advanced workout from her as after 3 months I'm finding it easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!","review":"You'll certainly feel the effects no matter which segment you choose.

I used it a couple years ago and lost about 20 lbs, so when it came time to diet this year, I just had to get it again. I like it because I can choose the specific workouts that are right for me.

The exercises are simple and although it looks easy, be prepared to sweat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for beginners a dissapointment for interm-adv.","review":"i was really excited about this video, but when i put it on i was extremely dissapointed. i come with a decent amount of pilates background and this focused nothing on technique and was so beginner i dont think i got any workout. the hips workout was a good burner though, but after doing this once i will probably never do this video again. she's way to peppy for me and i was looking for a much more serious pilates workout that would garner fast results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit the Spot - Pilates","review":"Denise Austin is a great teacher and explains all the moves thoroughly.

What I like about this DVD is that there are targeted exercise routines based on the body part you want to work on that day. So you can piece together several 10 minutes workouts to do as much or as little as you feel like doing. After doing 20 minutes, I have worked up a sweat and after 30 minutes I am feeling like I had a pretty decent workout. I wish she'd provide more instruction with some of the complicated exercises or that there would be a person to show the 'beginner' version of some of the moves. But all in all, its a good buy and I use it regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating!","review":"This is one of the first workout dvds I've bought and I really couldn't be happier. I love Denise Austin's personality! She seems fairly quirky and sometimes the stuff she says not only motivates me, but also makes me laugh. It's so much better than working out to a stone-faced trainer.I'm by no means a beginner, but this dvd will make you sweat because Denise utilizes some positions that are pretty challenging. I also like how each workout is specifically focused on one area...such as thighs. It's better than other workout dvds that offer one 10 minute segment to thighs, buns, and hips all in one.The one complaint I have is that Denise doesn't spend very much time on telling you how to position yourself while doing exercises. For example, she doesn't tell you how your back or neck should be aligned. I think that would have been more helpful. Otherwise, I love this dvd! I don't think I could work out to any other trainer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy, but it's hard!","review":"I enjoy this video work out.

This is the first video of hers I own, so I was initially put-off by her voice, but I got used to it quickly. (Plus, you can mute her voice, and keep the music if you choose.)I am also new to pilates except for another, much slower-paced Kathy Smith video (which has great pointers). So this is exactly what I wanted--a long workout (up to 60 minutes) that I can customize with a new set of exercises.Now I know that I have yet another video in my arsenal that will actually work my core continuously, while also targeting my legs.

This game is not easy which is nice. It also got a story which is pretty cool.

Works perfectly. It is noisy, but your crushing ice into a plastic bin, thats going to make noise. It does make a small puddle of water. All of this should be expected.Blenders just dont do a good job of crushing ice and your eventually going to burn out the motor. If you can find this model at a good price, I would buy it. Expect to do one cube at a time. Eventually you may expect an ice crusher to wear out. Crushing hard ice is difficult on a machine.

It's astonishing to think that anyone so out of touch with reality could have been elected to two terms as President. Slansky's brilliant book combines seemingly unrelated pieces of information into a cohesive whole that reveals, once and for all, the astonishing incompetence of the Reagan administration. As a bonus, Slansky also manages to skewer virtually all aspects of popular culture of the 1980's. Since those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it, this book should be required reading for all, lest we get another presidency like Reagan's.

One, some of the smaller knotwork details are indistinct, even missing. I realize they may be missing in the original, but for a coloring book I really feel they should have been extrapolated for completeness' sake. Second, the Latin script pages aren't translated, and the old calligraphy is hard enough to read that I can't translate them myself.Aside from these picky details, though, this is a gorgeous, fun coloring book, perfectly appropriate for the collector, either of coloring books or Celtophilia:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work as a coloring book","review":"I just received this and am rather disappointed.

This young woman's life story weaves through the palace intrigues of the Chosun dynasty in Korea, which for most Americans is totally unfamiliar territory.

I noticed it while watching the \\"B\\" westerns of The Duke's early movie career. Paul Fix wrote the screen play and is also credited for giving John Wayne his famous walk. In this movie, The Duke is a Man's man. He had that great charisma that is lacking in so many \\"stars\\" today. The story is simple and yet, it's a good one. the classic format of good vs. evil and no one could pull it off better than John Wayne! I also enjoyed watching Ward Bond play the corrupt judge. In my opinion; He is one of the greatest character actors in movie history. He and John wayne played so well off of each other. Even though the movie isn't considered a classic, It is well worth watching and it is also very much worth owning. Trust me; this is one for your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Wayne was Tallin the Saddle","review":"Take John Wayne and add a story from Paul Fix about murders and an evil Land grab, and you have a rip snorting story that zips right along.

Look for Ella Raines as the beautiful but equally tough heroine. This movie is just a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good western - but not a John Wayne classic","review":"Tall in the Saddle is a good Western starring John Wayne that is well worth watching. If you like John Wayne's early Westerns, then you will enjoy this one as well. The plot is interesting, although a little hard to follow at times (not sure I ever figured out why Wayne's character does not like women), but it moves along at a nice pace. The cast is solid, and includes some of the usual suspects found in several of Wayne's movies. Overall, I enjoyed the film, and am glad I watched it, but I would not rank it up with some of his other classics like Rio Bravo, or Red River."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing western!","review":"Splendid B-western form the 40's with a young and charming Wayne, beautiful women, funny side-kicks and lots of action.

This is a good western, with humor, romance, adventure, and mystery all rolled into one. A definite choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tall in the saddle","review":"Bought this movie a while back after seeing it on TMC, I believe.

If you watch the fight sequence closely, you'll see who the stunt doubles are and they appear in different roles in Wayne movies also. It's worthy of any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrilling Western!","review":"Imagine getting a Western flick that has a thrilling subplot, a mystery that continues to the very end, and causes you to feel like you need to watch it again and again and again!

John Wayne is at his best, and two beautiful women vie for his attention, along with some underhanded ways of other town's folk.

I have found, through reading a fair chunk of Mr. Duncan's works, that his ability to surprise never falters. This being an earlier work which I newly enjoyed through POD format, I see this has always been the case. Much has been written of the author's ability the create believable worlds amidst the fantastic, but I prefer to enjoy his ability to engage & entertain. It takes a rare writer to painstakingly create a world for his characters to adventure in. It takes a spectacular writer have us enjoy every second of the ride.

The story is simply too short and narrow in scope to be called epic. The writing, while entertaining and flowing, is a bit amateurish compared to, say, Sanderson, Goodkind, or Erikson.The characters are definitely vibrant and rich in personality, though.

They all perform better than Porter's - even the inexpensive generic from the corner store.Regardless of how hot or lukewarm the water is, or how much you use, or how hard or soft the water is, or how much time you spend lathering, this soap just does not lather. It remains weak and thin in any case. It's also too small to fit in a normal shaving dish or mug - it will only fit the Porter's mug.

It's heavy duty and will not be as easily punctured or collapsed as cheap ones, and while I have not personally cut one open to compare the filter element I have friends who have and they attest to the filter inside. Expensive oil filters simply have more filter area inside and will filter out more particles before sending all your oil through the bypass valve when they reach their capacity.The wrench off back is a great idea but the only downside is that the nut on the back is so large most people won't have a socket big enough in a typical tool set, but if you have an extensive socket set it's great... or if you are faced with a stuck on oil filter it's probably a lot easier to get a socket for it rather than dealing with a slipping filter wrench or trying other creative solutions like puncturing it with a screwdriver for leverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Installs and removes with ease","review":"I've always had good luck with K&N products and continue to like them including this HP-1017.

Built to last! A great bargain.","review":"I cannot get over the great value for the money that Lodge provides. This pan is built like an absolute tank. Its heavy weight means that once you get it hot, it STAYS hot, making it outstanding for stir-frying (better than a wok, really) and for searing meats. Also makes decent pancakes. The steady temperature regulation provided by the massive amount of metal in this pan is really great. In addition, cast iron, once used a few times, becomes virtually non-stick. Fancy-brand pans that cook as well as this one cost four times as much.There are minuses to be aware of, inherent in the product's nature. (1) It's extremely heavy. Consider the 10-inch size if that's a problem for you.

Baked at 350F for an hour and left to cool, it had turned the familiar brownish/black color and was ready to use.I have sauted and pan fried countless meals and I'm able to bake cornbread in this pan .

The idea behind a wok is to cook foods very fast at very high temperature, then to stop cooking.

Round bottom so I can scoop food up the sides when needed and when I turn the heat off, the heat starts to go away. I tried cooking on a friend's Lodge wok and the meal was almost over by the time it heated up and it was still hot when people started going home. I love cast iron, especially Lodge, but woks should be carbon steel and not cast iron or non-stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Swap","review":"Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could just pick up for say six months and switch places with one of our best friends from childhood......well that is exactly what Jessie and Erin do.It causes problems and major adjustments on both parts especially moving to New York and returning home to face some memories you wanted to forget.In the end love does conquer all and the problems and adjustments that both friends have to go thru are not easy but definitely worth the adjustments.Once again Eileen Goudge has taken us on a fabulous journey where love does conquer all. As you turn from page to page you wont be able to put it down. A great and fun read.Eileen have proven once again what a wonderful story teller she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened...","review":"...to one of my favorite authors? I've devoured almost everything Eileen Goudge has written, but had to plod through \\"Otherwise Engaged\\". My favorite book of all times is \\"Garden of Lies\\" an amazing and wonderful story. I find it hard to believe the same author wrote both books. I found \\"Otherwise\\" formulatic and rather boring. Please return to your usually writing style, Ms. Goudge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I expected this book to be predictable and shallow, and it delivered! It was a quick, mindless, yet entertaining, read. The characters were a little forced, but relatively believable. I woudln't say it completely lacks merit, but it's certainly not going down in history as quality literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain and boreeeng!","review":"The book is just that \\"plain and boring\\"!!!I was really interested in the story line, I read with so much enthusiasm in the beginning, but that soon dwindled. I had to skip so many pages hoping against hope that something interesting would turn up. There was absolutely no connection between Jessie and Hunter. I felt what they had was way too cold for them to really be in love.I gave it 1-star because of the disappointing nature of the book, I had such high hopes....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing something?","review":"I agree with what this reviewer, DlynB, said \\"While this book was entertaining it lacked depth. There was so much going on, the main characters swapping lives, possible divorce and family problems with Erin, Jesse's past coming back to haunt her, the Navajo culture and then the water company destroying Willow Creek. With so many problems the author was left with little time to go into real depth concerning any of them. Throughout the entire book I was left wanting to know more.\\"I wish the author DID write more about the two women exchanging lives rather than going into details about other things that don't really go in this story. There should have been more depth, like the person I quoted said. This book would have been a lot more enjoyable if it had more about Jessie and Erin in the everyday daily activities. I would have liked to have been there when Jessie almost birned down the Inn. Things like that should have been included rather than being mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Early Years-Madonna is false advertising!","review":"To all of you Madonna fans who can't get enough of her early dance pop years, do not buy this CD. I bought it in hopes of hearing what Madonna sounded like before she became a household name. Unfortunately, this entire CD contains only samples of her voice totalling about 3 minutes of airtime. The songs are basically synthesized experiments by Otto van Werner(sp?). MADONNA DOES NOT SING ON THIS CD. Otto used clips of a few words here and there that Madonna spoke and just looped them over and over again. This CD is false advertising--it is not Madonna's work, but Otto's. Please do not buy this CD. You will only be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste a lot of money!","review":"The songs on here are worse than run-of-the-mill, they're either boring or annoying.

Save yourself the time and money--don't buy it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you're a collector...","review":"Unless you just happen to collect -everything- by Madonna, this is absolutely a total waste of money. Otto von Wernher is the actual album artist here, Madonna just happening to sing along and doin' a terrible job at it. This is one good example of how record companies twist things into making the most money out of confusing the customer. This \\"music\\" is not like anything else by Madonna and lets hope it will never will be again. This is an absolute no-no. Wouldn't even waste time downloading it, let alone buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEESE","review":"I've been a die hard fan of Madonna since the beginning of her career.... but this CD STINKS!

Great!","review":"As I'm brand new to juicing I didn't know what features I should want in a juicer, so based on the previous reviews I bought this one....and I couldn't be happier. I haven't found anything I don't like about it. First and foremost, of course, it makes great juice. It's easy to use. I particularly like the tray on top that holds the cut-up food waiting to be juiced. The fruit and veggies don't have to be cut up in tiny pieces, chunks work fine. And cleaning the machine, easy as pie. It comes apart with the push of a button and snaps back together just as easy. I highly recommend it. Happy juicing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much pulp in the juice. Please reconsider before buying!","review":"Produces sooooo much pulp that it simply plops down into the juice cup. Simply awful! I had to STRAIN it every time (unless you enjoy 'thick', 'soupy' juice, of course). Pulp is completely wet. Basically, waste of money both - on the juicer and the amount of veggies used to produce tiny cup of thick, pulpy juice. Wish, I'd known what I know now before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre juicer","review":"Juicer does not extract as much juice as you would like to get. Leaves very moist pulp, even with fruits/vegetables that hold more water (tomatoes, citrus fruit).Carrots came through the machine and did not separate/extract enough of the juices from the pulp. Wasting a lot of produce.Cleaning is not very easy as there are many nooks and crevices that pulp likes to hide. Must be cleaned in between multiple juicing tasks as the machine plugs up quickly and pulp ends up in your juice.Unless you're willing spend a lot of time cutting produce up before juicing, I would like for a higher wattage juicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dither review","review":"As reviewer Coopsam said, Moe. has definitely reinvented their sound to a degree with Dither. It is great for first time Moe. listeners or fans that have enjoyed their previous albums. Moe. combines complex musical pieces with great lyrical tunes on this album. A couple songs were on the live album (Captain America and Can't Seem to Find) and really gained maturity in the studio. Faker, NYC, and Tamborine have great melodies and Moe. keeps their traditional sound without sounding to poppy. TGORM and In a Big Country have really great tunes to them as well. I think this album is Moe.'s best studio effort up to date. I was really impressed with Tin Cans and Car Tires, but I can't wait to see Moe. perform the songs off Dither live. Both old and new Moe. fans are sure to love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honk","review":"This is just an all aroung great album. Moe. is well known in the jam community but this isn't simply a jam album, it's a great rock n' roll album with hints of psychedelia. These guys know how to write great songs without letting the jam get in the way. Moe.'s best studio effort to date. Keep up the great work guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dither!!","review":"IMO it's moe.'s best studio CD to date. The new material was road tested and the results show through in Dither. Capt America is down right FUNKY. Ghost of Ralph's Mom and NYC both pack a heavy punch with very catchy hooks. (not in the bad way) Water is another personel fav because the lyrics are so interesting.They saved the best for last though with a MONSTER version of Opium. IMO that song shows off all of the qualities that make moe. one of the best bands around. The ebb and flow of the music and mood of the song building up in to the blazing guitars do what few songs can actually pull off. Being beautiful and rocking at the same time. A lot of bands try to do this and it's usually not pretty. I guess that's why I travel to see them in exotic, far away locals like Omaha or Milwaukee.I've caught a lot of music by groups that are lumped in to that \\"category\\" but moe. is on another level for me. If you are just getting in to them Dither is a great start."},{"rating":"2","title":"moe is fun","review":"moe. is fun once in a while. I saw them at thanksgiving 2001 at Hammerstein Ballroom, NYC, and indulged in plenty of sweetbreath and bourbon. They're undeniably a great band, and their two guitarists have a way of churning out magic. While moe. is best experienced in the live context, Dither does a so-so job of capturing the essence of the live experience. Get the CD to familiarize yourself with some of the music before you see a show, but if you know moe., you don't really need this CD. Get on furthur and get yourself the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"MASTERPIECE!?!?!?!???","review":"MORE LIKE A FINGERPAINTING!!

Understand is a hell of a song though."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"It's a wonderful thing when musicians take a couple of years off of making their albums to reinvent their style and their music. Moe. has done just with this album. They still have their same sound, but they have added a few more instruments to their collection and as a result this album takes off from the beginning and gets better and better as it progresses. Some of my favorites on this album are \\"Captain American\\", \\"Faker\\",the poppy \\"New York City\\" (which still rocks), and \\"Cant seem to find\\". I know that their live cd was a little weak but they make up for it with this one. Buy this album if you like moe. or even if you've never heard of them because this album is sure to keep anyone entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tires Ever","review":"I live in New Mexico where flats from thorns are legendary. These tires pick up less thorns than any others I've tried and resist puncture from the thorns they do pick up. It is true the newer tires are not as long wearing.

I don't imagine they improved the quality by moving the manufacture to India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two punctures in a week","review":"These used to be made well, but I guess Continental cheaped out.

Some of the questions are simple and fun to think about, others are intellectually and philosophically challenging.In general, most of these questions should be shared with friends/family/loved ones--that is to say that most people will probably not feel comfortable answering these questions in the presence of mere strangers. The book is a good way to learn more about other people you know and love or can be used alone to learn more about yourself and your own values.This is a valuable and simple book that is useful to have around the house and to glance at every once in a while by yourself or to pull out when engaged in thought-provoking conversation with people you know and trust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny conversation starter","review":"This book is great to start conversation with others and see how different people would answer these questions!

First problem: the blade wasn't well aligned with the food tray (not perfectly parallel, but slanted at the top) so it is hard to get those perfect \\"paper thin\\" slices.

I use it primarily to slice meat (roast beef) and cheese.The slicer utilizes a gear driven motor which is extremely noisy... and I do mean noisy! It is very difficult to carry on a normal conversation with the slicer operating.The slicer is not precise and does not cut evenly. The flimsy carriage bends and wriggles which results in \\"wedge\\" shaped slices... thicker at the top, thinner at the bottom. I like my roast beef paper thin... almost translucent... and this slicer just doesn't cut it (pun intended).Redarding the flimsy carriage, if you press on it the wrong way, the whole thing pops off its track. If you're not careful you could end up with sliced fingers.All in all, I am very disappointed with this unit. I plan to sell it in my next yard sale and purchase something that's better built."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Failed!!!!","review":"I used this slicer twice. Once to slice eye round roasts (4 of them) and once for cabbage. I found that the machine slipped around the counter too easily and the carriage was shaky. I was slicing on the thick side, and that came out okay. Yesterday, I took it out to slice a two-pound, flat cut cooked corned beef for reubens. I tried everything, and it wouldn't start. Not even a flicker. Dead. I re-read the user manual checked everything. This is not brain surgery and I am mechanically inclined.

Run-on sentences almost killed it. Not much was interesting in the book until about half-way where everything is described in a different perspective. It's as if some things, I think, the majority of people would see as odd situations, and very disturbing, but the main character sees them as something he doesn't have to care about.

THIS IS NOT CATCHER IN THE RYE FOR THE MTV GENERATION!!! This is a decent writing for maybe a twenty year old want-to-be writer, which is what he was at the time. Personally I don't know how Ellis got this work published. I kept waiting and waiting for ANYTHING to happen, but unfortunately Ellis was not very creative. Instead he liked to talk about what people were wearing, he should have used that energy and time on thinking of all those 80's fashions, and I don't know, write a decent plot, or story. Do yourself a favor and take the money that you were going to spend on this book and buy some paper and pens and write your own story, it will probaly be more entertaining.

Perhaps this is another point of the book (the fact that the characters were also so bored) that it was intended for the reader to feel this way as well? I did find it hard at times to remember who characters were because no back story was given on anyone really and they all just existed. To me this book was like \\"a day in the life of\\"...without any history or build up..it just plugged along which frustrated me as a reader who wanted more. I can understand why others may like this book but I prefer something with a little more detail I suppose. This book doesn't leave you open to interpret anything really, there's just nothing left.

It can be compared to Catcher in the Rye blended in with The sun also rises. Of course they were both written by great writters and who is to say Ellis is not.

In a dizzying trip through the world of L.A. in the 80's through the eyes of a young man, Ellis gives us the book of his lifetime. Though lacking a plot and any serious character development, this book is hard to put down. It's like one long drug-induced trip filled with meaningless conversations, sex, drugs, and the occasional violence. Brilliantly, though, Ellis let's the humanity of his main character come through in small passages scattered throughout the book that describe his recent past and especially a family trip to Palm Springs. The desparation of the book's characters and their futile search for happiness will leave you hopelessly depressed and pessimistic. If you haven't killed yourself by then, read Ellis's other, not so brilliant book, \\"American Psycho\\" which will make you want to kill somebody else for a change."},{"rating":"2","title":"LA","review":"This is a very scary book! One of the earlier scenes in it has the protagonist hooking up with another man. (Both of the guys are drunk.)After that, it's all about alienation (and drugs.)

Do NOT waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal and Vapid","review":"Rarely does a movie improve upon a story told in a book; especially when the movie stars people like Andrew McCarthy. Yet even keeping that in mind, this book makes its film counterpart appear to be in the same class of cinematic achievment as \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" I can honestly say that I have never read a novel with as little merit -- in terms of both style and substance -- as \\"Less Than Zero.\\"In attempting to point out the shortcomings of his characters, Brett Easton Ellis actually appears to sympathize with them -- never do any of the people in this novel realize how shallow their lifestyle truly is. Furthermore, he uses a ludicrous, staccato style of writing, which accomplishes nothing so much as making the work seem like an MTV video.This book is the intellectual equivalent of watching Duran Duran videos while snorting coke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I don't normally like to say this about a book, but in this case it is totally warranted. This book sucked. For starters, it was very obvious that the author was trying to be very Catcher in the Rye with this novel. I don't care for copycats.Second, the entire novel is about a bunch of over-privileged teenagers who do nothing but get high and whine. I hated every single character in this boo, particularly the narrator, Clay.When I closed the covers of this book, I was relieved to be finished but I couldn't help but wonder two things. How in the world did this get published and why do so many people think this is such an amazing novel?I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy, if I had one. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a little too graphic for my tastes","review":"Um, this is pretty much like every other Bret Easton Ellis book, except it was the first, so I guess they are all like this one. It's about a bunch of rich kids who became jaded about life too early on. They do a bunch of drugs. Have a bunch of sex and commit crimes that don't really disturb them, including raping a 12-year-old girl. It's pretty good up until the end, where the 12-year-old girl came in. That was a bit too much for me.The thing I found interesting about this book is that it's based in L.A. and the people in it are exactly what I expect of the rich L.A. brats, even though the book was written in 1985. It's Laguna Beach, before Reality TV was invented. I seriously would have thought the book was written today, except for the references to playing the atari and putting movies in the betamax. That kind of dated the book a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad!!!","review":"I loved the movie when it came out in the 80s....I usually think that books are better then movies but this was certainly not the case when reading Less Than Zero!!! This author writes in short bursts of thoughts and occurrences...No chapters, no fluid movement...Choppy at best! The Back cover of the book was the best part! Really made me want to dig in! Breezed though this book in about a day....Paging through, thinking \\"it has to get better\\", only to find that it doesn't....The names of most of the characters are totally stupid..How the movie and this book even shared the same title completely amazes me!! If you loved the movie...DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!! You will be asking yourself why you wasted your time on 200 pages of dribble! This books rating should be truly less than zero!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good.","review":"First of all, if you're looking for a clear-cut story, don't read this book. The only way it works is as social commentary, and that's only if you can take the characters seriously, which is really hard to do.Ellis kicks the novel off by trying to bait you into being disgusted by his characters. Everything they do is so incredibly over the top that it just gets silly. I really don't believe that most high-class LA types lived like this during the 80s. I think the story is really exaggerated, and I couldn't take any of it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish It Were Zero (Stars, That Is)","review":"I read this book when it first came out in the 80s. I actually read it three times. The first, because BEE was suppose to be the \\"new!\\" thing; the second, because I couldn't believe how bad it was and wanted to make sure I hadn't missed something; and the third, because I really had to make sure. I couldn't believe how terrible it was; I still can't. Please kids, take it from someone who was a young adult in the 80s, this book is not worth the time. Don't do it! Turn back now!Additionally, the movie was no better. I saw a screening of it in a packed movie theater on Boylston Street in Boston in the 80s. By the end of the movie, when you were suppose to care for these characters, most of the audience was laughing hysterically. It was quite sad (and funny)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"Bret Easton Ellis belongs to a mediocre breed that includes Dennis Cooper, AM Homes, and Jay McInerney who writes in order to shock, perhaps to hide his stylistic limitations. Less Than Zero, for example, is just two hundred pages of ramblings by a preppy druggie, interspersed with the usual snuff film encounters and gay sex. Fans of Ellis can counter by praising the \\"realistic\\" writing, but pick any homeless man on the street and he could write better. This book has no soul, and pity those people who compare the protagonist to Holden Caulfield. They might as well be spitting in Salinger's face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aimless, drudging \\"novel\\"","review":"I personally guarantee that you will regret wasting your time reading these 200 pages of pointless drivel. I'm well aware of Ellis' other work, but this \\"novel\\" reads like it was written by someone who dropped out of community college after one semester. There is zero plot development throughout and the characters are as bland and one-dimensional as one can possibly imagine.I wish Amazon had not packaged this book in with American Psycho and The Rules of Attraction (two fine pieces of work). I would've paid more just to save myself the time I wasted drudging through this. By the end of the book you'll be ashamed you stuck it out as long as you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Pitiful Attempt","review":"Once again, this is simply a depressing and actually quite annoying novel, if you have the morals of a street bum and allow yourself to call it that.This book wasn't a waste of time, today's world demands sensless, mind-numbing, idiotic scribblings of the pen like these.To compare this to \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is the greatest insult to \\"Catcher\\" that I can personally think of.Nor is it satirical, as some have said.By the third chapter, I was hoping that Clay would get in a car wreck while driving drunk, or possibly the book could just end and the rest of the pages could be blank.For God's sake, it doesn't even have one sober main character!Food poisoning is a greater joy than reading this shrill, insufferable, insolent, and downright intolerable book. It is, in short, quite possibly the worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The only good thing about this book is that it's short. There are a lot better things a person can do than hear about whinny, wasted kids that weren't beaten enough as children.

Less than Zero is less than bad. It's tenth-generation derivative California noir by a silly trust-fund amateur with great connections and no talent. In many cases, critics can disagree and still respect each other; but if you liked this book, you're hopeless. From the clumsy allegory of its first line, \\"Nobody knows how to merge in LA\\" to its slow, formulaic visits to the most predictable sites of rich-boy decadence (snuff movies! cocaine! Whooooo, scary stuff!), it's Didion writ dumb, Chandler without corpses--unless you count the readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was awful!","review":"My book club chose this book and everyone in my book club had the same opinion....it was horrible.

I watched the movie many times before I was aware it was from a novel. I eagerly awaited my read but found the movie not true to the book at all. In this case, that was a positive. Even with Andrew McCarthey's weak characterization in the movie, the characters are much more compelling in the movie than the book. There is really no one in this to like.As other reviewers have said, when you get a book with many great reviews and some totally disappointing reviews, it's probably something you should check out for your own taste. This may be such a book. I didn't get. Maybe you will. Great American literature? Not on your life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More than Zero, Less Than Three","review":"This book gets one star for writing about \\"something different.\\" BEE definitely \\"made it new\\"- which is more than we can say for some of these fossil novelists publishing tripe to rave reviews (Seek My Face, anyone?). He gets another star for being so young. Twenty is an age at which we can still be justifiably self-absorbed.Minus one star for over-the-top and unrealistic plot- which it WAS, no matter what kind of background BEE was attempting to portray. Minus another star for the overly stylized dialogue, which even Andrew McCarthy couldn't flesh out. Minus another star for the rip-off of a conclusion. At only 200 pages, BEE could've continued with Less Than Zero for mere days and come up with something half-plausible.It should count for something that the film cast included the ever-hot James Spader (Yow!), but not on this board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, not great.","review":"I have mixed feelings regarding this book. It wasn't until the final 50 or so pages that I saw any glimpse of humanity in these characters. Ellis does a good job of nailing their vacuous lives but it became reduntant and boring. At the end the narrator realizes the horror of it all and it ends on a hopeful note - though it is not a wrap-it-all-up happy ending, thankfully. Ellis' habit of describing wardrobe is seriously annoying and useless except to date the novel. And any comparison to \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is laughable. Why would Gen. X need a \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" anyway? It already has THE \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"California Dreamin' - not!","review":"Bret Easton Ellis is a master of depicting the vast emptiness that can come with too much privilege and not enough soul. I've also read \\"American Psycho\\" and \\"Glamorama\\", and there is definitely a common thread running through all three novels. People are searching for fulfillment in all the wrong places, and are digging themselves into deeper holes of despair. One of the darkest satirists out there, Ellis injects humor here and there, but his stories are mostly about people you really wouldn't want to know. His female characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the guys are emotionally unreachable. This early work doesn't contain much of Ellis' trademark over-the-top violence and sex, so if you are looking for an early version of \\"American Psycho\\", you'll be disappointed. A very interesting read, it is, as Ellis creates a cold, gray, empty world filled with characters who have lost their spiritual selves as well as their souls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salinger wannbe...","review":"I was turned off by Less Than Zer0 when it became evident that Elias modeled his antihero, Clay, after Holden Caufield. Ellis disappointed me with this attempt at a different Catcher In the Rye. This book is no 'Catcher' and is just a waste of time. Clay and his freinds are a disgusting lot who have everything they could ever want but manage to mess it up in a world or drugs, booze, parties and fast cars. Much like the children of hollywood often do. (ie: Michael Douglas' kid)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not a feel-good book, but kinda interesting.","review":"I guess I read this book about a year ago, and as I remember it, I found it disturbingly empty and heartless -- which is, of course, the point of the novel. As a result of lives filled with nothing more than quick sex, lots of drugs, and meaningless, phony \\"friendships\\", the teenage characters in the book seem utterly devoid of genuine emotion, other than despair, which is expressed obliquely. I suppose this book reflects reality for a certain segment of the population, which is unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"panacea for the attention-deficient","review":"This book is great for people who want a superficial and supercilious piece of \\"literature\\" to talk about in front of others to make themselves appear more artful. The book is a quick rush, it is indeed exhilarating and unrepentantly self-abasing, but the style is amateurish, there is little emphasis on characterisation, description, irony, or drama, and the intent of the author appears to be merely to shock, not to illuminate or enlighten as Art should. In addition it is devoid of any degree of philosophy or denouement. Perhaps this is the author's intent, and if it is he has accomplished his goal, but I would certainly hope that our culture could produce authors with much more noble literary aspirations. It's worth a read if you have two hours and don't expect too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It","review":"I have never seen the movie but I did have an idea of what this book was about. At first I was under the impression that it was merely telling the tale of what Clay's life was like a daily basis living in L.A.

Ellis experienced it first at hand. Sex, drugs, debauchery, and more drugs is the only way to really describe this book. See Los Angeles through Clay's eyes as he gets through his days by using and abusing drugs, going to parties, and witnessing his friend Julian go through hell.

The protagonist is written as being tremendously apathetic, but carries absolutely no message. (For unfeeling characters with something to say, see Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", or Camus's \\"The Stranger.\\")Poorly written prose creates a text with literally no entertainment value, and hardly any redeeming qualities. Those of you reviewers who seem to think this novel speaks volumes about youth need to remember that very few of us are braindead richkids with no direction.

The characters, with their laughably stilted speech and their contrived actions, bear not the slightest resemblance to any individuals or subculture recognizable from the real world.Even his portrayal of self-absorbed, materialistic rich kids is off. I went to high school and undergrad with plenty of such kids, and either they were driven to succeed so that they could retain their self-absorbed, materialistic lifestyle, or they were too busy being hung over to act as Ellis depicts.As for the incessant, glamorous partying with no consequences, has Ellis ever heard of the banality of evil?

Clay's cool detachment from everyone around him draws us deeper in to his life, or lack thereof. I read this book for the first time when I was going to school in L.A., and it could be part of the reason I moved back home. True to its time, a snapshot of what it was like to live there in the 80's. If you like this book, but appreciate a novel with a bit more style and a bit more substance, try Donna Tartt's Secret History. You will see the groundwork that he has laid for her and others. Everyone from 18-22 should read Less Than Zero...and never watch the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time, paper and ink.","review":"If this is supposed to be literature, I'd hate to see what bad prose is like.

The problem is there's no real story to it. It's just one long stream of college-age kids hanging out, watching TV, doing drugs, and having primarily gay sex in circa-1984 Los Angeles. Granted, it's a first novel written by a college kid, so I might be expecting a bit much from it, but it's just so bland to the point where the \\"Less Than Data\\" parody of it inTreks Not Taken: What If Stephen King, Anne Rice, Kurt Vonnegut and Other Literary Greats Had Written Episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation?was more engaging.

Perhaps the changing times and a different society that exists today as compared to 1986 play a part in forming my opinion. There was nothing in the book that truly captured my imagination, nor did I find the book to be a particularly shocking portrayal of American society.The literary narrative didn't grab me, either. I found the writing to be dry and unspirited. Ellis's efforts in \\"American Psycho\\" were far superior.Perhaps I'm judging this book harshly and unfairly. After all, it was Ellis's first novel and it was published nearly 20 years ago. Still, it didn't entertain me, nor did it cause me to think particularly. Overall, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"I was looking for an author like Kurt Vonnegut and Chuck Palahniuk. And some one told me to try this guy.

Yes, Bret, we get it, there's a seamy underground to the yuppie lifestyle. How shocking! Go for American Psycho instead, if you must read Ellis.

If the line bumps any wood (fence, deck) it cuts into it quickly. You could cut down trees with this thing! I would give it 5 stars if it had a sidewalk edger guide, but it doesn't. It works edging without a guide (plenty of power) but is hard to control. Overall i am very impressed for the price. I paid a small fraction of the price for similar gas units.

For me he is to singing what Giacomo Puccini was to composing. From the time he was a young man, his magnificent voice flew threw the air like Apollo in the classic Greek plays. Now that he is older, we still feel his enduring passion for song, his unending passion for life. This album demonstrates his growth from a very talented young man to the well-seasoned, incredible performer that he is today. If you love melody, if you love masterful singing, if you love beauty itself, this album is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong, Simple, Efficient, Inexpensive","review":"I was a little concerned about the power of this juicer after reading other reviews.

I've had the thing for 2 weeks and have juiced tons of stuff including big grapefruits in it without any problem or slowdown. This thing is a champ.Someone was right when they said that the pulp does kinda collect in the little juice shute, but that is really only a minor thing. All you have to do is just wiggle it a little and the pulp moves out of the way and the juice flows right into your glass.Overall - I'm very happy with this thing. Especially for the price I can't imagine any other unit that gives you more value for the money. I highly recommend this juicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit you're grippin and start juicin'","review":"Bought this wonderful machine for my wife about two months ago.

To those who complain about it not being tall enough to put a glass under, my response is quit the whinin and use your head. I put my juicer to give it a bit more elevation and it works just fine. These same folks would probably be complaining about the thing taking up excessive cupboard or counter space if they made it taller.

Not something you want to use in the morning when there are still people sleeping. If you push down too hard while squeezing, it makes a MUCH louder annoying noise. (That's not hard to do) So it could use more power.Second, I don't like a lot of pulp in my juice. This doesn't filter it very well. I have to use a separate strainer.Third, the juice pours into a separate container you supply, and the spout is fairly low. SO if you making juice for several people you have to choose a small container to fill and keep pouring it into something else.

I really do consider myself an expert when it comes to selecting oranges to the kind of juicer. This has been my baby for several years. Its is easy to clean and gives me a bit of the pulp that is necessary for that vitamin nutrition. I have found this is the best for ease of use and, dang,like the everready battery, this thing keeps on ticking. It runs after all these years the same as when I first bought it.

The motor is powerful and it does do a decent job extracting the juice. However, I have three problems with this product:1) The hole which allows juice to flow from the catcher down through the pouring spout is tiny. Thus, the hole is very easily clogged with seeds or pulp, forcing the user to disassemble the pieces and manually clear out the hole to allow the juice to flow. VERY ANNOYING!!2) The design does not accommodate tall glasses.3) When the adjustable spout is turned down to allow juice flow, the top of the juicer does not firmly fit onto the base. This causes the top to be unstable, rocking back and forth when a user applies downward pressure while juicing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in a crowded market of underachievers...","review":"I have tried using 5 different citrus juicers in as many weeks; from the lowest prices to some of the higher prices, both manual & electric.

Nifty drip-proof spout. Enough power. Fair price for a nicely engineered piece of kitchen equipment.Works with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits of varying sizes.Not perfect, but the all-around leader, in my opinion, in a crowded market of flashy, overpriced underachievers and underpowered poorly designed cheap wannabes."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy juice","review":"easy to use easy to clean.gets the most from your fruit..gives perfect juice ready to drink ..no mess.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of Personal Library","review":"Barbara Tuchman is a master of both narrative and analytical history without boring the reader.She tells her stories with color and with interest, offering the reader a perspective that provides a new viewpoint. She pulls the reader out of the 21st century and puts them square in the middle of the century and time about which she is writing. She gives you an understanding of the times that made men and the men that made the times. She offers you portraits of the major and minor personalities that make you feel as if you know them and lived around them. Her \\"March of Folly\\" brings to front stage the stupidity of man's actions in creating history: past, present and unfortunately our potential future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A history book, but one of the best business books I've read","review":"This is a fascinating, useful, insightful book. Tuchman shows us how political leaders over the millenia have consistenly made decisions that were not in their own interest, even though they had the option to do otherwise. I couldn't help but relate it to poor, self destructive decisions that organizations make, hurting themselves when they don't have to.

We cannot judge past civilizations and their decisions by our standards. While the idea of how we should view history is excellent the execution of the concept in this book is horribly flawed. The author allows her bias to overflow into every passage. Nowhere is this retelling of history accomplished from a neutral point of view. This destroys the good premise behind the book. Anyone reading this book and agreeing with it will simply be agreeing with the liberal point of view of the author who adopts modern liberal western thought in reviewing the decisions of the past and condemns those who did not think like modern western liberals. The author fails to follow the basic premise of the book and thus destroys her credibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wordy but insightful","review":"Insightful look at specific points in history where one or numerous significant errors caused a momentous shift in power or policy. Tuchman begins with the Trojan Horse and skips through time making stops in 16th Century Rome, 18th Century Colonial America and 20th Century Vietnam. Tuchman tends to be verbose in many of her pieces, but The March of Folly is the most extreme case I have encountered yet. Tuchman's thesis is instructive as usual and her argument is presented convincingly. Despite the repetition of information and the depth of the argument, The March of Folly is worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Optimistic Jew","review":"Chapter One of this book is entitled \\"Pursuit of Policy Contrary to Self-Interest\\". Here Ms. Tuchman identifies what she feels are the three criteria for folly: 1) it must have been perceived as counter-productive in its own time (not in hindsight); 2) a feasible alternative course of action must have been available; and 3) the policy in question should be that of a group (of rulers or entire societies) and not of single individuals.In my book \\"The Optimistic Jew\\" I identify Israel's misconceived settlement policy in the occupied territories since the Six Day War as the most self-damaging project in the history of Zionism. It is Israel's (and Jewry's) very own \\"March of Folly\\" and satisfies all of Tuchman's criteria."},{"rating":"1","title":"BrokeBack Hardback","review":"The book, March of Folly, is my second copy and one which I purchased to share with a friend who loves history.The book arrived in a timely manner and in good packaging.

I give the 2 stars simply for the fact that Mr. Akin went to the trouble to write the book! There are much better Catholic books out there, I recommend you save your money on this one. I also noticed that the reviews don't really talk about the contents of the book, only that it is a MUST read for every Catholic.

I went out and brought a Samsung DVR/VCR combo at Costco. Imagine my surprise when the tapes (that I thought might be faulty) played the recorded program back perfectly. I was only able to record at SP speeed with the Sylvania DVD/VCR recorder - and that produced a lot of static when played back.So, my tapes were not faulty.

Perhaps this is obvious to anyone familiar with Colorado, but driving up from New Mexico (where I have yet to find a road impassable from snow) it was a bit of a surprise, and it would be nice if these high passes were marked as impassable from winter to early summer.

It gives an excellent overview of the church and its influence over the populous. It displays during royalist times how the church worked for Ferninand and Isabel and suceeding ancestors of Spanish royality and reduced the role of secular government. The last chapter is riveting \\"the decline and fall\\" as it shows how secular government tried to overtake the holy tribunal as royalist rule dwindled because of misappropriations of the Marranos and the birth of new religion known as Islam today. The concept of 'appeasement' is also raised in this chapter which is a basis of the 'puritans' that migrated to the northeast section of North America. It can be inferred that this book was the basis of Adolph Hitler's philosphy with the cleansing of Jews and Protestants as non conformists to the function of the 'holy office'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother Reading This!!!!!!","review":"I found this book to be boring from the minute I began reading it.

It was real! Check the bibliography. Other reviewers totally overlooked in the book the significance of the EDICT OF FAITH quoted by the author (not of his making). Two other works should be read before criticizing this one; THE SPANIARDS, by Americo Castro (search under the author's name), and THE MALLEUS MALLIFICARUM, found by title. I recommend prospective readers read the reviews of these works first, and then decide if Mr. Roth's descriptions are extreme. A less direct method would be to read THE CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE (see the review in amazon.com), a novel based on fact, but with a fictitious cast of characters and the expected amount of fantasy. History poses a problem because it can inflame the mind unless one respects that what is past may no longer be true, at least in the same sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"I just say: \\"be careful\\". This is an interesting book, but rather because it gives an idea about what in the Thirties Spanish Inquisition was supposed to have been, than for the real light it casts on historical reality.

The \\"history\\" of this book is convenient invention of British polemicists to attack their hated Catholic and Spanish rivals in one shot. The Inquisition was not one of the high points in history, but it was not the horror that it has been cracked up to be either.A more fair and balanced view of the Spanish Inquisition can be found in Henry Kamen's \\"The Spanish Inqusition\\".

I usually fill it for her; she presses the \\"on\\" button and pours when the red light goes out, with a click, to indicate the water has boiled. It's well-designed; the handle is easy to grasp, the button is simplicity itself, and one can fill it from the spout instead of having to open the top. The water level is easy to view from either side and the cord is reasonably long, with storage for excess cord underneath. I wish it came in a smaller size for people with weak hands, like my little mother, who sometimes finds it dauntingly heavy, even empty. The trade-off, however, is the many safety features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I bought this about 2-3 weeks ago, and it has worked without problems.

Well, it's been nearly 3 yrs now since I've bought it and it has outdone any that I had in England so far, it heats up fast never gets any scale and cleaning up is no problem at all.

It's fast, sleek and quiet. Smaller capacity compared to the last one I owned, which is fine because my tendency was to over-fill anyway ... so now it takes less time, and therefore less energy to boil the water. If Braun is listening, only drawback is that the lid fits snug, but looks like it's not completely closed. I like the way the cord wraps discreetly around the base. I looked for a long time for the right kettle, and hated having to 'nuke' a cuppa in the microwave. The taste is just ... well, different!

We liked it so much that we bought one for my boyfriend's mother.We drink a lot of tea, so it's great that the water heats quickly. I like that I can leave the cord behind (and plugged in) when dispensing water into mugs in various locations of our apartment.I haven't had a problem with deposits so far, even though I use bottled spring water.The only improvement I would make is to have the lid open more. It opens to maybe 80 degrees (lid not quite straight up), which makes it hard to pour water from a pitcher that only has a little bit of water left (you can't tip the pitcher too far because the kettle's lid gets in the way). Maybe I haven't been creative enough to find just the right part of the kettle to pour into. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent for 2 years, then defective","review":"I bought this kettle about 3 years ago and have used it heavily.

The windows on each side let you see exactly how many cups of water you are boiling. Great kettle in other words. Except that after 2 years, the button that you push to boil water intermittently wouldn't stay down on it's own anymore. So then I had to actually hold the button down for it to work. No longer a time-saver obviously. I looked at some other kettles out there, but the steel ones are very heavy, and you can't see your waterlevel from the outside. They also cost more.

Fill your kettle with water, place it on the base, and click the power switch (with LED light) that is located on the handle. You have boiling water in about one minute.

The Braun is perfect. A full pot of 7 cups boils in 5 minutes and then shuts off. It's light, not ugly, and has a red light indicator on 2 sides. Best of all, the platter is perfectly designed, so that you don't have to orient the pot one way or another when you sit it down. The whole thing pretty much stays out of your way; even the cord length is adjustable. Perhaps the only thing missing is a bell or ring-tone that tells you when it's done.

It has a wide base so I never worry about it tipping over. One little flaw; if the lid isn't pushed all the way down securely it wont turn itself off when it reaches boil, but it's my fault I left the lid up.

Think twice about the longevity of buying a white plastic water kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient and quick","review":"I bought the water kettle for the guest coffee/tea bar of our bed and breakfast inn. It works just as advertised - it will heat two cups boiling hot in less than 2 minutes, a full 7 cups in less than 5 min, and it will shut itself off once it reaches a full boil. It is more convenient than keeping a hot water carafe full, and it is faster than heating a traditional kettle on the burner. It did have a new-plastic smell to the water for the first few times, but then that went away. The plastic construction is less hot to the touch on the outside, and the handle stays relatively cool, so the risk of burn injury is less than an all metal construction. All in all, I am very satisfied with the product and I feel it was reasonably priced. I would buy another. I only wish it were an even higher watt so it would heat even faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality","review":"Died in 6 months.

I couldn't help but be disappointed in the method he used to present his hypothesis. That is, he begins the book with a full explanation of the arch's location. The remainder of the book goes on to justify why he thinks this is true. As I read each chapter, I kept waiting for some intriguing plot twist or new revelation, but these never came. It was like reading a \\"whodunit\\" novel and discovering the killer's identity in the first chapter. I've read a few other books in this genre (\\"Holy Blood/Holy Grail\\" for example) that were truly suspenseful even if you totally disagree with the findings.

The search ultimately leads Graham to Axum, Ethiopia, reported to be the final resting place of the Ark.Through research and site vists, Graham explains how the Ark arrived in Ethiopia which contrasts with other theories that the Ark was destroyed by the Babylonians or that the prophet Jeremiah hid the Ark on Mt. Nebo.The book poses some interesting questions. For example:1. Did Moses devise the Ark based on an Egyptian prototype found in King Tut's tomb.2. Is there evidence that the Templars searched for the Ark in Ethiopia and did they find it?3. And, if this novel is nothing more than an elaborate fictional superstructure erected above some historical truths, what is its hidden meaning??"},{"rating":"2","title":"GET THIS BOOK!","review":"Yes, I could not put this book down!

And don't you think it is significant that leading Nazis like Heinrich Himmler had a passionate interest in the Ark of the Covenant?

It is fascinating.","review":"This is the only book ever that I have read twice. It is just fascinating. From the first page I fell in love with this book and could not put it down. Hancock is the real Indiana Jones. His research is based on archeological evidence, scripture, and myths all combined and elucidated. You will travel with Graham to Ethiopia, France, Israel, Egypt, Eritriea, and Lake Tana. Fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride. What a fascinating master-piece of history, adventure, and religion. A A+++ book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly absorbing","review":"Whether you come out of this book believing the ark resides in Ethiopia or not, it remains to be said that Graham Hancock has produced a thoroughly interesting read, filled with indepth research and well based logical deduction. There is nothing better than reading a book on a subject like this where the author has done their homework. My advice is simply this: buy this book right now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Print Shop 20 blows","review":"Printshop has not been good since it was a Dos program. Version 6 crashed all the time. Version 12 was buggy. Version 15 won't install on many systems. Now there is version 20. It keeps giving a fatal exception error after installing. Tried everything to get it to work. No joy!!!!!!!!!!! Support is virtually non existent. For all the money they are making they could do a better job. Whats with all the missing versions? They just arbitrarily assign a version number to it. They went from twelve to fifteen to twenty. What is Next? I guess it will be version Thirty then Fifty at the rate they are going. The problem is with all the new features they add, they add as many bugs and crashes as well. Do not buy this software. Make Broderbund go out of business if they can't support their crap or make a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too annoying","review":"I was using version 12 and liked it well enough. I reinstalled when I got a new computer that had XP on it and it would not install, so I thought upgrading to the latest version would help. It did install, but the software has more quirks than the last one. It has somehow linked itself with other programs and so when I try to use my CD burning software or Legacy software (a geneology program) it wants to open PrintShop first and considering how slow this program is at opening that isn't pleasant. I've reinstalled numerous times and the problem hasn't gone away. I also find this program more awkward in trying to create things like a simple greeting card. If you can tolerate the annoyances (like if you delete the icon from the desktop it thinks it isn't installed) then you might enjoy the features this program has, but personally I just now hopped online to find myself a program by a different company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It!!","review":"I'm sorry I did not read your reviews before purchasing this product. I'm not sure how bad the software is, but I'm sure the support or customer service is the worst. Their E-mail response = 3 days and does not answer your question but refers you to their web site. If you try to contact them by phone (your cost and their estimated wait of 20 min.), you get a computer response to review their web site and no option to talk to a tech.

And, now I keep getting emails from Brodebund trying to sell me one disc with the whole program. It has got to be the most shameless marketing plan I have ever seen. And, frankly, the graphics just aren't all that great. But, alas, I am stuck with it. Every time I have to make a card for another of the endless kid birthday parties my blood pressure rises.

I wish I had read some of these reviews before bothering. The cropping tool was my chief source of frustration. As an earlier reviewer pointed out, the area on a photo that you select to be cropped, bears little or no resemblance to the cropping that is done once you hit \\"apply crop\\". I tried to get some technical support by clicking on the \\"help center\\" and was directed to a non-existent site. Deluxe indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Program I've ever used","review":"I have used photo editing and publishing software but this is the worst. I had no problem starting out and importing pictures into the program. One of the many problems I have experienced is, if you try to crop a picture, the program moves the crop over where it wants. It's easier to edit your picture before you import it. Also, the project templates are very limited. I am very disapointed with the program and feel like it is a big waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there was less than 1 star this product would get it.","review":"The software will not even perform a basic crop function correctly. I found it to be totally useless. Their tech support is non existent. If you use their contact us feature they promise to reply within 4-5 business hours. I still have not heard from them a week later. Their website sends you to encoreusa.com for support if you bought the software from anywhere other than their website. Encore's website is just as unless. No support-just a run around. It did state that this software is not supported for laptop use- a fact they failed to mention on the box the product came in. To get a refund you are supposed to enclose your receipt and send the product back at your expense. I don't know why you would trust them to refund your money or even admit to receiving the return since they can't be trusted to contact you per their website policy. I will never buy another broderbund product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this software!","review":"This software is horrible. If you think the software is horrible try contacting the customer service center....THERE IS NONE. ALL VOICE MAIL. BRODERBUND SHOULD BE EMBARASSED TO PUT OUT SOFTWARE WITH NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. I just spend an 1 hour on the phone....toll call and they told be to go online....knowing full well that the website was under construction and I couldn't get any help there. Take about horrible customer service. Plus it's a toll call...oh and if you buy this product at retail they send you to another company who also has voice mail.

I am familiar with the program and like the outcome of all my projects. The problem is that it will not print any graphics at all. Customer service is hopeless.The one simple change suggested in their troubleshooter was ineffective. What good is a print program that will not print. very dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent improvements","review":"I've used Print Shop Deluxe for years. I just recently had version 6 and decided to catch up with the times and purchase version 20. I heard there were a lot of problems with version 21 so I chose version 20. I haven't been able to use it much but so far what I have done I'm extremely happy with. As with the other version I had, in order to upload pictures you had to know what file the pictures were saved in. The program, in my opinion, is very user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Recommended","review":"This is one of the worst programs I have ever used.

It fits a little loose but that okay as it gets the job done. Uses a Velcro closure at the opening so it's easy to install.

I find with this on, the quality is much better with it off, so I just keep it on the whole time. I was shocked at how simple it was, it came in a small bag, really tight knit and velcros over the videomic. Simple yet useful. The hair falls off a lot though, but is fun to annoy people with.

I was recording dialog outside, and in my experience it simply did not cut the wind to where I could use the audio. In other words the wind took over. In the end we had to stand between two buildings while using the Deadcat. I know Rode also makes a blimp, but I'm not sure I want to try that unless I could try it first.I've had great experiences with other Rode products, but not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dead cat would work better","review":"This was a total waste of money for me. It only likely fits Rode stuff but I did manage to squeeze it over my foam wind gag. It is very flimsy and the fake hair falls out constantly so watch your lens for stray hairs. It has no shap whatsoever - looks nothing like the picture - very flattened out and look like a squashed rat on the end of your mic. Honestly this is a really crap and over-price item which barely makes any difference at all.

I put it over my video mic, and it has a cool fuzzy look as well. The fur does not show up on footage (unlike other people who mentioned that \\"complaint\\" in their review), because I took the stock hotshoe mount out of the mic and put a taller one in, so the unit stands an inch or two above the camera. The one problem I have with this, and the reason for the 4 star rating, is that this thing SHEDS, the little hairs are everywhere inside my camera bag and something tells me they are going to somehow find their way into the sensors, mirror boxes, and interior parts of my 2 cameras (a 5d mark II and a T2i) and mess things up. It would be 10x more horrifying if they somehow got into my lenses..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Wind Noise Reduction over 5 MPH","review":"Tried this on several on-off comparisons in different wind conditions..

It comes in handy but I'm really not impressed by it. It blocks out a brief breeze or 2 but beyond that you are going to have awful audio because this thing can't stop bigger gusts of wind. I'm going to buy the Rode WS6 which from youtube test videos looks FAR more able to block out wind and a big price cut has been made so I'm stepping it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good working, same as everyone else with price","review":"Slightly overpriced, but it's better than getting crappy sound without.FYI: Make sure you put it over the foam piece that already came with your mic.

If (BIG IF) it starts, it idles very roughly and dies when any attempt is made to speed it up. Impossible to use. I tried higher quality fuel; I've taken the carb apart thoroughly cleaning it; I've checked the spark; etc. Nothing helps. I've also discovered through searching the Internet that others have had similar and other problems.It could be that I was spoiled by the Craftsman trimmer I had for eight years.

If you have a campfire and want to cook anything besides a hotdog or marshmellow this is the way to do it.Cast iron is prone to rust. So if you are camping in the rain expect a little orange. It comes off easily enough with a little scrubbing or some steel wool, but it is the major downside to cast iron. Oiling it helps reduce rust, but if it gets a lot of contact with water it will rust anyway.Cast iron is heavy. Count this out if you are backpacking. I have no idea how much this weighs, but I am sure it is too much.

The people are all squatty and chubby looking - not exactly a great inspiration in a workout tape!! I went back to amazon and nowhere did I see clear lables of \\"full screen\\" or \\"widescreen\\" or anything else like that. While I realize I probably ordered the wrong version, I can't find where I could've done otherwise. Very disappointed and don't know if I'll even use the DVD as it's so hard to watch this way. Be warned and don't make my mistake - order the correct version for your TV (if you can)."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time or money","review":"This is a terrible terrible kickboxing workout.

(2 20 min sessions)the only downside is denise's queing is at her worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweat and burn fat for real...","review":"Blast Away the Fat is a great way for begginers to lose weight, for regular exercises who are struggling to lose those last 10 lbs., or to just throw in your regular cardio rotation.It's 2 different workouts, both 20 minutes long. The first one focuses more on cardio through kickboxing intervals, it also works the legs with lots of lunges and jumping around. The second workout is interval training combining kickboxing moves with free weights. Overall, Denise's cueing is disastrous, which is strange since she has so much experience and has been an instructor forever... That being said, the workout is great for burning calories, breaking a good sweat and working your legs. You'll definitely get your heart rate up and sweat.This workout is easy to squeeze in a busy day and chances are the next day your legs will be sore. Denise does talk a lot, although I do find some of her words very kind and motivating, but I generally tune her out and focus on my workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Times flies after you get the moves!","review":"Denise is not always the best with her cues but after you have done this video a few times, it becomes a solid cardio workout. I look forward to doing this video because of the interval training and she does keep you motivated to finish! I am not one to like extremely peppy people but when I'm working out, I need it! Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was ok, with some modifications","review":"It's a good overall workout that will get you sweating...but I would suggest doing both of the 20 minute workouts back to back, to get enough done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth it","review":"This is the first Denise Austin video I have purchased. Personally, I find her to be an unorganized instructor. She changes moves without much warning and barely explains any of the moves. If you get to the point where you can stand the confusion, you can actually break a sweat. Denise constantly motivates you to keep trying, but overall, I thought for sure, anyone with numerous videos, books, and TV shows would be more organized and informative. Unless you are a big fan of hers, I suggest skipping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor cueing and instruction!","review":"This was my first Denise Austin workout dvd and it was very disappointing. I've been using many other workout dvd's done by excellent instructors (Tamilee Webb, Michelle Dozois, Lara Hudson, and Ellen Barrett specifically) and I must say that Denise falls way behind these other instructors in her overall quality of instruction and cueing. In this dvd, there is NO cueing whatsover. Not only was I confused and frusterated trying to keep up, the exercisers in the dvd also seemed like they aren't sure what's coming next. There was no warmup, and the pace seemed almost frantic. I know that Denise Austin has been around for a long time and built quite a following, and for that reason I'm going to give her new Pilates dvd a try in the hopes that Blast Away 10lbs was just a fluke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Energetic if not well cued!","review":"This was one kickboxing workout I got through by sheer guessing. I have other Denise Austin workout DVDs, but this was the most challenging only because you literally \\"guessed\\" when to move on to the next routine. Aside from that, I felt good after the 20 minute workout. The strength training with weights wasn't as challenging, but still overall toning quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"She should stick w/ regular aerobics. Her aerobic tapes are great but kickboxing is definitely not her area of expertise."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 GREAT WORKOUTS","review":"I OWN SEVERAL OF DENISE'S VIDEOS AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE! THE 1ST 20 MIN WORKOUT IS A GREAT KICKBOXING W/ALOT OF PLIOMETRICS. THE 2ND 20 MIN WORKOUT IS INTERVAL TRAINING W/5 PD HANDWEIGHTS, WHICH IS MY FAVORITE. A LITTLE BIT OF DANCING, A LITTLE BIT OF AEROBICS AND A LITTLE KICKBOXING. I ENJOY DENISE'S ENTHUSIASM & ENCOURAGEMENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a tape I would recommend","review":"I don't really think of myself as a highly coordinated person, but Denise Austin's tape made me feel like I was TOTALLY uncoordinated. Sure, after you watch it a few times, you learn where she is going to change things without notice, but sometimes I still catch myself getting lost. It also did not feel like I was doing an even workout. I have yet to count reps and such, but I do not believe they are even... I do sweat with this tape, but I find myself getting annoyed with the lack of direction from Denise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review 222RC Brass Impulse Sprinkler","review":"Overall review of 222RC Brass Impulse Sprinkler is good. However, keeping the unit in an up right position when fully functioning is a challenge as well as positioning the flow of the water. Also, the tripod itself is weak and therefore can easily bend out of shape if you are not careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I have had a raintower elevated sprinkler for many years and needed another one. I didn't realize this unit was a different brand since the price was similar. This one is very flimsy and doesn't have self leveling feet. The other unit is made of conduit, stays upright and levels on any terrain. Shame on Nelson for producing such an inferior product with too high a price. The box was destroyed on arrival and the shipping will be too much to return it so I am stuck with it. Steer clear and buy an official raintower unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"First\\" Skateboard!","review":"I bought my son this skateboard when he was 2 1/2. I'm now shopping for a regular skateboard for him. He has used this toy for a year and a half now. It has survived some pretty tough play and a few bumps by the cars. My son loves this toy and it's usually the first driveway toy he goes for. He also uses this year round, which says a lot for New England. I highly recommend getting this board for a child who wants to do what the big kids do, but dosn't quite have the ability. This board taught my son how to balance and now he is ready for a regular board. I also would like to add that the mechanism for raising and lowering the handle is pretty simple and easy, but it really has to be done by an adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order a Month ago haven't seen it","review":"If I could get the toy delivered then I could give review of the item. Order on 12/25/2005 as of 12/31/2005 item still isn't here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Birthday Present","review":"I purchased this for my 5-year-old boy's birthday. His eyes lit up when he saw it! It has great traction, much safer than a skateboard, even when the handle is down. We leave the handle up most of the time and use it as a scooter. The only problem we've had is when he puts his foot on the ground to scoot along he has to reach his foot out past the wide wheel that gets in his way. This doesn't seem to bother him much, he still loves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst toy ever!","review":"It looks fun in the picture, but there is a major design flaw with this toy - the wheels stick out so far that when the rider tries to go they end up slamming their ankle into the tire. Within 2 minutes of using this toy my son ripped open his ankle. This toy should be recalled. Do not buy it. I would send mine back, but we had already thrown out the packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"...don't skimp on something like this.","review":"I am a Mountainboarder and this product makes me cringe at the thought of all that can and will go wrong with this. First of all a handle that doesn't detach from the board when not in use is a very bad thing. Also mountainboarding can be fun, but it is also very dangerous, and if a child wants to start doing it (no younger than 12) then get them the right equipment. If they have there heart set on it (and you can dish out the cash) get them an MBS brand mountainboard....I recommend the Ambush-scout, made by MBS, for smaller riders. Make sure they have a helmet and gloves, and all other safety equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the wannabe skater..","review":"I got this for my son last year when he was 4 and he really likes it. Good for the boys who want to be adventurous but with parents who are a little cautious! It's very sturdy and durable and he likes the fact that he can use it as a scooter or skateboard. The only con I can see is that the tires are a little bit wide in the back and when he puts his foot down to push it, his ankle gets hit by the wheel. He has to be careful and makes sure his foot is placed wide enough out. Other than that, great toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate","review":"The book is either guilty of many mathematical errors or the author has left out reasons for using formulas which don't add-up.

It gives an overview of some of Gann's ideas and explains his 50% retracement rule in almost painful detail.I understand the frustration of the previous two reviewers. The book is poorly edited and full of typographical errors. Because it contains a lot of detailed workings, there is a tendency for the eye to skip over that detail. I can imagine that is exactly what the editor's eye did. Hence the typos.This book is not worthless though. It contains some sound advice about the importance of employing systematic analysis and the disciplined use of stops. It also provides a simple but reasonably effective trading technique. On the other hand, it is dull and too long. The general technique is also covered more succinctly and interestingly in other trading books.It is not worth the \\"new\\" price but a cheap secondhand copy or, even better, a loaner might be worth the effort"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was totally duped...","review":"...about 5 years ago in IBD there was an ad for thisbook in which the book seller said this book was fulltop secret info never before available and only availablefor the next 2 or 3 days, then the offer is gone forever.I panic bought.

It's a generational novel that follows the life a young boy through his early years with his carnival parents, to life as a white boy in the barrio, to law school, to Vietnam, and in the end (of course) to redemption. The characters are drawn fairly well, and the moral choices they face are compelling. But I can't say that the characters became my friends, or that any of the themes are particularly enduring. If you're considering this and haven'r read any Marquez, I suggest going there first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought this book would be","review":"I chose to read the book for a research paper in school and I was disappointed. I found it shallow and lacking in direction. There was not an specific time setting for her story and the social problems that affects our society are approached in a very generic fashion, like painting by the numbers. Isabel Allende finds the worse in our society and drags it down by attributing enormous racial and social barriers in our society, which they do exist but I believe they are overstated in her story. This book is more about stereotyping, racism, sexual abuse and a general decline of our society than about The Infinite Plan, which she just mentions here and there throughout the book to justify the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not attach shelf to shoe","review":"I was sooo excited to receive my new shoe themed shelf bracket.

The trick is to attach the heel of the shoe-shaped shelf bracket to the wall with the sole UP, then place the shelf on the (relatively) level sole of the shoe/bracket thing. I found that in this configuration the shelf could easily support of box of facial tissue and a greeting card, though supporting a 50-gallon aquarium produced disastrous results.Still, I have to give this product just one star because it does not come in brushed nickel and the tophat-wearing fish emblem does not match my decor."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am pumped up!","review":"Great system.Missed one star due to the fact that seats needs to go down just 1 or 2 inches more...

This is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Fusion Picture Book","review":"If you don't know Cold Fusion and can only learn by looking at pictures, you might have a chance to learn something from this book. If you are mildly educated, you would be much better off to buy a book from an author that knows what they are doing. Why buy a book that only goes over the basics when Ben Forta's books go over basics and advanced topics for about the same price. My final comment is that this book is about 1/3 pictures. Don't let the number of pages fool you, cause there is little to read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I justed went to a ColdFusion training class that used this book. It has more errors than it does correct lessons. It refers to databases that do not exist on the CD. The class decided the only thing good for the book was the fireplace. It would be a good book if you did not have to debug their code. New users will have a great deal of difficulty with this. It proved to be so confusing that our instructor stopped using it and came up with his own lesson plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"ConFusion\\"","review":"...the book itself has a majordrawback.....no support!Nowhere can I find any help on how to troubleshoot the installation of the ColdFusion Server....(it installed, but I can't login as Administrator).There is no website, faq, or email address in the book or readme file on the CD....you're on your own.I know I'll figure it out eventually, but the information should be a basic feature of a technical book like this.\\"Burned\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Information from the Author","review":"This book was written for a new ColdFusion developer, someone with no ColdFusion experience. However, it does require you to have knowledge of HTML and some Javascript. This book is a great starting point for anyone wanting to learn the basics of ColdFusion. Once you're finished with this book you'll be ready to move on to another book that covers a wider range of topics. If you're ready to make that move, I highly recommend the books from fellow Macromedia Press author Ben Forta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its still dope","review":"This game is hot!! I like it alot, the only problemI see is that sometimes its just too [unreal]. c-monnow nobodys gonna head to antartica, and bust out 2heelflips and a pop shove it in the waves.

That is the case with Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer. This isn't a remake of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater done with a surfboard, this is a game that stands on its own 2 feet. This one has it all, stunning graphics, fluid action, and addictive gameplay. I also like the mood of the game--very laid back. But make no mistake, if it is high speed combos and airs you are looking for, then check out Pro Surfer. Hopefully they will make a Kelly Slater 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best...","review":"Simply the best surfing video game out there. I have tried about 3 different ones and this one is the one.

Like surfing itself this game is really about being one with the wave, expressing your style and pushing the limits. No other sports game can offer that! The graphics are awesome and the gameplay is smooth. The controls are difficult at first but very comfortable after 20 minutes or a quick run through the mandatory tutorial. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes the idea of surfing but can't get to a local wave.... this game is the closest thing. Also, dropping back in and riding in the barrel is unbelievable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Transworld Surf","review":"I was really excited about this title, and went right out to buy it on first release.

REal waves are better anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kelly is the best....to bad his game is not!!!","review":"The bottom line is this...If you want a skateboarding game you buy THPS!!! If you want a snowboarding game you buy SSX!! If you want a surfing game you DON'T buy H30, Sunny Garcia, or now KSPS following in the footsteps of what appears to be yet another quarter pipe with some procedural textures sliding across the surface of it trying to make you believe you are submersed in an ocean!!! Maybe I am wrong and KSPS will deliver TWS caliber wave'(s), and THPS style game play. Personally I am holding out for the PS2 version of Transworld Surf.Happy Surfing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transworld Surf is left in the whitewash","review":"First of all, everyone who wrote about this game before they even played it is an imbecile. Anyway - This game is really good. The graphics are way smoother than Transworld Surf (TWS). Also, the game seems more fluid tha TWS. I like the fact that even when you go into the tube you can come out of it without falling - just like surfing. The intro videos are actual video footage and Kelly Slater adds commentary to each one about the location. While this game deserves 5 stars, there are a few things i do not like. One of which is that you must complete the required task in order to obtain a new level. Another thing is that i have not been able to get a good handle on how to do a floater everytime. Overall, this game beats out TWS. If you are a serious surfer, i would reccommend getting both, since both are fun, but KSPS is the must-have sports title of 2002!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this craft.","review":"This small stocking like stuffer item, was a fav for my four year old boy.

Our daughter likes to play with it and is learning to put the rings back on the base.

But I am also sure that for my offspring it also will be a bizarre relic as they wonder why one of their ancestors every put up with curing and cleaning and curing this when there was a perfectly good alternative in the cabinet. I wonder that too. Unless you are taking this out the the fire pit for outdoor cooking, I would highly recommend the equivalent Le Creuset models. They are enamel-coasted, painless to clean, and very heavy duty -- I expect to pass this one on as well. They distribute heat much better and have such contemporary innovations as a lid-handle NOT made of very heat-conductive metal.For outdoor use, I guess this is a sturdy bet (15 lbs) but know that this will require cleanup and care when you get home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Game!","review":"I decided to buy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 after renting THPS2 and I think they're both great. Actually, I found very little difference between the two! The only differences I found between the two was that the menus are different in THPS3, you can grind off more things in THPS3 and the graphics are slightly better in THPS3.

There are a couple of flaws, but overall the game is worthwhile...Good stuff: phat graphics, large levels, several pros, lots of tricks, realistic action, create a skaterNot so good stuff: control scheme can be frustrating, certain areas on each level are almost impossible to navigate, depth perception issues, \\"living levels\\" translates into a couple of pedestrians walking around aimlessly that fall down (or punch you) as you skate into them, game is too easy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bass Tape!","review":"Project Pat's album is nice.

There are a few tracks that I like besides Chickenhead: Don't Save Her and Ooh Nuthin' to name most. If you liked Three 6 Mafia's When the Smoke Clears... like I did, you may not like PP's album.

While it's nicely padded it tends to distribute a great deal of the weight on your neck. My son is seven pounds and very small. I used it for ten minutes and my neck was killing me when I got home.

The DS's touch-screen controls are a much more efficient user interface (expect to increase your level-advancement by 50% by NOT using a mouse) even though the playfield is notably smaller than a 'standard' PC monitor.

The DS version has shops where you buy power-ups, hints, puzzle codes and other modes for the game. You unlock new puzzles as you go. Puzzle modes include classic, relapse, puzzle, strategy and flashlight. Classic is just like what you play on the computer. Relapse has blocks coming from the top and bottom of the screen. Puzzle has strategically placed blocks and you have to demolish all the blocks to pass a puzzle level. One wrong move and it's history! Strategy- Every time you make a move, a whole line comes up. This mode can actually be difficult if you don't have any bombs. Flashlight means you play in the dark and adjust the flashlight with your D pad. There is a casino game in every level. You collect trophies as well. This is quite the meaty puzzle game that's guaranteed to keep you busy for more then a few hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this game!

At first I ignored it and played through it but the flickering because so severe that I could not focus or touch the right blocks. It made me kinda nauseous too.

Thank goodness they aren't to the point of skating down our somewhat steep street. They would break their neck with these straps coming undone.I bought two sets for my two 5 yr olds and the straps keep coming undone on both sets. The tensioning clasp just doesn't stay snapped shut.

Upon arrival at your destination, you can easily set up your system without ever removing your Xbox. The back/bottom of the case opens for the sole purpose of cable connectivity. The only drawback to this accessory is its underabundance of storage capacity for vital accessories. Four controllers simply refuse to squeeze in there, let alone all necessary cables.

It is not easy to adjust them again after putting the spring back in and replacing the screw. I have been putting a drop of olive oil in the spring assembly after washing and drying them thoroughly by hand, but I certainly expected some information to come with a pair of relatively expensive shears. There is no information on the box, either. The handles are smooth and slippery, and it is sometimes difficult to maintain a secure grip when cutting through bone.

Foreigners recognize that immediately, but it takes we Americans much longer to realize that. Of course, with all the goofy rules and exceptions in English, it can be quite fun to speak it. No more is this more apparent than with homonyms (words that sound the same but have different meanings). Kids love homonyms, and used in an imaginative context can help children gain an appreciation for language. With that in mind, A CHOCOLATE MOOSE FOR DINNER is a delightful book. The sayings and the illustrations that accompany those phrases are a joy to read and usually get several laughs from children. A few of the phrases (shoe tree, and the rowing allusions) maybe a bit unfamiliar to modern audiences. Nevertheless, those terms add to the book rather than detract.

My only complaint is with the female lead. I admire Tara Fitzgerald's work very much, but in this role as an American exchange student, she is not very believeable. Some of the reason why is the script (which is a little too corny for words at times), but her accent is all over the place. She is trying hard to sound like the bohemian American she plays (it doesn't play very convincingly), but then constantly slips between an American accent and an English accent, sometimes in the same sentence. The ending is a little silly, but overall, if you are not expecting a life changing experience, The Student Prince is an entertaining way to spend 92 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Click-Art Font-Version 3","review":"I'd recommend this item for anyone who is interested in fonts!

It works still but I don't expect it will last - why can't they make metal gears? While you can buy replacements, I don't intend to spend more money after bad and will look at going up a notch.

We used it twice and then, just after 30 days (when one can no longer return to Amazon), we discovered it was dead. Then we noticed the reviews here on this site and see that there are many complaints about this item! A blender should be able to handle frozen fruit for smoothies! The $20 ones I've bought at the Drugstore always managed fine. I took it to a Braun repair shop where hopefully it will be fixed. However, the plastic teeth that turn the blade look fragile and probably won't last. I am perplexed that this machine has been rated highly by respected sources.On the plus side - I do like its design and the fact that the jar is held in place on the base and doesn't unscrew itself like my last blender. Won't matter if it won't work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For users having trouble with broken gear teeth","review":"Many reviewers of this product have complained about broken plastic gear teeth--a problem I too experienced within a few weeks of using my new blender. I returned the broken blade assumbly to a Braun authorized service center for repair under warranty. A repair technician at the service center told me the broken teeth were caused by the way I was using the blender with frozen ingredients. The service tech told me to use this procedure: Put all the non-frozen ingredients into the jar, put the jar cover on, place it on the motor base, and turn on the blender to any speed. While the blender is on, remove the cap that covers the opening in the lid, and pour or drop frozen ingredients into the jar, continuing to blend until finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Smoothie Maker","review":"This is a great smoothie maker! I looked on Consumer Reports to see what the best blender was and this is it! They said to buy a blender for what you use it for not for the overall rating they give. This was the best for smoothies, and I have not been disappointed so far. I make at least one smoothie a day, and the gears show no signs of wear. They seem to be much better than my previous blender. The only reason that I did not give 5 stars was because the only position that you can set the glass top on the base is with the handle facing back.

It does a great job of crushing the ice to a pleasant consistency with no chunks. It took us a few tries to the ice just right (needed to work on the amount of liquid to add), but once we figured it out, we love it. Definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!","review":"This blender broke after three years of medium use. Something is stripped inside of the drive motor and it will spin but slips and does not spin the blender. Don't buy this blender, and don't buy a Braun."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed, not durable","review":"I bought this blender 3 years ago and MAYBE have used it 2 to 3 times a month since. I've mainly used it for drinks like Margaritas, which requires some ice crushing along with blending other liquids, but never used it for anything thick and chunky like blending fruit for smoothies. I've always found that the dial was difficult to move to each power level with a lot of resistance in turning it. It's always been very noisy even at the lowest power level (1), as if the motor was struggling to keep working. Today, it died a slow death, the blades barely turned and the motor overheated (smelled like burning wires). I'm disappointed to say the least, because my previous blender lasted 18 years with the same use! I would not recommend this blender since I've never been impressed with it even when it did work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Within 2 years, broke twice, cheap plastic gear","review":"Just adding to all the negative completes to bring the star rating down. Glad to see they are currently unavailable, its about time they stop making such a non-reliable blender, that even with warranty still have to pay for shipping to have it fixed. Cheap plastic everyone is talking about broke on me twice the past two years. There are much better options out there I just bought a oster professional series blender, I hope it does a better job then this blender did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheaply made","review":"I needed a new blender and based on reviews I was excited to get this one. I make smoothies almost every day. I put all the ingredients in, turned it on and the blades were spinning but not pulling the mixture down.

There has got to be a better choice out there for $50!"},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"I would like to give some good advice to any potential buyers...do not buy this blender. I saw the concerns at this site, but went ahead and purchased the blender based on Consumer Report's advice. A mistake... I learned. After using the blender only 5 times (making smoothies) the motor lost some power (the low gears didn't work). After a 1 hour round trip drive to Braun's nearest repair shop, the blender did not function any beter. Braun wanted me to return the blender AGAIN for repair! After several calls, long hold times on the phone, a check eventually was sent to refund my money (after I had to pay to ship the blender back to them!).

There is a ton of chatter on the MX2050. Half of it raves about performance. Half of it moans about maintenance. I'll confirm both. I loved the performance of my MX2050 for the less-than-a-year that I could tolerate its repeated maintenance problems.I bought the MX2050 because of the performance reviews, and I ignored the chatter about maintenance because Braun had recently \\"fixed these problems\\". Well, they didn't. I've replaced broken parts every 2 or 3 months, until this month when the little black coupling melted, rendering the unit unreparable.Apparently, the MX2050 is the best product in its price range. If you like fixing broken stuff, then buy it. I'm tired of it now, so I'll be trying the Waring Professional Bar Blender that costs 3 times as much but has excellent reviews and a good maintenance track record over its longer history. Wish me luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Crusher King","review":"I bought the Braun after reading the reviews at America Test Kitchen and Consumer Report to replace my worn out Oster Kitchen Center. Main job is to make smoothies out of frozen fruit and ice. My new machine does a fantastic job and I am very pleased. The other reviews correctly note that the lid leaks badly in some circumstances so hold a sponge over the top. Not a big deal to me. Some complain about weak teeth but Braun now has a replacement for that.I love this thing and bought two more from Amazon for gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BLADE GEAR TEETH BREAK!!!!","review":"I bought this blender following Consumer Report's review. BIG MISTAKE! I wish I would have read the amazon.com reviews first. After one month of making my Abs Diet Smoothies, the plastic gear teeth under the blade broke! It has worked fine until today! One month, that's all you get with this machine. Their customer service is closed over the weekend so now I have to wait 2 days plus who knows how long for a replacement part! Don't buy this. I bought it in Feb. 2005 and it broke 1 month later. I noticed the same negative reviews on here dating back to March 2003! 2 years and Braun hasn't had the \\"BRAUN\\" to remedy their own problem! Shame on Braun. Never again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good performance but broke after 2 years","review":"Worked well for 2 years then all the sudden motor quit working. Only used lightly (maybe once every two weeks).Two design flaws:1) the clear cap at the top doesn't seal well and liquid will leak out the top when you first blend something and it splashes at the top.2) The plastic teeth that connect the blade with the motor assemble are brittle and eventually break. After 2 years, 3 of the six were broken off.At least the blender is relatively inexpensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious Design Flaw","review":"I like the blender, but after reading many other reviews (after I purchased) with the same problem it seems that Braun has a real quality control issue. After only 3 weeks of normal use, the plastic teeth on the underside of the blade started breaking. Within another 2 days my new blender was as useful as an anchor! I have been waiting for a replacement part from Braun for 4 weeks, and according to my call with them this morning, it will be another 2 weeks before I might see it. Wish I had not thrown out my 15 year old blender so quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Does A Good Job","review":"I had the same problem with the blade that PM444 did. I found the model number of the blade on another web site, and entered the number into the Amazon search and it came up with the right blade available from Small Appliances. The correct number is Braun 4184-625 Blender Blade. If one enters that information, Amazon finds the right blade. I have been generally pleased with the blender. Consumer Reports gave it a best buy, and that was my motivation to buy it. It has only one bad habit that I've discovered, and that is a tendency to cavitate when crushing ice. One has to remove it and bump it against one's hand to remove the cavity so the blender will work again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor engineering","review":"The white plastic teeth and plastic drive mechanism are truly a bad design. Have sent back three of these blenders, and finally gave up. Two had broken white teeth, and one of those had a motor \\"grinding\\" sound like it was under a load it couldn't handle. The third had broken white teeth and the black plastic drive mechanism the teeth fit into on the base also broke off. Did not put any of these machines under difficult stress, but was mixing smoothies, with frozen fruit pieces. Added the ingredients slowly, and if the motor started to accelerate, stopped the machine, added more liquid, and resumed. But, each of these machines tolerance for significant frozen loads was really grim. Consumer Reports really got this item wrong, wrong, wrong. Our $15.00 blender from WalMart works better!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Thinking that I was buying a very powerful blender, it being over 500 watts. I decided to get this more expensive $60 model. To my suprise a $12 blender would have been a much better purchase since I wouldn't have expected much from it. I used this blender possibly 1 week making only one smoothie each morning. It burned the motor up in just a week even though I blend the fruit first and then the ice a little at a time. This was a waste of money, you would be much better off with the $12 model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twice broken","review":"I wondered if my blender was an aberration, but after reading that others had the same problems with theirs, I realized that the little plastic gears that turn the blade are not strong enough to handle the pressure. The blender worked wonderfully until the gears broke off. I ordered a replacement part from a company in New York. Within a short time, the gears started to break off again. I quit using the blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Plastic Gear Teeth Break!","review":"Now ask yourself...Why would a manufacturing produce one of the most critical, rotating parts out of plastic, rather than steel? Buyer beware! The gear teeth underneath the METAL blade are made of CHEAP PLASTIC. I wish I had read the Consumer Report on this one in 2004. The gear teeth broke off within a year. If you are looking for a blender that will last a while, don't get this one. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st use, LAST use!","review":"I purchased this blender with C Reports blessing- What a mistake!

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BLENDER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun Blender: Works great... when it works","review":"Like most everyone else, I experienced a broken plastic drive tooth (still worked though) with my blender and also noticed that speeds 1 and 2 seemed to be the same speed.Barring those issues, I really liked how well it blended until this past Thanksgiving weekend. While making my first batch of frozen drinks for guests, it began to smoke. It then slowed down and died.It appears there's a one-year warranty on it as long as I can come up with proof-of-purchase and take it to a service center. I got it as a Christmas gift last year and sure hope my sister saved the receipt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixes Well, Breaks Easily","review":"The Braun MX 2050 blends most ingredients easily, including semi-dry items, such as dates, in a minimal amount of water.

Took to local authorized repair center, but they decided they had to return it to Braun for repairs...in the meantime, the shop went out of business. I've never received any replacement for this unit, but, then again, I rather not have to worry about it failing again. Finally got the KitchenAid Professional Chef's model- finally a machine that actually works consistently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it until it broke, plastic teeth","review":"A few months ago we searched for a new blender, and the trustworthy consumer magazine rated this one a good buy. In this case the magazine was wrong (although I still trust and use their recommendations). We bought this blender on their recommendation despite reports of broken plastic teeth. After a couple of weeks of making smoothies the same thing happened to ours. It seems that Braun could spend an extra $5 to make teeth that hold up, and this blender would STILL be a good value if it were $5 more expensive, but believe the reports, the plastic teeth break easily and quickly with any hard use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful","review":"We got this blender because of the Consumer Reports rating, and the reviews that said it was powerful. It is! Can mix up ice or ice cream easily. Overall has a high quality feel to it. Not too many speeds, but that's fine - who needs seven or eight? Symbols for the various speeds are indecipherable, but we're rather smart so we quickly deduced that \\"5\\" is faster than \\"1\\". :) Biggest drawback is the holes at the top the little piece goes into the big cover (why do they make those two pieces anyway?). Hot liquids could come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"long-term reliability problems","review":"Crushes ice, etc. as advertized, but the \\"teeth\\" on the bottom of the jug broke off, and I can't find a replacement assembly.

I had it only 6 months. The plastic gears have stripped twice, and the teeth on the bottom of the jar have broken too.

I looked to see if they have replacement pieces, but they don't. BAD BLENDER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Margaritas! Smoothies! Puree! Ahh, just Wonderful.","review":"I am very happy with this product! I was hoping to buy a black and sainless steel blender, but this one is worth miss match in my kitchen. It is a similar if not better product than many of the more expensive blenders (L'Equip, Bosch, Vita-Mix).The dial control is great, and easy to wipe off and clean. It does a great job on frozen drinks, just keep it down to 7 or so ice cubes or frozen fruit bits at a time - add more once those are crushed. It makes creamy smoothies, that are actually smooth. The glass jar is heavy duty and dishwasher safe. I couldn't ask for more (except maybe a color choice)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Blender","review":"Awesome blender, great at crushing ice, makes great smoothies.

Low price for a blender of this quality. Sturdy, great \\"placement guides\\" so you don't ruin the gear cam. It won't run if not in the correct position. They thought of just about everything on this blender. Love it. Chops ice and makes smoothies really smoothe not lumpy. Excellent, excellent machine.

I use mine mainly for smoothies and to prepare sorbet for an icecream maker. It has a hard time blending moderately dense foods (mango). After a time the machine starts to smell bad (burning plastic) and you have to wait till the thing cools down before continuing. In order for it to work properly, you have to water the contents down more than the recipe often calls for. You can do a lot better than the Powermax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be careful pouring","review":"So far my biggest complaint with this is how it pours. When pouring a full pitcher into a glass the liquid will pour down the side. It pours better when it is half full. As far as power it is great. I also love the appearance. It is stylish and I don't mind leaving it out on the counter. With a slight improvement in the pitcher it would be perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless for my purposes","review":"i cook a lot of indian food, and many recipes call for pureeing various spices, chilis, and other vegetables into a paste. this is what i bought this blender to do. much as i love my food processor, it doesn't really turn out a smooth puree, especially with small amounts of material.this blender has failed completely to puree anything. i even tried to make hummus, and all the machine did was thow the ingredients onto the side of the jug and spin the blades uselessly. maybe it would puree a very liquid vegetable soup, but that's not what i bought it to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"It definitely blends","review":"When making protein shakes and smoothies, I find there is too much air after everything is blended.

It turned out great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy was I disappointed","review":"I ordered the Braun MX2050 Power Max Blender as a gift for my son in law. Because it's a gift I didn't open it but let me tell you how it was delivered. It was not packaged in anything but the box you would find on a store shelf. There was a slice producing a hole through the box that was about 2 inches long and all the way into the box. It was raining out and the item sat in the rain with no protection until the carton was puckered and damaged. I am going to be very embarrassed to give this as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful blender with parts that break","review":"I don't care what Consumer Reports says, I would strongly discourage anyone from buying this blender. Although it has a strong motor and is easy to clean, I cannot tolerate the fact that the blade part has plastic teeth that hook into the base and these plastic teeth break very easily.After almost all of the teeth snapped out - after normal use - I called Braun and spoke with their customer service person who admitted that this was a design flaw and that they had received many calls about this. He offered to send me a new part. It took three months for them to deliver the part because the demand for replacements was so great!And here I am again a few months later - after very infrequent use, the plastic teeth are snapping off. I am thoroughly disgusted with this product. It is really a shame because it is otherwise a good blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was excited to received a highly rater blender, but it did not live up to expectations. First it would not fit well onto the base and I'd have to jiggle it to get it to lock properly - when it didn't fit it would make a terrible grinding noise and only by trial and error would it finally work. Trying to clean it by using the pulse resulted in water and suds all over the place because of openings in the top. Then within a couple of months the plastic bottom pieces broke off and it wouldn't turn. I like to make protein drinks with frozen fruit and one or two ice cubes and this is not the blender to do that with. I do not recommend buying this blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save the box!","review":"We bought this blender and it seemed to work great so after about a month I threw the box away. Less than a month later it broke.

The blender seems to have one major flaw - a base with plastic teeth. Although the technical data indicates a sturdy stainless-steel blade, the actual mechanism that controls the blade is made out of plastic and is easily broken. I only used my blender for 2 weeks before it broke, and I am waiting on a replacement at 20% of the original cost (excluding shipping)that I won't receive for 3-4 weeks. I'll be replacing this blender very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this blender","review":"Blender worked well initially, but coupling between motor and blade, entirely made of plastic, broke apart after two weeks.

I ASSUMED they just didn't take good care of it. But 2 months later when my blender went(I treat mine carefully)... P.S.(Feb.2007)**I have discovered a way to extend the life of ANY blender.

This time I was told by Amazon that the product obviously has some inherent problem and they would not replace it, only refund my money.

She's been using our 10 year old cheap oster blender and it has had no problems except for the fact that it leaks through the bearing since it's so old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good....but it didn't last...","review":"Per the reviews, I purchased this and found it terrific. However, it died within 10 months, and because I don't have a certified repair shop in my state, I had to send it away at a cost of $10 + insurance. It has been 2 months and still it has not been returned due to a part that has not arrived. If I had to buy a blender again, I'd buy a cheaper one. It may not be as powerful, but at least you would have it! My last cheap one lasted 16 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective and Impossible to Return","review":"As mentioned by other reviewers, the gear at the base of the blender (which drives the blade) is made of plastic, and the teeth break off easily. I owned this product for 6 months, only making my daily smoothie and my son's protien shake, and three of the six gear teeth broke off. The major problem is this, however -- the blender is virtually impossible to return unless you live close to one of the \\"authorized\\" repair shops that Braun has listed on their website. You can't return it to Amazon after 30 days, and Braun will only repair or replace defective items through their difficult-to-find repair sites. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeds Expectations!","review":"I purchased this item for Christmas 2005. I did a lot of research beforehand in consumer reports and other sites and found that this blender was the best blender for the price. It was even rated as a Consumer Reports best buy! Some of the other reviews on the product written in previous years state that the blender had problems and such, but according to consumer reports, the blender was revised in 2004 and all problems were fixed. The blender is wonderful, and it even crushes ice without liquid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Pleased","review":"I have tried many blenders, i.e. Krups, Oster, etc. After checking Consuerrerports.org they rated the Braun MS2050 as the blender to buy. I put the blender to the test by blending a powder drink with a banana. I am so pleased with the thickness and consistency of the finished product -- no other blender I have owned has accomplished this result. The Braun MX2050 is a fantastic blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in Less than a Year","review":"I ordered this item to give as a gift. It was shipped on September 1, 2005 - on August 25, 2006, it died. The bill for repair was $90.00 - a great deal more than the item cost. Save your money. This is not an item to spend your money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go ahead and buy it!","review":"We've owned several blenders of different models and hope this one lasts longer than previous ones. Hubby uses blender 2-3 x daily for shakes mixed with ice, ice cream, & fruits. Since arrival last week, blender has been great chopping up ice, blending all ingredients smoothly. Pleasantly quiet motor; substantial weight (not flimsy); visually appealing (fine to leave in open view on counter top). Following reviews including \\"best buy\\" recommendation from Consumer Reports, this appears to have been a wise purchase...PLUS we beat the suggested price of $50, another added bonus! Too early to rate it 5 stars, but I expect it will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after 1.5 years of light use","review":"was a reasonable blender but 1.5 years into a 1-year warranty it just stopped working. light use -- we've probably used it 30-40x total. quite disappointing - won't buy Braun again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blender great price","review":"We purchased this blender because it got great reviews from Consumer Reports. We are very happy with our purchase. We were also pleased that it was priced so low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you plan to make smoothies","review":"This is the second Braun blender I have had. I had to replace the first one when the plastic teeth in the blade broke off. Now the same thing has happened. This blender cannot handle anything that uses frozen fruit or ice. I'm done with Braun. Forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strike two. Cheap plastic parts that wear and break (and you can't fix that)","review":"Braun MX2050 Jug BlenderWe have had two of these blenders from Amazon. When new I rated it good. But over a year the first jug lost plastic teeth. The second blender after 13 months of a lot of home use broke. The plastic turning gear on the machine spins uselessly. The motor works great but the plastic assembledge of the machine and plastic teeth on the glass jug is poor. I need a new blender now and I surely say there must be better choices.I thought this machine was powerful and good. It looks great.They promote the powerful engine. But it is like having a car with a super powerful engine but you can't drive it because something else breaks down. I struck out twice with two machines and I am done buying this one at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too weak","review":"I first used this blender in January 2006. We did not use it very heavily at all. I ordered new blades for it twice and now it won't blend anything. The new blades just about doubled the original price. I thought Braun had a good reputation, but I am throwing this blender away and I don't plan to purchase a Braun product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it, at first!","review":"This blender was recommended and highly rated on CR. It was great at first but quiclkly lost it's steam. Maybe it wasn't meant for smoothies with ice? I have since replaced it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crushes Ice!","review":"I chose this blender from magazine reviews that said it was the only one that would also crush ice. It does. I'm satisfied with it for all uses, and I like that it has a glass container (so many of them don't), even though I have a tendency to break things!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Broke Twice","review":"I experienced broken teeth on the bottom of the jar first, for which I got a free replacement. Today the plastic disk on the blender that the drive shaft spins broke as well, and it is obvious that this repair would require servicing. The blender worked great, but then it broke twice. The cheap plastic parts are definitely not up to the task of chopping frozen items for very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died just after warranty expired","review":"This blender worked fine until I owned it for 14 months. Then it suddenly died. No warning at all. I did not use it all that much, either. I won't buy this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bonehead design","review":"Add me to the list of purchasers who've had trouble with the plastic blade/gear assembly breaking - twice! Braun claims this is due to a manufacturing problem, but it seems more like an example of bonehead design, using a weak plastic part to transfer the power from the motor to the blade. I'll contact Braun and try to get a second replacement part, but I'm doubtful that it will last any longer than the first two, which was perhaps 10-20 smoothies each.Amazon needs to add a 0 stars category for items like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumer Reports RETRACTS GOOD REVIEW","review":"Consumer Reports (March 2004) says that they have changed their method of evaluating blenders because of this one - - they discovered that their testing didn't go on long enough to find out that the blenders break quickly. The magazine says that Braun will provide a free replacement blade and gear assembly - -but when we called, it turned out that we had to pay shipping to send the faulty blender back to them. I had only used the blender about 30 times, and had never even put ice in it. I had only mixed yogurt with lecithin and other powders - - which has to be about as hard on a blender as mixing plain water. It had been extremely noisy from the first use, but all of a sudden it made a horrible noise and then it had only half its speeds. It would still run in speeds 1, 3, and 4, but did not run at all (not even a humming sound) in pulse, 2, and 5. This is a ridiculous failure after almost no use at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died on 2nd use","review":"On my 2nd batch of smoothies it started to smoke and smell really bad. Motor slowed to a crawl. Bought on CR reccomendation. Have to pay return shipping to Braun for repair. JUNK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So many problems!!!!","review":"I know I can always rely on Amazon reviews to be correct and concise. I wish i'd read reviews on this blender before we bought it at Sam's club. Within weeks of buying the blender all the plastic pieces broke off! There was much blame going on in my home....now I see that quite a few people who bought the Power Max had the SAME exact problem!!!! I called Braun today and I expect to receive my free replacement part within 2 weeks. I hope that the blender works though I have my doubts. I will think twice before buying another Braun product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not buy again","review":"I bought the blender based on CR....blender failed after ~8months of operation. The blade will not longer turn....can't seem to figure out what went wrong...but will not buy again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacement gear looks the same.","review":"One tooth of the blade gear broke the first time I used the blender with some frozen fruit in it, all the other teeth broke off the second time. I called the 800 number for a new part, but it looks almost exactly like the other one, and the plastic teeth feel just as flimsy. I'm afraid to use the blender for anything that isn't soft.Only difference is the nut has markings and the blades are at a different angle. Plastic seems identical.Please post/review your experiences with the replacement blade.My girlfriend is thinking of making a metal cast of the plastic gear, assuming I don't actually use it and break it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"It is a great engine and jar. Good blender. But it does not last. Braun has received so many complaints and they have not improved the situation with the cheap plastic base gearing that seems to become defective within a year of use. The many reviews online indicate the same: not recommended.I bought this blender last summer ('07) for about $60, and it has stopped working properly in Nov. '08.While it worked it was fantastic for smoothies, etc.It is a waste, though. Asking for a replacement from Braun costs time and money. Many people have received a replacement, which has broken time and again. Too bad! How can Braun make a great blender and blow it up with such a basic part (they should make this part metal, or of better quality.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"PowerMax Not","review":"Bought the PowerMax and thought it was the best blender in the world. It was for the two weeks I had it. Had to return it the blades didn't turn. If it worked the way it did for the first two weeks I would love it. Haven't found one that works as well, but I don't think this is a reliable machine. Returned it for a refund with no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for awhile...","review":"I bought this item because it was rated high by Consumer Reports. After a couple of months some of the plastic teeth (that spin the blades in the Jug) have already broken off. I am very disappointed with this item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Blender","review":"I purchased the Braun Blender from the internet because it was the Best Buy pick from Consumer Reports. My old Oster blender finally gave out after about 40 years! I have not had it very long to give it a credible review; however, I am disappointed with the plastic piece on the bottom of the blender which is sure to wear out. I hope you will consider manufacturing a steel part and replacing them to all purchasers. After reading other reviews. I see other consumers have had problems with this same part. I am very happy with the way it works but am considering requesting this part BEFORE it breaks. What do you suggest?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"This blender is awful. We've had it a few months now, and while it appears to be well-constructed of heavy glass, basic no frills controls... the blade connection in the bottom of the container is plastic and it strips out of the motor constantly. We end up grinding the plastic more than combining what's in the blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible; two of them both died in less than a month","review":"DO NOT buy this if you're thinking of blending anything frozen. My first one failed after nine smoothies. I figured it was just a fluke so I tried again -- same result with the second one. What a waste.Basically, if you push it too hard, there's some sort of clutch in there that burns out. It's like when the clutch on your car is slipping -- the motor spins, but if you put even the smallest amount of resistance on the blades it disengages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Consumer Reports Sucker","review":"Bought based on CR's report and it worked great for about a week. As several others have mentioned, the plastic white piece under the jug has started breaking and we probably have one or two uses left before it won't work any longer. Consumer Report's testing lab obviously didn't test it for very long. Don't buy this until they fix this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I bought this blender based on Consumer Reports recommendation. And I had also looked at reviews here. I am glad to report that we are very pleased with our purchase. It is very nice powerful and rather quite blender. I would whole heartedly recommend it to others. We use it mainly for making milk shakes and misc food blending and such. And it has worked flawlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also, very disappointing","review":"I tried to use this blender several times with placing the canister in different positions to lock it down. It vibrated all over the counter and I had to place my hand on the top and hold it down to keep it from falling off. Also, had a horrible burning smell. I checked with Braun the Mfg. and they said this is a manufacturing problem with this blender and had received numerous complaints about this problem.The woman in customer service at Braun said she also purchased this same model and had the same problem. I guess this is why you can't find it in any of the dept. stores. I sent it back to Amazon.com and they agreed to a complete refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"this blender is a huge disappointment as Braun are usually so reliable. I switched it on twice and both times there was a horrible burning smell, the machine wobbled on the kitchen counter, and this was at the lowest setting.... can't imagine what the top speed is like!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed drive system","review":"This is a very hard blender to use - the drive system will not engage properly. We just bought it in July and my wife wants to put it in the garbage. We went back to using our 20 year old Waring blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Burns Out","review":"OK - it ran for just over 1 year. It was only used for frozen beverages and not that frequently. It worked great at first, but the motor doesn't seem up to the task..."},{"rating":"1","title":"After all these years - still a drive gear design problem!","review":"As one who works in manufacturing, I know the pressure to deliver a product to the consumer at a price he or she is willing to pay, BUT continuing to produce a product with a long-term design problem is inexcusable. Braun should recall all of the MX2050 blenders due to the design of their drive gear. The plastic gear breaks once too much torque is applied, and the teeth simply shear off.I have a suggestion for anyone looking for a general purpose blender. Go to eBay in the \\"Collectibles\\" area, and look for a good old Oster or Waring - one from the '60 or '70s. No, these older blenders may not have the latest CPU technology, or fancy modes, and they may be the wrong color, but they work! And, they will continue to work after the Braun has chewed up its next drive gear. You can buy a really nice used Osterizer or Waring for less than $25 on eBay, and either will outlast the MX2050."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender problem","review":"I purchased this blender because Consumer Reports rated it the best for making smoothies and ice drinks. Three weeks after I got it, some of the plastic teeth on the bottom of the blade mechanism broke off. It still worked, but I am sure the rest would break off soon. I returned the blender and will look for one with no plastic parts on the important operating mechanisms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Blender, not bad for the price","review":"The main reason we bought this blender was the great review in Consumer Reports. Overall, it's not bad. It does what it's supposed to do and the jar is lighter than the Kitchenaid blender it replaced, which we had for 7 years prior to this one. Our main gripe is the pouring spout on the jar. It's difficult to pour pancake mix from the jar without having the mix run down the side of the jar."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but not for long","review":"we use our blender for frozen drinks at a minimum of once or twice a week. this blender works really good but with that amount of use it did not last long-only about 6 months. we now have a Oster Beehive Chrome Blender, which we have had for about 2 years now, and we love it! It works great, looks great and even feels like a sturdy well made item."},{"rating":"2","title":"PowerMax Blender Review","review":"It is great for smoothies; this is really the only thing I have used it for but it does a great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars if possible","review":"Warning, this is the worst blender I've ever used. It is heavy, hard to clean and the plastic blades break. I'm on my second one after the first broke in just a few weeks of use and it just broke. The whole plastic part on the bottom of the blade (under the blender) just broke off. Stay away from this blender. I bought this because \\"Comsumers Reports\\" said it was good. They were wrong! I would give this peace of junk zero stars if possible but that is not an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Average Blender","review":"This has been my first blender. It blends properly although needs a few shakes when dealing with ice, i'm overall satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made plastic gears at base of blade.","review":"I bought the blender on the Braun name and owned it a bit over a year, the first plastic gear broke off after two weeks, and then another broke off about six months later, today two more gears broke off and rendered the blender useless. Looked into a replacement part, costs about $17 which was half the price I've paid for the whole blender! I'm very disappointed Braun would use such a poorly designed gear which makes the whole unit poor and downgrades the brand. I now am looking at other brand blender to replace this one, not another Braun. I can't believe this gadget only lasted one year. Prior to my Braun I owned an indestructible $10 Sunbeam lasted forever and donated away because it was so 70's looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jug Blender? More like \\"ugh\\" Blender!","review":"I mean this is an okay blender but the blades frankly aren't top quality if you ask me. It has a user friendly design and everything, but it seems like Braun has turned a blind eye to the MX2000 line recently as they can be faulty and often have a crippled spin right out of the box (!) I recommend instead a Black and Decker or heck, even two forks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in 6 months","review":"I bought this Blender because of positive reviews in a major cooking magazine. The blade stopped turning within 6 months. I got a replacement part by driving 35 miles to the only repair facility in the area. I had to take the entire blender with me. Now, within less than a year from purchase, the blender won't even turn on. This blender was only used, perhaps two dozen times."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am on my second Braun Blender","review":"I had a Braun MX2050 PowerMax Jug Blender. The motor burnt up within a year. I really liked it because it was good for making margaritas. So I brought a second one. The one too started smoking within a year. This blender is not good if you are going to use more then twice a month for ice drinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I was excited about purchasing this blender based on reviews from a \\"unbiased\\" consumer magazine. It did crush ice well compared to others I've owned, but after a month, the plastic pieces that connect the blender to the base unit were breaking off -- they should've been made with stronger plastic or a totally different material that would hold up. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!","review":"I am embarassed to admit that I have owned two of these. The first one lasted a year. Then I discovered that top of the base unit had cracked. Since I had no other problems with it, and thinking this was a fluke, I purchased another one. Within one month, the top had cracked in the same place, and the rotary control knob fell off. This is a poorly constructed unit which will not hold up under normal use."},{"rating":"1","title":"This blender was a huge disapointment","review":"We heard all the great reviews and thought we would give it a try, the second time we used it the blade bound up on the spindle and the motor started smoking. I had to take every thing apart and re-adjust it. IT worked fine for a while then the little plastic piece on the bottom broke, so we sent for a new one when we got the new piece we put it in and then a few more mixes is all we got out of it before the motor burned up completely!!!!!! If you like to make smoothies with frozen ingredients I would think twice about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's true the teeth on the bottom break","review":"I've had this blender for 5 months. At first, I loved it. It's extremely powerful and blends. But all the other reviews are true, the teeth on the bottom of the carafe just broke. Initially it was just one, but just now all of them broke off while trying to make a smoothie. I only used this blender once a week, so imagine if you used daily. What a piece of junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Blender, Great Customer Service","review":"I purchased this blender from Amazon over 2 years ago. This is the best blender available. I make a breakfast shake almost every morning, and this blender works so much better (especially crushing ice) than any other blender I've used. The only problem, as noted by other reviewers, is that a portion of the blade is made from plastic and it can break. Mine broke after 2 years of heavy use. I called customer service (1 800 272 8611 - don't make any selection and wait for the operator) and they replaced the part, free. The warranty has expired, but I still received the replacement free of charge. I considered buying a new blender after the part broke, but frankly, this blender works so well that I'd probably just purchase the same blender again, despite the blade breaking. But, Braun replaced the part at no charge, so I definately think this is a great product with great customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic parts","review":"I use a blender to make protein shakes. This includes ice cubes or frozen friut. In this blender the part where the blades connect to the motor is made of plastic. This part broke in about three months. I called Braun, they were very good about it and sent me a replacement part in a couple of days. Shortly after this something broke in the base and the motor no longer will turn the blades. I'm guessing there are more plastic parts in the base. This blender will probably work fine for mixing liquids, but if you plan on placing greater demands on it try another brand. I subjected an Oster blender to the same treatment for years before if gave out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker!","review":"Well, folks, they haven't fixed the design flaw in this product, so don't buy it. I went on the referral of Consumer Reports, hoping that Braun had made the teeth on the bottom on the blender stronger. But the reviewers before me were right!Makes me all the more sad that my husband broke the 1960s vintage blender I had for 15 years. Not only did it look cool, it performed like a trooper until he put the glass pitcher in cold water after blending hot soup -- ouch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic but Functional","review":"As advertised, this unit is pretty basic, but it was top rated in Consumer Reports and it does work well. Crushes ice as advertised, simple construction, easy clean-up... I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high expectations","review":"After reading the reviews I was convinced this blender was the best for the money. I mostly make smoothies and similar textured things and this blender can't keep a blendable mass moving. It is also terribly noisy and shaky on the low setting and the icons on the control panel are hard to decipher. It gets one star because the glass and blades are sturdy (not much help if the machine can't do the job.) I considered returning it, but decided to avoid the hassle and use it until it burns out, and then replace it with something else (don't expect this to take too long.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Limited Use","review":"Worked well crushing ice, but I've only used it twice. The pitcher is heavy glass - definetly wouldn't want to drop it. I would prefer a nicer control interface over the dial option - but the blender seems to do it's job fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk!","review":"The lack of a tight seal makes this product unusable.

I'm impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and blends in seconds","review":"I finally decided to pay a little more and see if I could get a blender that would truly crush ice and not start burning out on me after a few uses. I also wanted to have a glass jug that did not leak. I researched various blenders and did not want to pay several hundred dollars so I decided on the moderately priced Braun MX2050 PowerMax Jug Blender.The day I received it, I used it to prepare frozen drinks and could not have been happier. I have since used it for everything from fruit smoothies to preparing salad dressings. I have had no problems with this product and I have no complaints.The blender is easy to use, simple to clean, and will be a staple of my kitchen appliances from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"High expectations, disappointing results","review":"We purchased this blender because it was rated a Consumer Reports Best Buy. However, about 30 seconds into its very first use (making a simple smoothie), it started emitting a HORRIBLE, burning plastic sort of smell that quickly filled the kitchen. I wasn't terribly impressed with the blender's power either, as it didn't seem like a significant improvement over the cheap Oster it's replacing. As mentioned by some other reviewers, the jug design is not ideal for pouring, and seems to promote drips. On a positive note, I do appreciate the fact that everything (except the base, of course) is dishwasher safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't put Blender together again","review":"This blender really worked great until I had to take it apart to wash it. You're supposed to be able to unscrew the bottom to get it really clean, right? Once I washed it and put it back together, the bottom piece would no longer fit into the spinning part of the base. I took it apart serveral times, trying to figure out what was wrong, and had others try it. None of us could. We called and they offered to send out another part, but they never did. they said if the new part didn't work we'd have to bring it to a repair center (an hour's drive away). I waited too long for the part, then it was too late to return it to Amazon. Then our new puppy chewed up the box. I am so mad I wasted 50 dollars (at that time) on this blender I used for just a couple days. I bought a smoothie maker at walmart for 13 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A throw away appliance","review":"Purchased this item March 2007, totally broken down and out of warranty July 2010. This is not your mothers Waring blender that it will last a lifetime. This is a cheap plastic item that you will throw into the landfill after couple of years. It is a good example of Braun quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a very good blender, it is fast, powerful and does a superb job. I used it for blending solids to thick consistency. It is very good, but the blade unit needs improvement, especially the plastic moving part. So far it has not broken and i hope it will stay that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRAUN isn't as BRAWNY as it once was!","review":"After arrival everything WORKED PERFECTLY, just as CR reported. I just wonder how they do a rigorous test on appliances such as this. I think they tested this brand new. Anyway, this is made unusually cheap for a Braun product. After some months, the Braun PowerMax became the Braun PowerFlop! Others expressed similar results gears broken etc... Now I'm looking into The Oster Beehive line close in price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"First time we tried it only 2 of the 5 speeds functioned. It's on the way back to Amazon.

This blender has been working for a few months now and it works great! The blades are well designed and the motor is powerfull. What more is there to say? I have had over a dozen blenders in the past few years and this one is the first that I liked. When I see a sale, I'll buy a second one to keep as a spare in case they stop making it before it breaks. The warranty is ok, and the cord is shorter than I like (long enough for a kitchen counter, but when I move it to my bar I need an extension cord). Other than that, a great find... I wont buy another brand of blender again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Teeth","review":"Apparently I concur with almost everybody else! We did lots of research to find a blender to make smoothies and frozen drinks. We were careful to use small chunks of ice and followed the directions that came with the blender, but after a few uses the plastic teeth at the base of the pitcher broke off. The teeth probably should be made of metal. Otherwise, it's a great blender and works as advertised. Strange to find this type of problem in a Braun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic parts","review":"I love how this blender makes smoothies with ice, however, I am now on my third blade assembly and will not buy another replacement. It costs about$20 each time for this critical yet small part. A shame an otherwise excellent blender went cheap on the most important element. I would've paid more up front to not have this problem! At this rate I can buy a new blender and I will make sure the working parts are all metal!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumer Reports UPDATED review","review":"What the reviewer who mentions Consumer Reports fails to say is that CR updated their review a few months later, saying that this Braun blender failed several durability tests. That's why it's being offered at such a deep discount, of course! If you only use this to blend smoothies or something, you could be fine, but heavy duty work will make the plastic innards break and shatter. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Down and Still Waiting","review":"After MUCH research, I was so excited to receive this blender. I enjoy making frozen fruit smoothies and needed a powerful blender that would last longer than the mainstay market blenders. This unit had excellent reviews.Unfortunately, after about a month of making smoothies, I went to put the blender on the base and noticed one of the spokes falling off the jug into the base! I thought, \\"Oh no, my new blender has a major flaw, plastic spokes!\\" It only took another week before all of the spokes broke off.Since early July, I have called, called and recalled Braun's warranty/customer service department, who have told me each time that my part would be shipped that week. Here I am in September and I'm STILL WAITING for my part! Apparently Braun is busy making blenders, but not making the replacement parts for those of us who took the leap of faith to purchase this blender prior to the \\"Consumer Reports\\" spotlight review.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more smoothies","review":"I was so excited to get my new blender for my birthday. It wasn't two weeks later that it was broken. The plastic piece on the bottom broke off which meant that the motor could no longer spin the blade. The ice crushing feature was a joke. Pieces of frozen fruit would jam the blade causing the bottom piece to spin and ultimately break off. I expected better quality from Braun. They usually have such good items. Make sure when buying a blender that the bottom of the blade is made of a very sturdy plastic or metal. And Braun's warranty: You'd better make sure you live near one of their factories. It could take quite some time to get a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great blending, awful design","review":"Like many others here, I have had numerous problems with the plastic gears breaking off.

I'm disappointed because, as a blender, it worked great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defect in the blade mechanism","review":"This blender definitely has a problem with the blade. The plastic pieces that connect to the base that spin the blade are extremely vulnerable to breaking. I broke ALL of them within the first 6 months of owning the blender. For the record if you break one and try to run the blender, it will break all the other pieces.While I have not contacted Braun yet, I will do so to try and get a replacement part. This is definitely a defect in this product and I do not recommend purchasing a ... blender to use for a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment!","review":"Although this blender was highly rated by Consumer Reports, I found it to be sub-standard. First, the nylon gear that powers the blades, found on the bottom of the jug, broke twice, first after about seven uses (smoothies!) and then after about twenty uses (still smoothies!). Braun sent a replacement blade/gear unit free of charge after I phoned and complained when it broke the first time. I decided not to bother after it broke the second time. Second, the motor is somewhat noisy. Third, one of the speeds did not work well. Overall, this is a shoddy piece of equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Piece of Junk!","review":"I am so glad to see that I'm not alone in my extreme disappointment with this product!I bought this blender less than two years ago. Within weeks, the cheap plastic gears on the blade assembly started to come off. Braun sent me a replacement. A few months later, same problem. Now, even with yet another replacement, the blades won't even spin.Braun's response? They sent me a coupon for $2.00 off a bag of DOG FOOD! When I contacted them again, they said they'd pay for 1/2 the repair cost. Never mind that the nearest service center is 50 miles away ... this, for an item that cost me $50.Like everyone else, I reasearched thoroughly and took Consumer Reports' recommendation. This is the first time I've regretted it! I will NEVER buy Braun products again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun the best?","review":"I bought this blender after checking the Consumer Reports ratings.

The plastic impeller at the base of the blending unit broke after three or four uses, exactly one month after I purchased the blender. Consumer Reports may have thought that this blender performed well, but between the poorly designed plastic parts and the peculiarly misfit lid that lets thin liquids spray out easily, this blender isn't worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"Wasn't really the best game but still the graphics were good.

People may find it annoying that Jillian stops doing the exercises to explain proper form, but that is much better than how this lady doesn't bother to explain form, and huffs and puffs while trying to say what to do. I am a very tolerant person, but she is totally fake and obnoxious.I didn't even break a sweat, so not only is this video annoying, it is also useless.

Incredible for making stew in, this fryer has been used for almost everything except frying chicken. Every Lodge product our family has had has lasted for as long as I can remember (I am 29 now) and requires little maintanence - a little seasoning w/ oil and heat every once in a while is all. Cooking in this fashion imparts a wonderful flavor to meats, tomatoes, breads - whatever! Forget the non-stick, $400+ cooking sets from the big boys, cast iron handles cleans very well if well-seasoned and is actually best if you don't clean it too hard.

It gives no real explanation on what Transcendental Meditation is. It doesn't really explain how it is making a difference in the students lives other than the children giving interviews and saying they are less mad at their siblings. This is a \\"talking heads\\" documentary that doesn't really tell a story. I would have liked to have seen a couple stories of changes in children...seen the proof. I am a public school administrator. I would have like to have seen how the public school systems can incorporate this without breaking the no religion in school policies and laws. It says Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are in it. Yes, for not even a minute and its not an interview. It shows them at a publicity engagement promoting the David Lynch Foundation.

There are a number of lists of hair and makeup products - but which ones do I choose?

There is basic but nevertheless useful information on caring for grey hair, brightening skin and altering tonal values of makeup and clothing. I wasn't bothered by the fact that some big hair care names were mentioned. The book needs some sponsorship, after all. Resisting pricy products is a little like resisting the urge to color.

It is unfortunate to discover the locking mechanism only locks one side of the bar where the key hole is located and not the other. The biggest downfall is the California Proposition 65 warning that the product contains cancer causing agents, warning that you should wash your hands after handling.Ask yourself this question: How often are you able to wash your hands *right after* locking or unlocking your motorcycle. Two Word Answer - GET REAL!!! No product is worth known exposure to cancer causing agents. No reputable manufacturer will use them where the product is constantly handled. This is a ridiculous product and it is a real shame the product description is not required by law to include the Proposition 65 warning.

Some of the other reviews list the amp getting hot fast at high sound levels, and after a few hours at loud volumes, yes, the amp will get hot. Shutting it down for a few minutes, though, will cool it, and prevent any damage due to overheating. As far as performance, this subwoofer can handle relatively high volumes without distortion.

Ken, it is time to retire..... Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK..... so where is the value in this book?","review":"Books like this are a major frustration. They promise so much but deliver so little. If the authors spent as much time on content as they did on being slick and cute this book might be worth its price, but sadly they didn't.Books do not have to be long and complex to have significant value, but I feel totally cheated when they take a couple pages of real information and work hard to stretch it out to the required number of pages in order to make a sale.Shame on the authors for producing it and shame on the publishers for letting them get away with it.

But when I read it, I realized you don't have to go on for 400 pages to get the point across. Although I'm not sure that every bad relationship could be fixed by an apology, taking the steps suggested in the book sure can't hurt. Plus, knowing you might have to apologize later makes you think about what you're doing NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disapointment","review":"As a professor of business ethics and management I was very encouraged when I came across Blanchard's latest book. Managers are often faced with situations where they do make the wrong decisions due to poor judgement or lack of proper data; This will never change. But on the other hand how they handle these situations after the fact often becomes a matter of ethics (and good sound management). A key tool in these situations is an apology (in all of its various forms).To bad Blanchard took the very critical and complex tool of the apology and made it into a trivial \\"pop-science\\". Making material readable is very important, but making it trival is totally unacceptable and does a tremendous disservice to the reader and the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicer in person than in the picture","review":"I ordered these because they were (VERY) inexpensive during one of Amazon's sales.

However, half-human walking rodents marching in mass, eating everything in sight, including flesh from humans until the point of death seems past the point of fantasy genre for the intended audience age. I also thought the medieval terminology necessary for the plot and setting of the story will require the age group of 9 to 12 to have a very extensive vocabulary to totally understand the book.

It came with a 3 year warranty (24 hour replacemnt)and had it for almost a full week and they are currently holding my Projector hostage. They are claiming that my lamp warranty has expired, I barely used it since I am in school and used it a couple of hours on week days and about 4 to 6 hours on weekends. It dropped from 49% to 63 % in the lamp life and when I sent it in to them it had already dropped to 59% lamp usage. All of this in the economy mode.

The songs are all classic and contemporary Broadway fare, but with an interesting and suprising pop twist. Even if you aren't really a Broadway buff or fan, you'll enjoy this CD. Donny's smooth, strong voice is used to it's advantage here.The strongest tracks are the title track, the beautiful song \\"This Is The Moment\\" from 'Jekyll And Hyde', \\"Immortality\\" from 'Saturday Night Fever', and the absolutely gorgeous duet with Vanessa Williams \\"Not While I'm Around\\" from 'Sweeney Todd'. The whole CD is brilliantly arranged and produced.I also love his renditions of \\"Seasons Of Love\\" from 'Rent' and \\"No Matter What\\" from 'Whistle Down The Wind'. The weakest track I think is \\"You've Got A Friend In Me\\" from 'Toy Story'. It just never grabbed me and I could do without Rosie O'Donnell singing.This is definately Donny Osmond's moment !"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Beautiful As Ever","review":"Donny Osmond shines once again in this new CD. The songs he sings are so beautiful and having him sing them makes the songs even more beautiful.

Rosie O'Donnell sings one of the songs with Donny (\\"You've Got a Friend in Me\\" from \\"Toy Story\\") the two of them are great. If you are a Donny Osmond fan, this is the CD to own!

The duet with Vanessa Williams is masterfully done. The duet with Rosie O' Donnell is fun. The 2 Andrew Lloyd Webber songs are fabulous. This is something you will really enjoy if you are a contemporary Broadway listener. What a treat. I can only hope that Donny Osmond releases more of this genre. His voice is truly one of the best around today."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's done better","review":"I was there when the Osmond Brothers became popular, like most young girls of the day I very much liked listening to Donny and his brothers. I still enjoy their and his music. I have seen Donny in Joseph 7 times. I even saw him in Little Johnny Jones. I have heard him sing with passion and emotion. I'm sad to say, I don't hear it in this collection of Broadway songs. If you want to complete your collection of Donny Osmond records, buy this CD. If you want a good Broadway album, find another. I listened to this CD on three different sound systems thinking that was the fault. Donny's voice is lost under the instrumentations and electronics. He can have a powerful and articulate voice, but it is lost on this recording. I very much enjoy the work of Donny Osmond and I adore Broadway. I hope he tries again and lets his voice ring true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it possible to give LESS than one star?","review":"This album should be burned. His...versions of Braodway songsare an insult to any lover of the theatre. Even the most meaningful ofsongs seem to lose their power under his bizarre arrangments.

I have been a fan of Donny's (Marie's too) for a long time. To date, I believe \\"This Is The Moment,\\" is one of Donny's best musical acomplishments.Some of the Broadway shows Donny pays tibute to are:Seasons of love (Rent)This is the Moment (Jeckyll & Hyde)Luck Be A Lady (Guys & Dolls)It's Possible (Seussical)Not While I'm Around (Sweeny Todd)Give My Regaurds to Broadway (Little Johnny Jones)Threre are 13 tracks and 12 of them are tributes to Broadway. The loner song that made its way on to the CD is not a Broadway hit, but a Disney hit. You've Got A Friend in Me from \\"Toy Story\\" is sung as a duet with Rosie O'Donnell.With the release of \\"This is the Moment,\\" Donny Osmond has found a way to bring his own unique style to this Broadway tribute album.If you are a fan of Donny Osmond, Broadway, or classical/jazz beats this CD is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Donny shows his vocal versatility on this CD.

Overall, the story is not bad. The basic idea of a bus ride to the MMM is a good one. SOME of the characters are nicely drawn, such as Charles Roc Dutton's bus driver, Ossie Davis as the patriarch, and the caring father of the wayward son. But the film is weighed down by Spike Lee's usual soapbox dialogue and polemics. Sadly, few of the characters in this film actually talk, they make speeches (as is the case with \\"The Red Menace\\" and \\"Putney Swope).\\" Like I said, the story itself is good and the above-mentioned characters are nicely drawn. But the dialogue? Go to the soapbox on 125th St. in Harlem as the Black nationalist pontificators pound the podium and you get the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the most horrible film I have ever sat through.","review":"This film was awful. It only serves to perpetuate racial stereotypes, especially carefully veiled, negative opinions regarding whites.

Don't waste your money on this CD... most of the tracks are \\"rip-offs\\" from other artists and their styles. The track \\"My heart beats like a drum\\" is definitely \\"dumb dumb dumb\\" because it's a complete rip-off from their own hit single \\"Around the world.\\" Other tracks sound similar to the styles of other hit artists (i.e. N'SYNC, Backstreet Boys, Enrique Iglesias, No Doubt, just to name a few).

As the CD liner notes reveal in tiny print, the cute young faces on the cover are not the people who sang the vocals.

The presence of some sugary, synth-heavy Euro-pop-dance confections that owe more than a little to Abba, Aqua, and Robert Miles (\\"Around the World,\\" \\"Why Oh Why,\\" \\"Until,\\" and \\"Mind Machine\\") does little to make up for the dishonest packaging, infantile lyrics, or the tepid attempts in the second half of the CD to ape the Backstreet Boys and Enrique Iglesias."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Great Stuff!!

They do a wonderful job of combining dance, pop, and ballads. This album has 14 tracks, 3 interludes, and 1 bonus remix! That makes it well worth the money! 5 of the tracks are ballads, while the remaining 9 are upbeat dance songs. It also has a 15 page booklet with the words to all the songs and tons of pictures!

But I decided to keep it after listening to all the songs closely again. The lyrics are good. And most of the songs have an upbeat, kinda outerspace theme going on. I suppose that I thought that I should just give them a chance. It is good dance music and some of the songs can easily get stuck in your head.

I had heard the Lalala song on the radio and scrambled to find this CD. I was excited the day I bought it, which soon turned to dismay when I found that pretty much the entire CD sounds the same. Especially numbers 2 and 3, lalala and the bells song. I thought I had put my stereo on repeat for a minute. The only songs I thought had any merit on the CD were numbers 11 (Mind Machine) and number 13.

Other songs on this album have the same sound, but none are as sophisticated as the popular radio tune, and they make the album trashy.

There wasn't an in between. Thanks to ATC, europop now has the ability to convert people into loving it.\\"Around The World (La La La La La)\\" needs to be listened to by everyone. It's the most played song in German radio history. This song is what converts people. I myself used to resent europop, but once I heard this song, I instantaneously became addicted with it.

But you must keep in mind that the author takes Ancient Egyptian beliefs more seriously than most 20th Century Americans--Some of his ideas are a bit dotty by my lights. But he is fair and reasonably unbiased. The book format is tall, narrow, and thick--probably about as small as possible to get the information across, but still larger than ideal if you plan to take it into the field with you in Egypt. The size ends up not being totally satisfactory for either leisurely reading or as a field companion.

I have looked through the Sybex CCNA book and found that it is much more accurate and easier to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"CNAP - CCNA1 v3.0 and 2 third Ed.","review":"I ordered this title through Borders in P.R., I waited 12 weeks for it to get it, and I need to make a full review before starting with this new version at our Cisco Regional Academy, just because it's very important to see how it matches the curriculum, searching for errors...and I found from the beginning more than 32 pertaining the section of optics...it really dissapoints me to recommend this for my students, just because is not a good starting point to learn concepts or descriptions with those mistakes...I am actually teaching this at the Aspira Cisco Academy in P.R., I think it was to fast to develop this new version and its not the first time I found such things, I got a lot of titles with the same problems, instead of those books that are not fully revised, when thinking from the point of view of the people who are making a large investments in their educational preparation to keep them up to date, that's why I like to review them before any...recomendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"I finished the first CCNA class with the new 3.0 curriculum. It was a nightmare. Nearly every student was failing because they made the mistake of reading the book. We soon figured out that the book was useless in preparation for the academy tests. Cisco was \\"worki8ng the bugs out\\". One of the complaints I had was Cisco-last semester- would take one sentence from the book and have it on the test. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. If you are in the Cisco Academy, spend the money on ink and paper and print out the online curriculum, which by the way, is totally different than the book-more focused to the test objectives. The first few weeks of the new curriculum found several hundred students at my school near failing because of \\"the bugs\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong title","review":"I was looking for CCNA 1 & 2 Companion Guide Revised Third Edition, from that page I clicked on 'used & new' link and oredered what I thought was the same product.

The cd that comes with it is even worse. it gives conflicting answers and the design is poor. avoid this book if you can. i am losing faith in cisco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor book","review":"I can't believe Cisco would allow this book to be printed. It's as if the book was never reviewed by a technical editor. Their are a huge number of errors and the writing is clumsy. Unfortunately the online material is, in my opinion, not much better. Shame on Cisco for putting this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong entry in House of Winslow series","review":"This was a good strong entry in the House of Winslow series and helped to make up for some previously weak entries. Erin Winslow who grew up in Africa searches for something more in her life. The character of Stephen is more of a plot device than an actual character, but Quaid is strong and well worth reading about. I would have liked more in depth about his struggle with alcohol though. Morris has finally learned to get the reader interested in the next book by introducing characters in this one. Amelia is an intriguing character and I looked forward to reading the next book in the series that focussed on her and her brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This was the first book I read by Gilbert Morris and I absolutely loved it!

Things I love about this carafe:*keeps coffee hot!*easy to use -- simple screw on cap, one handed dispensing (just press on tab with thumb)*lightweight but solid construction (I bumped it a couple times but with no adverse affects to the lining)*delicious design . . . sphere is so geometrically simple, and yet so pleasing to the eye*comes in an array of colors and finishes (tough to decide -- I chose the classy and modern frosted black)The number one reason that I love the idea of a carafe is that it keeps my coffee hot and fresh, with that \\"just brewed\\" taste (as opposed to leaving it in its brewing pot on the warmer, where it always seems to degenerate into scalded, yucky coffee after a few hours).I also find it useful for when I have company over, or for keeping at my desk so I don't have to run back to the kitchen for a refill.Love it, love it, love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic Mystique -- More information!","review":"I've noticed that Amazon doesn't appear to have the artists listed anywhere in their descriptions for this here or the non-U.S.A. available versions (available elsewhere, such as amazon.co.uk, amazon.co.de, etc.)After some homework, I finally located all the titles' artists, and thought I'd share:1.

I've never used a bad s-video cable, until I tried theXbox 360 S-Video AV Cablefor my 360 (my TV's component in is wonky). Dot crawl, moire, and just plain fuzzy. I'm not sure it was the cable or the connector that plugs in the back of the 360, but it was awful.Knowing that there had to be a better solution, I paid the extra dough and bought this Microsoft cable. It does everything you'd expect, and in a pinch it works as a composite cable. No more moire or dot crawl, and the picture quality rivals component for SD TVs. Is it lame to have to pay $25-30 for a decent s-video cable--yes, but paying $15-20 for a horrible one is even worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xbox 360 S Video Av Cable","review":"This is a great product for those who don't have a Hdtv such as myself. It contains the normal composite cables plus a s video, which is better then then composite. Great, simple and reliable product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture Quality","review":"Synopsis - S-Video interface is much better than the yellow composite RCA input that comes with the component cables. If you have a standard definitions (old tube) TV and you are not going to upgrade to an HDTV for awhile, this is well worth it to have a sharper and clearer picture. Can tell a difference with the S-Video input.Was dissatisfied with how the yellow video RCA input looked on my SDTV. Wasn't planning on updating to an HDTV for awhile and saw a review about how the S-Video cables made the picture look sharper. Purchased this cable on amazon and when it came I tested the video input between the S-Video and yellow composite. I could tell a big difference. Had my wife confirm what I saw to see if she could tell a difference and she could. She works as a video editor and can tell the difference in video inputs. Great purchase, just wish Microsoft had included it with the Xbox 360 out of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Worked","review":"I ordered this cable for our son's tv which was not a HD so he could hook up his Xbox 360 worked as showed and we like the s video makes picture 100 % clearer and clean like never before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Correct and True????","review":"I thought this book would be interesting but it turned out to be nothing of the sort.

They had a great narrator with insight from real veterans who fought in these battles. The producers of the DVD did not need to show blood and guts like a video game. You got the feel of the battles from the veterans' descriptions and stories. I hope they will make a DVD for season two because I still have all of season two on my DVR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth watching for interviews with veterans, but seriously flawed","review":"Interviews with veterans are great but that is where the good news end. This is pop history with serious errors, incomplete research, inaccurate CGI, etc. Still, it is enough to spark interest and imagination so that's a plus. Watch it to get some perspective on the horrors of war from people who were there, but then do your own research.Another, rather annoying fact, is that the documentary literally repeats itself endlessly every 10-15 min or so, because it was designed for commercial breaks. So, multiple times during one episode, the screen goes blank momentarily (where the commercials would be) and then, immediately starts summarizing the entire episode up to that point, to allow for short span of an average viewer who must have \\"forgot\\" everything over the commercial break! So, there is actually a lot less material than the length of the episodes may lead you to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"Loved watching this series on the military channel.

After a couple weeks it wouldn't print and had to go back to Sony for a 6 week repair job. Now it works, but the print quality is horrible. The pictures are dull and the color is horrible. Background scenese are just blobs of color and there is no contrast whatsoever. If have since bought a Canon i560, which I intended to just use for day to day document printing. But I've compared the same picture coming from both and it is night and day -- the bubble jet that costs less and does more functions prints 2-3 times better. The pictures are sharp, the contrast is great, and the dullness does not exist. I'd suggest staying as far away from this Sony as possible -- it's a rip off and you can do MUCH better with a good Inkjet or Bubblejet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Quality Printing, But...","review":"This printer does excellent, quality, professional printing but I cannot recommend purchasing it. Sony has changed the ink cartridge when they came out with the DPP-FP30 & the DPP-FP50 and no longer make the cartridge for this printer. If you purchase this printer, make sure you get a lifetime supply of ink cartridges before buying or you will find that the printer is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEST PRINTER EVER, BUT NO RIBBONS AVAILABLE","review":"Sony created a fantastic printer. The results are even better than the typical local chain drug store's services. However, Sony has DROPPED THE BALL and will no longer supply printer paper and their proprietary SVM series ribbons, so anyone with a printer of this series now owns a very expensive paperweight. Consequently, I recommend that nobody buy the new printer advertised here. Only Sony's proprietary ribbons and paper will work in the unit. I think we should flood Sony with angry calls, so they make the supplies available. Their number is 212-833-8000. Press 3 to dial by name, and key in \\"Stringer\\" (Howard Stringer is the President of Sony).

If you want to discover ECW don't get this DVD just yet, buy cyberslam '99 or something like that first.

The 4th and 8th cuts are my personal favs. The deftness of the violins is especially beautiful in the 4th cut, as is the piano in the 8th cut. The 6th cut also has some fine piano, and the accompanying guitar is a nice highlight in the 9th cut. The entire CD has very nice percussion throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time!","review":"I agree that The Amazing Race is the best show on any network and I think most fans of the show would enjoy having their own copies of each season.

Malford Milligan, Charlie Sexton, Doyle Bramhall II, Susan Tedeshi, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Johnny Lang, Jimmie Vaughan, Dr. John, Willie Nelson are the old and new friends that join in and make this such a real and fun CD. This is one of those CD's that the only thing wrong with it is that it eventually has to stop.

However, unlike their previous stints with Storyville and the Arc Angels this CD is pretty mellow and laid back. Not to say that this is bad but considering the talent on this CD, as well as the past appearances of Double Trouble with SRV, the Arc Angels and Storyville, I was expecting more Blues/Rock rather than top forty style ballads. Three songs do stand out on this dics, they are \\"Turn Towards the Mirror\\"--Bramhall, \\"In the Middle of the Night\\"--Jimmie Vaughan, and \\"Groundhog Day\\"--Jonny Lang. Both Vaughan and Lang will have new releases of their own this spring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Trouble is BACK!!","review":"This album is AWESOME! I have had it for about 2 weeks now and love every track on it. Lots of guest appearances by some of the BEST in Rock and Blues. The diversity of this album is the key here.

My impression is that the people involved just came around the studio for an hour or two and did their part. The result is quite uninspired and to be frank - boring. There are so many better albums in this genre, so I strongly advise you to skip this one. I bought this album on sale, got home and listened to it a couple of days, and just realized that I would never play it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money blues fans, this is more trouble than double","review":"What a major downer this disk is! The concept of bringing together many of the players/friends of SRV and new guitar slingers like Sheppard and Lang was a good one. However, one embarassing track after another highlights how much Stevie Ray Vaughan was the spark to making Double Trouble sound so electrifying. Charlie Sexton, Lou Ann Barton, Dr. John, etc. have weak material and deliver luke-warm performances that make me cringe. One listen to this disk was all I could take before tossing it into the dumpster. Even Jimmy Vaughan sounds tired on his duet with Barton, spooling out a lack-luster guitar solo that is a shadow of his fabulous work with the Thunderbirds and last two solo outings. I should have listened to the sound-bites available on this site. What a hodge-podge of a disk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Trouble without SRV? I'm afraid so..","review":"Well, let's start by saying this album is OK. That's it. It's just OK. It doesn't even stand a chance against SRV's albums like The Sky is Crying and In Step. Sounds to me a bit like Double Trouble wanted a SRV sound but with new millenium blues. Sorry guys, but Tommy Shannon and Chris Layton aren't very good at it. They should stick with contempory blues.Albums by Tommy Castro or Scott Holt are contemporary blues, kind of like this, but a lot more well done. Hey Double Trouble-listen to Tommy Castro's \\"Right as Rain\\" and see some real 2000 blues. I liked these guys better with SRV. And BTW, the Susan T. parts of this CD are horrible, she has a lack of soul and it's as if she has no respect for SRV. Some songs are ok, but no one can replace Stevie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...this album is truely awful!","review":"If you like SRV....forget this album.

Also, if you want to hear the vocals, listen to the real soundtrack. The vocals on this are terrible (especially the ensemble- they don't blend at all), especially compared to the original cast. So, if you're smart, you'll buy the pocketsongs version.

I was overly disappointed when I heard how unlike the OBC recording this disc was. Frankly, I was stunned. The makers took their own liberties as far as extending bridges and instrumentals (as heard in No One Mourns The Wicked's intro), and it was quite confusing. I know. Yes, it is karaoke. But isn't the point of karaoke to make the song easily understood for all who perform it? I am very familiar with the score and I could seldom make out which were which beats. Especially during something bad, dancing through life, and even defying gravity. I am really open-minded and i tried to accept it for what it was.

I've also virtually memorized the music from the original cast album, and have read the vocal score). Sloppy playing by the musicians, absent orchestral parts (synthesized or not), whole gaps in the score, accompanied by strange phrasings that made me wonder if they had done a complete re-write, or were perhaps playing the music from memory.

I am a professional singer and vocal teacher and I perform with and use pocket songs and other instrumental tracks on a very regular basis. I also bought both this and the pocket songs version and while yes, I can appreciate variety and taking creative licenses, this took that way too far. It is admireable that they used real instruments, but only a select few were used and each stood out far too much. It is not easy to make me dislike *anything* that has to do with Wicked. I believe it is one of the best shows to appear on Broadway, but this did the trick. While the woman who sang Elphaba's songs was quite talented, she is really the only saving grace. Don't waste your money. The pocket songs version is by far superior (not to mention less expensive)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but very disappointing compare to alternatives...","review":"I was really disappointed with this particular CD. I bought both this one and the Pocket Songs version (JT 325, which Amazon also sells), and although I listened to this one first, I was disappointed at first listen. The arrangements are clearly over-synthesized, and not even synthesized well. (Frankly, I probably could have created these arrangements on my own keyboard at home and done as well.) The tempos are spotty and certainly not up to the same tempo as the original versions, and the background vocals, while certainly are not terrible, are not the best representations of the original versions.

The only plus is this is the only version you can get with graphics. The Pocket Songs version is better and the most complete of all available versions. If you can find it, Priddis put out what I think is the best version on 2 discs. The tempos and orchestrations are nearly exact to the show.

There are no real instrumentations - instead, the background CD uses keyboards and synthesized orchestra parts. The flow is shoddy, at best. There are also numerous instrument picks that are ridiculously out of place - for example, strange \\"horn\\" instrumentation in \\"For Good\\" was really bizarre and distracting.If you're looking for a instrumentation CD for practing with, by all means, try to find a used one, think twice about spending full retail on this item.If you're looking to perform or use for any type of audition - please think twice.

And what a combination it is! The beauty of this work lies in three facts. First, they are not working in isolation. In fact, five of these songs grow out of their association with the music ministry of a Belmont university campus and a local church in Franklin, TN. Second, the music matches the hymn and song lyrics as far as tone, emotion, and singability is concerned. Third, Jars' vocals and production continue to improve and sometimes even amaze. A few of the vocalizations, in fact, have a \\"Beatlesque\\" sound to them. In other words, this is one fine CD that will only get better with repeat listenings!

Theoretically the trick to cornsticks that you can hope to ever actually remove from the pan is to preheat the well-seasoned, greased pan thoroughly. Remove it from the oven and then add the batter carefully, so you don't burn yourself or any part of your kitchen - and proceed. The cornsticks should come out easily. If they don't, you are in good company. And at least you have a cute-looking, historic, relatively inexpensive American pan that someone, somewhere can bake successful cornsticks in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Idea but not worth the trouble","review":"We've got two of these and must say that while cute as the dickens conceptually, they aren't worth the time. First of all, the corn image doesn't come out clearly. Secondly, they are difficult to clean after the first few times. Thirdly, you would need three to fit the corn mix of two Jiffy Cornbread boxes (which is mostly what we make.)Now, if these facts don't set you back and you are still interested in purchasing this product, let me tell you that THE best way of getting the best corn kernel image is to coat the bottom with Crisco -- all veggie version please. You have your heart's health to maintain. We tried various versions of spray oil (ie, regular Pam, Pam-like spray with Flour, Grilling Pam) and the Crisco butter-flavored sticks worked best.Pam T~mom/blogger"},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A must read for any pilot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"It is utterly amazing that Wolfgang Langewieshe could understand the behavior of aircraft so well after they had been flying for only 41 years. You've learned what you need to know for the written exam and maybe even your checkride. Now its time for \\"flying 102\\". Read this and you will understand flying better than many 40-500 hour pilots(An unfortunate fact given accident statistics in this experience range). After reading this, you will understand how seemingly competent pilots can easily get into trouble for a lack of \\"true\\" understanding. At least, it will make you a better pilot.....At best, it may save your life....Jason Ensminger, M.D., Sport Pilot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing better for perspective pilots","review":"Yeah, the book was written long ago. And suprise the author didn't have pinpoint accuracy in predicting the future.But nothing compares to this wonderful book for someone who wishes to become a pilot.I was given this wonderful book by an aunt while suffering a short hospital stay. She knew I was intrigued by airplanes. Was only 14 at the time. The book was terrific and explained fairly complex things in a way one could understand. Not without some effort on my part. But still I have never seen it done better.I read, and reread this book dreaming of one day flying myself. It would be ten years before I was in a position to get a license. And rereading this book for the 5th or 6th time before starting on the training was a tremendous help. As someone else commented \\"flying in your imagination\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things they just don't teach you in Flight School","review":"I'm not a complete fan of the writing style, but the information offered is quite valuable to me anyway let's say. There are items of interest you might not, or most likely will not get from MOST CFI's. No offense, but too many people rush through school just to get certified then become a CFI. They get the right answers that they memorized on the test based on what they have to answer, flew the right patterns well enough to get by and so on, you know the type. Not saying the right answers are wrong, but a lot of those test-passers can talk the talk but can't walk jack-s***.The point is, this book breaks down many important concepts that I personally am not just memorizing, but making mine. If there was an emergency situation, and I knew you read this book, I would rather have you flying the plane than someone who's flown for 10 or more years and hasn't. (Read the book.)Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Informative!","review":"To begin, the entire Amazon experience was great. The product itself was the icing on the cake.

Stick and Rudder covers many important aspects of flight from an angle not available in modern texts.Stick and Rudder is tough reading and is only appropriate for those passionate about aviation who want to understand why things work, not just how they work. With that mindset, any pilot will be able to improve their skills after reading Langewiesche's explanation of all the fundamentals of flight.While not easy to read, the concepts taught in Stick and Rudder are well thought out and explicated. It's amazing that 60 years after it was written, instructors still haven't learned from Langewiesche's style.

For a student pilot, I can see where some of what's presented might be confused with the curriculum that today's instructor could be trying to get across. Of course, my review here is biased since I read it after 400 hours but I feel that this book has given me an additional, though slightly different, view of aerodynamics and has definitely helped me become a better pilot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding flying","review":"Having just started the pilot course, I got the advice to buy this book.

Anyone who disses this book is an accident waiting to happen. If you can't recover from a spin don't fly an airplane. I added that last comment to encourage students to make sure your CFI teaches you the procedure. It is simple and may save your life.

By the time he passed on last February at the age of 94, literally hundreds of thousands of both new and experienced pilots had learned the profound truths of aviation from \\"Stick and Rudder.\\" It is, quite simply, the ONLY book that explains everything a pilot does and why he must do it. Certainly there are elements of \\"Stick and Rudder\\" that are in need of an update, and the writing style is rather \\"classical\\" to contemporary eyes, but there is wisdom here that you will not find anywhere else.

It helped me understand how and why things work or don't work when flying. Most of what I believed was wrong or at least why I thought something was right was wrong. You read this book and think, \\"Of course. If I want to stretch my glide I should lower the nose of the airplane.\\" Of course before reading what he wrote I would have told my friends the exact opposite. If you know how to fly it is a great book to learn how to explain it to your friends that don't. If you want to play flight simulator this is a must have book. The only problem is it is hard to read while your flying and sometimes what he writes is hard to believe unless your looking out of the cockpit and seeing that everything he writes is perfect. If you have anything to do with flying this is a must have book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The all time classic about the fundamentals of flying.","review":"Stick & Rudder is an all time favorite about how an airplane flies. Written over 50 years ago, it explains in a very easy-to-understand manner the basic four forces of flight, the three axis of motion, how an airfoil works, how basic aerodynamics affects flight, and how to perform the fundamental maneuvers. The information is as valid now as the day it was written. As a ground and flight instructor, I have used this as a basic text for all my students for the past 12 years. Discusses in detail straight & level flight, climbs and descents, turns, stalls, takeoffs, landings, torque, various aircraft configurations, and piloting techniques. An absolute \\"must have\\" for every pilot from Recreational to Airline Transport certificate, this is the FIRST book every aspiring pilot should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be on the \\"Required Reading\\" list for all pilots!","review":"\\"Stick and Rudder\\" is absolutely, without a doubt, the best book ever written on the actual mechanics of making an airplane fly. It discusses, in clear, understandable terms, what good pilots do when flying airplanes. I first read this book while I was a student pilot struggling with landings. After I read it, I began applying the techniques the author discusses, and noticed an immediate improvement in my flying. Now that I'm a CFI, I recommend this book to all my students. In my opinion, this should be THE book used to teach basic flight maneuvers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE FOR ANY STUDENT PILOT","review":"This book is simply amazing.

And there is sooo much, so unless you are satisfied just flipping through a book before leaving it for dead, you can count on working on this book for awhile! Yes, a lot of it focuses on war, but unfortunately, wars have become the significant milestones of the past 100+ years of history. It is still very exciting to get to see so much \\"up close and personal\\" thanks to the photographers who took the time to take the shots!My only complaint about the book is that I found some of the captions to be excessively slanted, politically. Obviously captions are necessary to explain what we are seeing, but I felt that some of them they were also saturated in judgement that was simply not called for, even for a photojournalism book. Not quite enough to be obnoxious, but enough for me to give it 4 instead of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A short review of Century","review":"This book is excellent! I feel as though the use of photographs to depict the last century instead of words was different and effective. With some of the photographs, I could feel sense or feel the emotions displayed, especially the photographs of the depression and World War II. The layout of the book is well done, dividing the century into transitional sections versus decades. I was slightly disappointed not to see any pictures about the Titanic. The title of the book includes the words, \\"progress, regression, suffering, and hope\\", all of which I think describe the Titanic."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Without Error","review":"This book has a lot of gruesome pictures and is not for those who wish to be shielded from the dark side of the last century. It certainly has a lot of images that makes one wish we could find a way to bring a stop to all of this horror, but this century is not off to a good start either.I do wonder about the accuracy of this book after discovering an error. The picture on page 421 that purports to be of Nazis executing people somewhere in the baltic in 1942 is actually a picture of Nazi war criminals being executed in Poland in 1946. One wonders how many other pictures are mislabeled."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little less editorializing, please","review":"The book was given as a gift for my daughter, who loaned it to me. I found the over emphasis on war, misery, and man's inhumanity to man tiresome and depressing. Also, I could have done without the editorializing as a photograph tells it all, anyway. The past 100 years included scientific achievements in space, medicine, engineering, and the arts as well as other events which should have been noted, but instead, the author chose to burden us with photograph after photograph of the dead, starving, and maimed. I will not be looking at this depressing work again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased view of the century","review":"This book takes a particular approach to the century; that is chronicalling \\"what we've been through\\", and the author puts it. There are page after page of war pictures, mostly of agony and dead bodies. There is no accounting of the extraordinary advances or achievements in science, medicine, the arts. I bought it as a gift, and it will have to be returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Negative! ZERO Stars, Really!","review":"We received this book as a Christmas Gift, and I now I've got to figure out what to do with it. What a terrible waste of money! This book depicts the century in a truly negative light, presenting pictures full of suffering and violence, even stacks of corpses. It is too big to ingnore, and too horrible to display. I don't understand what anyone could find appealing in this book, even the non-negative pictures were nothing spectacular. Don't buy this book, especially not as a gift!

Other than that, the cable is perfect. Works great, no problems. I bought this cable because I ran out of HDMI ports on my TV, but had plenty of spare Component ports. This cable is capable of displaying 1080p for games, but only 1080i for content from Zune. This may not be an issue for you if your TV is smaller than 50 inches(like mine) or if your TV isn't capable of handling more than 720p over component(like most older HDTV units).

I have had great luck with monster in the past but was too cheap and decided to trust microsoft.Note: I bought the microsoft vga cable at a local store and the picture was horrible and might as well have been the lowest end.

But, regardless, you're not seeing all the great graphics without this cable. I am old school and just bought a 360 and am loving the graphics. Some of the graphics are definitely wasted by using just the yellow video plug. Go for component video if at all possible. For even more sharpness, buy a power conditioner.

To be specific the David Gilmour era - TDB and TDSOT. There is also a heavy Beatle influence on a few songs. To me, that is a good thing! With that said they aren't clones, they do have their own sound. The songs are very smooth and the cd is very well produced and polished. Too bad that they will never get airplay in the US market. This is also available as an SACD hybrid in both stereo and 5.1 surround. If you have a system capable of playing sacd in 5.1 then I suggest you search it out. The first time that slide guitar comes through the center speaker (about a minute into the first song) you will be glad you did.

Latifah takes that song and puts her own spin on it. And while This appears on QL's last studio rap album,Order in the Court, she sings on the track. And while Latifah's lyrics are great, at times her voice is only half there. At times, it sounds as if Queen Latifah was singing with her mouth half closed. That is the main reason why I kicked off a star. She has sang on her rap records a lot but never showed her great vocal range that is expressing now. Kind of likeWeekend LovefromBlack Reign. She had a good singing voice on that track but unilke her current music and Just like \\"Paper\\", I think she downplayed her vocal abilities because of her image as a rapper.

(2 1/2 cups.) If you want a small carafe, this one is nice, but it is a little too small for me.UPDATE: I have discovered that there is a design flaw in the lid. You depress the lever to pour your coffee and the coffee can go into the lid. I discovered this while rinsing the lid - when I depressed the lever, coffee came out!!! It wouldn't be a problem if all the liquid rinsed out at once, but I have to shake the lid while depressing the lever repeatedly and, sometimes, there is still liquid in the lid (I can hear it.)

I bought this book because it had many reviews and most of them where good. I figured the couple of bad reviews where people who just like to complain. I buy many books and like most of them. But this book was the biggest waste of money I have come across. This book is definately for beginners who want to setup Users and Groups.

Is AD an important part of Win2k? Do bears live in the woods? Yes it is important, but you still have to deal with TCP/IP and security too.Fortunately for the publishers, and us, you can also buy a Win2K stup book, Security book, etc, etc.Which one do you need?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"This book has some very good information, but, does not convey information adequate to supply a system administrator with the information necessary to run a network. It appears that that was the intent of the book, and I think the writers missed the mark.As examples, the backup utility is described. Unfortunately, the creation and maintenance of media pools is not discussed. One cannot use backup effectively (maybe not at all) unless the media pools and media are created and managed in advance of performing a backup.As a second example, the group policy discussion tempts you about creating an install package for software but never shows you how.This book will be one that I will use after exhausting other more reliable sources of information when I want an alternative view of Windows 2000 Server architecture and administration.Not a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"This book has everything you need to know.

What separates this book from its electronically broadcasted brethren is one key component: good editing. Leitch's drawn out diatribes and abhorrent use of language leave the audience suffering from more than his self-effacing semi-biography.

Most important, Mead clarifies the musical responses and exigencies which brought about this impressive technique in very readable english.

Its two-sidedness at first seems clever but in fact, by being \\"reversible,\\" with both sides usable for cooking, the \\"seasoning\\" on the side toward the burner gets wrecked each time you cook. In addition, being virtually handleless, it is nearly impossible to move when hot. It's meant to stay put - on your stove. You have to leave it alone for a good hour, before washing up.

All sections of the orchestra seem to relish Prokofiev's sense of the grotesque. There is no want the balletic or lyrical beauty either, nor of the epic - just listen to the cataclysmic climax of the slow movement of the 5th!My only quibble was the lack of presence of the gong, however what a thrill to hear the growling tuba and trombones and uninhibited clarinets.The 7th is hardly a cinderella piece and is given its best performance in decades.The rarity of hearing outstanding performances of Prokofiev's last 3 symphonies(his greatest)on disc, let alone in concert programmes, is frustrating and totally unjustified.

I agree with another reviewer who said that you could read this in sections because of the organization. There is so much material in the book for any student of American History. I found the chapters on MacArthur, the Bomb, and Vietnam (Nixon) to be especially enlightening. I have to say that I think the best chapter is entitled \\"D-Day Revisited\\".

It is very interesting to read, but its shorter nature does not allow readers to answer all of the questions they may have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and Concise","review":"I have just started reading Ambrose's work, and I enjoy every moment of it.

There were pieces from various wars in which America participated and the perspectives were well presented. There's no attempt to write history here -- merely a sample of the times and conditions as they were from the Civil War to the Gulf. An easy read and one that packed enjoyment. If you're looking for serious analysis of strategy and tactics, there are better places. If you want to consider the thoughts and reflections of some human charcaters in combat, this is a good spot to start. It was especilaly nice for those of us who commute by public transit, with bite-sized pieces to easily digest in a short time span.

They come up with an idea and the publisher says sure before even looking at it.This is not really a history book. It's Ambrose stating his opinion about a number of points in our history. In many cases there isn't even a real description of what happened - just his opinion.For example, in 24 small pages, he tries to \\"understand\\" MacArthur. For someone that complex, giant books have struggled to understand him.All in all, a waste of time (and paper)."},{"rating":"1","title":"History writ simple","review":"geez, Ambrose can really churn it out, can't he? What we have here appears to be a collection of sweepings from Ambrose's floor; stuff he couldn't fit into other books or just had lying around.

Apparently, the water was quite choppy. Give me a break!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly sloppy and uniformed with a few good bits","review":"Ambrose writes in a mostly accessible style which is not a bad thing, but this book is a mish mash of different magazine pieces that have virtually nothing in common and are quite uneven in quality. Further, some of his work is just pure opinion based on almost no real scholarship, (his arguments about the bombing of japan or the cold war come to mind).

This main vocal is done by a man named Otto Von Werner and various versions of these tracks have appeared on several albums since the early 90's.These tracks are an interesting listen, but not worth spending money on.

Madonna recorded three background tracks for Otto Von Werner in the early 80's. She didn't write or play any of the instruments on this album. Otto then re-edited the tracks so there are now 8 (sometimes 10 depending on the collecting he is pushing, these songs are nothing like what Madonna was recording at the time (for that \\"real\\" Madonna material check out \\"In The Beginning\\" or \\"Pre-Madonna\\" to hear some great \\"lost\\" material. \\"Give It To Me\\" is by all accounts awful, flacid, and dull. Do not blame Madonna though, as the majority of these songs aren't even songs at all just a mish mash of retrend beats and phrases. Otto Von Werner is the bad guy here not Madonna.

It's like listening to the same song that's been cut and pasted together in ten different ways (all of them very painful to listen to). It's a big collage of very uninteresting, boring quasi-music. This is the same old pastiche that's been around for years--Mr. Von Wernherr just keeps repackaging the stuff differently every few years in hopes that more people will buy them. Don't be fooled!

On \\"On The Street\\", that line is sampled so the chours is \\"Dancing, Dancing, on the street. On The street.\\" What the hell? This was so awful that even my cat was ready to kill herself unless I turned it off. Oh and the rest is just sound clips being sampled together to form So-Called \\"Songs\\".

The strong songwriting (mostly from band members) gives Mango a chance to display their widely varied musical skills. All members display exemplary musicianship. Highlights in a very strong set are the opening track \\"Tempestaad\\" (music set to an adaptation of Pablo Neruda's poem about a storm) and the almost-subversive cover of the Bacharach/David classic \\"The Look of Love.\\" Marquez's breathy phrase \\"don't ever go\\" before Donna Viscuso burns up a sax solo, just grabs at your heart.

The retractable tip means there's no cap to lose, and the easy disassembly makes it very easy to clean and refill. This pen may be a bit thicker than \\"regular\\" pens, but I love the feel, balance, and weight of it -- it feels like you're writing with a quality instrument.

We bought this tent to better fit the family on our last camping trip. To our surprise when we tried to set it up, the grommet and tab that connects the pole to the ground was missing on one of the four corners. Also missing was the tab and grommet to stake down one of the mud porch flaps. We rigged the pole to our vehicle using some spare rope and used a rock to hold down the mud porch. It seemed ingenuity might keep the tent upright, but then a tab that was sewn onto the tent detached. We ended up fitting the whole family in the bed and cab of the truck for the night. We took down the tent and stowed the items in the carrying bag, hoping the experience with the tent would be over. Not quite. The seam on the bag now has a hole! The tent is tall and roomy but terrible for the wind. This is the worst quality I have seen in any product in a very long time.

It was great. So, I was really hopeful for Christmas Cupid. It is semi-cute which about the best I can say for it. There's some humor to it, but the story just isn't that solid and tended to wander a bit. Cynthia Evans character comes off rather sleezy which I didn't think was appropriate for a Christmas movie. Then again, ABC Family has been far from \\"Family oriented\\" with much of their recent programming. So, in many ways, I guess I should have seen this movie coming.I might suggest renting it and watching it one time, but I would keep the younger kids out of the room. My teenager thought it was boring and not very funny - keep in mind that my teenager loved Snowglobe too.

Anyone who knows me, or doesn't, based on reading my reviews here, will tell you that. On the whole, though, I struggled with Niccolo Rising, primarily because the author lost me when she got into the political events of the time. Frankly, I was bored, so much that I began to skip pages to get to the more interesting parts. The language is dense and difficult to follow. I had to read this book is short fits and starts because the author really packs the information in, sometimes to the detriment of the plot. But when the plot got back to Claes, it was actually quite interesting. It's just too bad that there was so little plot there. It was disappointing, considering all the good things I'd heard about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series has it all!","review":"I am buying the Kindle versions of Dorothy Dunnett's books because I have read and re-read my paperback copies so often that they are falling apart. The Niccolo books use some of the standard devices of romance novels (misunderstood hero, star-crossed lovers, difficult quest)but Dunnet's intelligent prose, multifaceted characters and detailed research into the historical context raise her novels far above average historical fiction. Dunnett's Lymond series is also wonderful. She's the best, as far as I'm concerned: you get a LOT of story for your money with Dunnett."},{"rating":"1","title":"A laborious disappointment","review":"I'm a lover of historical fiction, especially ones set during the Middle Ages. This is the reason I pruchased Niccolo' Rising by Dorthy Dunnett. I was especially excited by the Bruges setting, as I have visited this beautiful and historic walled city a number of times. However, the novel has not lived up to expectations. It is a tedious read mostly because of Dunnett's extremely awkward writing style. In addition, she makes the story way too complicated with too many characters that are not necessary to the plot. Her descriptions of places and characters fail to give the reader adequate, let alone clear, mental pictures. It's too bad that her tedious and complicated writing style got it the way of an otherwise interesting story line. Even Hella Haassee was an easier read. I will not continue with this series of novels, and my choice for this genre remains Sharron K.

It explains the birth of the banking system, the mercantile system and so on. No matter how brilliant you are, one has to explain it to be able to build on it. And that's what Dunnett does with elegance. Do not drop the book, it takes few chapters and then starts the fabulous ascension of Nicholas.Each book happens in a different country. I've visited all but one and Dunnett left me breathless. Again, you can't put any book down. So, stick to it and you'll have a great reward of knowledge, history and fiction.

Be patient--sorting out the characters, setting, and slang can be a little overwhelming, but proves well-worth the effort (and makes the rest of the series a piece of cake). Ended up ordering the other seven books after reading this first installment, and couldn't wait to have my questions from Niccolo Rising answered in Spring of the Ram. Spoiler alert: many of these questions aren't answered until the end of the series! For such a rocky start, the book was a great finish. It felt like saying goodbye to an old friend 4,000+ pages (8 books) later. May re-read the set someday just to check out all the subtleties I missed during the first go-round! Good stuff!

The beauty of Porter's ideas are that they can be applied to your own specific business or division or they can be applied to your overall company. Competition is universal and that's what makes Porter's wisdom so important. I enjoyed his analysis of watching your competitors actions and also I found his comments about being mindful of your suppliers very useful too. It's just such a useful and important book that everyone should be revisiting it every few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unpleasent surprise","review":"I've heard about this book and Michael Porter for a long time; the people I have talked to absolutelly adore him and his writings, but I must say I was througly and repeatedly disappointed in this book.

I would have to wash my hair every day because it gets oily and looks dirty if I leave it for one day. With the Fekkai, I can go one day without washing and not look like a slob. The shampoo and conditioner make my hair keep its volume for at least the next 10 hours. It will also keeps its shape all day. I love taking my hand through the back of my hair and feeling that there is still volume.Another good product to use is the Fekkai Root Lifter. I use it on my towel-dried hair and then blow dry.

I didn't want to build a speaker box for regular car speakers so I decided to try some smaller outdoor speakers. I hooked a pair of these up to a lower end Kenwood 4x50 watt car stereo/CD/mp3 player. These speakers sound great. I've had them for about a month now and they handle the rough, dusty roads on our place without any problem. They seem pretty well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent outside speaker","review":"For the price they can't be beat! I shopped at BestBuy and CicuitCity and found that I'd have to spend 2 to 3 times as much for comparable sounding outdoor speakers. These speakers were easy to mount with the included free mounting brackets.The speakers are efficient(I've mounted 2 pairs on my large screened porch and my amplifier is a relatively low powered unit).Sound is decent but not like you'd expect from more expensive bookshelf speakers in your den or living room. Expect the base to be weakest aspect of these speakers. The speakers can be powered to pretty high sound levels before noticable distortion.Considering the price I've not seen anything else that can touch these speakers at this price point."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Speakers Are A Bargain!","review":"We were moving and didn't want to leave the Bose 161 speakers (that I had installed in every room of our home.) I looked for speakers that were less expensive to leave in their place, and took a chance on these Audio Source LS 200 speakers based upon the reviews here in Amazon.com. Although the reviews were good, one doesn't expect \\"real\\" quality at this price. You cannot imagine our surprise at the quality of the sound these speakers reproduced! They are not as spacial as the Bose but their dynamic and acoustic range is excellent. Like the Bose they fall off rapidly below about 80Hz but are very linear up to the audible limits. (If you want more bass add a sub-woofer.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"These speakers work ok, and handle lots of power, but the sound reproduction is not very good. They are supposed to be three-way speakers, but the higher notes like cymbals aren't there, and compared to my $50 Jensens in the basement, these speakers sound like a very cheap boombox.I realize that these are very low-price speakers, but I bought them because the rave reviews made me think I was going to get something as good as my relatively cheap Jensens.Usually with a 2-way or a 3-way speaker, you can put your ear in front of the tweeter and hear all the highs, but I'm not sure the tweeters are even functional.That said, the cases are reasonable quality and it comes with nice mounting brackets and I will keep them. But they were not the bargain I was hoping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound/Great Value","review":"These speakers are a great buy.

Yes the bass is a little low, but you are only paying thirty something dollars. For the price the speakers are amazing, they have some good volume before they distort and they have better bass than all the leading name brands that run one to two hundred dollars. I put a pair of Inifinity Outdoors in a side by side comparison and actually had better bass output from the audiosource. So I took the Inifinity's back and had enough money to buy a 300 disc cd changer and money left over to buy an extra pairs of audiosource speakers for the garage and more on the deck.I would recommond these speakers to anyone who wants good sound quality outside at a cheap price. If you are looking for surround sound speakers, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak midrange - worse bass","review":"I puchased the LS 100's to get a decent speaker for a great price.

I highly recommend these speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"There are a lot of instructions on this product, although complicated at first, if you follow the instructions correctly and take your time to read them, it will work.The package come with the included sensors already paired with the base, so, all I needed to do was to change the passwords and include my phone numbers.When it calls me, I can hear what is going on ONLY if the alarm is in the silent mode, since it has a pretty loud noise coming from the base (where the mic is).The door sensor works pretty good, every time I forgot to disarm, it goes off. The motion detector, it is not the most reliable, but it also works, I believe the reliability has to do with the fact that it seems to read the environment every 5 seconds or so.I live in a small apartment, and I don't know what is the actual range of these devices and cannot say if they work well in large houses/apartments.So far, it is working OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Less Than What You Pay For","review":"The instructions for this product are terrible and make little or no sense. The \\"chapters\\" follow no logic and it was written by someone who does not speak fluent English as seen by the multiple spelling and grammar mistakes.Though I was able to get the basic features to work with this alarm, I was not able to program the phone features. You cannot remotely access the alarm by phone if you have a home answering machine.On two occations the alarm went off for no reason(not armed) most likely due to radio frequency interference.The entire unite shuts off without an alarm sounding if you simply unplug it from the wall, so I am not sure why it has rechargable batteries.Nobody answers the toll free customer service number and they have yet to respond to my voicemail."},{"rating":"1","title":"For in the home only","review":"This alarm system was bought to protect my garage. The install was super simple, and the unit worked well in the house. The reason for my low rating was because they advertise a 450 ft range for the sensors, but at about 60 ft it would not work.

At a couple of points in the movie, I closed my eyes and just listened to the gorgeous blend of traditional classical and movie score music.

However Zimmer doesn't resort to dissonance and disjointed rhythms to garner that effect. The music stands on its own, as well, despite the voice-overs from Hopkins (Lecter). I'm a Keith Jarrett fan, so I'm used to blocking out vocalizations during \\"intrumental\\" music. I might have paid $7 just to sit in a movie theatre to hear the score played with the screen blank--that would have been far more rewarding. . . . I'll certainly pay $15 or so to play it whenever I please in the comfort of my own home. Even if you didn't like the movie or haven't seen it or the whole idea just weirds you out, give it a shot.

There is a seductive beauty to this film that is created in great part by the music, and that sense is well preserved on this recording. \\"Let My House be My Gallows\\" is a small masterpiece evoking poetic images of perhaps the film's most exquisite scene. Normally, the use of voice-overs in a soundtrack album detracts from the score. But here is an example of just how to integrate music and dialogue. Indeed, the inclusion of the vocal elements make this recording a small treasure. Hans Zimmer continues to grow as a composer, and this effort is worthy of significant praise, bravo, or \\"goody, goody,\\" if you prefer.

The Delta was my starter bandsaw, and I learned a lot.When the Powermatic arrived, I got help lifting the top and bolting it to the base base. I was unable to install the drive belt, and after reading about the issue on the internet I called PM for help. PM provided the technical assistance I needed. It takes two people to install the belt, and in this case about 30 minutes of knuckle busting and heavy lifting.The PM runs smoothly. I will replace the bandsaw blade.

I bought a used 2 or 3 year old Powermatic saw that seemed to be almost unused. I bought it because of it's reputation. Bad idea. The quick release didn't work which makes it impossible to change blades. Long story short, I got the blade changed and while using it, something snapped and the upper wheel slammed into the shroud. I never had any problems with my old Delta that I had for 5 years.I took it to the local Powermantic service center, they kept it a week, gave it back. First cut I tried, same thing happened again. So, I called Powermatic's service technician. They were of no help, just said to order parts. Couldn't tell me why the release and tensioner wasn't working. Faulted me for buying a used saw. Hopfully, if you buy a Powermatic it runs well because repair help is hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"I purchased this bandsaw 3 years ago. The fence is not well designed. The locking mechanism uses a plastic pad which holds the fence in place but the plastic pad fell off Shortly after I purchased the saw. Sure, you can glue the plastic pad back on and keep going but for a grand you would expect a better fence and locking mechanism.The carter quick release just broke recently while tightening the blade. A few of the gear teeth dropped out of the bottom of the release mechanism so now I will need to follow up with Powermatic to get it fixed.I purchased Powermatic because I thought they set the standard. I don't use this tool very often and several things are broken and it isnt operating right now. It was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save the last star for a while","review":"I received this saw in mid August. I was and still am impressed. It's heavy and quiet. I did replace the blade with a Timber Wolf and it works like a dream. The instruction mannual does leave a LOT to be desired. Whoever wrote it obviously was hired through nepotism and not for hands on knowledge. But with some page flipping and common sense it does go toegther. It can be seen that PM did employ quality control on this piece of equipment. I also got the PM mobile base for the saw, it was well worth the $$$. I'll wait about a year and update this review as time will tell how this \\"baby\\" holds up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assembly Instructions","review":"The instructions to assemble the saw were among the worst I have ever seen. Steps were missing so that once a certain point in the assembly was reached you had to take it apart again to complete the missing step. This happened 4 different times. The photography showing most steps was poor at best. I wound of with extra parts that I still have been unable to determine what they were used for. I assume the extra parts are from another missing step in the instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fly in the ointment","review":"I hate to be the \\"fly in the ointment\\" for this machine but I was really disappointed in a machine for which I considered I paid top dollar. (For a 14\\" machine). In addition to sketchy assembly instructions, I was also missing a few bolts and had to revert to my jar of leftovers. When the time came to install the belt I found that the motor pulley was out of parallel with the saw pulley ... It seems the lower moter bracket was welded to the frame out of square. I was able to remedy the situation by putting a nut behind one of the mounting bolts and bending/twisting the motor bracket. Something I might expect to do on a \\"bottom of the line\\" machine. The machine runs well and cuts great (with a new blade) but already one of the (rear blade support) roller bearings has frozen up.

This movie is very earnest, even overly so, as it beats the viewer over the head with its precious three-part allegory. It would be a noble experiment if not for the utterly inane third story.

This movie was essentially about some guy's wife dying of cancer and should have been billed as such. The fountain is just a metaphor for the main character's \\"crusade\\" to save his wife. Its a movie about things we all have gone or will go through at some point, over dramatized and not very interesting. I think this movie could have saved itself if the main character would have withdrawn to his fantasy world for example, in order to save himself the pain of his wife's death - or something else out of the ordinary. But this is a movie about mundane things, covered up with an artsey-fartsey perfume to make it look deeper. If you're looking for a sci-fi or fantasy flick, this isn't one. If you're looking for movies that deal with the subject of death, there are several better than this one; the notebook for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Dab 'll Do Ya","review":"This film comes off like a very elaborate advert for a designer perfume called \\"The Fountain.\\" The acting is wonderful, the cinematography is superb, and the score by Clint Mansell is divine. The thing that is missing for me is the understanding of it. I give it four, well... 3.7, stars for the aforementioned, but nothing more.The script makes no sense, kind of like \\"Donnie Darko,\\" only more beautiful. It left me with too many questions and not enough answers. If the message of this film is that there are no answers, then it certainly achieved it. If someone told me the producers were all on peyote when they wrote this, I could believe that.You will have to get this used, as did I, so that you won't be too disappointed, and so you will see the scene that prompted me to title this review as I have. That bit is actually kind of funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"They lost me","review":"It's not that I didn't like it... I just didn't understand it. The movie is like a beautiful and intriguing puzzle, but the trouble is that in the end the pieces never actually fall together to form a bigger picture. Which ultimately leaves the viewer confused, unsatisfied and sort of empty. The performances by Jackman and Weisz are absolutely wonderful, and the visuals are stunning. But apart from that... It just didn't do it for me. I need a STORY. The Fountain gives us tidbits, but no involved storyline or in-depth character development. Besides, I feel somewhat cheated... The way the previews misrepresent this film is almost criminal. They make it seem as thought this is The Highlander plus depth and minus the action, the story of a man who is living forever and trying to save his dying wife over and over and over. This is NOT what it's about. Not even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your time & money...","review":"I have never written a review on Amazon, because I never felt committed to defending or criticizing the spending of someone else's money. I am breaking my own rule today, because this film deserves it. This is a film that deserves to be seen by as many people as possible. It deserves the right to be celebrated as a cinematic masterpiece. Plain and simple: \\"The Fountain\\" is perfect. The effects, the drama, the chemistry of the actors.To give this film one star or two stars because one \\"didn't get it\\" is a travesty. I \\"got it\\" the first time I saw it. It's about life and death, true love, our own egotism and our worst fears. It's about acceptance, regret and loss. It's about life; the universal struggles that we each go through, today or two-thousand years from now.Don't deny yourself the privilege to experience this film.

The Fountain is visually stunning from Alpha to Omega. If you've seen any of Darren's films, you'll understand the format in which he presents his storys. Hugh Jackman's acting has moved me so deeply. He truely is an amazing actor, and Rachel Weisz is just as spellbinding to behold.The story deals with Death and the effect it has on the loved ones left behind. It brought me to tears. The Fountain is something we all can relate to. This has to be one of the most important films I've seen in my life. The range of emotions that the story moves you thru (sadness, grief, hope, release and understanding) has left me with a deeper understanding of the greatest mystery of all time.It has been said \\"the only thing the dead know is that it is better to be alive\\". I have to say that there maybe a small bit of truth in this, but only time will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good looking cliche'","review":"This is your standard \\"love conquers all\\" story with a slick veneer of fantasy and sci-fi effects that fail to elevate the film beyond a dull and monotonous romance yarn.The triptych storyline just plain fails to deliver. It basically tells the same story three times and there is never any correlation between the three tellings. The ending will leave you wondering just what was the point of all of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"poetic","review":"'The Fountain' is one of the most interesting and resonant films I have watched in recent memory. The director's 'Requiem for a Dream' is another of the most visually,intellectually and emotionally stimulating films I have ever seen. I kept thinking about this movie after watching it and I am truly bewildered at the many bad reviews. I suppose people generally want entertainment from their movies. This is certainly not that-This is art."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one will play with your mind","review":"This is a really bizarre movie. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are great and fun to watch. The story(ies) are strangely tied together and the sets are really fantastic. The storyline gets a little tied up and winded at times, but overall (on the second viewing) it is a spectacular movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deliberately Heavy Handed and Obtuse","review":"I thought the movie was visually and thematically interesting, but I really didn't enjoy the method of story telling Aronofsky used, or the heavy handedness he employed in trying to get us to understand his point.I left feeling as though the separate time lines had been shuffled so as to deliberately obfuscate the themes. Opening with the Conquistador thread, for example, killed my suspension of disbelief with all of its glaring historical flaws until it was later framed as fictional. Something was always being hidden from the viewers, but these secrets never carried much 'pow' upon revelation. It's as though Aronofsky believes that by presenting a good theme in a confusing manner it somehow becomes better.I'm a fan of obfuscation when it makes a better movie, such as Memento, but this one just didn't do it for me. If you liked the presentation that's fine, but people who didn't aren't necessarily idiots."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fountain HD DVD combo","review":"About 20 minutes into the hd dvd the dvd froze. I had to watch it in the regular mode which was a bummer. Otherwise the movie was great. It would have been phenomenal in HD. Very much in spirit like Neverending Story but for adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but boring","review":"Rachel and Hugh turn in excellent performances as they always do, but even their considerable talents did not save this movie. Yes, it is touching at times and is filled with some beautiful shots, but all in all it was a struggle to sit through this movie. If your film interests lean towards bizarre and extremely vague plots, you might enjoy this movie. If you prefer a well thought out, gripping, and unpredictable plot to keep things interesting, then you will be completely bored to tears with this film. In my humble opinion, it is one of the least entertaining films I have ever watched."},{"rating":"1","title":"emilie","review":"I am gobbsmacked really. This movie cannot be described by one simple word. Maybe awful is the word I am looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch this movie","review":"Watch this movie only to see how horrible it is. I'm sorry but I thought movies were for entertainment. The only brain power that I should be using is for studying and for school. I do not think that a movie should give you a headache. Anyone that tries to be so deep is full of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fountain","review":"I sorry but \\"The Emperor is Naked\\" - this comment given to all the pretentious people who watched the movie & won't admit at it's end they looked at each other with a blank expression. Yes it has wonderfull imagery & good acting, which doesn't change the fact that you would not know half of the \\"presumed story\\" without reading the plot line on the back of the dvd case. After which it's still like getting the answer for that crossword puzzle clue at which point you call the author a cheat & liar, as the given clue could never have lead to the stated word.

I will never make this mistake again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best story to follow.","review":"We spent too much time trying to follow the story.

The blacks are awful, often motion leaves trails behind and some scenes just don't look very HD at all. Wait for a better quality Blu Ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen MUCH better from both actors","review":"I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting, but I sure didn't expect what this movie delivered. Both Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman have been in much better films than this. The basic premise was fine - it was the story telling I could have done without. I walked away feeling like I'd seen a great story in a very hollow film - & that I'd completely wasted 2 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering stream","review":"This was more like a music video than a movie. Ambient music, trippy visuals, simplistic, vague, predictable story. At least it's only about 95 minutes long. I can't think of a soul I'd recommend this to and I'd never sit through it again. Scenes are shown over and over and some shots linger when there is no need, simply to lengthen it because the story is so simple. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good.","review":"**Spoilers**What you have here is a slowly paced movie, that jumps around a lot, and does not have a definite conclusion. This is a recipe that some people will simply not like.I loved the fact that it's open to my interpretation, the movie doesn't let you know for sure what's real and what's imagined.My take is this: The entire movie takes place in present time, and there is no \\"Tree of Life\\". The past and future versions of the characters are from Izzi's book. Tom is spending all his time working and trying to find a cure for his wife's terminal disease, not realizing what's important, which is spending time with his dying wife. She can accept the fact that she'll die, he thinks that death is a disease that can be cured, it isn't until the end of the movie that he understands that he needs to accept death, his wife's and eventually his own.I really enjoyed this movie. After it was over, I got kind of a \\"I liked that, but I don't know why\\" feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rudderless Ship","review":"This movie is like taking a boat ride without a rudder. It sort of muddles through from one thing to another. I kept thinking it would pick up and do something right - heck - they've got Jackman - DO SOMETHING. Don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. I watched the extras, hoping for some clue as to what the director was trying (repeat trying) to achieve and even the people working on the movie said it had no direction and was the worst thing they'd ever worked on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud","review":"I gave it 2 stars - 1 for being in HD and a 2nd star for being a visually beautiful film. That's as far as it goes. The story is ... well what story? Well acted but ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"After starting us within the supposed 'real world', we're exposed to layers of narrative dross that conflates actual experience with what I can best describe as South Asian Hindu yogic crappola.Not sure what the disease of thinking should be called.Nice visuals, but think of the implications.-r.c."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"It's interesting to read the reviews on here. Everyone seems to have seen something in their own way. I'm sure I'm no different. I kept thinking about how much it reminded me of a stage play. It was different, deep, and gave an interesting perspective. I enjoyed the movie but I also enjoy movies like MI3 or other \\"dumb\\" hollywood movies as someone said. Go to the movies to be entertained not to look for the meaning of life. Especially since you are seeing basically one person's view (the director) and probably shouldn't take it too seriously to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Philosophical idea + A poorly executed film = A fountain of disappointment.","review":"This movie was based on the ideas of immortality, afterlife and Zen(I'm not 100 percent sure of the last idea). After it finished, I still did not know what it meant to say.It's really boring and incomprehensible. What a waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this movie","review":"While I loved 2001 which many people seem to be comparing this movie to, I was continually frustrated and annoyed. I like the tie in between the book, current times, and past times. The problem is I don't really feel there was much of a story being told in any of the time periods and that their connection was flimsy at best. A repeat of certain scenes with small changes just further convoluted the story. Maybe I am missing some hidden meaning or message, maybe this is just not my type of film, or maybe it was just a poorly written story executed without real purpose or clarity. I am going with the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless waste of time","review":"this reminds me of another worthless waste of time called 2001 a space odyssey. it had no real plot or storyline. the only part based in reality is that people die. if you want to get the same message from life and save yourself an hour and a half then listen close......people die! now that you know that secret you don't have to sit through the agony that is this movie.P.s. it is unlikely that you really would have taken that message from this movie if you hadn't also gone searching online halfway through the movie to find out if this movie had any sort of point or might possibly get better at the end.P.p.s. it doesn't get any better at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD review","review":"I bought this movie for my mom for Christmas. The DVD was of good quality and was in perfect condition, which was what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"I found The Fountain to be a terrific movie that incorporates significant elements of Maya Cosmology and blends them into three worlds: what appears to be a fictional story set during the Conquest, our present time and a spiritual world that appears to exist concurrently with the other two worlds. This is not New Age content nor is it a 2001 science fiction proposed future world. Maya cosmology from its Classic Era (pre-Conquest)is seamlessly woven into all three worlds. I was amazed to see a movie that was visually appealing, engrossing and was written with content rich, well researched subtle points far exceeding the usual dribble that is passed off when venturing into the themes of this movie. You don't need a degree in comparative religions or cultural anthropology to appreciate this movie. It has a broad appeal on a number of levels. To fully understand this movie, however, you just might need to be Illumined."},{"rating":"2","title":"great looking movie in hd","review":"great looking movie in hd! over all the story is good but seemed short me!! i felt like the movie could have been longer and established the story better but overall it looks and sounds great! a wonderful addition to your hd dvd collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fountain with Hugh Jackman","review":"Never watched such a boring, senseless movie. Love Hugh Jackman, only reason I got the movie. Plot was lost after 20 minutes. What was with the bubble? Too deep, soo senseless, too much flipping around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compared It To TREE OF LIFE","review":"I became interested in seeing THE FOUNTAIN when someone compared it to Terrence Malick's current film THE TREE OF LIFE. And I wasn't disappointed. Like THE TREE OF LIFE it is a film that invites a second or third viewing. It's nice to see something a little different that makes you think. The EXTRAS are worth studying also. The interview with Hugh Jackman is interesting and the section showing how several of the spectacular special effects were put together is fascinating. Again, like TREE OF LIFE, this not a film that everyone will care for, but I did. Worth seeing on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking Mans Movie-","review":"Go watch it and decide for yourself how good it is.

Beautifully done intertwining 3 stories in one.

Great trippy little flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightenment awaits.","review":"First of all this movie is all set in the present time, at least I thought so, the rest of it is just a manuscript from within the movie. Looking for a way to help his dying wife a brilliant surgeon discovers a miracle drug that seems to reverse aging. His wife dies before he can administer the drug. He consequently suffers a mental/nervous breakdown. Finally through a ?\\"Dream sequence \\" the doctor is enlightened and discovers that death is just the transformation of the journey, just another vehicle like the body, only without form. He becomes the Buddha or the enlightened one in the end, sitting underneath his Bodhi tree, understanding that you can not cling to life or anything, because it is only a journey, not a destination, he becomes one with universe. The visual effects of the movie are stunning, and the subliminal messages are many. Overall it kind of reminded of VANILLA SKY, beautiful film wonderfully done. If you enjoy a thinking film I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buddah Bob and his cosmic snow globe","review":"This movie rocks. Solid story. In HD format the visuals will blow you away.

I bought it solely for the cast and had not read more than the review IMDB offers. Big mistake.I was impressed early on in the viewing by the imagery. It was mind boggling but unfortunately quickly moves on to mind bludgeoning. The acting is well done but the script was so shallow that it doesn't matter how many times the same lines are repeated, it has no value. The modern day scenes between Jackman and Weisz yo-yo'd between precious and brutal and the rest was filled with nonsense. I can only surmise that a lot of the film ended up on the cutting room floor and that is why what if left is so haphazard, disjointed and unappealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing story line.","review":"Very confusing story line, which never quite came together for me at the end.

The effort to try and bring together Christian, Jewish, Bhuddist themes was terrible and meant nothing to nobody.It's got love in it, but it is not primarily a romance flick.

The acting was superb in this movie, but somewhere on his journey, the director forgot a movie needs to have a point. It's so much more enjoyable to engage in something when there is some point to it. I have no idea what the point of this movie was, nor was I able to follow the \\"acid trip\\" that was this movie. The ending was as unfullfilling and confusing as the beginning was, which is how I would have to sum this movie up.

There's not even a surprise ending or twist like \\"Bruce Willis is a ghost all along\\"!As for the romance part, I guess it's just an average sad love story, reminds me of \\"What dreams may come\\", which is equally crap.Right at the end, when the credits came up, I couldn't help it but to say \\"Oh F---!\\" I then immediately read the five star reviews of this movie, and realized the movie is made for the Starbucks, Fine-Arts, student-loans crowd.I now need to watch some Avengers to get this movie out of my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"hm","review":"i watched the movie and still have no idea what it's about. it skipped all over the place, was filled with esoteric ideology which seemed to be designed to make the film maker appear more illuminated and intelligent than the rest of us. lol. not a fan. sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Don't waste your time.

It deals with some of the most written about philosophic issues of mankind: love, life, death, possibility of an afterlife, and what it means to be at peace with the reality of the world (ironically, explored through science fiction and fantasy). Although it has a rotten rating on rotten tomatoes (only 51 positive), and I can see why many might find it to be simplistic or overdone, I found that I was quickly absorbed into the world(s) created by Aronofsky, and was touched by the simple yet exceedingly important (and so easily overlooked in the real world) issues and themes it explored. Plus, all the philosophic and metaphysical stuff aside, the sound-track and scenery are both awe-inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, not for everyone","review":"This is a beautiful and quiet film. From the gorgeous photography to the understated acting, the movie is elegant and ethereal. If you love poetic storytelling, do not require exposition, and can allow yourself to become lost in the emotion and the \\"music\\" of the tale, you will enjoy The Fountain. It celebrates spiritual love and eternal bonds.After viewing, I felt a need to pull out some Khalil Gibran. \\"Trees are poems the earth writes upon the sky, We fell them down and turn them into paper,That we may record our emptiness\\" and \\"Half of what I say is meaningless, but I say it so that the other half may reach you\\".I would recommend this to anyone who likes Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or who enjoyed The Years of Rice and Sand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted two hours of my life","review":"This is one of the worst movies I��ve ever seen.

Never buy a screenplay by a graduate student! Summing up the main character, it seems that he is the world's first, and hopefully only, Roman Catholic-Buddhist Mayan conquistador-doctor-baldheaded guy. The lighting guy went on and on about \\"creating a mood\\", but it was almost impossible to see half of the movie because it was so dark. My mood became one of impatience and exasperation.

Thankfully, it only cost me a $1 to rent this film. The film looked interesting, so I rented it. Why Hugh Jackman made this film, only he knows. Money? A good premise that goes no where. It would have been a great story if it was just about him looking for the fountain and not all this time stuff. Plants come out of Hugh at the end? What does that mean. He's bald in one section and we have no idea what he is doing, why he is talking to the tree. It just moves from time line to time line without saying why. No wonder the project was shut down for a few years. No wonder this movie died at the box office. For me, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I think one star is giving it to much credit. Not even worth the $1 it cost to rent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Kind of Fountain","review":"Once again, Aronofsky delivers a thought provoking and well crafted film. Most viewers will find their appreciation growing with a second or third look. During my own 1st viewing, i found the story complex & challenging, and the photography mesmerizing. Somewhat like Izzy's unfinished journal, it helps once you know how the movie resolves in the end. For the second viewing you will be more able to focus on nuance in scene & setting, and enjoy how little hints relate to the greater story. It is a fine movie for a relaxing & worthwhile evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"the fountain on blu-ray","review":"AWESOME! This movie looks amazing. We have a PS3 to watch blu-ray discs on and they look AMAZING."},{"rating":"2","title":"one amazing journey","review":"The Fountain is an interesting movie, and for much of it, quite confusing.When the movie begins, you are treated to a variety of events that unfold in a very confusing way, and you begin to wonder if it's possible to catch up to everything going on. However, after a while, all the events seem to come together and flow with the story. It's one of those movies that takes a lot of time and patience to understand.It's a story about living forever. Or rather, trying desperately to find a way to live forever, through a series of fairy tale events and strange happenings. The acting is really good, the story is interesting, and the magical feeling of living forever is a great touch. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"paean to love and life","review":"A very elegaic movie, beautifully shot, and one of hugh jackman's most compelling performances. however I wonder if the script could have been even better somehow to create an ending that would have held me. technically, this is a great film. emotionally, it could have moved me more. still worth watching. a fine cinematographic effort and worth exploring as a visual feast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get into this movie.","review":"Just not my type of flick. Could not get into it. Did not watch it until the end but think the plot was evident after about 30 minutes. Others may find it interesting, just not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd movie, I like sci-fi, but this show is hard to follow","review":"Odd movie, I always like sci-fi shows. This show is hard to follow, turned off before the end of show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably made more sense on paper","review":"Ambitious but deeply flawed attempt from Darren Aronofsky, who fared better with PI. Hugh Jackman did the best he could with the confusing, slow, dull script, without much help from the miscast Rachel Weisz. Apparently she had a brain tumor and he was trying to find a way to save her--but then it turns out she's writing a novel with the same title as the film, and it spans the lives of two similar people from 1500 AD to 2000 AD to 2500 AD. And there are Mayan things and a star and a fountain of youth tree, and ......I don't know. Who cares? I can usually follow convoluted plots, but this was just too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, poor SKU","review":"The Fountain is a good movie, and worth re-watching. It is a sort of fantasy/allegory that focuses a lot more on style than character development, but I still found the plot to be coherent and the movie compelling enough to care about what was going on. You need to be in a contemplative, patient mood to watch this movie: it is not exactly action-packed, and the themes and characterization are subtle.My principle complaint is that this edition is a major disappointment. Underwhelming visuals, essentially devoid of special features, nothing packed in the box except the disc. When I buy a Blu-ray movie I am expecting the definitive edition for the price I am being charged. That means carefully mastered visuals, well-done commentary tracks, deleted scenes. I am really expecting more than what may as well be a recording of the movie off HBO."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful but boring","review":"The direction, costumes, and acting are all wonderful in this movie. The problem is that the script is an awful mess. I wanted to like it, I really wanted to like it, but beauty will only carry it so far. I left the theater disappointed.Strange as it sounds, I think it might have been better if the director would have stuck with images and dropped the story. A kind of dream sequence of these images would have been much better. Then I would have been able to enjoy what I was seeing. This script is more amaturish than profound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best movie ever!","review":"This movie is far ahead of its time, and as such it is timeless! No movie has depicted so vividly the final transformation of the human evolutionary process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film... He does it again.","review":"The Fountain is a hard movie to understand and appreciate. Some people don't like the lack of plot development and other such typical things within a movie. I believe that all of that is intentional. Its not about plot development... its not about death, life, and the existential meaning behind it all. I love this movie because visually, it totally delivers.... and if you're the kind of person thats willing to truly take something in, the film can become a moment of self reflection.Though many movies deal with such themes, no one does it by totally rethinking the way we view movies. We expect certain things... but then he gives us something else.The fountain is to film, as Heidegger is to being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This movie is all over the place, it's a shame, it could have been magical with a stronger script. The visuals are interesting but you'll do better going to a fine-arts museum. However, the soundtrack was transcending and spiritual."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars","review":"This movie deserves 0 stars because for the first 45min, nothing happens. After that, I fell asleep. Then I woke up and some really weird stuff was going on. This movie was so stupid and boring. It couldn't have ended soon enough. If it hadn't made me too sleepy to reach for the remote, I would have turned it off. Beyond horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie for 2007 yet!","review":"Horrible script, completely incoherent. The audience simply cannot understand what the meaning of the movie is about. The cinematography is meant to awe (along with the trailer) but it dosent compensate for the very very poor film. It's also sad to see good actors cast in such shoddy films. I guess this is what you get when you give hippie wanna be's who've taken way to much mushrooms a few million dollars.Save yourself the money and don't believe the trailer. This is quite possibly the worst movie for 2007 yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap.","review":"I did not not get a chance to see this in the theater. When I read about the story, I thought that this was a movie based on a short story about a wounded solider in WWI who is being treated by a nurse, who he has loved over 1000 years in other lives (which for the life of me, I can't remember the name of.) If I was casting THAT movie, Jackman and Weisz would be top picks. Alas, I ordered this film site unseen, and it stinks. The Acting is good, the sets and photography are the best, and the soundtrack was excellent. The story? What, all Faiths are good EXCEPT anything with Christ? I would put it up for sale for the shipping and packing costs alone, but I can't in good faith inflict this on someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there was a negative star to give I would give it!","review":"Worst movie since \\"Zardoz\\". Sure the visuals were pretty but \\"Sunrise Earth\\" on Discovery HD has more substance than this. The thinly veiled \\"point\\", point not plot, was heavy handed, narcissistic, and trite. At no point were the characters believable and always incredibly selfish, i.e. screw saving humanity I want to save the one woman I love. People call this movie a poem, perhaps but not a very good one. I'm more of a fan of Keats than Milton though. If you want an incredibly long \\"Paradise Lost\\", then this may be for you. If brevity is the soul of wit, this movie is witless. By the end of the movie I felt like I had lived forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, a thousand times no.","review":"A visually engaging, pretentious, overwrought piece of junk.

It mixes vague eastern philosophies along with Christian and Mayan mythology. The subtext of which fail at any real direction. I guess the moral of the story is we are all one and therefore, eternal.. but it's not really even clear about that.Poor direction, poor dialog, zero character development. Rachel acts as though she's seen the light and Hugh just has yet to witness this revelation. Everyone is sad and crying almost the entire film.All in all the movie achieves almost nothing while remaining completely uninteresting for 96 minutes. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad","review":"I thought it was all a bit boring.

Not even worth a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playing Mind Jive With The Viewer is Not Cool","review":"I don't really mind jive, if it makes sense, the way Rod Serling's mind jive made sense. I could only get through 24 minutes and that took all my patience. If you can't hook me in 25 minutes you ain't gonna hook me. This movie raised two important Questions: What was the producer thinking when he funded it; and what was I thinking when I rented. That about as metaphysical as I need be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Boy","review":"Can't begin to enumerate all the things that are wrong with this film!

I followed instructions, filled up the tube with paint, and started my trim work. The pad distributes the pain unevenly, and it started dripping quite a bit.The tube holds enough paint to cover about 6 feet. When the tube is empty, you have to remove the pad, and fill the tube up again, then put on the pad, which is filled with paint. A big mess.Not recommended. Stick with tape and an angled brush for trim work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"This guy has an axe to grind (but without a true cause) and his outlook on the mormon church is CLEARLY askew. I am a lifelong catholic and have lived near 2 Mormon families for most of my life. We have talked at length regarding their views several times since I have known them and I can tell you this: Mr. Bennett's opinions (though he states them as fact), could not be further from the truth. Did you get your poor feelings hurt by a mormon Mr. Bennett?... or were you just interested in making a dishonest buck?If you want to know what a mormon really believes you could just ask one of them. As in all religions, I'm sure you have good mormons and bad ones, but generally I have found that they are extremely kind and genuine group of Christian people. And their beliefs are NOT as Bennett says they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad attempt at representing a religion","review":"This book is skewed and not true.It is clear that the author was writing it only to interest catholic members and make money.I am amazed that he was able to get such a false documentation published.Mr. Bennett should be ashamed of himself.

I would be fired.It is clear that Bennett in not being objective. He should have tried that.I have had a few mormon friends, and they have told me a little about their church.

Before I made up my mind, I decided to get all the informaion I could. I wanted to get all the details from someone who really knew what they were talking about and not just tell me what I wanted to hear just so they could make a buck. So where did I go for the information--to my local CHEVY dealer. I figured they should be unbiased and be able to quote former Ford presidents about their trucks without loosing any context or clarity. Sounds pretty outragous doesn't it? Of course, an intelligent human would go to the Ford dealer to find out about Ford trucks. Then when that person finds the true facts from the proper authority, that individual can make a knowledgable and wise decision for ones own self. This book is like asking the Chevy dealer about a Ford truck!

In all seriousness, they do seem at least as well put together as what I found in stores (and for much less money).

The only drawbacks that I have noticed is that battery must be charged by plugging in the camera so you're unable to use the camera while charging your second battery and the battery life if you take stills does not last very long. You can purchase a separate charger (approx $20). Photo quality is great and DVD quality is great. Indoor settings you have to remember to check lighting or use the flash.

The stand-out tracks are Odyssey's huge hit 'My Happiness' and the new single 'Bless My Soul'.It could've been beyond brilliant if some of the better non-singles were included, but hey, you can only wish for so much.

(Our \\"thermos\\" brand lasted years.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not too disappointed","review":"The machine is less than $40 so my expectations were in line with that (cheap), however it never really seemed to stitch, at least, I thought it would stitch even the simplest items, and I only used it about 5 time sin a year, but it didn't, and it would stick on every job, it was frustrating. It eventually broke, and I was sorry to say it still looked brand new, and that was the shame of it - it was too cheap to fix, and I was forced to throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Perhaps even the Hello Kitty sewing machine would have been better. I was raised on my mother's Singer and now use my mother-in-law's Singer. I decided to purchase a simple sewing machine just for easy hemming. After one pair of pants hemmed, this machine was unable to recover from the trauma of one job. I truly believe I did everything as instructed in the manual and the instructional DVD to no avail, and I'm not even a novice sewer. I don't think I can hand this down to my daughter to learn about sewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute garbage","review":"This is not even a toy. DO NOT waste your money on this item. Amazon will charge you to send it back which is what most will do if you expect even the lowest standards in a \\"quick\\" machine. Nothing about this machine functions well. Never got an even stitch or a complete row of stitches. Amazon should not carry this item, it has lowered the quality of Amazon's products in my view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what we wanted","review":"My nine year old daughter wanted a sewing machine and like many other things she wants I didn't want a big investment only to learn she's bored five minutes in...this machine works perfectly. I haven't sewed in years and I was so pleased the instructions for threading the spool and bobbin were very clear and concise. She has been able to use it with ease and we're having fun making clothes for her stuffed animals.I highly recommend this item, we've had no problems with it whatsoever and is easy to use for young and old and really sew like a sewing machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This product is extremely cheap in price, also a cheap proctuct itself. I had a lot of problems with setting up this product and after an hour of trying to set it up I found that a very small peice was broken, so small that I could barely see it but played a very big part in how it sewed. The sellers would not refund my shipping for it and I would have to pay to ship it back, which I did not think it was worth the hassle. I bought a very nice one, Project Runway Special Edition, and it took me less than 10 min. to set up, very good stitching."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little unhappy","review":"Slightly above a toy but definately not a sewing machine for anything serious. I ended up hemming my sleeves by hand. Bobbin is loose. Doesn't pull the material through very well. Not at all what I had hoped. I will end up giving this away and buying a real sewing machine. One that will handle a hem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for learning","review":"I purchased this item as something to learn on, and it is wonderful. However, this is not a machine for heavy sewing. But for small projects like curtains, quilt top, pillow cases, and similar items its perfect. A great item to learn on."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR","review":"Nice little machine, well designed and assembled. Has good instructions plus a great CD. However, after 5+ hrs I was not able to repair a seam in the waistband of my sweat pants. The stitches would not lock, no matter how I adjusted it. Worked great on the little swatch that came with the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ideal For Rocket Scientists With Perfect Eyesight","review":"What a shame that such a pathetic product is manufactured in this age of technology. First of all, sewing machines have included a little electric light since the 40's. With all of the intricacies of just threading this machine, a light should be required by law.The instruction book, which was written with rocket scientists in mind, details \\"loop around at 3:00, then again at 6:00..\\" You should try to see the miniscule loop positions.I received the machine today after a week of anticipation, spent 2-1/2 hours of diligently reading and following the instructions, and now I cannot wait until tomorrow to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"lightweight sewing machine","review":"This sewing machine is fine for my purpose in buying it - a lightweight machine to use for small sewing tasks when visiting my father. I need to repair seams, re-hem, other little jobs that I have been doing by hand on my visits. I don't think I'd try to make a whole new garment - the machine is very light (which was the point for me in buying it) and a little rickety, but for an experienced seamstress it's usable and useful for repair jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made Machine with Bad Performance for a Cheap Price","review":"This machine is really cheaply made. The price speaks for itself. If I had a second chance, I'd use the $30 on this to put in towards a $100 machine or more. No matter what kind of thread you put in the machine, it keeps getting snagged every time you sow. Does NOT sow jeans fabric well, sometimes not even at all!!! And it keeps getting stuck with even the most simple pieces of fabric.Don't buy this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"the sewing machine is Cheap!","review":"The sewing machine, is built very cheaply, does not even sew correctly, I understand i didnot pay that much, but to feel you really are just ripping people off,its an item i ended up throwing out, for it just took up space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"After considerable research, we decided to get this sewing machine for our 9-year old daughter. We feel this is the best low-cost sewing machine for the money. Although many of the components are plastic, the machine is sturdy and well made. It includes a foot-pedal, does not require batteries, and closely resembles the basic features and shape of a traditional $100+ sewing machine. I only give this item four stars because there is no light.After helping our daughter select the proper thread and tension adjustment, she has made several hats, skirts, and so on. We have also found that no matter how cheap or expensive a sewing machine is, there are going to be problems if it is your first time at sewing. Many people don't realize that there is a fair amount of knowledge and skill required to make ANY sewing machine stitch properly. If you can't get your sewing machine to stitch properly it is most likely tension setting, thread selection, etc..(...)Hope this helps !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this product","review":"I bought this machine because I needed something to hem up some pants for my children and myself. I didn't have alot of money to spend on a full size sewing machine so I decided to purchase this one. It's great. It's so small so it doesn't take up alot of room in my little apartment. It's also very easy to use. I never used a sewing machine and with the easy to follow instructions, I caught on quickly. It hems up pants perfectly and I was able to hem a pair of jeans with no problems. It doesn't have a light but as long as you have enough light in the room you are working in it's OK. I haven't tried repairing anything yet but if it hems jeans, I am sure it will fix anything. I would recommend this to anyone who has never used a sewing machine and doesn't want to spend alot of money on one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Machine is temperamental but will work with some tweaking...","review":"I followed all of the instructions and, at first, could not get this machine to work in an acceptable manner. Frequently, the upper stitch would not connect with the lower (bobin) stitch. I tried various tension settings and checked all of the threading many times.Then, I purchased a better thread for sewing machines and tried adjusting the tension settings again. I was finally able to get the product to sew correctly.I would still have to say, this product is not for the faint of heart. But, it will work if you are tenacious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke","review":"We bought three of these machines for a classroom quilt project. They were so poorly made that I am returning all three to buy ONE machine that costs a little more. You are much better off going with a more expensive machine- this one is very cheap in every sense of the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LOT smaller than picture","review":"I was disappointed with the size of the actual product because it was like a toy for my younger granddaughters. Kayla and Tarra are 13, and they love my sewing machine so I thought I would buy them one for their birthdays. I wish I had paid more attention to the actual measurements because I would not have made this purchase! They both had problems getting it to sew because the thing would not make a real stitch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned out.","review":"I ordered this item fully understanding that it was a beginner's sewing machine. I know it's not the heavy duty kind with bells and whistles that costs a pretty penny. So when I tested the machine on the test material that comes with it I wasn't expecting it to be the only stitches I would get out the machine. When I lifted the foot and took the sample material out and placed my material in (cotton, not a heavy material) it didn't work. I checked the plug, nothing. It simply stopped working. I sent it back in about a month ago and just got it back today. It works now, but not a highly recommended product."},{"rating":"1","title":"MB","review":"Total waste of money!! It took me an hr to do a simple stitch to hem curtains. The bobbin wouldn't catch leaving me with a very loose stitch that fell apart a wk later. I thought maybe it was my novice sewing skills until my sister, a seamstress for 30 yrs, couldn't even get it to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"wont work","review":"This product doesn't work right.

Too bad since it was good at first."},{"rating":"1","title":"QuickStitch is a little too Quick","review":"I am not into sewing, so I bought this machine for one project and it was fine, easy to use, came with good instructions and everything. A few years later, I had another project I wanted to use it for and I couldn't even get it to turn on. It's dead. It was cheap, so I can't complain too much, but keep that in mind in your decision-making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great","review":"This is not a very good machine. It is a plastic waste. The only thing this can sew is cotton material. I would not recommend it to any one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to set up","review":"This sewing machine was very difficult to set up.

Last I found was at a NAPA car parts store about 15 years ago and then it was $19 for just a tad bit more product.When I needed more, finding it in household user's size (not in 5 gallon buckets for commercial use) was almost impossible. I couldn't even find it at NAPA again (or at least on line).If you know what this is and what it's for, this is an excellent source and the price is good, too.Since it won't go bad, I ordered two tubes just in case.

I e-mailed Lanzar and didn't get a reply. Pretty disappointed in their customer service. I know the subs were hooked up correctly because my uncle installed them with me and he has been doing installs for 15 years. This is a good product if you're on a budget, and don't push your subs very hard, but if you're looking for a high quality product for cheap, this is not the sub for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall pretty decent speaker","review":"It's a decent speaker. I have a different type of lanzar 15 besides this one. I feel this speaker would work best in an enclosure with no bass hole. I have a bass hole with my two 15's and it sounds alright.

The music must have played at the straight, leisure suited discos of the 70's because the heat generating, pulse pounding music I remember is mostly missing from this lukewarm retrospective.With the exception of the wonderful, \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\" there will be no flashbacks to the energetic nights spent dancing under the disco ball crammed sweaty body to sweaty body just waiting for the next beat to grab the crowd and push you higher and higher.Studio 54?

I have both standard and wide-mouth Ball Mason jars, and wanted a nice wide funnel that would sit and be stable in both. (Two sets of lids and bands is bad enough, two relatively expensive funnels felt like overkill.) From the pictures the tapered design of this funnel looked like it would fit really well in both types of jars. I'm guessing that Mason jars aren't quite the standard in Germany though. The narrowest part of this funnel is roughly 1.5\\", much more narrow than is needed for a 2 3/8 standard Mason jar. In a wide-mouth jar the funnel goes in nearly to the handle and rocks around a little. It'll work, but if you're looking for a funnel that will \\"lock in\\" to a wide mouth Mason jar this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Qualty","review":"Top quality materials and construction.

This is exactly the type of music that really gets you pumped up. It has the music backround of a Heavy Metal rock band, and the Lead singer is an amazing MC. If you enjoy great Rap or Hard Rock, you will love this band. Just listen to some of the samples that Amazon provides and you'll see what i mean. Now i have to say that Linkin Park is one of my favorite bands, but to compare the two... Well it's completly different. If you're a fan of Linkin park, you would probably like Bionic Jive, but if you don't listen to Linkin park because you think they're too soft, then this is most definatly a CD for you. These guys are the best at what they do, check 'em out and you can thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"VET warning!","review":"I don't know if it works because it turns out my cat had a yeast infection in her ears.

The bench assembled easily and all the parts lined up. Unfortunately, the chair did not. The parts did not line up. Since the dowel rods used to assemble the chair do not come out easily, I was stuck. Fortunately, with a cushion on the chair it's hardly noticeable. If you buy this chair, I would suggest placing the pieces together to make sure they line up. Something I should've done. Once you start assembling, you can't start over. I would also suggest getting a cushion for the back. This chair is uncomfortable if you sit in it for more than 20 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent furniture!","review":"I am extremely pleased with these chairs.

And so it was with great delight that I finally read my first Parker novel. It was dated, as is the case with some Westlake, but the terse writing, the setup of Parker as a double-crossed crook who has mutated into a killer as he fights to survive are all genius. Reading it I thought of two other killng machines. The hero of The Killer Inside Me, who actually revolted and disturbed me (Parker does not have \\"the sickness.\\") and Jack Reacher. There is something so reminiscent of Parker in Reacher. The loner, the quick mind, the moral clarity. Or maybe ammoral clarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"People like it or they don't","review":"From looking at the other Amazon reviews on this book, it looks like people really like it, or they really don't like it. I fall into the later category.I read this story as part of a book club I attend with some friends. While they though the story was great, but I didn't care for the protagonist, his treatment of women, or the plot.On the plus side, this is a fast read, and the story moves along well enough to keep you turning the pages.On the negative side, I just felt the overall plot was unrealistic in regards to Parker's attempted murder, and his plan to get his money back from the Mob. Maybe the Mob in this story wasn't as tough as I'm used to from reading other books or watching TV and movies, but I'm thinking the Mob would send an army of people after Parker for what he did. Regardless of the cost, I think Parker would have been sleeping with the fishes by the end of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hunter","review":"Found out about this series after watching Payback.

The plot is the following (I will write it because this is the first review and is nothing written about this book).Parker who is a bank robber went to jail when he was betrayed by some friends. When he goes out he found those friends (of the mafia) and try to kill them. Super Parker goes for the mob himself because they owe him part of his last robbery.If you have one day at the beach without children, you can finish this book in one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful book","review":"The sequel to his original book about growing up in 1950's Australia, the first book was quite funny and a good read.This book however is a tacked on version which was boring and generally unfunny.

The only problem is that when we got the box, the coupon was expired over a year ago, and no was was willing to follow through with giving us $20 off a game.

The card itself is $50, and the points, bonus game, and $20 dollars off a new game (limited time offer) easily helps to make your money back. Even if they didn't include the rebate, it would still be less than buying these parts separate.

That goes with the territory buying a used DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have made a very good long article","review":"This book has a catchy title and a compelling premise, which, unfortunately, the book doesn't live up to. The organization of the book feels arbitrary and forced. The repetitive anecdotes make for a boring read from cover to cover. The chapter titled \\"Biology\\" is its weakest point -- a random litany of information that doesn't arrive at any particular or useful thesis. Unfortunately, this tendency to string together various historical anecdotes pervades the text. The final chapter is decent, but it's a long, irritating slog until then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special.....","review":"Audrey Finnegan is a temporary secretary that Wheeler Rush hires when his business is going under and his regular staff are gone.

Duh. You'll have to read the rest of the story to find out what happens.This story had its cute moments but to me it was a slow read. I felt the characters lacked depth and it was mediocre.

I've listened to this album a dozen times over and have grown fonder of it each time. All of the beats are hot (even though some of them we've heard on the Special Herbs) and Doom is droppin Rhymes like Dimes yet again. All songs are strong and the skip button should never be used, even the skits and instrumentals work well....as they usually do with Doom. Don't sleep in this album, cop it if you don't have it. If you do, go listen to it again. Only problem is that after listening, you'll want more....but who said that was a bad thing!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"P. haukas is a faggot","review":"This is not Doom's best album by far, but his lyrics in most of the songs are genius. Though there are some poor samples in the middle, Doom still kills it on this album. Doom is far passed mediocre.

Well, the rest of the songs are pretty whack and besides that one great song the beats are pretty lame and doom can be a pretty boring mc at times. He has the ability to make these great songs but is very inconsistent with both rhymes and beats.

This is not classic. 2.5 stars. I was expecting hot fiyah on this album, but instead its just slightly lukewarm fiyah on here. Ho cakes is classic with another classic motown sample, Kon Queso was tight, and Track #10. That is about it. I like the joint with guest production by Madlib only because I saw Doom perform it live in 2003 @ Scribble Jam! Other than that, this is the verge of the mighty Doom falling off. The problem is that people are giving praise to the madvillian album, and Danger Doom. Truly I mean WTF???????? This is the bottom line. Doomsday was classic, MM.. Food is decent at best, and Doom as mighty wordsmith that he is, will only be good for cameo's like U-God, and Talib Kweli.

I paid $20 for a used copy of Operation Doomsday a few years back and didn't want to spend so much again since I missed this upon its initial release as well. As a whole, it has a different vibe than Doomsday, which makes it hard to declare either as superior to the other. I lean toward Doomsday, but this one's pretty tight. Several superb tracks here, but I must say that the best is Guinesses, on which Doom lets his minions take the MC reins as he whips up a terrific production.The bonus DVD is cool, but nothing to bite gnomes about. I've only watched it once since purchasing.Overall, a must for fans of true hip-hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doom solid as usual.","review":"Understandably not quite as good as The Mouse & The Mask, but still incredible.

There is no way to fall on this and not be injured. My husband received scratches to his stomach, chest, and neck, but the eye was the worst - it ripped his eyelid in 2 places, scratched it in many more, and he needed 8 stitches on the top of his eyelid and underneath his eye. The doctor said it was just luck the eye itself wasn't injured.There are many small children in our area, and we shudder to think what would happen if one of them were to land on this.

The author's viewpoint is the one of a neurocientist, hence more centered on neuronal molding than on learning. The author shows that what we call brain development is actually about partially limiting the adaptivity of the brain circuitry. Still, there is always potential for adaptation, age does not prevent the molding of the brain. The evolution of the brain is driven both by genetics and learning. So how we use it matters a lot!

I was not disappointed watching the incredible constant motion displayed in each of the songs he chose to include. No doubt Mike is probably one of the best drummer's alive today. The third disk I have not gotten to yet, but I am looking forward to watching it. Mike is an extremely intelligent dude and I find it interesting listening to his stories and his commentary on the music. My only complaint is the price of the DVD.

Wow!","review":"My students often play pictionary in my Spanish classes and sometimes would complain if they chose a verb, saying that they didn't know how to draw a verb. So these cards really helped them to overcome that.I do like that every verb has a sentence underneath it, conjugated in the present tense, first person singular form (yo form). However, there is no pronunciation, and there is no English translation - which is good for learning - helps the student to get away from translating in his or her head, but then there is the question of true meaning, which will hurt confidence and thus motivation in learning. All in all, a great idea - verbs on cards! Huge size, so great for classroom learning, and a really wide variety of categories of verbs. For the price, this is a great tool to have in your Spanish library.Sra.

I strongly recommend it both to novice meditators and more experienced practitioners.

Just reading the book makes you feel quiet and calm and makes you look forward to your meditation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, clear and basedin experience","review":"A very simple and beautiful guide to the path, and probably because of that profound.Martine has a refreshing and down to earth approach to grounding meditation practice within my daily life, making this helpful in practicing both formally and informally, and easy to incorporate in a daily routine.I read it all the way thru once and now read the indvidual self-contained sections daily on an as needed basis.The pictures are an added bonus and can be used as meditation aids on their own and as comments to te text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely helpful","review":"Although a dedicated Buddhist practitioner I am still relatively new to the actual concepts....Martine Batchelor explains these in concise, incisive detail without over doing it and keeps the examples short and on point.I especially found helpful her personal stories from life experience illustrating that even someone who lived an idealistic life as a Buddhist nun in Korea had problems not only in the monastery itself, but coming back into the western world we inhabit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes meditation EASY","review":"A jewel of a book by a very wise lady. De-mystifies meditation and makes it accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime.Simple and concise language, a variety of approaches, and a guided meditation at the end of each chapter. You couldn't ask for more...Yet, you GET IT, in the form magnificent color photographs by the author's husband, Steven Batchelor!Highly recommended, you wont' regret adding this book to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying on many fronts","review":"We have now removed this shower head and its specialized shower arm and its specialized escutcheon and the short water-supply extension pipe these require and replaced them with a better and less costly set of components. The driving problem with the 18494 is that its conventional spray pattern is fine and broad; it stings tender flesh and does not deliver enough water to any one spot to easily remove soap or shampoo. Then, there is the matter of its over-sized couplings (head to arm, arm to water supply) making piecemeal substitutions impossible. Finally, the head's inner workings are plastic, so they break easily when one takes it apart for cleaning/descaling. And, did I mention, the package is costly. We switched to the 15966 \\"Flip-Side\\" and mounted it on a less-prestigious and normally-sized shower arm -- and we are much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riserblock alinment","review":"I installed the riser block and the guides didn't lineup. The top guides were over a half inch forward of the bottom guides. I called tech help they informed me that this is an on going problem. They told me to remove the pins from the saw body. They said the pins are for alinment porposes only. They have nothing to do with holding it all in place. I am concrned this won't stop the top half of the saw twisting while under blade presure. They assured me it wouldn't be a problem. Let's hope it isn't a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kit fits Ridgid 14\\" Saw","review":"Everything as described and fits well.

Used on Ridgid 14\\" bandsaw insted of Powermatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raise my Jet","review":"Decided to try the kit to raise my Jet 14\\" bandsaw. It worked perfectly. Kit is complete with all components including blade,blade guard, longer guide rod, and block. There is about a 1/8 difference in where a 3/8 blade rides on the upper and lower wheels,but it doesn't seem to affect tracking at all. Works great and now I have a two tone, gold/white machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Riser block problem still not fixed - 2009","review":"I got my Powermatic saw today and started to set it up. I thought I'd install the riser at the same time since I already had all of my tools out. The riser I got is out of square; not only does it cause the wheels to be misaligned in the vertical plane, but the top and bottom surfaces of the riser block are not even parallel. When installed, the top of the saw leans back enough to be obvious. putting a straight-edge across the face of the top wheel shows that the bottom wheel is set back a half inch at the top and three quarters at the bottom, so re-drilling guide holes wont even cure it; one of the horizontal faces would need re-milled. Nice Q.C. there, guys. Hopefully, I can get a good one cross shipped without a lot of blather about how co-planarity(sp?) is overrated. I'll let you know how this tragicomedy ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update: More Trouble Than It's Worth","review":"After owning this iron less than a year & rarely using it---maybe 3 dozen times, briefly---it died completely. Worst piece of junk I've ever wasted money on!This sounded like a fantastic iron. It's not. The thick cords make it extremely unwieldy. Can't set the iron upright, not good. The worst thing about it is that you get steam for just a few seconds, after the iron has been on for awhile. Most of the time, instead of steam, the iron dumps out big spurts of water. Also, the temperature dial has a nasty habit of moving from whichever setting you placed it on. I believe this happens while ironing, somehow, because the dial is right under your hand while using it, and apparently the slightest touch spins the temperature dial up, up, up. Have scorched two expensive garments because I forgot to check every few seconds to see if the dial had strayed up from Delicate to Cotton."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a junk iron!!","review":"I bought this because it was on sale for $20 on amazon.com. I was so excited to get this fency iron with steaming capability. As soon as the package arrived, I opened it up, filled it with distilled water, and turned it on. Within a minute, I was able to depress the steam button and got nice steam jet. I started ironing and within first five minutes it stopped producing the steam. I tried cooling it down and re-heating but no luck.I sent it to warrranty service for repair, after paying $10 on shipping out of my pocket. Received the \\"repaired\\" iron and it showed exact same pattern. It looks like either I had a defective unit or the design itself is terrible. So you have been warned, beware of this iron.The iron itself still works but no steam. What good is an iron that can not produce heat?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Real piece of junk!","review":"I got this iron @$20, thinking great deal! It's NOT! Cord is way to heavy! Cant sit it upright while ironing. Spit water half the time, which causes water spots. Then after about 4 months just wouldnt work at all. Ended up just having to throw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, broke in 6 months","review":"This thing is not worth the money. I got a better deal on it this summer and was happy, despite some design flaws. Then one day it just decided not to work anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"If you can open the cap and refill the tank while the iron is still on then its just a water \\"reservoir\\" tank and NOT a pressurized steam generator (like the higher end Rowentas). This is why it tends to spurt water after hitting the button a few times..the iron is not able to convert the water to steam fast enough. If you want steady, consistant steam delivery, than consider an iron with a pressurized tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so 'hot'","review":"got the iron last week. It doesn't produce hot steam, rather a mist of cold water. The cold water is sprayed on the garment which it then heated with the iron. So this product can be used to iron, but not to steam a standing garment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Woman, Strong Bones","review":"This book was recommended by my 2 daughters who both have osteoporosis and are in their 30s. It covers everything and is easy to read and understand. Truly a handbook for anyone who has osteoporosis."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"If you want to know anything about osteopenia or osteoporosis this is the book to buy. It is full of information - beyond most other books - entertaining and accessible. All women should read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beethoven: pure and simple","review":"Wouldn't it be nice if any reviewer of any product simply said, \\"I liked it!\\". Well, I liked it!I enjoyed them so. Backhaus does his best to give us the unadorned Beethoven. And he succeeds so well that he has displaced Kempf as my \\"reference\\" set. I have and enjoy many of the complete and near complete sets and a good many of other Beethoven sonata recordindings. But I now go back to Backhaus to hear what Beethoven really wanted. And, in doing so , I continually rediscover the genius of the composer. I think it takes a pretty good artist to assist you in that.Highly recommended. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast, too harsh.","review":"Although celebrated by some reviewers, I think Backhaus' box set doesn't excite the listener. Several movements are played too fast as if he had no patience or time to play (or record) them at the correct tempo marking.As far as recording is concern, there are differences among the sessions like mics placement and reverb. On the majority of the tracks, unfortunately, the piano sounds like an old and harsh fifth rate instrument.If you still doesn't know the Beethoven sonatas, I suggest starting from the Arrau's box set; if you're an expert and are looking for another version, check the amazing Anton Kuerti's recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon's Backhaus collection is Pathetic!!","review":"As a proud vinyl record collector, I find the Backhaus selection here on Amazon very lean indeed. I think it outrageous that his earlier UK Decca/London mono cycle is nowhere to be found. Some of the very first recording from 50-51 are a bit rough, but from 52 on the recordings are beautiful. PLEASE don't tell me that the mono/stereo debate is still going on in the 21st century! I, for one, have his complete stereo and mono cycles on vinyl and I think I'm the better for it. I've been hunting about for his LVB PCs with Krauss in glorious mono........I'm not going to kind it am I????? It's a pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"My awesome writing instrument !!!!","review":"As a draftsmen, this pen has easily become one of my best friends. you'll be asking yourself why, haven't I purchased a number of cross pens, before now?!!! Not only does it perform as advertised, but it just looks good and handles, just as well. You'll notice that your good penmanship has gotten much better, since your brilliant purchase order of this cross pen. I make a gift of a number of cross pens/writing instruments for my near and dear friends, over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross ATX Ballpoint Pen","review":"Terrible pen - I think it is counterfeit since it doesn't appear to be of the same cross quality I am used to. When I twist the barrel to lower the ballpoint it grinds - fit and finish is terrible. I am returning the pen to Amazon and will look into how to determine Chinese counterfeit Cross Pens before I buy in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naval gazing","review":"I partly agree with the other review in that this book is essentially a glorified exercise in naval gazing and irrelevant to most people. However, that alone isn't a reason to attack the book. I do take away points because the book is too much a knee-jerk defense of rational choice against a knee-jerk attack on rational choice. If you haven't read Green and Shapiro's book critiquing rational choice, you'll feel like you're missing half the story. Some of the defenses of rational choice are a bit superficial in and of themselves (alleging that Green and Shapiro don't provide a sufficient alternative). If you're heavily invested in this debate, this book is probably worth owning, but even for other political scientists it's probably a bit superfluous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disco lives!!","review":"If you are from the Disco Era or just love that music (and who doesn't?) then you will love this album.

If you're a fan of Disco/Funky music then Studio 54 is a MUST! I can't stop playin'it either in my car or in my home appliances. GREAT whenever! It brings back the fun of the late 70's and the mid 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good tracks, too few.","review":"Studio 54 is a shabby film. I've spent $7 to watch it and a friend of mine spent an extra $20 to buy the soundtrack. After I've listened to the album I felt sorry for my friend and his 20 bucks. Like the film the Album is mostly full of chaff, with only two or three tracks worth listening to. The great \\"heart of glass\\" is the reason why this album got two stars instead of no stars at all, \\"knock on wood\\" is also nice, and so is the first track. So take your hard earned $20 and buy a \\"Blondie\\". With the change you can go and get a ticket to a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"....","review":"Bubblegum disco , bubblegum cheesy songs.Avoid it , try Salsoul , Philadelphia Int. etc, if you want to listen to the \\"real stuff\\" ."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste!","review":"There aren't many good songs on this album. It's really lousy. \\"Que sera di vida\\" is good and the mix is pretty cool, but nothing else is worth listening to. And the worst part is that the best song of the movie (\\"If you could read my mind\\") is on the second cd, not this one. I also would have liked full length versions of some of the songs in the mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't contain any big name 70s hits...Very Disappointing","review":"If you want a \\"Best of 70s\\" CD...this is not it. I'm a big disco fan and was expecting this to be \\"THE\\" CD to have...an instant 70s party, but it's not!!! A few good songs like \\"Knock on Wood\\" but no Gloria Gaynor,no We Are Family, no big names...NO GOOD! Also avoid the 2nd volume--it's no good as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Start","review":"This is the first book in a 4 novel series, and also the first published novel of Mr. Watt-Evans. The book is well written, and shows all the promise and excitement of a new and talented writer. The story has many familiar trappings as Garth is sent out on the first of many quests. Though the use of Garth the Overman as the main character makes for an interesting and differant read. I would recommend this book and series. If you enjoy the wryness of the story, check out The Misenchanted Sword for some fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product, especially for small spaces","review":"I was looking for a speaker for my iPod for use (strictly) in my office.I have the Bose stereo at home which I love but that seemed like overkill (in quality and price) for my 10 x 12 office.This product is perfect for my needs--it's a great size (utilizing very little desk space), has charging capacity, allows for easy display of the iPod screen, and seems to have very good quality of sound.My only reason for giving it less than 5 stars: the volume dial is VERY sensitive...anything more than a slight movement can take it to a deafening level (which is not that well-received in the work setting).Although this stereo does not come with a remote, you probably don't need one if you're going to use it in a small area (such as an office) where you do little moving around!Great price and great fit for my needs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, lightweight and nice-looking easel","review":"I bought this easel for a workshop in landscape painting, because I needed something cheap, portable and reliable. It turned out to be a great choice! It is lightweight (I don't drive, so I had to carry it around, and it caused no problems), quite stable and very adjustable. It doesn't have a manual, but you won't need any! It is very easy to handle.Consider, though, that if you take this easel outdoors, you will have to bring something to put your brushes, paints and other stuff on. Because this thing doesn't have any shelves on it. Other than that, it's a great value for money and I absolutely love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remember...","review":"While a student at SUNY-Albany in the 1970s I used to go to Saratoga Springs, NY to see Roy Bookbinder at Cafe Lena. It was great to see him up close and experience him enjoying what he did so well. I was able to enjoy his renditions which appeared on this his first album. I owned the LP and wore out the grooves. The CD brings back those good times and is a good introduction to the styles and people to whom he tries to remain faithful."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Roy...thanks!","review":"The same as another reviewer, I also had the great pleasure of hearing Roy at Mead-O-lark over several consecutive summers in the mid 70's.Roy is the real deal. A down to earth traveling bluesman in every sense, that sings, plays and tells a story straight from the heart like few others. His stories, the memories of fishing on Washington Pond and most notably his music have left an impression on me that will last my lifetime. His playing has surely formed and influenced my love of music to this day.If you are ever fortunate enough to meet him, ask him if he still has that record setting stuffed Bass caught in Washington Pond. Perhaps he won't mind telling you all about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merlin The Sorcerer","review":"I have a great deal of interest in historical settings and Merlin The Sorcerer really satisfies that need. The settings of the old Briton and Mayan Empires are realistic to the point that you actually feel you are there and understand how they effect our lives today. Merlin The Sorcerer grabs your attention and won't let go. I can hardly wait for the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"For anyone interested in the Civil Rights movement, this is a must read. It took the tragic, brutal death of one young man for people of this country to say enough is enough. Mamie Till Mobley writes with honesty and integrity. I wish I had met her. She is a truly inspiring woman who would not let her son's death be in vain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death of Innocence: The Story of the Hate Crime...","review":"I have only read the forward and the frist few chapters of this publication. It is amazing how a mother accepts her child's death and continue to live life to the fullest, but that is life. I was amazed to see that this publication had been written on such tragic event, but Emmett Till's mother writes this book in memory of her child, about her life, their family life and the evils of our nation. I am sure this publication served as healing vehicle for her because he died as a child, which means he never reached maturity to graduate from high school, enjoy/experience life or just to play as a child like kids do everday in this country. It is a great and sad story, that other human beings (adults) can hurt and killed a child because according to them, he violated the rights of a caucasian female."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Book","review":"As a mother myself,I cannot fathom how a young black child could be so horribly and viciously killed. For years, there have been different versions to this story,and for the most part,it made him seem as though he was disrespectful to the lady when all that only happened was this young fella trying to get what he wanted out of his mouth by whistling(as he was taught by his mother and grandmother).Thank God for Mrs Mobley's book. I read it through within a day. Some of the stuff,I had to make myself read,and it makes you wonder how folk can still go on living after such an ordeal. My hat goes out to the memory of a dear woman who lived her life with courage and dignity,and a son needlessly killed. Every mother regardless of her color should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a better description","review":"I decided to purchase this for my husband for Christmas.

Some tracks (It's Cold, Pygmy Motorcycle, La Pump, Make it Through) shine more than others, but overall \\"She Like Electric\\" makes for a truly memorable, delightful and entertaining listen that you'll find yourself wanting to repeat over and over.

I mean you dont know a word they are saying and screaming their heads off in bottlenose. All songs they are way off pitch. I mean they probably had one professional music lesson which didn't help at all. They are probably like since my family has sooo much money we can record an album just to be cool. This is a disgrace to all 13/14 year olds. Look at like all the other singers out there. They probably only recorded the song once and didnt practice at ALL. I mean they should have at least another year of voice lessons maybe it would be fine but Smoosh please save our ears and wait until you actually can sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they make this cd?","review":"I heard about smoosh in a magazine, so I decided to listen to their songs on Amazon.com.

Of course, she won because... i dont know. maybe people were shocked that a girl could actually dunk the ball or maybe they thought that she did something that nobody in that dunk competition could top. Oddly enough, listening to this cd and then reading the reviews made me think of that dunk competition. This music is terrible and if you listen to this garbage then you are terrible too.

Someday when they grow up, these girls will look back and listen to what they did, and say \\"oh my god.. i didn't do this. why couldn't i wait till i was ready?\\"this album just doesn't have a specific audience. Should all the preteens listen to this? or could it be possibly aimed at an older audience? that would be ironic, though, as the lyrics and music are shallow and not well written from an adult or older person's point of view.

So much for fixing the hem of your skirt while you are wearing it! - a complete impossibilty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I concur with the rest....","review":"Luckily, I didn't have to spend money on this.

We had to get rid of our Sears model because it was too difficult to start. The only disappointment is that is does not roll backward very easily (which can make it hard to manuver in tight spaces) and my husband thought the plastic felt a little cheap. Other than that we are thrilled with the job it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and reliable","review":"While this mower will not \\"cut any thing you can push it into\\" as another reviewer said, it does do a very good job at a very good price. It starts easily and I can use it without asking my husband to prep it or prestart it to warm it up before I take it off to the Nevada outback to do a little cutting. I can't use it on rough terrain and it chokes on some of the big nasty weeds that grow around the edges of my garden beds but even a gas string trimmer has some difficulty with those. I like the clean lines and the simple operation of this mower. It isn't as noisy as our old one and the mulching feature is nice enough that we use this tool once in a while on the lawn instead of the riding mower (which doesn't mulch) Overall, based on price and features, I would recommend this mower over all the others offered in the same price range at the time we purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runs great, looks great, has the power","review":"We have had a very wet spring and it always seems to be raining,so have only used it 3 times, but it started easy and has the power even through tall wet grass.

The price was so low I was skeptical $179. And yea I wud buy it again and may buy a second one when they become available. I seen one at wallmart and went back and it was already sold. I really liked the way it arrived completely assembled except for putting on 2 screws to complete the handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as i expected","review":"I knew it is not the highest standard lawn mower - but it got great reviews in the consumer reports and I can only confirm this review.

This is a very good mower for the money. I have never ordered something so large through the mail, but with minimal assembly it was ready to go. The engine is very easy to start (usually only 2 pulls when cold, one when the engine is warm) Mulching & side discharge both work well. I have not tried bagging. It is definately easy to handle & move around all the obstacles in my yard, including a steep bank, trees, stairs, etc. As the household Yard-Woman, I love the Yard-Man mower despite the name!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't order this from Amazon","review":"This might be a good lawnmower but I can't find out as Amazon shipped it to me missing several parts.

I\`m an expat with a bank in Tokyo so I wanted to read this book as soon as I heard about it. But it was a big disappointment. I know Lehman did some crooked stuff, but where are the really juicy details? Why did the author make us read so much about his time at Yale Law School and other experiences that have nothing to do with the book\`s title? And a lot of the book seems like a personal vendetta against people that the author worked with at Lehman."},{"rating":"1","title":"fact of fiction?","review":"I realize Mr. Marion says this book is a mixture of fact and fiction, but the amalgamation of both coupled with this writing style, essentially render the whole effort fiction and comic-book fantasy reading. As such, if you read it for entertainment purposes only, it has engaging sections. Yet many sections completely bore you or make you feel Mr. Marin is simply boasting about his supposed prowess and intellectual escapades (not to mention his sexual escapades). In short, after the roller-coaster ride through Tokyo's Chuo-Ku, it leaves you somewhat cheapened, like a one night stand by the author and Wall-Street's biggest.

The People Magazine article in 1982 gave more details about your life than this book! While this book was a welcome addition to my admiration of a long career, for a true Reddy fan such as myself, I wanted more! This is no way to treat a fan!By the way, Helen is exceptional in concert; fun, interactive, energenic, enthusiastic, and emotional. She's also this way in person and during interviews.

After you see 1 show you don't want to stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Dramatic Series in Television History","review":"The Sopranos is arguably the best dramatic series in television history. The writing, directing, acting, and character development in this show are brilliant, and stand quite apart from anything else on television. Despite quibbling among reviewers as to whether the second season is as good as the first, both stand head and shoulders above anything else on television, and are also superior to most cinematic films. It is curious that The West Wing seems to win more television awards than the Sopranos. I have seen both shows. The West Wing is an above average show, but is nothing exceptional. It is not even in the same league with The Sopranos. I suspect its \\"wins\\" are more the result of internal television politics than actual merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness continued","review":"The second season of the Sopranos offers more characters, more character development and more great plot lines. While it doesn't have the \\"freshness\\" of the first season, It more than makes up for it in quality. Great acting, great directing. A great story told simply and wonderfully. They resorted to more gimicks in the third season, but Season 2 retains the feel of the first season. If you liked season 1, you'll like season 2. More of the same and just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sopranos Complete first and second season","review":"I recieved my product in a quick fashion and the DVD's were great I love the Soprano's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sopranos Season 2","review":"Never saw the series when it was on TV.

Season 1 was fresh, funny and heart-wrenching. Whoever is behind this mess of a season ought to be clipped. Terrible, terrible, terrible. The introduction of Tony's annoyingly lame ass loser sister Janice is awful. There's nothing likable about her. Melfi, who was brilliant and warm is for some reason barking and hissing like a mad woman, totally uncharacteristic. Did these writers watch the first season before writing these eps? Continuity, anyone? Everything flowed so smoothly and naturally - flawlessly - in season 1, but so far season 2 feels so forced and flat. Major bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sopranos-Second Season","review":"I received my DVD Soprano set 2 weeks after I ordered it.

We also get to see more about Tony's career choice and how it affects him. We also get introduced to some new characters, the least of which is his memorable sister Janice.Season 2 the cast and writers seemed to hit a groove, a familiarity and the show just flows along much more naturally. By season 2 I was fully addicted to the show. Getting to watch an episode or two each night was what I looked forward to all day long.One of the best TV shows of all time. A stellar cast.

Good things do come in small packages...","review":"I found this book very helpful ...it starts with mating patterns (that we all should know , but of course forget...)and tactical devices. It covers pawn structures and levers(which i found especially helpful) and later goes into attack on the opponents king ( conditions and methods). What I like about this book is it's brevity. Some people may argue that it's too short, but in my opinion it covers the essential material while not making the book a chore to read. Ask any chessplayer, and he or she will tell you about their fantastic collection of chess books they HAVEN'T read. This book will be an excellent study for anyone under 1700 and because of it's smaller size, will be a good refresher course for those who have already covered the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kopec gives it to you straight!","review":"If you are a beginner or ANY player rated under 1800, you should probably get this book.

The first section deals with pattern recognition. This is a very important skill. Kosten lists about 24 basic mating patterns and recomends that someone not familiar with them should learn them. He then gives examples for about six of them. I don't think that even the author would think that anyone will learn the basic mating patterns by reading this. The book of combinations by Polgar is an excellant example of a book that will give a lot of practice in finding mating patterns. He also gives pawn play in the middle game a very short treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are Better Ways to Spend Your Money","review":"The section showing the 26 basic mating patterns is very handy.

The machine is very well-constructed, safe, no leaks or burn issues like I'd read about on some of the other brands.

This is another forty dollar investment into a machine that might only work a few more times. Do not buy this steamer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous For Cleaning Bird Cages","review":"I bought this for one reason. I needed something to help me with removing dried droppings from bird cages. Let me just say that for this purpose it works just great.I cannot use any chemicals or harsh cleaning products, and nothing, I repeat nothing I have tried works as well as this little machine. Dried bird poo is like concrete, and the steam softens it so I can simply brush & rinse it all away with a garden hose. Now, if you are looking for a machine that will just blow the dirt away while you stand there and say 'gee whiz' this is NOT what you are looking for. A little elbow grease is required, but it will loosen tuff dirt enough so you can easily finish the job. The kind of steam cleaner that just blows away the dirt will cost you anywhere from $500 to $1,000. For less than $100 with free shipping, this machine is a deal that is very hard to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warm Mist, Not Steam","review":"I suspect that the steam cools between the time it leaves the heating source and the time it arrives at the nozzle. It has a long tube to travel through. What comes out is 1/3 dripping hot water and 2/3 warm mist. The hot water burns me; I can put my hand under the mist. It's bulky and takes up a lot of storage space, but I would suffer that inconvenience happily if it produced better steam. For ease of handling, storing and steam quality, I'm siding with the handheld models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"This item was very reasonably priced; delivered promptly, and worked fine for several months. Then the button which locks the attachments fell out. Live steam poured through that opening and parts were not securely attached.

Be advised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steam Fast SF-275","review":"I was not disappointed in this floor cleaner! I really like all the attachments for cleaning different spaces.

Now, if it only sucked up the dirt left behind I'd have a miracle product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I recently purchased this steam cleaner because I installed marble tile in my bathroom. You can't use harsh chemicals on your marble so this steam cleaner is great for cleaning the bathrooms. The steam lasts a long time. It heats up in 2-8 minutes depending on how much water you use. The down side is that there is no storage compartments for the accessories and the electrical cord does not recoil, but long enough to move about. I also found the switch for continous steam to be too small. Overall you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"Returned the product. After reading the reviews and the propaganda I picked the Steamfast. I had high expectations of cleaning small areas around the house without using any chemical substances.The first area was the garage floor. There was some oil and rust stains. After prepping the unit as instructed, the unit only spitted out a low volume of steam and at very low pressure. Quickly it wouldout of steam and had to recycle more steam. What a major disappointment! I had so many projects lined up like tile grout, car wheels, etc.I will try another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This is the first time I had purchased a steam cleaner and have been wanting one forever. Needless to say, I was very disappointed when I used it. My oven was not very dirty, but had a few spots from spilling. I used the machine and went over and over it and it would not clean it up. Eventually I had to use a brillo pad and it took it right off. I then attempted to use it on my windows outside and that was a disaster because the hose was not long enough to reach the top of the window so I had to pick the machine up with one hand and try to clean with the other. Very hard to do. The brush attachments were very small and could not be used on bigger items. The only thing I could do with this machine was to steam my floor, but for that I could have purchased just a floor steamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can be used as a 30 minute humidifier but don't expect to \\"clean\\" with this thing!!!","review":"Read all of the 1 star reviews TWICE before you even think of buying this.Keep in mind that all the 5 star reviews, in my opinion, could be believed if they were talking about cleaning a couple square INCHES of area.This \\"steam cleaner\\" is very time consuming to \\"clean\\" with, its not hot enough, it doesn't produce enough force and, its not practical for \\"cleaning\\" large areas.Its not worth the space it will take up in your home, let alone, what you pay for it.There are cleaning products for a reason.You have been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I suppose I had high expectations.

Don't expect to use it ONLY to clean your greasy kitchen, the steam cannot wash grease away, you still need detergent.3. There are some changeable heads with it, but they are made by plastic.

As soon as I received it, I went to work on my bathroom tiles, which are 41 years old. I fastened a washcloth over the triangular brush and scrubbed them. They look like brand new tiles. The tiles in the shower did not come quite as clean as the rest of the tiles but I believe they will after a few uses. I only found one slight problem. It seems to lose steam if you keep the button pressed for a while. But I just let off the button and gave it a few seconds and the pressure came right back. I do love it and I know I will find many uses for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for wooden floors - effortless","review":"I have been using this unit for around 12 months and it is reliable, generates ample steam, and cleans wooden floors and bathroom floor tiles effortlessly. I will never go back to chemical cleaners, this unit is so much faster and requires less muscle power.Once in a while the steam stops, this is due to the hose twisting. I use an extension cord to complete the job in my 2 bedroom unit.In my experience the accessories are not useful. I tried it to remove shower scum (didn't work well), it was easier to simply use elbow grease with a mild cleaner and scrub."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Steam Cleaner.","review":"I love it.

We found that you really need to work at it to remove stubborn stains. You end up having to attach the small scrubbing brushes as the steam alone will not do the job.

Save your money as you can achieve almost the same result in the same amount of time with a good scrub brush and cleaning product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Steam Cleaner","review":"This unit does a wonderful job in the bathroom and kitchen. Used in conjunction with spray cleaner it removed buildup from around sinks and shower stalls. I have an oven with sealed top burners. It always gets burned deposits around each burner head. Nearly impossible to remove the deposits. Last night I sprayed and cleaned household cleaner around each burner. I used the brass brush to dig the deposits up.

The songs are perhaps not as catchy as the first release, but they are just as interesting and more complex musically. The rhythm section of Copeland and Clarke is tight and Holland's dulcette vocals are incredible. This band was a melding of styles that on first glance wouldn't seem to work. Clarke is a jazz bassist, Copeland is a rock drummer with a very reggae style and Holland wrote country and western tunes. Together they melded into a very interesting (and I daresay progressive) trio.

DZ's finest hour, however, had yet to be achieved until \\"Hot and Spicy Beanburger\\", which occurred after Tortelvis left (during the DZ \\"disco era\\") and then came back. In my opinion, \\"Un-Led-Ed\\" was good, \\"5,000,000\\" was better, \\"It's Not Unusual\\" was an interesting hiccup, and DZ achieved their peak at \\"Hot and Spicy Beanburger\\".

Nonetheless, Ms. Delinsky is one of modern fiction's most reliable authors; not surprisingly, THE VINEYARD is very good. Her two heroines, Natalie and Olivia, both are real and appealing. The hook with which the story opens is a grabber. Delinsky's writing, as always, is fast-paced and the story is compelling. As a device she often uses to add structure to her books, there is a long-hidden secret which turns out to have had a great impact on the lives of some of her characters. The most telling sign of a skilled writer, I have noticed, is that even the ancillary characters are interesting and believable.

I suppose they wanted to include more stories, but it ends up being a more of a pain to make sure you have the 'right' disc for the story your kids want. If there wasn't enough room on one CD, cut one of the weaker performances -- there were plenty to choose from.Overall, this was a big disappointment.

Their amount of topics on their on-line support is not broad enough.

Their phone support is even worse. I waited on the phone for 45 minutes to talk to a customer support person so he can tell me he would only help me if I paid more money. Next time I'll buy a PC with Dell or Gateway. Like I wrote, the product is fine, but part of the reason for choosing a particular PC is for customer support.

Ideas are expressed more often as algebra and theorems than as English prose. Therefore it's more of a resource for academic work than for actually implementing a compiler. If you are looking for such a formal treatment, perhaps as the basis of a thesis, I highly recommend this book. It's similar to the Dragon Book, but is more up to date and covers topics specific to imperative, functional, logic, and OO languages. But if you're simply interested in getting a working understanding of how to implement a compiler, I suggest one of the other highly rated works on Amazon.

There is a difference, however, in the reasons. Daniel Webster overcame the devli through his goodness, whereas Joe Hardy overcame Satan through his determination. There is a similarity here, because Joe Hardy remained true to his wife's love in overcoming the wiles of the beautiful Lola.

I would not recommend it to the beginner. For a person familiar with the basics of Elliott Waves this book is gold. It shows you how to think outside of the square as far as how patterns should and can look. It made me realise that most of my wave analysis was flawed.Some of the book is overkill, and i did not read some parts as they seemed to be overcomplicating things, especially the Neely system of labeling.

One might have a chance if this book was treated as textbook and offered in a university over a semester long class, taking each chapter apart with live examples.Other reviews mention that it takes years to master this method.I somewhat agree. The rules of logic are not clear and that is mainly because if the autor wanted to go to great lenght to explain everything this book would be around 2000 to 3000 pages.

I scored 2220 on the GRE, and after 2 readings, I have no clue WHAT he's talking about.I'm not convinced chapter 3 was actually written in English -- more like translated INTO english from french, by someone who flunked french!

My kitten is fairly good at killing this device even though she weighs less than 6 pounds. The instructions say not to bend the arm back against the motor. My cat didn't read the instructions. My other complaint is the the buttons are where my cat can push them by stepping on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful","review":"This toy nearly killed my cat. The mouse is the perfect size to get lodged in the cats throat, which is exactly what happened when the plastic stick detached from the device (which it did a lot). He nearly choked to death the other night. My suggestion, if you must buy this, use it only under supervision and put it, or at least the mouse away when you are done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I work in a pet store and have this out on demo. I also have one for my 4 cats at home, so this toy has really been put through its paces over the past few weeks. Verdict: Poor.There are two major problems. Firstly, it's too light - my big 'ol Maine Coon just picked the whole thing up and walked off with it! It also gets pulled onto its side far too easily. It needs to be weighted in the base.Secondly, the wand part just pulls off FAR too easily. It simply slots onto the metal stem with no locking mechanism. I got bored with having to reattach it every few minutes. Also, the more it comes off and on, the looser it gets....so it gets worse over time.When it's upright and in one piece it's an OK toy. The speed adjustment is good and I like the auto-off feature. Hopefully they will tweak the design a bit and it will be worthwhile. As it is, buy the Undercover Mouse instead - much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fun for the cats, but swinging arm keep coming off","review":"I like the idea of this toy, since it keeps the cats engaged with the random motions.One of my cats really gets into it, and can play with it for a while.The other only sort of swats at it from a laying-down position.The problem is that the swinging metal arm on which the feather toy is attached to only sits on the main part with a metal clamp, and when the cats get into it and jump on it, the arm keeps coming off.So while the cats have fun, I don't, bc I have to keep re-attaching the arm! That's super-annoying.It's sitting in the corner now, unused, and I guess it is back to the crinkly shopping bags on which I have to spend no money at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a piece of garbage.","review":"This product wasn't working right and they promised to send a new one. They never did. It also falls apart as soon as the cats start to play with it. A total piece of garbage. Not to mention a company that doesn't keep it's word. I will be contacting them again but I am very angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shows no interest","review":"Had figured this would be a good way to entertain our Kitty when no people were around to play with her. She normally likes and shows interest in the wand toys, and since this seemed to have the same \\"principle\\" (but without the human) I thought she would go for it...but I've thought the same about other products and was wrong, and was also wrong about this one. She did not show any interest in this other than a little intimidation by the swinging arm, even when it was set on the lower speed. I was a little afraid that if she did approach this thing, the yellow arm would bop her or poke an eye, but needless to say it never got that far. She was not intrigued enough to go near it. Still not ready to give up on this, I set it outside one day when a neighbor's cat was visiting. He also did not seem to realize it was there to pique his interest. Returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cats Lose Interest Quickly","review":"Kittens may find this toy fun, but only three of my five adult cats were mildly curious at first and lost interest quickly. The lure on its string slides onto the end of the rotating stem and is held in place by pressure. After a few minutes, the device tends to fling the lure loose from the stem. There is no automatic shut-off when this happens, so someone must supervise the device or the batteries will run down needlessly. I plan to give the toy to someone with a kitten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 3 days...unhappy with purchase","review":"I purchased this item for my 4 month old kitty who is very active. The idea is good... but it is not sturdy enough. She bent the rod that holds the wand in the first few hours when it wasn't falling off. I have duct taped it on for now and straightened the rod... I am sure it is just a short matter of time before it snaps off completely. She has also tipped it over several times - scaring her and me.I am sorry that I paid $30 bucks for this item... I am much better off with the laser pointer and feather wand that are only a few dollars. Wish I could return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seek and Destroy","review":"My little Munchkin kitten loves this thing, but I have to wonder how long it's going to last. At just over 1.5 pounds, she beats this thing to a pulp, often dragging the running unit across the floor. While it hasn't show any signs of failure yet, I can't imagine this thing enduring for too long before we have broken gears or fried motor. Another downside would be the durability of the \\"mouse\\" portion. I've only had this a few days and it's more or less shredded. A better, more durable mouse would be lovely.On the upside, the movements and adjustable speed are outstanding. I also love the timer functionality. Miss Kitty Fantastico likes very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"When I got this product, I turned it on and it worked for maybe an hour. Then, it just stopped working. The older model of this toy is better. It broke within a few months, but at least it worked and gave my cat tons of entertainment. Cats love the panic mouse. If you are going to buy it, don't buy this version, but remember, no matter what version you buy, it will not last long. (but to see your cat having all the fun...it's worth it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endless Kitty Entertainment","review":"This upgrade from the original model was well worth the added price. Now with a timer, you don't have to remember to turn the unit off after your kitties have had their fill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for a really young kitten...","review":"This is one of the first toys I got my cat. He likes it for a little while, but quickly grows bored. I'm talking about 3-5 minutes, if that. It's easily caught, and once he catches it, that's enough for him. He might try again a few times, but then he'll walk off. When he wanted to play, I would turn this on for him and he would come back to me like, \\"no, YOU play with me!\\"I think it's just not enough to keep a smart cat entertained. He loves wands, that I have to move on my own. He likes to stalk it, and then just as he's about to pounce--I move it! It's great fun for the both of us. This thing just lets him catch it. Boooooring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panic Mouse for Two","review":"We bought the Panic Mouse for our two cats. One younger indoor cat and one older outdoor cat. The older cat does not seem interested in cat toys at all, but the Panic Mouse does get his attention on a limited basis, say 5 or 10 minutes. The younger cat loves the laser beam toy but we thought we would get the Panic Mouse for her to give us some peace and quiet. She too likes it in small doses, say 10 or 15 minutes. The timer makes this toy very practical. Neither cat goes crazy over this toy, but both like it enough to play with it a few times everyday. So far the Panic Mouse has proven to be durable and interesting for both cats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panic Mouse","review":"Panic Mouse is a big hit with my 5 month old Chartreux. The plastic wand came right off in minutes so I secured it with a cable tie and electrical tape and it has stayed on. My kitten kept flipping the unit over so I drilled holes in each of the feet and screwed them down to a 3/4 inch piece of plywood. The 15 minute timer is perfect.I have started to use only the slower speeds and my kitten will hide and sneak up on his prey. On the faster speeds the cat will get really rough with the toy and hold on the mouse and strain the motor. I have had the unit 2 weeks and my cat plays with it at least twice a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke immediately","review":"Broke within 10 minutes of use. Very expensive and doesn't work. My cats are not hard players, yet our blind cat broke it immediately"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cat Toy","review":"I found one of these on clearance so I took the chance of wasting alot of money, but I'm glad I did! My cat loves it and it doesn't require my constant attention. I can turn it on and set the timer and then go about my business. He will sometimes let it run a few minutes but he eventually notices it and plays. I love the timer and speed dial. Also, something I do is put a few plastic grocery bags near it so the furry mouse will hit them every so often. The noise really enhances the effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earns the name PANIC!","review":"I bought this product for my cat. She loved it so much when the first one broke I went out and got her another one.However, I hope my story makes you aware of this product. My cat was playing with the panic mouse 360 when all of a sudden she let out an extremely loud meow. She jumped up on my bed pulling the heavy toy behind her! A wire loop goes through the mouse and the loop had loosened and became wrapped around her paw and tightened as she tried to become loose! As she was running around in a panic I was trying to catch and free her, she eventually broke the wire part off the wand, but the wire was still wrapped around her paw.Thankfully I was able to get her and take the wire off, but she was extremely frightened and hid under the table.This product is CHEAP and potentially HARMFUL to your pet's health. It certainly earned the name PANIC mouse! DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy sucks!","review":"We had this toy for maybe about a week and our cats broke the toy.

It is beautifully written and engrossing. The mechanics of the Alexander Technique are well reviewed . The strength of the book, however, is the contemplative and insightful approach to the intellectual, emotional, and creative aspects of the Technique, the understanding of which is vital to its mastery. I recommend this book very highly, but not as a first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for Cellists","review":"This book is an excellent and precise treatment of the Alexander Technique.

A moderate number of pictures are present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in many ways, dangerous in others...","review":"This book is an excellent exposition on many of the mechanisms by which you can learn the Technique. The unit on principles is also fairly good. Sometimes the author seems to get lost in detail, and his discussion of applying the Technique to musical goals is, for my tastes, weak. For a first book Carrington would be my choice, but many benefits from Alcantara's may be reaped by the discerning reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"McAfee sent back","review":"I've been using AVG Anti Virus for several months.

Then every time I boot I have screens that let me know I don't have other Mc Afee products installed. The system check told me of I was not safe as I did not have some of the products installed. The last straw was when they sent my rebate back for no UPC code enclosed, a bold lie. This was the last straw. I'm now back to the free AVG Anti virus.

It's the only one I've had that didn't fall off within minutes of sticking on the tub. Just took a bath with it, and it stayed put. It was super comfortable and also the water doesn't affect the pillow (others I've had have either soaked up the water or become stained when I use colored bath salts or bath bombs. I just used colored bath salts with it, and it stayed white).

Seems like the author, who only knew Janis Joplin for the better part of two years, (and didn't know her at all during the first part of her career in San Francisco), casts far too many one-sided judgments based on a personal ax to grind. Also, she displays no insight or appreciation of the San Francisco scene or rock music. An opinionated hatchet job, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't have picked a better title","review":"Let me say up front that I am not a Joplin fan; I don't like or dislike her. I just don't care. I only picked up this book because I like biographies of creative people, and the price was right (a buck.) But I had to force myself to finish this dull, depressing and dreadful book. Lots of lay psychoanalyzing and a bizarre attempt at a substance abuse lecture combine to make for a laboriously constructed but unsatisfying bio. The author is a trained musician, but you would scarcely know it from this clunky tale. There is little to no examination of the music of Joplin, much less any real interaction with her band. Unless you are a die-hard Joplin fan, save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH THE READ!","review":"I'm not sure what is going on with this book, but I think it is TERRIBLE! The author, while claiming to be a friend and associate of Ms. Joplin's, perpetuates a mood of haughty disdain for the books main character! At times, it seems that the author is almost mocking Janis and the illness of her drug and alcohol dependence. This does not jive with the author's supposed \\"relationship\\" with Janis! \\"With friends like these........\\" (You know the rest!) Aside from the lack of compassion (or maybe a helping hand?) for Janis' deplorably sick condition, the book is a collection of disjointed, run-on sentences, improper grammer, and incorrect punctuation. Buy \\"Pearl\\" - it's much better than this biased, cold, poorly written trash. Peace, Jon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Janis book out there","review":"I got interested in Janis a few years ago and wanted to read up on her. I bought this book, along with Love Janis and Sweet Scars of Paradise. Having read all three, this book is the last one I would recommend. Get the other Janis biographies first. If you're like me, you'll find that this book is biased and very critical of Janis as a person. I wanted more and felt there was something lacking with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"Buried Alive is a moving and disturbing account of Janis Joplin's life. Written by her publicist, who knew Janis well, this book definitely shines a spotlight on Janis' erratic behavior and personality.I was somewhat disappointed that the author glossed over Woodstock and Janis' participation there. However, it was well written and filled with personal observations and experiences with Janis as she traveled to stardom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically Important But Shrill","review":"That Myra Friedman was able to publish a biography of Joplin which is so poetic, so intense, and so engaging a mere three years after Joplin's tragic death is nothing short of miraculous. However, in the context of two other superlative Joplin biographies--LOVE, JANIS by Laura Joplin (Janis's younger sister)(1992) and SCARS OF SWEET PARADISE by Alice Echols (1999)--I find Friedman's compulsive rationalizing and anxious tone here (especially in the book's concluding section) to be less illuminating of the REAL Janis Joplin than the other two books. If you read only one Joplin bio, read LOVE, JANIS; if only two, add SCARS...; but if you are a die-hard Joplin fan (as I am), read all three. Taken together, it is a tribute to Janis herself that three stunningly intelligent, articulate writers could be moved to so obsess over Joplin's work and life that they produced biographies of such high caliber within thirty years of her death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very enlightening","review":"This book seemed really negative to me. Most every page sounds like the author couldn't stand Janis Joplin or her music. She uses way too much dialogue that couldn't possibly be verbatim, just her take on conversations that may have taken place. It's hard to believe that someone who says she was close to Janis for two years would ridicule her like this after she's dead. I feel bad for Janis that this book is supposed to be the best representation we have of her. It left me with a lot of unanswered questions about Janis, particularly her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks","review":"Pleeze, Rolling Stone and other worshippers of this dribble. Myra Friedman spends most of this outing psychoanalyzing Janis Joplin with the pompous arrogance of someone who fancies herself a shrink. This cold, biased analysis of Janis leaves her faceless, lifeless and one-dimensional. Painting Janis to be a pathetic, ridiculous coward throughout, the author makes several laughable attempts to portray herself as a close friend, claiming to have loved Janis. With friends like this, who needs enemies? I can't imagine Janis feeling anything but betrayed and offended by this judgmental portrait. Janis deserved better than this. Unfortunately, it's been hailed as the definitive rock biography. It is nothing of the sort. If you want to know the real Janis, listen to her albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I didn't know much about Janis but got interested in her a few years ago when a friend turned me onto her music. AFter reading Sweet Scars of Paradise, and Love, Janis, I picked up a copy of Buried Alive and was really turned off and frankly, disappointed, by the author's self-righteous tone. This book seems really outdated with its psychoanalytic slant and negative portrayal of Janis. Seems like the author had a personal vendetta against her and the entire '60s.If you're looking for a good book about Janis, I'd bypass this one and read the others bios instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"OM to 4/3 Adapter","review":"This unit works fine and costs less than half of what the Olympus store was charging. This is a very cost effective solution for utilizing one's OM lens with the new digital camera bodys."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is room for improvement","review":"This book is a welcome addition to a very scanty body of work about the Igbo language. The grammar and pronunciation are very well explained, there are good illustrative examples, and the phrasebook is extensive and useful. There is also interesting material about the Igbo history and culture.However, the included dictionary gives no guidance about the tones used in pronouncing the words it defines. Words are NOT marked for tone in the dictionary. Since tone is phonemic in Igbo (as in Chinese, for instance) this is a very serious limitation and it prevents the reader from building up a vocabulary by browsing the dictionary and plugging new words into sentences introduced in the phrasebook and grammar sections. If there was a lot of other material available for learning Igbo one wouldn't need to use the dictionary this way, but there really isn't.Hopefully in a future edition the authors will rectify this sin of omission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dictionary anyone?","review":"This Igbo-English Dictionary is the best resource I have so far, besides my mom. It really helps, you can go look up words or simply use the back, which shows you how to say tiny phrases such as \\"Help me\\" \\"I'm hungry\\" \\"I'm Hot\\". The back also gives the consumer some cultural insight and history.My only problem with it, is that verbs are not displayed as either i-dot or i-dotless.verbs should be explained in more detail if you are going to do a section on them in the front, and most dishearting of all is that the top page markers are wrong. on some pages you will find the bolded word in the middle instead of at the end.However all things considered this is a great assest for anyone wanting to learn Igbo."},{"rating":"1","title":"E for effort","review":"I bought this hoping that it would be better than others but was greatly disappointed.

Benjamin Fischer knows better than to trust the house, having survived its previous attempt to kill him, and only helps the others as long as it is safe to do so.

However, this is a good piece to watch if you are interested in the media aspect of war, and what the effects are. It raises good questions like what is the difference in the impact of seeing a dead American on TV vice a dead Arab? And from which audience- an American one or an Arab one? One of the underlying themes is that both sides saw Al Jazeera as \\"working for the enemy.\\" Recommended viewing for anyone working in Strategic Communications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Documentary","review":"Before watching this movie I must admit I had some stark views of Al Jazeera, but this movie completely changed that for me. It seems this Arab station was asking when no American station would: what evidence is there of WMDs or links with al Qaeda does Iraq have and what motives does the U.S. have for \\"intervening?\\" The most upsetting thing taken from the documentary was how the U.S. media congregated in CentCom, waiting to be given, probably filtered, government and military press releases - our news stations were waiting to be given the news.This is a great documentary which will probably pick up viewership as time goes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good unbiased information","review":"A little boring at times, but very good unbiased information documentary-style.

In a released video, the guy running the show over there in Al-Jazeera is shown talking to Saddam's son ( A vile man) and telling him not to worry that Al-Jazeera is their network (Saddam's). This video has lost all credibility for me, just like Michael Moore's F911. Both are lies sold for mass consumption to people that want to believe that America is wrong and evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking insight","review":"With all the gushing reviews I've read here and eleswhere, I was expecting Control Room to be one of the best documentaries ever. As you've probably guessed, I didn't like it all that much. I found it rather blah, linear and uninspired. It wasn't awful, but it just wasn't anything I hadn't seen, read or known about the Iraqi war (and I'm a Canadian who generally stays away from television). Especially now that the war is long since concluded, it's not something I want to spend alot of time thinking about. But hey, I love documentaries and this one is highly rated, so I gave it a chance.

It reminds us of how big of a cultural issue Iraqi Freedom is, and shows some of the weak points in US cultural awareness.If you have to watch some ultra leftist propaganda, this one is at least more educational than anything Michael Moore ever put out.

We Americans have been led to believe that A-J is anti-American, but this film suggests that it reports as it sees it, and is quite objective. I was convinced. Important interviews with the head honchos were sincere and heart-felt, often earthy about the necessity to inform.That this film is so highly regarded, I can only believe that it tells the truth. There's a lot of propaganda fed to us Americans, and because of our own network coverage, much isn't reported as it truly is. A-J doesn't sugar-coat the news, with often graphic shots that are unsettling. War is ugly; peace is unattainable because of the crazies who don't believe in an Allah of Love.

I had also heard a lot of good things about this movie. I expected it to be great, if not greater. Well... it wasn't... in fact it was no where near as good. The plot is way too convoluted and I didn't find the characters to be likable as I didn't know much about them(due to the weak character development).

As a love story it failed in establishing a repoir between its main characters and as a story of war it failed in providing action scenes. As a scifi movie it left you wondering if maybe the science was left out in favor of the fiction. I give it two stars. One for the art, one for the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is anime.","review":"Probably my favorite anime movie. The movie is kinda beyond words really. A little action, a little romance, a little sci-fi, a little melancholy, and a lot of gorgeous art. I really enjoy the soundtrack for this movie and its no surprise on how well this flick turned out seeing how its the same director as Voices Of A Distant Star. Needless to say, if you enjoyed that movie you'll love this one. It doesn't quite have the heart-breaking quality of the first film, but it more than makes up for it with its wonderful story.

They are randomly spaced, varying from 20\\" to 32\\". These grommets are not secured well and can easily be pulled out. Some are not completely within the hem, so these can be pulled out with your fingers because the bottom of the grommet is in the thicker hem while the upper part is in the single layer fabric.

But several of the suggested chords are pointlessly hard to play, and don't really sound all that good anyway. The overarching problem with this book is that it only encourages players to use chord formations involving a range of, usually, three frets, as opposed to the first seven--which is actually easier, and results in much fuller and cleaner sounding chords. For that matter, bar chords on the mandolin are never going to sound as clear as open chords, but you'd never know it from looking at this resource. It may not be a total washout, but buyer, beware.

It was if you were slowing down the beat of my heart.\\" No, I'm sorry, but this just comes across as descriptive text for the emotionally impaired. What he should be singing is \\"When you left, you ripped my heart out!\\"Each word is perfectly shaped (by far the best \\"was\\" I have ever heard), but the meaning of the words and the arc of the melody never make it off the printed sheet.

This was, by far, the best book of the bunch. The main characters have been developed, the \\"mystery\\" of Mallory's past revealed in Stone Angel and, finally, Ms O'Connell can just spin out good stories without the soap opera nonsense of a \\"mysterious\\" past (which I endured because the rest of the stories were so very good).This book is a deliciously interesting story of magic, madness and betrayal in the very best tradition of classic Doyle and Christie. If you are looking for a 90210 script dealing only with the love-life and past of the protaganist with story as a very minor background note you will want to look elsewhere. If you want a rich story that will captivate you and surprise you ... this is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly terrible","review":"A tedious, tiresome, terrible book. Mallory is completely unlikeable and I just couldn't find a reason to care less about her. She does not elicit interest, empathy or sympathy. Where did her interest in oliver tree and the WWII murder come from anyway??? The story was bogged by technical details about magic tricks. At one point I found myself wishing that there were explanatory illustrations so I could figure out what was supposed to be happening. The magicians were equally as tedious. By the end I couldn't care less who had killed whom for what reason. My only goal was to just get the thing finished and shelved in a dark, forgotten corner where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Stone Angel, but a great read nonetheless!","review":"I've read the entire Mallory series and, without a doubt, Stone Angel is the best. Still, Shell Game was extremely interesting, the storytelling up to O'Connell's usual standard.

Basically, her strategy seems to be accuse everyone of everything, and eventually someone will confess.Maybe if I had read the earlier books the Mallory character would have made more sense to me, but I don't think that should have been a requirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after reading Judas Child","review":"Like other best seller authors, not enough meat in the book, relying on previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the series as a whole, but this book was AWFUL.","review":"I do love the Mallory series as a whole, and I've read enough mystery series to know that no author can be good every time.But reading this novel was an exercise in dragging my eyes almost against their will across some of the most boring dialogue I have ever had to misfortune to witness.Holy cow...over and over and over these long long looooooong dialogues between these old magicians...WTF? I could seldom figure out what the heck they were even discussing. What was the point??And the descriptions of the magical equipment and set-ups...AUGH!!!Methinks O'Connell loves magic and wanted to work her interest/hobby into a book. But sweet jayzuz, please, don't ever do this to us again.I only kept reading in case there was something crucial to the later plots.And I missed Charles. More Charles! More cowbell, and much more Charles!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book I found hard to pick up","review":"I've read all of the Carol O'Connell books featuring Mallory, etc. Having always had an interest in magic, I thought this would be a great read. \\"Tedious\\" is the word many other reviewers have used and I agree. I really lost interest in how and why Louisa had been killed 60 years before and which of the magicians were guilty then and now for the present murder(s). Thank goodness it was not the first O'Connell book I have read. Not up to the standard of those great books that preceded it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only finished it because I had nothing else to read!","review":"This book really deserves only 1 star but out of respect for the truly wonderful series that suffers a letdown with this book, I give it 2. Doesn't the NYPD have anything better to do with what are purported to be two of its best officers? Did Mallory get a message from outer space nudging her to investigate a World War II death? Like other readers I expected a Mallory who was at least slightly affected by the action in the previous book. But no, she is the same amoral machine we previously encountered. Her supporters have become her apologists and even they are beginning to have doublt about her. Is there a direction to this series or just a series of non connected police stories? Instead of wasting a book on this slight story, why not a short, short story--that's all the plot content allows. I will hope for better from the next Mallory."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW, SLOW, SLOW","review":"I kept thinking the pace would pick up in this book. I was wrong.

If I were not interested in the characters, I may have put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"I have been a fan of O'Connell's and have read and enjoyed most of her books. This one was an unexpected disappointment. Besides the tedious detail of hard-to-picture magicians' illusions, its worst failing was the most basic: making the reader care about the victim and solving the crime. Oliver Tree, the magician who dies performing a dangerous trick, never becomes a character the reader knows or cares about. Mallory's passion to solve the crime (not to mention another magician-murder that happened 50 years ago) is inexplicable. Tree never becomes real and his murder is almost a trifling event surrounded by a bunch of other unlikeable characters. Forget this one; not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I have read all the previous Mallory books and found this one to be very disappointing. Too much unnecessary (and boring) detail about magic props and equipment and not enough attention to the story itself. At several points, interesting activities were abruptly cut off and there was no follow-up later to tell the reader what happened. This was a very slow-moving, plodding book. Not at all what I have come to expect from this author and definitely not up to the quality and interest of the previous books. It was a struggle to wade through it to the finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peice of junk!","review":"How could I put this? I wouldn't spend anymore than $ or MAYBE $ on this peice of junk!

This left me with a little energy to spare but i still got a workout.my daughter is 1.5 months and she fell asleep during the warm up and was content during the rest of the exercises. I sometimes use the warm up routine to get her to sleep when she's fussy instead of walking her. it gets her to sleep faster and allows me to get a little exercise while putting her to sleep.this wouldn't be a good workout for anybody, but it's great for a new mom because you can keep your baby entertained while you workout and you'll still have energy to take care of your little one afterward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potter's Wheel for preteen","review":"Sculpting Wheel- 7\\" Diameter All Metal with Ball Bearings: This wheel is very heavy and sturdy.

Each of the 13 articles generally focuses on an individual legend, and Brunvand thoroughly researches the tales by tracking down numerous versions of the stories and positing how they may have originated. The style is scholarly, but accessible and interesting. His writing is a good introduction to more advanced ways of studying folklore, and the analysis and commentary adds to our understanding of how these stories develop and why they have become part of various communities' cultures. Compilations of ULs do document good stories, but just reading lots of the same old ULs can become a bit boring after a while. This book shows that there are interesting histories to the tales and that understanding these histories and cultural contexts enrich our understanding of folklore in contemporary life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Teaching Story","review":"I have used this tale with many children ages 6 to 12 in schools around the United States. It is a terrific vehicle for asking higher order questions and for teaching thinking and questioning strategies. In Central Asian educational systems, the \\"teaching story\\" is a vehicle for indirectly teaching concepts that are not always possible to get across in more direct, intellectual ways. They also have a deconditioning effect, that is, they prepare the listener or reader so that when faced with difficult circumstances he/she can chose a less automatic, more conscious solution. My students have thoroughly enjoyed this tale and easily understand the concepts that many adults have trouble getting. It's a great discussion starter for helping children understand the differences between irrational and beneficial fears."},{"rating":"2","title":"If A Dolphin Were a Fish","review":"This delightful book thrilled my neighbor's daughter,Kira. I bought it as a birthday gift, but it's such a great book, I had to give it to her now.The story is adorable and the illustrations are beautiful. Kira doesn't notice this, but the thing I like about the book is the educational value. The reader is learning while enjoying the story, as Delfina imagines herself as other sea creatures and how her body would be different.Not only are the illustrations beautiful, but they are funny as well. The way the dolphin's form is combined with other sea creatures is hilarious and surprisingly, graceful. You'll need to check out the sea turtle w/the dolphin head to see how that's possible!Overall, this book is jampacked w/education and entertainment and I highly reccomend it for the children in your life as well as your inner child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turns heads","review":"Got this shirt for my girlfriend, she loves it and wears it when in a mood to get some silly and fun comments.

The producers use computer-generated imagery with great dexterity to restore the Parthenon and Goddess Athena in all their greatness as contemporaries could admire them on the acropolis in the fifth century BCE. As a narrator, Nia Vardalos makes this journey entertaining.

Well, the original recordings weren't the greatest, and the Buzzcocks have a kind of rough sound anyway. I listen to this CD mostly in my car player, and it's fine. On my better home equipment, imperfections are there, but not horrible.The Buzzcocks have another greatest hits album, made in 2001, called \\"Ever Fallen In Love?\\". Maybe it has better sound, but it DOESN'T have better track selection.I like Jay Banerjee's review, and I agree with him that \\"You Know You Can't Help It\\" and a few other Diggle compositions would have been nice. However, I do happen to like \\"Noise Annoys\\" and \\"I Believe\\".Anyway, buy this. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever Heard of Sound Quality","review":"I am by no means a hardcore audiophile who complains of sound quality all the time. I picked this album up without reading reviews because I thought it would be a no-brainer. It had a ton of the songs I loved and some new ones I hadn't heard. Yet, when I popped it into my player, what came out was not the music I remembered. I felt like I was listening to the Buzzcocks play inside a tin shed wrapped in cardboard. Not sure which album you should buy if you love the Buzzcocks, but I am giving mine away and looking for a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT TO GREAT","review":"I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE \\"POWER POP\\".

Each time I use it, I am reminded of just what a disappointment it is and what a crappy cut it gives. After the first year I moth- balled it and bought a 30 year old John Deere to cut my lawn. What a difference. The old Johnny finally died so I'm back to the Yard Machine and it's still the disappointment that I remembered it being. Gotta love the 20 horse engine, but the weak frame flexes so much that it's impossible to get a level cut. The only adjustment I can find is on the left front of the deck and I have it as low as possible. This severely limits deck height adjustments and it still scalps on the right side when making a left turn. Way too much frame flex. I've gone as far as placing a brick on the left side of the deck in an attempt to get a level cut...to no avail.

To say that this becomes tiresome is an understatement, and of course, completely optional for the parent. But what adds insult to injury is that rather than print all of the lyrics, the books simply lists an \\"etc.\\" where the parent is supposed to keep going and going.

Poor Gil.This book has some interesting observations about apple culture, and a couple lessons for tech managers, but it's also full of self-congratulatory prose, with an occasional good dollop of self-pity. It's also written at around a 4th grade level - there were lots of opportunities for deeper analysis of what happened at apple, why Gil's strategies for turning the place around might have worked or might have failed, NeXT vs Be, and how apple changed as an organization. Unfortunately, Amelio and his co-author never delve into the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperate for Approval?...No. Just Seeking extra cash","review":"There's little that can be said about apple that has not been said already, from a darling of the computer industry, the \\"cool\\"computer company, the education market cornerer to abroken hearted corporation without stamina to go on.... Reading trough the lines of this book you realize how commited is the writer to selling you the idea that he was like Julius Caesar surrounded by traitors and not understood by his friends. Rather, he comes across as a uncaring, intelligent person that does not realize on time that he's dealing with human beings, that the money is not going to last forever and that there's a strong reason for adminting your mistakes and that is not to repeat them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gilbert Principle... how not to be a CEO","review":"Pathetic.

I find this book not exciting, and it failed to point out Apple's real issues: market share.How funny that Steve Jobs also fails to bring Apple back. About three years after, the production of Macintosh is still a little higher or lower than 4 million units. Compare it to the world PC production of 100 million+ units, this is poor.Apple's worst days are yet to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be honest to yourself","review":"Amelio, who never caught my attention during his reign at Apple, has done an incredible job. He tells a story very personal and compelling. Reading between the lines, it is impossible to miss the advices for better management and leadership- like it or not. Whether it serves his purpose or not, the book emerges as a manual pulling together a remarkable analysis of power structures that persist in huge corporations. Whoever adores Jobs more than his own wife - don't buy this book. For someone who longs for another perspective, please go figure, for this story might tell the truth - whatever that is.Whether cold facts are told or not, this piece is personal, and self-critical. I find it impossible to accuse someone to be \\"one-sided\\" when presenting his memoirs of the time at Apple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same story, different company","review":"Having been witness to a very similiar situation in a truely capable yet dysfunctional company, I found this book to be the therapy I needed after my departure (escape). Gil seams to give a fair account based on facts that can be backed up rather than emotions. In fact, I am ordering another copy for the \\"Gil\\" I used to work for, I will give my old copy to my old \\"Steve Jobs\\". As a Mac fan,it was truely a hard to read about the myth behind the legend, and the problems that Apple has."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder Amelio only lasted 500 days","review":"Amelio shows why his reign over Apple was a failure. His technical knowledge is shown to be severely lacking with several major gaffes in terminology (megahertz vs megabits) and at the same time, insults his former engineers by saying *they* didn't get it.the book is somewhat interesting if you can get by the pompousness of Amelio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching without practicing","review":"Amelio seems to have a disconnect between his criticisms of Apple's employees and his own actions as CEO. He identifies lack of follow-through as a key problem in Apple's culture, but details numerous occasions when he gave directions (orders?) but did nothing to assure that they were carried out. He discusses his choice of a second-in-command in a very detached fashion, yet one of the key jobs of any CEO is to select and direct competent subordinates. By his own admission, his choice for COO was a disaster, yet Amelio elevated him and left him in place. For a very different approach to turn-around management, readers might want to consider Gordon Bethune's \\"From Worst to First\\". It details a successful turnaround by an executive with both vision and hands-on command of how things actually work in organizations. Amelio seemed to lack both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the issues: it's poorly-written drivel.","review":"There's a lot of debate as to how realistic Amelio's opinions, expectations, and statements are, and I'm sure that many of the reviewers here have fine points. My issue, though, is that the computer community should be embarrassed by this book--not because of the content, but because we can accept this hack job (no pun intended) of a book. I don't think an editor even saw it from across the room: I've never seen a book published by a major house that was this poorly written. It's one trite comment after another. The Shakespeare analogy at the beginning is both pretentious and horrifying, and portends what is a truly terribly-written book. I found it almost unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pathetic piece of whining!","review":"As a former Apple employee who had the misfortune to work at Apple during his ineffectual but mercifully short reign, I can now understand why all his of direct reports that I've met held him in such low esteem after reading this book.If anything, he comes across as a doppleganger opposite of Steve Jobs: bursting with integrity and honesty, but utterly naive, and disconnected from the personal computer industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate, Biased and Self Glorifying","review":"Amelio's spin control is quite amusing and it's ironical how most readers fall for it. Anyone who knows Apple well would be able to see what a onesided, inaccurate and extremly misleading story this is. It's nearly as if the truth doesn't matter in the book and it's sad to see someone who's supposedly done so well in American industry stoop so low. Added to that most of Amelio's \\"successes\\" in the book weren't really his own and unlike Jobs who at least acknowledges the key engineers and Apple folk who really make the succeses Gil prefers to keep all the credit to himself.It's a fast paced, once sided, misleading read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst test book I have seen","review":"This is the worst test book I've seen.

I've tried clamping several things, from copper pipes clamped lightly to solid steel tool bits clamped with maximum force, and no matter how lightly or tightly I clamp things down, the working piece seems to move around in the direction of the openings. The whole thing is painted a glossy orange, including the clamp jaws, so maybe I need to sand that down. It's like the jaws need to be knurled or something to give it grip. Perhaps the intent of this small vise is to use it for delicate items, and the smooth surface helps things from being damaged, but so far I'm using this for tools and other heavy duty things, so I would appreciate some better gripping power.I may edit my review if I decide to sand the jaw faces and they start to grip better, but right now I'm not terribly impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Vise","review":"It's a pretty nice clamp and it does what it is supposed to do.

I wasted ~$35 on these poorly made products, please buy something else with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Lived Product","review":"I have tried with two, guess I'm a slow learner. The first one worked well for three months then scrambled images appeared and it developed a personality of it's own. The second one had it own way from the first like it does not understand AM or PM settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your timer","review":"I purchase two timers and returned one dead on arrival while waiting on the replacement the other timer led stopped functioning, I have returned both timers once and received timers that do not function as they should....these timers are a P.O.S. avoid unless you like spending your own money returning garbage"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to happen with the timer","review":"I bought two woods 59377 timers, not too hard to program but after a few days one of them lost the settings. So I reprogrammed and a few days later it lost the settings again screen would just blink. Sent it back and got a new one now the other one is doing the same thing. Will be sending this one back also. I bought a brinks and it seems to be holding settings.Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I purchased this timer because it had two outlets. The first one I received was faulty, the display did not activate and there was no way to start/set it.The replacement I received after I returned it lasted exactly one day....again, the display went into default mode and I was unable to reset anything.When I unplugged the timer from the outlet I noticed a rattling sound inside, as if something inside had popped (fuse?). There is also a 'dimple' on the side of the unit that I did not notice earlier.Concerned that maybe my outlet was the problem I had my local electrician test it (no problem), then plugged in another timer and have had no problem since.Most likely there is a flaw in the electrical wiring inside the Woods timer.The Woods timer is going back to Amazon - again. This time for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one star due to poor QC","review":"I'm just going to say when I got this item I had to plug it in for a while before the screen would even come on (which was half numbers, and un-readable letters), and like another poster, I had to take it apart to get it to work correctly. I can only give it one star because of this, and seing as I've only had it on for about 12 hours I don't know how well it will work in the long run. Some less mechanically inclined people might not know how to take apart the unit (making it virtually useless), and ruin it (which they should never have to do in the first place..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but is defective","review":"Item was D.O.A. despite that it was sealed in original new packaging and the container was not damaged, and despite that it has a sticker on the back saying \\"Q.C. passed\\" which would mean it \\"passed\\" Quality Control. I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"On-Off Function is Erratic","review":"I've had this unit for over 3 months now. I consider myself reasonably capable of setting up automated devices such as this one, and the instructions seem to be well written and clear. However I have not been able to get the unit to turn lamps on and off according to the program. The lights stay on most of the time, but seem to turn off and on randomly. I've set it aside three times and come back to it later, re-read the instructions, and tried again to program it and get it to work. No luck. I cannot recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Don't waste your time and money on this product. It wouldn't even turn on to activate any timer settings. Either product was defective, or a scam!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Received a dud.","review":"I received this timer and the lcd had a display on it. I put it away for a week and now it won't even work. No lcd display. Battery doesn't \\"charge\\" and it doesn't even turn on. Piece of crap product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, defective","review":"Despite reading the negative reviews of other buyers, I decided to chance it thinking if it worked, I'd be golden. Bad choice, b/c now I have to return it. After plugging it in, I programmed it just fine, and the battery charged up. But then... I plugged it in again, and this time got all the LCD elements lit up and none of the buttons were working. Unplug it, and it seemed to work again, but that's no good, b/c then stuff plugged into it wouldn't work!Worse yet was when I gently rocked it while plugged in and heard the relay clicking on and off. That was the sign that this one was toast.The sad thing is that feature-wise, this is a nice unit; they just need to get their quality control up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think about it!!!","review":"We bought these timers (2) before we left on a trip...when we returned they did not work. They keep time but do not turn on or turn off the lamps attached. Even the manual override switch does not work properly...it gets stuck. We are past the point of being able to return the items but want to warn prospective buyers to avoid these worthless timers."},{"rating":"1","title":"electronic controller quit working","review":"this timer is too complicated to program. after 6 months it stopped timing completely and just left the light on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 2 weeks","review":"This product stopped working after just 2 weeks. Of course, my window to return was closed by then. In no way is it a reasonable expectation for a product to not work after just 2 weeks. There are many other similar products wth the same price point available. I would strongly suggest not buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Tries and NO results","review":"I recieved the original timer and it worked with the manual switch but triped GFI when it tried to turn on the light by timer. It was returned and a replacement was recieved which also did not work. the replacement did not trip the GFI but it did not turn on the light by the timer. It also worked manually. I have returned the second timer and asked for credit to buy something that will work. I should have read the reviews prior to buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"failure within months after purchase","review":"I purchased four of the Woods digital timers. I returned one unit immediately to Amazon and received a credit for the purchase price. I programmed the other three and used them to turn on and off small table lights. Within a year all three of these timers failed. The warranty period is one year.Other digital timers have lasted for years which is what I expected from the Woods considering the price of $17.00 each."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product!","review":"I bought two of these and both have completely failed with in months or days. Woods does not care one bit about the problem. Read all the bad reviews. They just quit working for no reason. Dont trust these one bit with your house!! Why would Woods even sell these is my question??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after only 3 weeks....","review":"Yup, I second everyone else's statements. Don't bother buying this darned thing, it just is not worth your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only work for one year","review":"This product works fine, but only for about one year. After that, it dies. Just like other reviewers say, I see 8888.88 on the screen. It means it is not working anymore.I reprogrammed it. Then it went 8888 again after couple days. Repeat the process.It is not hard to program. Really. But why bother if it works only for one year?I should have read the reviews before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked","review":"Straight out of the box, this timer never worked. I couldn't even set the time, much less program it to do anything. Absolutely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to program, poor life span","review":"As others have stated, the programming is a little tough, the \\"manual\\" button requires a bit of attention to get right. I used this to switch a block heater (12.5 Amps) for a diesel car. It sat in an unheated garage to perform this duty. Failure mode started with loss of display elements, then loss of programming and finally completely unreadable, garbled display. Failure was less than 3 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two worked for 5 months, then they both bust","review":"I bought three of these gadgets in June 2011, and immediately began using two of them. After around five months, one stopped working, and a week later the other one. On both occasions the gadgets were opened and I found that part of the circuit board was darkened, as if burnt. So much for \\"heavy duty\\". All they had been doing was, in two separate houses that run solely on solar energy, turn the refrigerator on in the morning and off at night. And they weren't put to this use all of the five months --only when the days had been cloudy and we doubted there'd be enough electricity in the solar batteries to last the night while the fridge was on. And these are small fridges, more like the minibars in dorms or hotel rooms, that consume less than an amp per hour. I'm really disappointed. The third one is still in storage, I've been wondering whether to use it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed item","review":"I bought two timers,this Timer is very bad set-up and not clear informations,and the woods Timer is clear,easy set-up.I tried to set 2 hours,but not working as i want,just for christmas lamps and tree,don't need for down or dusk??Then i threw it to the trash.I have to bought 2 more WOODS Timers."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great and is reliable","review":"This is my 2nd time buying this item each time I got 2 so I have 4 that work really well. They are very reliable and keep good time. I use these for aquarium lights and co2 solenoids.
