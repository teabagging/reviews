The major plus for this mat is that you can toss it into the washing machine. I'm planning to buy a few extra mats so we can just throw the dirty ones into the laundry. The mat also cleans up well with a sponge. It's also thin enough to take along on trips.

If you want to watch the movie, you HAVE to watch the previews.This might not be such a big deal if you're only watching the movie once, but if you're like most families your kids will watch this movie over and over again.

They either complain that the movie is too mature (it tries too hard to be politically correct, and it is too blatant in its portrayal of violence and racism), or that it is too childish (making a mockery of actual history by portraying it in a cartoon-ish and simplistic manner). So, what is it?The problem is that people already have too many opinions formed about it before they even watch it. People were already protesting 'Pocahontas' before it was even released way back in 1995! Why judge something before you have seen it? If you watch it with an open mind, you will see that Pocahontas is a wonderful movie with a great message, and that the creators took a lot of care into trying to portray Indian culture in a respectful way.

The features on Pocahontas face are really touching, and boy is she cute! The music is fantastic, I particularly enjoy colours of the wind, but also the rousing chorus of savages, when pocahontas runs to save john smith. Alan Menkins score really adds impact to the emotional scenes. The one reason, this disc didn't win full marks wasn't for the quality of the film, but of the disc. The picture was remarkably grainy, the worst I have seen of a disney disc, even Pinocchio from the 1940's was crisper, come on disney !

The villain isn't either cool or horrible, the only good song is the war song, Disney took painful historical inaccuracies with the plot - and talking about plot, what's with the learning each other's language thing in 5 seconds?

The picture looked very grainy, especially when compared to other Disney DVD movies. When viewed on an enhanced widescreen TV, there was a lot of shadowing.

One, of course, the obvious \\"Disney\\" songs, which get better or worse depending on the movie. Colors of the Wind is the best Disney song to date. Also the pop song If I Never Knew You blew me away. And two, the underlying soundtrack perfomed by Alan Menken.

A bit depressing in it honesty of hate and love, this movie shows that animated movies can convey more emotions than just laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD quality poor","review":"This is one of Disney's best animated films, but the DVD does not do our favorite little Native American any justice.

As for the sound, it's an OK Dolby 5.1 mix...the songs and score are wonderful. But what took me aback from this movie when I saw it in the theater was the glorious animation. The DVD has ruined this aspect of the film and Disney really needs to hurry up and re-release a newly transferred version (I've heard rumors that the Mouse House does have a new 2-disc SE of Pocahontas ready to go...when they decide to release it, who knows.)If you want to buy this disc, I would strongly recommend waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the sentient tree will show them the way.","review":"We rank this 34 out of 41 Disney animated movies that we own.

Other themes include overcomming obsticles and \\"cant we all just live toghether in peace!\\" The animation is good, but the music is hardly memerable and even though the story is good, it is GROSLY different from the true story (changed to make it rated G)Bottom line, if you collect disney animation or you have kids, this belongs in your library. But it's not a movie young boys (or older) will enjoy too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another substandard Disney effort","review":"I was so disappointed in this film. The animation is lovely, as always, but the ending was disappointing and the music was definitely mediocre. If you're gonna make an entirely fictitious film about a real life historical character, would it hurt to have a happy ending? Instead, John Smith goes back to England alone. What a bummer. Rent, don't buy, this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poca Haunts Us","review":"Disney was on a roll: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Alladin, and the Lion King. After The Lion King, it appeared Disney could do no wrong. Well, Pocahontas dispelled that myth. While this 10th anniversary edition was carefully put together, it does not hide the fact that at its core is a severely flawed and uninspired movie. The movie's slow pace makes it somewhat difficult to watch despite the brilliant colors and awesome sound. Disney fans are used to action and adventure appearing at expected and unexpected moments. And there's always a love story somehwere. Pocahontas, however, is almost devoid of any action and really does not have a love story. For that matter, there isn't much of any kind of story. I am sure that Pocahontas, a legendary figure in our history, deserved a much better treatment that this hauntingly weak Disney dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not realistic","review":"This film couldn't have been any less realistic. Not only does it take an event in history and insult the hell out of it, but it makes it into a film with horrible songs. Not that I don't like musicals, cause I do, but the fact is the songs are weak in every possible area.Pocahontas, a young beautiful indian princess (who, in reality was about 12, and really ugly at that) falls in love with Captain John Smith. From that point on, it's a total WEST SIDE STORY cheap imitation. Of course, there's the climactic scene in which Pocahontas \\"saves\\" Smith's life, although historians now believe that may have been part of a Native American ritual.This film is Diseny's apology for all those Native American stereotypes, in which all indians dance around like schmucks and say things like \\"How, White Man!\\" The film is based on all those myths that grade-schoolers are taught to believe. Nice try, Dis, but you should really know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre and potential to teach racist language","review":"The songs and story line were a dud, not very interesting. Or perhaps it was just the racist language on both sides that distracted me. \\"Savage\\" \\"White man\\" \\"injun\\" \\"demon.\\" My daughter is only four and so didn't seem to pick up on it, but an elementary-schooler might pick up on some of the language. And it didn't help that Mel Gibson, who can't sing, is the male lead and is known to have some racist views in real life. Finally, Disney was unable to keep any deaths off camera and implied and so it was the first Disney movie which she asked what happened to this or that character (who was killed).Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is one of my favorite Disney movies, although I'd wager a lot of people consider this to be one of the worst Disney movies. The use of color and song in this movie are key. It's a romanticized version of the historical Pocahontas, but it's still a fun and engaging story with highs and lows."},{"rating":"2","title":"VHS movie","review":"I purchased it for my grand daughter, aged 5. I thought I was ordering a DVD, but it came as a VHS. It's OK, she doesn't know the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad picture quality","review":"What's up with all the grain on the picture? Even my VHS copy has clearer picture quality. This DVD must have been rushed because it's obvious Disney did not put in their best efforts on this film.On the other side of things, this is one of the last Disney movies that held the style and class of other films such as \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Beauty And The Beast.\\" The songs are beautiful and timeless. The animation is spectacular. This is a wonderful movie, despite it's history is FAR from accurate. I'd give this DVD 5 stars if it wasn't for the inexcusable poor picture quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad online streaming","review":"I tried several times to play this movie and it never did. I never got a chance to watch it because my online streaming expired before I could ever get it to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"pocahontas dvd review","review":"the dvd was excellent - i purchased it because the animation was as good or equal to beauty and the beast and the music was written by the same composer and lyricist"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"I rented this movie for my two year old to watch she still has short attention so it was nice to have it rented just in case she didnt like it, she watched half of it the first day and the other half the next day but she loved it so we may end up buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwrenching","review":"I absolutely love this movie but the end makes me want to cry. I kept hoping she would jump off that cliff and swim to the ship to be with John. I know Pocahontas never had a romantic relationship with John Smith but they belonged together in this film. Since when does Disney care about historical accuracy? They've changed plenty of movies adapted from historic events or books to appeal to children. Nevertheless, this remains one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pocahontas","review":"I really love this movie. First of all, nobody should be getting their pants in a bundle just because the movie does not exactly follow what \\"actually\\" happened in history. You have to remember that this movie was ultimately made for children and it does give them enough info to realize what is happening in the story. The animation is good, and the facial features are wonderful. But, I would have to say that my favorite thing about that movie is the music. The rest of the movie is great, but the music is magnificant. The song \\"Colors of the Wind\\" is one of the greatest songs. I also think that there is plenty of humor in the movie( most of it from grandmother willow). I would really recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like a recording off of video","review":"This DVD looks like it has been recorded off of video. The images are not crisp and motion has interesting color changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pocahontas","review":"This movie was purchased from seller: moviesonsale1, and would not even play half way through. The seller of this product placed information in the evelope with the movie saying that if any negative feedback was received they would no longer be able to help you. They also gave a false phone number as a point of contact. I would never purchase anything from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Sexist and Somewhat Racist","review":"I would not suggest allowing children to watch this film unless you are completely comfortable with perpetuating sexist and racist stereotypes. Annoyed by depictions of female being \\"saved\\" by male counterparts, and glowing depictions of \\"life being perfect\\" for Natives prior to arrival of whites is a bit of a stretch. This film perpetuates several misconceptions about Native Americans, which are incredibly unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"I really expected more but it was good enough.Your money is really good used in it.The movie is amazing and a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie","review":"Okay, I can see where some of you guys got affended from the racism in this movie, but that doesn't take from how much fun this movie is. I am Native-American and it didn't bother me, I loved the singing and my children loved the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best from Disney...","review":"i believe this cartoon to be much more in depth to real-life circumstances than other ones (ie., the little mermaid, etc.). it is very deep where racial tensions are exemplified and the conclusion of the story is no less than dramatic and beautiful! the music in the story is also more than wonderful to the ears and mind. this movie is one of the only cartoons an ADULT can relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney could have done a much better job.","review":"I actually wanted to give this one star, but my sentimental attachment to all things Disney forced me to throw in a bonus point.I know it's for kids. I know it's for entertainment's sake. But....There is so much that is of value in the truth. I don't know why the actual story had to be turned into this PC mish-mash. Disney's adult fans will not be amused. If it's for the kid's sake, please just rent it or borrow it from the library. And, while you're at the library, be sure to pick up some of the wonderful books for kids and teens that tell the facts in just as exciting a manner.If you really want to excite your children about history, take them to Jamestown and Colonial Williamsburg, where history really does come to life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Tarzan Instead","review":"This poking, plodding snoozer barely rates two stars. The songs are dreary and poorly rendered, and the plot is almost nonexistent. Everybody in America knows the Pocahontas legend and can state it in a paragraph; Disney fluffs it into 80 minutes of wooden characters and lousy songs. This movie has none of the zip of Alladin or Hercules, and none of the charm of The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast. Unless you want to collect all the Disney animated shows, take a pass on this one and spend your money on Tarzan instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nose dive for Disney","review":"Now just listen to me here. Imagine the disney movie life as pryimid. First we had Beauty and the Beast, then we had Aladdin, then the Lion King shot the Disney movie quality to the top of the pyrmid. Then came Pocahontas.And Disney took a nose dive.Making the classic tale of Pocahontas into a movie may have sounded like a good idea. But with all the crazy historical innacuricies you need to wonder what story it was actually based on. I'm sure by now you all know what really happened in the end. And John Smith's version of the tale was an exageration from the beginning (I have a friend that's related to our herione I know!) I do give it 2 stars for the music though, that was pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am sorry I can't review the item since I can not see it at all.

I do not recommend it to any one much less any one under 8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for children","review":"Disney's fictionalized love story between the 12 year old Pocahontas and the 27 year old John Smith can only leave us praying that this didnt happen in real life. (Pocahantas married John Rolfe when she was 19 and had a child, which is, of course, left out of this movie).Even if you get passed the blatant pedophilia overtones, the movie is still filled with bland musical numbers, and boring dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Fave Disney Movie","review":"As a child i really enjoyed this movie and love watching it with my nieces.

That is good for the main reason of not having to replace it, because the movie will always be in your video library (unless something should happen like Amazon going out of business or something, but I don't anticipate that to happen anytime soon). You don't have to worry about the disc getting scratched, or worried about it getting lost or whatever. The bad thing about streaming movies is that you only get the movie with no options. I can't get subtitles, and there's none of the extra stuff that you get when you buy the disc. All you get with streaming is the movie itself, which I suppose is fine, but not if you're interested in the extra bonus materials. I gave it four stars for the movie itself, but took off a point because Amazon should be able to put the full content options that the DVD/BluRay has. It is 2013 you know! I'm sure they could."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Disney Movie","review":"I love the songs, characters, and plot in this movie. While some historical aspects are not true, this is a children's movie and I thought Disney went about setting it up quite well. The artwork in this movie is amazing as well. It's a movie that I could watch over and over, and I am certainly saving this one for when I have children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good French version","review":"I bought this version because it had the French language version, and I want my kid to watch Disney in French since we live in the US and he is not exposed to enough French. I was looking forward to hearing the voices and the songs I had liked so much. For each and every Disney movie from that collection that I have bought, none of them has the original French we had back in France. The voices are different and the song lyrics are too!

Compiled with no notes, no glossary, no thought or imagination. Only contains some of Burns' letters containing some of his poetry. Worthless without context.

If they had not spent so much time repeating the same three things, this book would be only half as long as it is.

If you're trying to sell me a Cadillac, don't give me a Yugo after I've paid you. This book (the hardbound edition) is probably pretty cool as a coffee table piece, but otherwise not worth the price (see comments 1&3)3. All of the useful information in this book is also in a Youtube video by these same people.All that being said this is a really nice if a bit expensive sales brochure.

Master P (born Creola McMorikawa) has in this, his sophomore effort, recreated in toto the semblance of a long-departed Orlando Gibbons as processed through the sensibilities of a young Hawley Crippen. Gone are all the old supportive devices, the balalaikan propensities, the Krespin-like glissandi, the intercrural obsessions. Now, in their place, Creola has substituted stalking-horse platitudes of a most Pantagruelian nature, striated with the merest Aristarchian tenebrae. What was once just a tentative progenda is now a full-blown sepsis overlaid with Reichian polemical recusations. Such proclivities were formerly jejune, but in this context they are downright crepuscular. Only a genius could have carried it off.

Just try and compare this album to something like 'Tha DoggFather' or 'The Slim Shady LP' and you'll see how bad this album really is.

If I were you, I would start listening to Green Day, and Smashing pumpkins. Now that is music.

There were a lot of problems with this album: (1) a double album, which was the style of 1998, with only two good songs on it (\\"Hot Boys & Girls\\", \\"Solders, Riders & G's\\"), (2) No Limit Records were putting out albums faster than Mickey D's serves burgers and with the usual guest stars on this album (virtually the whole No Limit roster) on every single song, you couldn't tell the difference between this album and, say, a Skull Duggery album. (3) is that Master P was starting to sound too much like 2Pac (like most rappers around that time). For Master P's good stuff, check out Ghetto D, 99 Ways to Die, Ice Cream Man or TRU's True or Tru to Da Game."},{"rating":"1","title":"P is in it for the fuccin money","review":"He puts out new cd's and videos just to boost his image, this CD is garbage, and it's worthless.

This book is a great depiction of the sheer sacrifice of him and his family at the time. this book tells how Adams was far more involved as (1) of our founding fathers than he was ever given credit. As to his analyzing his own faults, this quality proves to be endearing & proves his great character and integrity and love/pride of this great country. Great read !!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Discursive amblings on how cantankerous Adams was","review":"Here we have a fugue on what a contrary figuer John Adams was. It is not a chronological narrative of his life--those who may want that must look elsewhere. It is a survey of his ideas beginning, often returning (too often), at his packing to leave Washington after losing his bid for a second term. The ideas explored are not systematically arranged, nor are they looked into with much depth. It tells us how much Adams just did not get along with folks, again, and again-- I can't recommend this book, especially to those of us that like a good biographic narrative, nor to those who like extensive and linearly arranged expositions of a famous thinkers thought. I must say how surprised I am at the high ratings given by many reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author invented his Vietnam war experience,Why?","review":"The book seemed OK , until I discovered that Mr. Ellis had invented his experience as a Vietnam Vet . If somebody does this, what's the value of the book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting, though somewhat limited look at Adams","review":"Ellis' fine work demonstrates that, unlike Jefferson, John Adams' vision of government still has much to teach us today. While Adams was blessed with a long and productive life, the author's focus on his retirement years deprives us of some insights and perspective on Adams' presidency and his days as an ambivalent leader of the revolutionary movement.I would recommend this book highly; however, if you are only going to read one book on Adams, read John Ferlings' biography, which is broader in scope and just as well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for seven year olds","review":"My son loves this book.

He loves any books of transportion; planes, trains, and cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking Interplay","review":"This is an album of three incredible musicians at the height of their powers in a live setting. Lane's playing is almost beyond description. From clean comping to incendiary hyper-speed runs, Lane covers it all with conviction, emotion and breathtaking virtuosity. Hellborg's bass sound warm but packs plenty of punch as well. Hellborg is an amazing bassist who has a certain style that is very endearing. Sipe's drumming is solid without gettng too busy, which is helpful when you've got Lane and Hellborg going nuts in certain spots. There are plenty of dynamics and lovely melodic interludes along with the fiery playing. For fans of power trio interplay along the lines of classic Cream, Hendrix Experience, etc. this is as good as it gets. This defines the state-of-the-art for power trio improvisation. Nuff said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An upset hardcore fan of The Boss","review":"I bought this book all ready to be able to sit down with my harmonica and piano and bust out Thunder Road. The piano music doesn't follow Bruce Springsteen's piano at all. It was really upsetting. Instead they throw in the vocal melody in with the piano music. So all those people who love to sing along with Bruce don't need to because it's in the piano all ready. Other songs leave out important musical parts to include the vocal melody in the transcription. I want to know if there's anywhere you can buy the real note for note transcriptions. Honestly, I would have rather saved my money and spent my time figuring out the songs myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR GUITAR PLAYERS","review":"Why are so many of you complaining about the piano parts being wrong in this book?

And he's in superb company. Bassist Leroy Vinnegar may have had his technical limitations, but few players on his instrument ever filled the sonic space of the bass with such unerring taste and unshakable swing. And drummer Stan Levey is a West Coast jazz legend, showing a different side to his personality by playing brushes mostly on this date, and even some bells on a rollicking, danceable \\"Jericho\\". A fine piano trio date that, unjustifiably, languished in Contemporary Records' vaults for 29 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything You Could Want in a Romance...Except Anchovies!","review":"Quinby Parker has a way with pizza and with jobs...lots and lots of jobs.

But it's not just hotel, road-warrior gaming. Office, all of my six-sigma stuff, just painfully slow. Oh and Sony won't even begin to talk to you about downgrading to XP. There have been any number of times where the machine just seems to lock up, a few times where the entire explorer session (files and all) go away. I'm certain this would be a great XP machine, but have no idea how to do it. Sigh.

From day one the battery was problematic. Sent in for service and it came back with a note \\"works to spec for specified user mode\\" - translation the battery lasts 1.5 hours in normal mode. This is a brick that needs a AC adapter all the time. Also the mouse on the computer is horrible - have a Thinkpad from work and the mouse is 100x better. The only thing worse then the product is their customer service. My battery died at 14 months - guess what: the $400 warranty that I got stiffed for from Sony does not cover it. The single most defective part of their computer is not covered. BTW if you login into their site they dont have any history of purchases.

After one year, two keys fell off the keyboard. $89 for a new one. The battery had to be replaced before the year was up. It crashes all the time. The wireless connection is constantly interrupted, and there are numerous other little annoyances. But here is my biggest gripe: the computer just came back from repair. They were not able to save any of the software, including Microsoft Word, and now I've lost all the factory installed software. Because there is no serial number, because the software was installed at the factory, I cannot replace this, unless... I buy it. Now For 1,200 (the price when I purchased this junk) one would think Sony could afford to send a Repair Disc, and a CD with the standard software they installed at the factory.

There were proper villians with uniforms and armies, and a wall to seperate our world from theirs. This story pays homage to the great titans of the realist spy fiction genre: John Le Carre, Len Deighton and the like. Rucka's writing reaches and surpasses the high mark set by the regular Queen & Country series. The tension of the chase scenes is masterfully constructed. Brian Hurtt's artwork in this collection is less heavily inked than in his contribution to the regular series, \\"Operation: Morningstar\\", and this creates cleaner lines and better showcases his artistic detail. An exciting, emotional story that hits all the right notes, this collection is a must-have for spy fiction fans of any medium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crockett Rock","review":"I have been warming up to the Q&C series, but this one made me a fan. I loved the first collection, went lukewarm on Morningstar, hated the art in Crystal Ball (liked the story though), and really liked Blackwall (the first collection to give the reader a real sense of Tara Chace's dedication to the job and friends and what it takes to protect both). Declassified features the return of Brian Hurtt from the Morningstar arc. The inking is less heavy-handed here than that storyline and the story, already a very tense thriller, sparkles because of it. I won't divulge what happens as Crockett travels to communist Europe as a Minder, but a lot happens!

We gave him a bath, then sprayed it on as directed, and he immediately stopped licking the areas. He made it through the whole night without licking, and today the area has gone from a bright inflamed red to a very pale pink that you cannot see unless you're close to him.

Sometimes the Frontline doesn't work as well as we hoped, so this one and the Caspar oral tablet serve as our back up. The odor is not bad but slightly irritated to the eyes--kind of like mint and eucalyptus spray. So it's necessary to cover your dog's eyes when applying.

The disappointment put my little guy in tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive product, poor quality!","review":"Really expensive for a poor quality costume. The belt is HUGE, made of a sticky rubber-like material, and poorly manufactured (pieces falling apart before use).

The costume fit well but then I went to put the belt on my son and it was HUGE! So big the belt falls to the floor. You can't adjust it, there's only some fixed velcro to hold it on.I emailed the vendor asking if maybe a large size belt got in with the small costume and he said no, it was the same size belt for all sizes of costume!Otherwise, I'm happy with the costume in all other ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely unsatisfying","review":"I understand this is a child's costume, but as an adult making choices on behalf of our children, the item you receive should actually look like the costume. We received what we ordered, and even the product picture on the packaging looked nice..... but the actual costume was all one color - brown. There is no black like you see in the preview. It really looks awful.The belt is ridiculous. I wear size 36\\" pants and I can wear the belt provided. We would have to cut up the belt and add Velcro tape to fix this for my son. I think everyone understand that not everything is going to fit perfectly but this is just a different story.My son actually wanted to look like Anakin for Halloween and not some kid with layered brown polyester tunic. I would advise to look elsewhere for Halloween."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute costume","review":"My 6 year old son is a HUGE Star Wars fan and loves this costume.

The Amazon description says 6-8 year olds, but when the costume actually arrived, the packaging indicated it was for 3-4 year olds. This is completely confusing as the sizing says 4-6. It was way too small for my 5 year old son, who is average height and on the slim side.For almost $30, the fabric is very flimsy and the belt looks nothing like the photo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The belt broke as soon as my son put it on.

The only book that addresses this approach in a completely comprehensive way, challenging business leaders to rethink their approach to strategy and change.

I will read it again with my highlighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never discusses history","review":"This book never covers the importance of an individual's history. Are you predisposed to this? Did you cheat in previous relationships? Did you feel that you could always have everything? and what about the out-bursts? He says to refrain from angry out-burst, they are Love Busters. They are necessary! The betrayed spouse needs to get this stuff of his/her chest. His/her life has just been shattered into a million pieces I was very disappointed. Dr. Harley's job is to get people back together, no matter what. I would not recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent insight into how affairs occur and how to survive.","review":"I've read several books on surviving the pain and confusion of an affair and Dr. Harley's book clearly stands out.If you or someone you know is suffering from the effects of an affair, I highly encourage you to get this book for them.This book helped my wife and I significantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is helping me and my husband.","review":"I didn't think it was possible for me to ever begin to trust my husband again, and then I read this book. This book illustrates that by commiting to and applying some common-sense rules, there is hope for relationship repair and even growth. The examples used from the author's experience and practice are amazing, and served to keep me engaged and reading through to the practical part. I found many ideas helpful, especially the concept that men and women, although they will list similar top 10 needs, usually pick a different top 5. This book makes sense and helps you to pick up and actually do something for yourself and for your relationship in the face of the overwhelming emotions you experience when your spouse has an affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is ok. I don't recommend it.","review":"Harley has a firm stance on making marriages last at all costs. Sometimes the memories can be so haunting that it may be best to move on. There are several points in the book where he tells one member of the couple what to do. This is in opposition to most (individual) counseling sessions where self exploration is key, and where the client ultimately determines what they should do. I think there are some good points in the book, and it's a quick simple read. I also don't particularly like that his theories are not backed by research. It seems like he is pulling the four rules to marital recovery out of thin air just because they may sound like they work. I recently purchased His Needs, Her needs by Harley to get a better understanding of his style but after reading this book I'm not looking forward to reading that one. Overall this book is 2 stars and I would recommend it. I hope to find better books on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed in this book","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It inappropriately places blame for an affair on the wounded spouse. While it is true that both spouses bear the blame for a marriage that is vulnerable to an affair, only the spouse who choses to be unfaithful bears the blame for the affair. I found this book to be very incomplete regarding good advice for dealing with the very real physiological, emotional, and mental effects of the discovery of an affair. It seemed to be more focused on making the unfaithful spouse feel comfortable than on dealing with the issues that must be dealt with to salvage and rebuild a marriage. I think there are more helpful books on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story of John and Sue","review":"First I want to say the writers of the book are very knowledgable about the subject of adultery. However, my big issue with this book is that it follows mostly 1 couple's affair (another one is talked about) THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE BOOK. Both give examples of an extremely difficult situation to over come, the other not so difficult. This is a good contrast I guess, but for me, my wayward spouses affair/situation was right in the middle. A few things I read made me feel as though it would be impossible to get past my own husband's affair. I do think it has some good tools to use, meaning having all your \\"love banks\\" filled. With that said, there were times I just couldn't wrap my brain around getting over the affair then having to do all this work? It is probably best if one reads this book when away from the situation and a little more over the affair. But for me, I got very tired of reading over and over about \\"John and Sue's\\" situation....continually throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIME TO HEAL","review":"This is a great book to read for married couples that want to stay together after an affair. My husband who had an intimacy issue said he learned more about relationships from this one book than he did in his entire life.I learned alot also, especially about Love Busters (my main problem). I recommend this to anyone trying to deal with the pain of an affair. I also recommend his other books for those in a marriage or serious relationship that want to prevent this kind of pain.My husband and I are planning our future and loving each other. He is now the type of husband I always dreamed he could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"question","review":"Sorry, this is not a review. I'm looking for a book that helps with dealing with an affair AFTER you've been dumped, divorced, whatever. It seems as though most books that cover affairs deal with working on the future of the relationship, not with betrayed people trying to put their lives together after being cheated on and left for the other person. There's divorce books, and affair books, but is their a book that covers both?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for the cheated-on spouse","review":"This book uses an extremely arrogant affair as the scenario to base its assumptions and rebuilding on. It places too much blame/stress on the spouse that wasn't cheating to heal the relationship and doesn't let the hurt spouse acknowledge his/her feelings. (In this scenario, it's the wife that did the cheating and will not/does not want to end the affair.) In addition, it uses trite phrases such as \\"Love Busters\\" in order to rebuild the relationship. I do not recommend this book unless you are in the same scenario as this couple. I have found other books to be more instructive for both parties involved that present more realistic and varied scenarios to base advice on."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget personal trainer","review":"First off I have to say that I have used exam cram to pass my last 3 exams so I know that they are very useful.The problem I have is not with the book but with the personal trainer part which to me seems like nothing more than an electronic version of everything that is in the book.It goes chapter to chapter along with the book ,The only thing good about it was the test questions.They should have offered the book with a disk of tests not with the same thing I just read."},{"rating":"2","title":"widerruf","review":"meine erste besprechung von \\"mr bewley in berlin\\" sollte nur das interesse an dieser ausgezeichneten lektüre wecken. skandal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This monitor was terrible!

My husband even yelled into it from another room and I could not hear him on the monitor. The automatic feature really does not work.

DON'T BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Great concept but really bad design/engineering. Sensitivity wasn't great (baby has to really scream to get it to turn on by itself) and I agree with everyone else that the sound quality sucked - would often hear him crying through the door when the monitor wouldn't pick up a peep (even with sensitivity turned way up). But that was acceptable with the first one we because of the light show and music. My son absolutely loooves the light show on the ceiling! But then that quit working after 5 months. Changed the bulb, took it apart - projector just would not turn on any more. So we exchanged it for a replacement (no problem at Babys R Us) which the light show again just suddenly quit working. This time only after 1 month. I think we'll take it back and get a monitor only and some other light/music thing for the crib.Also - the turning on of the music & projector was a pain - have to constantly flip each off/on; off/on - probably what causes it to quit working. The switch wears out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice","review":"Our son loves the lights and music, but the monitor is not a good product. It has static feedback on both channels at any volume level and the noise activation system does not work unless you stand over it and shout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not recommended","review":"The main reason we liked this monitor was for the light show.

Definitely not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too musch noise!","review":"My husband and I bought this monitor because it was the cutest one, and matched our aquarium set that we bought. We really liked the projection and light show. We figured a monitor was a monitor and it didn't matter what type. We were wrong. We tested it out and it was fine in the baby's bedroom, no noise and it picked up the baby's noise. However on our end, it was a constant buzz that never went away. So when we were sleeping it was very irritating to have a constant buzzing in your bedroom all night long. I would not purchase this monitor again."},{"rating":"1","title":"light show ended at 8 months...","review":"We never used it as a monitor because the reception was awful. However, the light show and music was great! Until it stopped at 8 months. I called FP and they are sending a lightbulb replacement as a curtesy, Whoopie...they only last approx. 15 hours. Not worth taking it apart constantly to replace the bulb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Projector died twice within a year!!!","review":"We got this monitor for a shower gift and thought it was the best thing with the projection of the fish on the ceiling. After only having it a couple months the projecter died on us. We exchanged it for a new one, now about a year later the same thing happened again. I am very dissapointed in it! My daughter who is almost a year loved watching the fish swim and now all she can hear is the noise and looks all over for the fish. The monitor also had a big interference problem, whenever the heat kicked on, there would be soo much static and noise I had to turn it all the way down. It was terrible! I do not recommend this monitor at all to anyone!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst monitor ever.","review":"This monitor was a gift when my daughter was born and I am so glad that I did not waste my own money on it.

We are currently looking for a new system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as advertised!","review":"This monitor is horrible and a waste of money. We wanted it, despite the fact we had another monitor, because it matched our theme and we had all the Ocean Wonders Items. We have never been able to hear our child over the monitor, regardless of how close the monitor is to him. You can not even hear the music that the monitor plays. The sound activated feature has never worked. We use it, but we have to start it ourselves and use another monitor to hear our baby. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this monitor based on all the information that I read about it. The music and pictures don't turn on when he cries. We have the volume turned all the way up and the only way you can hear him is if you have the receiver pressed to your ear. We tried everything the instructions said and nothing worked!!! I was really impressed with all of the other Fisher Price Ocean Wonders items that we registered for except for this monitor. I would not recommend this product to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy mama","review":"This was a gift, so I now have no box. I was excited as I thought the automatic sensor would give my baby viewing pleasure. The sensor dosent even work, not even with me yelling at it. I cant believe FP. Dosent recall this product.

The light show is pretty cool, but it only stays on for ten minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but a huge waste of time and money.","review":"I bought this for my 6th child thinking what a great idea, something that will respond to the baby crying and allow me to hear at the same time. What a joke I have only had it for about 5 weeks and the light show died after 3 weeks, it would shine but not turn now the bulb is dead as well. Good old customer support says you must have the monitor in hand in order to troubleshoot the problem. Just what I have time for standing around holding the monitor while juggling an infant and dealing with a 2,4 and 6 year old. Don't bother with this product Great concept but a huge waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORIBLE","review":"The light show is cute, but too bright! not a good idea when you're trying to get your baby to sleep.

Not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Even though I had read poor reviews of this monitor, I was determined to buy it since it matched my theme. I figured that my experience would be different. Unfortunately, it wasn't! If you love listening to FUZZ, then this is the monitor for you! It's actually hard to hear what my baby is doing over the fuzz! If I could do it all over again, I'd listen to the reviews & buy one that was proven to work well for my baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!!!!","review":"I wanted this monitor because of the fact that it said it was sound activated. When my baby cries the music is suppose to start and the light show is supposed to turn on. I put it to the test before I put my baby in the crib. I stood at the location of the crib and made a few noises.........it didn't activate it. I stood closer to it and made some more noises and it still didn't work. I have yet to see this function work on our monitor. I don't have the other problems as far as not hearing our baby in the monitor. The sounds are not clear, but I can hear her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about absolute worthless piece of electronics","review":"I can't believe how this monitor ever made it to the market. OK. It's got an interesting idea - but work on the basic stuff first: the radio communication between transmitter and receiver. The baby sees pretty lights and mom and dad hear loud, indiscernible static. Baby could be choking in his sleep, but mom and dad would be happily listening to static. What a joke. We got this as a gift, and it's on it's way back. Leaving the doors open to the baby's nursery would work better than hooking up this monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This monitor is horrible!","review":"I am incredibly disappointed in this monitor. The only good thing about this monitor is the light show. The reception on the receiver is horrible. We can't hear our baby unless he's screaming and even then its hard to hear. Plus all we hear is static. It doesn't matter what channel its on or where its positioned in the house, static is the only thing that comes through! I would not recommend this monitor to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was disappointed to find that this name brand item was such a dud. I COULD NOT HEAR MY BABY, which defeats the purpose of a monitor. I didn't have any bulb or battery problems, as others did. Every time my baby cried, the monitor did not go on, which is one of the features I was seriously looking foward to. The only nice feature is the pretty fish projection and sounds. Since I already threw out the box, I cannot return it, so I will use the projector feature. along with purchasing another monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE light show BAD reception","review":"Nice light show but awful reception!! Can't hear baby crying full lungs unless I'm standing right next to the monitor, which doesn't help if you have a noisy house already!

Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Buying","review":"I bought this thinking I could tackle 2 things at once (the light show and a monitor). I was wrong.

I do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot HEAR baby!!!","review":"I bought this thinking that I did not really need a powerful monitor for my SMALL apartment.

It looks nothing like what is represented on the box and is completely fuzzy looking! I wish I could replace the bulb again on our moon and stars monitor but the screws are stripped.

Our monitor does NOT work under any circumstances, even after reading the manual and having all the handy people in our family try to make it work. A friend of ours gave us a Sony that works AWESOME! So I don't think it's user error. We should send the unit back but I can't be bothered -- our solution is just not to buy anything with the Fisher Price logo in the future. To those of you who bought one of these that works, congratulations, one must have escaped working from the factory :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on it.","review":"I was given this monitor as a gift. I think it may have been defective besides the fact that it didn't work very well. First off, it's supposed to turn itself on when baby makes a noise. Even with me talking at full volume in the room it never turned itself on. Also, the static was horrible. I could kinda hear my son babbling in the background, but if I had been trying to sleep instead of answering emails, then forget it. But the music it has was nice, and the lightshow could be good at night. It didn't attract my son's attention during the day.So I returned it, and I'll be buying something with a better rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for Improvement","review":"I unlike some other parents don't have a problem hearing the baby, although I do get the static.

So when ur baby cries IF THE LIGHT SHOW CAME ON!! That would be all you could hear!! But being we have a small house I could have lived with that! BUT!! YOU HAVE TO SCREAM TO GET THE LIGHT SHOW/MUSIC TO COME ON EVEN ON SENSITIVE!! I recomend the Evenflo Whisper Connect for a monitor (i could hear her breath if i turned it up!!)

The African elements are overshadowed by slick Western production values and a relentless desire to please. The lyrics are pretentious and self-indulgent; the music so \\"soothing\\" that I wanted to throw it out the window. What is this supposed to be? Music for the Lite-FM crowd? Background filler for the dentist's office? A Disneyland version of Africa?

Hellborg is one of the best and most original bass players of this era. On this album he plays with G. Velez, percussionist and overtone singer. The album and track titles may sound rather bombastic (or meaningless) for the non-inititated eye, while after a decent listening you certainly get the point. One would hardly think that a duet of a single percussion and a bass can give such an ease of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard rocks of pork","review":"This wasn't crackli'n it was more like Rockli'n.

It gives your body the slight push it needs to fall asleep when you're having trouble. I like the sublingual tablets because they seem to work faster than the traditional pills you swallow and they have a pleasant orange flavor. My only gripe is that they don't dissolve as easily as other sublingual tablets I've taken. These require you to move them around under your tongue to get them to dissolve. Others I've taken dissolve quicker without manipulation under your tongue. Still, this won't stop me from buying these again. They do what they're supposed to and the price is very reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omega constellation Watch","review":"I am very dissapointed with the product.

Find a better version.","review":"I was incredibly excited to finally get a copy of this book, and started reading it as soon as it arrived.The problem I have with this book is not in content, but in spelling... There are SO MANY misspelled words.The publisher is someone called Really Simple Media and supposedly has reprinted the original book exactly as it was by Mr Hopkins. To me, it appears they scanned the original work and did OCR, because some words don't even make sense in the sentence.The current publisher of this book must have changed something. I find it unbelievable that a person in the ad business would so carelessly edit a work with his own name on the cover, and even more unbelievable that generations of advertisers would recommend this book to their colleagues.There are other reviewers who make the same observation in their reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ideas and a Joy to Read","review":"I found this book to be very informative and was worth the time and money. I found many ideas which will allow me to continually improve upon my electronic and print marketing campaigns.Others have said that the book is written horribly and the publishers should be embarrassed - I disagree. Granted, there are a few grammar errors - but the book is written in early 20th century and much of the language, speech and mannerisms of the time come through in the writing. I found this style entertaining and easy to read.The book also refers to many of the social norms of this era such as discussing only \\"men\\" in business. If there happened to be a successful business-women - she was only able to accomplish this with the help of men. Again, I think does not take away from the content of the book, rather augments the principles since they are time honored and are able to survive the tests of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best!!","review":"This book change our perspective about our business strategies.

The publishers (really simple media) are obviously just a bunch of amateurs taking advantage of the fact that this masterpiece is in the public domain.Spend your hard-earned cash on a decent used copy of Scientific Advertising instead of buying this unprofessional edition...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding work.

That's right, that means that there is no new material to be found here. I also wonder if all the rights for these recordings were arranged.The brief Lenny snippets don't often even go with the essay being read, and the whole pile of slop has some attempted important-sounding synth music added in.It is not a fun listen. I do not recommend it, except for completists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Previous reviewer had skewed expectations","review":"This CD is obviously billed as a biography. One look at, I don't know, anywhere on the jacket would clue you in. The first reviewer was looking for a comedy album and didn't find it and so of course he was disappointed. However, as a biography goes this was concise and well thought out with many excerpts from interviews with friends and family, and excerpts from Bruce's performances as well. The narration can be bit muggy at parts and they don't always identify who is talking, but overall it is a speedy and easy way to get to know the life of Lenny Bruce with some comedy mixed in as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to read this for history too","review":"...and I loved it!

The Walking Drum, although it isn't a western, is vintage L'Amour. His attention to character developement, historical and geographical accuracy, and good old fashioned story telling makes this one of the best novels he's ever written. Anyone interested in suspense, adventure, romance, and wit will have a great time with this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm trapped in an adventure novel and I can't get out!","review":"I'm actually a fan of Louis L'Amour and his westerns, so I was pretty excited about the idea of him writing a medieval adventure novel. However, I was very disappointed with \\"The Walking Drum\\". The book is basically a series of repetitive adventures involving Kerbouchard (another of L'Amour's supermen)getting into trouble and getting back out again. Repeat, ad finitum. The only thing that seems to change is the backdrop. That L'Amour knew the places and histories he was writing about firsthand is obvious. He was always good at making the settings of his books very vivid and living parts of his books. But the actual structure of the novel's plot -- well, here it's just a hodgepodge. By the time Kerbouchard rescued his father I just wanted to get the darn book finished already. Definitely not one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best historical fiction ever!","review":"I had to read this book my sophomore year in high school. I am so glad my teacher assigned this! It is very well-written. You truly feel as though you are actually experiencing everything in the book. I found it to be very accurate and very rich in detail. I wish the author had been able to write a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable reading","review":"I love adventure stories, and this is a good one. I did not understand all the historical background but enjoyed the book anyway. L'Amour knows his westerns, but he definitely did a lot of research to write this book as well. I've also read Last of the Breed which is excellent.In the \\"Author's Note\\" at the end of the book, which was written in 1984, L'Amour notes that in school we are taught little of China, India and the Moslem world, but \\"they are now powers with which we must deal both today and tomorrow, and which it would be well for us to understand.\\" He called that one right."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book set in a great time peroid....","review":"...but not a good story. I don't want to sound like at 11-and-a-half year old person that wrote a review to Emma or whatever, but the peroid this book was set in, is a great time.

If action and romance are all you want, then this book can supply short intervals of that. If you are more of a person who treasures symbolism and learning about human nature, then this book will utterly bore you."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Bond in the 12th Century","review":"I just finished \\"The Walking Drum\\" - I have been reading all the L'Amour books I can find, and this one disappointed me.I enjoyed the change of scenery from the typical L'Amour' American West setting to one in far off Asia, but found the book to be too cliched and and the plot simply unbelievable. The hero is just too handsome and heroic, and the events too full of convenient coincidences, busty babes and wondrous escapes.I felt that L'Amour wrote this book as a pot boiler to earn cash rather than as serious work of historical fiction. If you really want an engrossing read, try Bernard Cornwell's \\"The Archer's Tale\\" trilogy, which takes place a couple of centuries later."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complicated epic","review":"There is many different places and characters that the main character encounters on his journey. Most of them have long and unpronounceable names. I recommend if you read this book to keep a pad of sticky notes and write down important characters and places in the book. This book is a very informational book that captures your magination and keeps you yearning to read more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writng and Awful Writing What a Surprise!","review":"Great historical backdrop, great adventure writing. Enough intrigue for 10 books (if disjointed).Unfortunately, the main charactar spends half of the book talking about how great he is and how his greatness affects his view of the world for about half of the book. It seems like way more than half. If the dreadful monolog were deleted, it would be a normal-length book.Surprisingly, the women charactars are all unbeleivable and hard to respect.As always, Louis L'amour is a spectacular writer. He could really have been helped by a good editor on this one.Unique, Delightful, Infuriating, Disappointing, Exciting, Tedious"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN AMAZING INSIGHT INTO OUR PAST.","review":"IT WOULD TAKE YEARS OF RESEARCH TO COMPILE THE HISTORY IN THIS BOOK.

After awhile, however, the book became so repetitive that you could anticipate what would happen next. I gave the book 2 stars only because it did keep my interest for a few chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story filled with subtle philosophy. Incredible!!","review":"I have been an avid reader of L'amour's Westerns and, aside from Sackett's Land (which isn't completely non-western), I had never read any of his non-western titles until I read this. Louis L'amour did a fantastic job on The Walking Drum with so many intricate plots working at once with the coming of age of Mat Kerbouchard, his never-ending quest for his father, all the side romance plots, not to mention his yearning for learning. No type of story-telling is forgotten. A masterful work indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Typical of the Author","review":"Hey don't get me wrong he's a great author but if you read one of his westerns you have read them all.Not so with this book it is an above average old fashioned swashbuckler adventure. Just fantastically good stuff if you like Historical Fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece!!","review":"I'm on my third read of this book. This book has a touch of everything ... great humour, philosophy, accurate history, romance, bravery. It's probably L'Amour's best novel. It was his first book I read, and it left such a sweet taste in me that I haven't really enjoyed any of his other books. I would recommend it to anyone, young or old. I read it for the first time after high school, and I'm reading it for the third time several years after college.I'm inspired by Kerbouchard -- brave warrior, philosopher, scholar, lover -- as skilled with his sword as he is with his mind and his tongue.I was a bit disappointed by the ending though -- the build-up and anticipation was so great that I don't think the ending did enough justice to the whole novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book i have read more than once.","review":"An amazing story filled with adventure, Its just a shame the other 2 books were never written.

As a history major, I love to find books that reflect the truth of history in a beautiful and realistic way. Kerbouchard is a truly renaissance man who is on a quest to find his father, who may or may not be dead. In this quest, he travels mideval Europe, from the Christian lands of France to the Muslim lands of Spain and East to the steeps of Russia. What amazed me when I read this was that the middle ages were only the dark ages for western Europe; the Muslim lands were bright and alive and unoppressive. Kerbouchard's philosophy in life of learning for learning's sake is one I have adopted in my own travels through life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Louis L'amour","review":"The Walking Drum is an instant classic.Having read the book many times at different ages from a teenager to an adult. I have found it to be full of life, passion and adventure. This book makes you want to see the places in Spain and go to the library in Cordoba, to see the statue at Cadiz. You actually want to read and learn about great things, to become a scholar, or in our day a professor or an author.Louis L'amour brings you into the time and carries you on this adventure making you not want to put down the book.It's Just a great Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FUN historic-fiction","review":"My father read this book to my sister and I when I was about ten, so naturally I have a lot of sentimental attachment to the romantic hero, Mathurin Kerbouchard, and his quest.

I re-read this book every-so-often, and find Kebouchard's adventures don't get tiresome with repetition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not L'Amour's best","review":"Because of all the good reviews this book had, I bought and read it.

Now I read the Trilogy just packaged the three movies without re-mastering DVD. I think the Laser Disc looked better (I don't have the DVD).

Frank Miller really needs to get a Directers Cut of number 2 out there cuse as i understand alot was cut from that movie it just nees more cuse it leaves you wantin more but in a good way. these movies are classics and will never die out and frankly the terminator just keeps getting worse as the movies progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trilogy blu Ray","review":"They are what u expect out of 3 films...one being very popular and the last 2 being mediocre...sound I'd awesome on all 3 but picture quality is only improved on the first while the other 2 are slightly...if your a big fan, go ahead and get them for the low price...if you'd being introduced to the series, then find the MGM trilogy on DVD that was released 5or6 years ago...price is probably lower and quality is pretty close to these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robocop Trilogy","review":"The second disc, Robocop 2 was defective and would not play at all, so I am giving this set 2 stars.For MGM to release this with a known defective disc is inexcusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have collection","review":"So happy that it was released in DVD.

I didn't find any extras on the case, so I thought it would be on the BR itself, But no dice. The DVD has more Xtras than the Blu-Ray. The 2nd and 3rd have only a trailer and being a being a huge Robocop fan,I was hoping they would have a lost featurette or new Commentaries. I was disappointed in this purchase and I wouldn't recommend this, I'd suggest to pick up the first single disc of the first movie. Oh well, Live and Learn. I'm keeping this though since I already bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ROBOBOX version is LAME.","review":"Amazon is confusing, they put the SAME reviews for two DIFFERENT DVD Boxsets. Make sure you DO NOT get the ROBOBOX and are looking at the Robocop MGM Trilogy. The great version of the Robocop collection is the MGM version with Robocop 1 UNCUT. The Robocop 1 in the ROBOBOX collection is EDITED! I was mislead by all the positive reviews so I ended up getting the lame Robobox which simply just has the movies, no extras, and a butchered/edited masterpiece (yep, there are a couple minutes missing from Robocop). Avoid the blue Robobox, it's not the same DVD set everyone here is praising, it's DIFFERENT, not the definitive version of these classic movies. I wish somebody made that clear before I made a big mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Robocop!","review":"Its Robocop, who doesnt like them, evreyone should just have them.

It should be a misprint or something. If you already have 1st movie or expect better transfer for 1st movie, don't waste your money and better wait until the right boxset comes out or individual title is available if you're interested in 2nd and 3rd one.-- below updated Feb 28th, 2011Now I found 2nd one and 3rd one is available.

The second and third films look a bit better than the original film but, again, it's a marginal improvement over all.Audio is decent sounding although dialogue can get lost with the first film and that could easily have been remedied during the transfer stage.There are no special features which is inexcusable given that there were special features that could have been licensed from Criterion's edition for the first film or even ported over from the DVD boxed set.Over all the presentation of all three films is careless and sloppy.I'd wait to see if this is reissued again unless you can get it for very little money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anamorphic sequels....finally!","review":"What I find disturbing on Amazon.com and most other DVD sites is the lack of information about a release's format. All three ROBOCOP films are finally in Anamorphic Widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1. This is the first time Robo 2 and 3 get anamorphic releases, so for me, this alone was worth the cost, since I already owned the definitive Criterion Robocop. This is a slightly better release, however, in that it has some featurettes and trailers. It's great to finally watch Robo 2 (and the slightly sillier Robo 3) in Anamorphic Widescreen on my 65\\" HDTV, and in DD 5.1! While Robo 1 is still the best of the three, by far, don't discount Robo 2 and 3 for they have their moments too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movies - zero Remastering","review":"I swear that some guy in his basement with a DVD copy of Robocop ran DVDDecrypter, a blu-Ray burner, and burned it. Buy the DVD set. If you want to see something on blu-Ray in the Sci-Fi genre, forget MGM and get a good Universal Pictures movie or series. The original Star Trek series remastered on Blu-Ray jumps out of the screen in vibrant colors and hyper-realism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Buy!!!","review":"I sadly enough bought this set because I am a fan of the movies.

I needed to stabilise it to see if it'd heal on its own, or whether I'd need a doctor. There was nothing at the pharmacy that fit. This product was comfortable, sturdy, and easy to use and to keep clean. I would say that at the time I was right in the middle of the range of fit for it - 5'10\\", 340 lbs, mostly on thighs and hips.Postscript - the knee healed nicely, and I no longer weigh anything NEAR 340+ lbs. I included my then-weight in order to be helpful to others in deciding whether this product might fit. Truth of the matter, if this hadn't done its job, I might not have healed as well, and might not have been able to drop the weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Only problem I have is over use. I've been having some knee pain after twisting my knee. Have used this for plane rides, long meetings where sitting too long.

This book was written with good intentions, as can be understood from the simple and clear illustrations used to explain many aspects of photographing art work and the various examples of faulty photography. However, for digital camera users it is virtually useless for anything beyond setting up the correct lighting conditions since digital photography ise mentioned almost as an afterthought, with the bulk of the book dedicated to extensive elaboration of the merits and uses of photography film. As such, it can only be of help to those artists who still prefer to use (and manage to find) analog photography machines and films.

It gives the history of the land and the population of every domain, but almost nothing about the darklords. Most of them aren't even named. While domains of dread gave each darklord a story and history, nothing is said ofthem in this text. The only thing I really liked about this text is that it hails the return of the lich king Azlain.

John Little has to be the biggest Bruce Lee fanatic in the world. He probably knows more about Bruce Lee than Linda Lee does. That fact that he has to raise the price, make it a bigger hard back, and still reprint material from earlier in the series proves that he is just out for a quick buck! Bruce... we've been had. I am not going to return this book and inflict it on another poor soul, I'm going to burn it! John Little is a great author and really knows his stuff. It is just sickening that he feels comfortable putting his name on this absolute xerox of a book. Sorry John, I'm not buying any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, Done that!","review":"Most of the things in this book have been published in other books. I wish Bruce Lee was still alive so I wouldn't have to buy a book that is stale with Bruce's 1960's, hippie philosophy.

I have always been fascinated by his approach to fighting, but now --after reading \\"Artist of Life\\" -- I have a much deeper respect for him as a human being. Talk about being a \\"complete\\" person; this book reveals Bruce Lee to be a Chinese martial art historian, a philosopher of both eastern and western thought, a poet of great depth and sensitivity, a martial art pioneer, and his essays on self-knowledge are absolutely compelling. Bruce Lee has revealed to me many areas of development that we all need to look at in order to become a \\"total\\" person. This is a great book, containing the words of a great martial artist -- and, more important, a great human being."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"\\"Bruce Lee: Artist of Life\\" contains a treasuretroveof wisdom that is applicable to everyone (not just martial artists)! Iwas absolutely amazed to read about Bruce Lee's insights into life, eastern and western philosophy and even his poetry! There is enough martial art material (most of it never published before!) to satisfy the most serious practitioner of Jeet Kune Do, but there is also a wealth of wonderful material on psychology, self-knowledge and art to make for wonderful reading for any member of the family. I am going to have to order a second copy to keep in good condition because I've already marked up my first copy with underlinings and notations. What a book!

It's true that the grinding part of the game is arduous, but the rewards when you acheive master are great. It's a sad day whenever you have to drop skills you've worked on so you can learn another skill.

However, I was a little on edge when mention was made of a book of spells and knew the \\"Linnets and Valerians\\" was not for my family when the children were directed to chant spells and pull pins out of voodoo dolls to undo the bad magic cast by someone else. In telling the children that what they were doing was okay, Ezra, a servant tells them, \\"But don't tell your uncle. He'd say it were superstition. I reckon the cleverest men be ignorant at times.\\" The main premise of the book is that some bad things have happened because someone with bad intent used magic, but we of good intent can fix it using magic and then we will get rid of the book of spells. I probably should have given this book one star, but there were a number of likable aspects of the book. I would advise any caring adult to read the book first before giving it to a child you love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like finding a long-lost best friend","review":"I read \\"Linnets and Valerians\\" over and over as a child, captivated by the magic of a great story.

To write a book and do a tour promoting this as some prophesy is a big rip off.

The humor was good, I just was turned off by the silly parts relating to the [this is a possible spoiler] lizard transformation from the smoking of the weed, it was silly. The detective had goofy over acting too which was annoying. Cheech and Chong were top notch though however so I give this 4 of 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicken man eats Hamburger Dude!!","review":"I recently bought this movie after reading the reviews on Amazon but I ended up being disappointed...despite Chicken Man's best efforts. My main grumble is the inactivity of Sgt. Stedanko. All he does in this movie is smoke pot, mumble aimlessly and then turn into a lizard!! Things are much better when he's clear-headed and on the case. There are some redeeming moments in the film, namely the mental asylum scenes (where we meet Chicken Man) and also the Chinese restaurant madness...oh (...) However, the rest of the movie just ambles along. I think the only funny moment in the first half of the movie is when we see a lizard smoking pot. In fact I think Mr Chong was suffering from a strange fascination with these reptiles and unfortunately lost all focus on making a good movie. OK man."},{"rating":"2","title":"laughoutloud","review":"Nostalgia for my childhood recently caused me to buy and watch the Cheech and Chong movies (with the exception of The Coriscan Brothers). Aside from realizing I shouldn't have been watching those movies in my pre-teen days, I realized how well done they are. Most amazing to me was that they held up one after the other, feeling not repetitive, though each of them is rather episodic. Most impressive was Chong's direction; he makes a number of interesting choices that elevate him beyond the status of writer/star who has enough power to direct; clearly, he took this role quite seriously. The movies, of course, are not serious. I rarely laugh out loud in movies these days, but I did at least a half dozen times in each of these. The characters are not only given funny situations in which to work and funny lines to deliver, but each of them is presented with a kind of earnestness that makes them likeable, and the films all he more watchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prolly my Favt Cheech and Chong movie.","review":"I liked this movie alot and I have seen it about 20 times. It is just laid back and does not take a lot to follow it.From the point where they sell there weed out of there old Ice Cream truck and are followed by cops and Sgt Stedanko who a couple years earlier was a serious cop and now makes bust to get the weed.Then they get some weed from Jimmy's house. Then they find out they made 17 million from the deals and celebrate and by goibg out to eat. There is a lady who things chong is Jerry Garcia. Then a Ex girlfriend of Cheech is there with Hamberger dude(Pee Wee Herman)and they do coke. After this She along with Cheech and Chong go back to the hotel for a 3 way.Then her Husband a convict that escaped comes to beat up and Cheech escapes naked and goes up and down a elevator shaft.When they finally get out Cheech finds out Chong gave Hamberger dude all the money and they look for him at Casa Del Wacko's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for true C&C fans","review":"\\"Nice Dreams\\" is nowhere near as funny as \\"Up in Smoke\\" or \\"Next Movie\\".

DON'T DO THIS! Find another movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would you like a Hamburger?","review":"Nice Dreams might be either C & C's second or third best film. They have a movie that might seem weird in the first viewing, but it grows on you after a few viewings, each one getting funnier. And it's not just the funny sequences involving a pot garden, a lizard sergeant or mental patient animals. It's also the little things, like chats by Cheech and Chong about petty stuff that actually might make sense when you go with the flow (like the discussion on Hippie retirement homes).But that's just an observation on the small things. Overall, Nice Dreams is a very hilarious film that has all the things you could want in a C & C movie, and while it doesn't quite match up to the brilliance of Up in Smoke, it does many cool things; one of which is bringing Pee-Wee Herman in the mix as the uproarious Hamburger dude. Love the save the whales song."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the only way I would buy them.","review":"I love Cheech and Chong but I always hesitated buying these since they were around $15 a piece. I might of bought other Cheech and Chong movies for that amount but these were not as good as their first few efforts and I just couldn't just toss over $30 for both. I'm glad they did this because I could justify completing my collection of Cheech and Chong.The movies are funny but not Laugh out loud funny most of the time but they are Cheech and Chong and they have some fantastic moments. Don't expect a lot of features to these CD's you get some commentary and a bit of extras but not much."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars!","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my kids (ages 5 & 8).

Yes, the camera resolution is horrible but most 4 to 12 yrs old will not care. The kids go crazy when they take high scorer's photo. Excellent game for young kids.

It is very fun and gives kids a great workout. It is targeted at little children and kids of all other ages. That being said, the game hit a very wrong chord with me. One of the many games on it involves pretending to prepare food. At one point, a chef comes to challenge you (my 4 year old son) to a cooking duel. When my son beat him, the game said \\"Damn, you beat me\\". I do not want to expose my children to such language and I find it annoying that a game that targets children would contain such language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, affordable family fun!","review":"My experience with these games has been mostly great and a little frustrating. These games are perfect for a younger (6-8) video game player. My son sweats when he plays! I feel better about his playing this than other sedentary games. They are also for 4 players, so getting everyone in on the action is possible. There have been some bugs, and it doesn't always respond the way you want. The single player versions are usually a little less frustrating. For us Wii resisiters, it is affordable, active and exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to our playstation","review":"We ordered this as a Christmas present and the kids love it!

Left financially insecure after a divorce, Mildred experiences the American dream and builds up a successful business of her own. Her happiness is marred by her cheating second husband and a rebellious daughter. The situation worsens until the climax and Mildred must then choose between herself and her daughter.Always suspenseful and engaging, the characters in Mildred Pierce are very down to earth and believable. Although I am French and not American, I could identify with Mildred, her hopes and her fears.This is a great book and highly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"A remarkable story of human relationships, complexities, perseverance, and weakness!All too often people turn a blind eye to what they refuse to believe, or perhaps can't comprehend - and we see this played out in the interactions of Mildred and her daughter Veda!

A powerful piece of writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Focus On Mother-Daughter Instead of Man-Woman","review":"I never met a James M. Cain novel I didn't like and this one was no exception. The title is of the lead character who rises to great success during the Depression with a series of restaurants in early California. However, she has one big problem: the daughter she raised alone, Veda. Veda becomes a singer and also a master at deceiving and betraying her mother. Veda does not even consider her mother's spouse, her stepfather, off limits. This showcases the same intense Cain focus on a twisted relationship but this time it is on the mother-daughter relationship, arguably a more powerful one than the lover-lover one. This was made into a movie starring Joan Crawford, who won an Oscar playing Mildred. I thought this film version went too over the top though and veered into being maudlin and soap operaish. Stick with Cain's novel, the far more complex work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This was an interesting twist on the original Mildred Pierce.

Without education, breeding, or work experience outside the home she manages to achieve professional and financial success beyond her wildest dreams.But Mildred's wild ride from rags to riches is fraught with personal loss.

I read it in anticipation of the HBO mini-series. Actually, I read it in between part one and part two. Could not put it down. I really enjoyed the extra detail in the book - the slice-of-life from those Depression days and a really cool look inside the mind of a really screwball woman. It's funny to think about the fact that it was written by a man - what must he think of us gals? I haven't really gotten into analyzing it to that depth, but maybe one day I will and this review might embarrass me. I better cut it short. The book is fantastic. The mini-series is great. The original movie is still a classic, though very different in tone from the book and tv series.

The content of this book was a little unusual for the 1940s. I was surprised that the book has a totally different ending than the movie. I have seen the movie several times, and decided to read the book. I am so glad I did, and my husband really enjoyed this book too. Mildred is a great character. She was a woman before her time. Stepping out to have her own business. Not too many women in those times would have had the courage to do such a thing. Her daughter, Veda, is a BRAT. Mildred is a \\"disney land\\" parent. She thinks the more she gives the more her daughter will love her. This is a good example for divorced parents today. They feel compelled to give their kids too many \\"material\\" things and they really just need to spend more time with their children and learn to say \\"No\\".

It's loving, moving, beautiful, and terrible. It's also shocking, because the tone of this memoir very abruptly changes from this jovial story about an eccentric family's travels to a different, much more serious, story altogether.

We have to take the batteries out and leave them out for 30 seconds to 5 minutes before the thing will work again. Batteries don't last long at all. The shutter response is very slow, disappointing when you're trying to catch a fleeting smile from a small child.

These guys live for the thrill and horror of killing vampires, and in-between they get drunk and act stupid. The vampires themselves are truly monsterous and powerful. Forget Bela Lugosi.While I found the characterizations of the vampire hunters to be a bit weak and very uninteresting, the portrayal of the vampires and the methods of battling them to be very well-written ... and fascinating. The battle sequences are exciting, violent and unpredictable. So I find myself trudging through the dull narrative about the vampire hunters' lives while anxiously awaiting the next battle sequence.Bottom line: forget about the vampire hunter soap opera and read the book for those terrific vampire-killing sequences. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, if you like purple prose.","review":"I had high hopes for this book because I'm a great fan of vampire literature and like James Woods and all that but when I first started reading this book I couldn't figure out what was bothering me, distressing me and then I figured out it was Steakley's writing style which goes on and on like this forever and forever with no letup, beating us, blinding us, giving no quarter, making me wish for just one period, even one, and then when he finally comes to the end of a sentence he ends it.In the next paragraph. And when he's not doing that, he begins paragraph after paragraph with the same word:And this got really irritating.And it was because the story was weak.And the characters even weaker.And maybe by the end I just didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but just not what I like","review":"Vampire$: A NovelWell written but the storyline just didn't quite grab me.

Here's one, which pretty much killed the last part of the book for me, and hence, no real payoff: **SPOILER WARNING** the reveal of the bigbad vamp, the one we've heard but not quite seen, the one pushing all the buttons, the one that ~ heck, it would have been more satisfying if Steakley had just said, \\"Aw, it's Dracula\\" ~ ?? Yeah that one. Turns out he's actually NO ONE WE'VE EVEN HEARD OF UP TO THAT POINT IN THE BOOK. So when Felix says, \\"The bastard's name is...\\" you will respond with, \\"I'm sorry, WHO?\\".No punch. A lynch-pin disclosure in the book and it lacks any dramatic impact. Steakley tries to tell us all about him then, in the few paragraphs before he gets wasted by Team Crow anyway, but you won't care.Why didn't he make it one of the George Bushes? J.R. Ewing?

This all changes as the S*** hits the fan. the hunters become the hunted as an ancient vampire decides that Crow has gone far enough and must be elimenated or turned. The Book is almost in three parts, part one is the told primarily for Crow's perspective, the second is the history of Davette's relationship with a 'master' vampire and the third is from the persective of Felix, a gunslinger who becomes a reluctant member of Team Crow.

First of all I am a huge vampire fan. I don't go so far as to dress as one, but I am a big fan nevertheless. I've watched the John Carpenter film before I read the book. The stories are not related at all, a big plus for the book. I loved the story of the novel and it's unique approach to vampire slaying which thankfully, made it to the film. Now for the bad. The writing felt like it was written by a child. Not even in a simplistic innocent way, but by some fifth grader doing his best horror-noir impression. The character development really suffers from this, as well as the dialogue. I found myself confused with a lot of the scenes, having to flip back a few pages just to clarify what had just transpired.Overall, I'd say stay far away. Try I Am Legend by Richard Matheson, which even though written in 1954, still delivers the goods for a vampire novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampires","review":"I was very disappointed with the expletives used LIBERALLY throughout the book. I did not finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong starter, weak from page 50 on","review":"Bleuach!!! The horror in this book was for horrible. A strong beginning but it then spiraled into weak adolescent fantasy. The characters were cardboard, the vampires were Romero revisited ala \\"Night of the Living dead\\". The one small concept addressed in the book which is interesting dealt with Vampire sex or lack thereof."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked the movies you'll love the book.","review":"Sometime after I see a good movie I'll read the book to see if it adds something the movie missed or as in this case is better. I enjoyed the characters of Jack Crow and Felix, the balls to the wall vampire hunter and the old west gunfighter, kind of the new to the old twist. The book makes the vampires out to be more the monsters they are then in old movies and that heroes can have bad days too and don't always win over evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampires for non-vampire fans","review":"Excellent book, with a few hidden cross-overs to Steakley's previous book, \\"Armor\\" (anyone catch the \\"Antwar Saloon\\"?). I wouldn't waste time or money on the movie. I can't believe the producers even read the book on which it was loosely based. I've seen some online chat conversations with John Steakley and some of his fans, and look forward to anything he may write in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not quite 5 stars","review":"If you've seen the movie, forget all about it while you read this book. Nothings the same except a couple character names and one or two scenes. This is one of the better Vampire books around, altho the psychological aspects didn't come through as much as they did in Armor (a 5 star book which every sci-fi fan should read). The little references to Armor (Felix & Jack Crow, the Antwar bar) are cute but actually detracted from it for me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in ages","review":"I read at least 200 books a year and this has become one of my favorites of all time. Vampire$ is one of the few books out there that you can not put down once you open it. It has great characters and storylines and should become a classic horror novel along with the likes of \\"IT\\", \\"Dragon Tears\\", and \\"Dracula\\". All in all the books rocks!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Steakley's Vampire$: A Human Side to the Vampire Myth","review":"Steakley's \\"Vampire$\\" is not a book for the philosophic. Instead, it broaches the idea of the vampire as a monster. Gone are the ponderings of the more inactive protagonist (such as Louie in \\"Interview...\\") and instead we meet, and learn to care, about a group of hunters who try not to think too much about what they do! It is only through action that they all attempt to deal with situations which would drive a normal man mad. This wonderful blend of human personalities linked to the common cause, the erradication of Vampires, made for a new slant at an old genre. It is worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Global Beat Enlightenment","review":"I loved it! I bought 4 and gave them out to friends for MY birthday!

The \\"Doctors\\" look fake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very amateurish","review":"I have several dvd's on yoga and exercises for back pain; this one was a BIG disappointment. It's almost embarrassingly amateurish and wasn't helpful in the least. I'm giving it to the thrift shop (though I hope no one pays more than a quarter for it). I received an e-mail ad for it from Amazon and it was rated five stars, so you can imagine my surprise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"I have to agree with the reviewers who believe that this DVD is uninspiring and not well done. The presenters ARE amateurish and reading from an awkward script.Counting would be good to prevent back misalignment. Except for the warm-up and cool-down, where the stretches aren't held nearly long enough, the entire workout consists of a hands-and-knees position, where the arms and shoulders get more of a workout than the back and leg muscles, and a lying-down series of pelvic tilts and mild crunches. Not bad exercises, but not enough variety, not enough repetitions, and, most importantly, no thorough explanation of how to optimally tighten the abdominal muscles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful step-by-step instructions, great illustraions","review":"This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in pen & ink drawing. Instead of trying to explain techniques in detailed text, it shows you step by step with color illustrations. It is written for all levels & the instructions are easy to follow.There is information on types of lines, value and contrast. A wide variety of techniques are also covered. These include, dry surface, damp surface, wet on wet, spatter, blotting, impression, stamping and salt & alcohol.It shows how to draw & paint metallic objects (gold, silver, iron, rust), baskets, pottery, brick, stone, marble, granite, textiles, clouds, weather, earth textures, rocks, wood, trees, leaves, foliage, flowers, fruit, & eggs.Another section includes instruction on drawing transparent objects such as glass, eyes and many varieties of water. There is also a section on animals covering butterflies, animal hair, scales & feathers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected or wanted","review":"A better title would have been, \\"Creating Textures in Pen & Ink, Enhanced with Watercolor.\\" 75% of each texture comes down to \\"make a detailed ink drawing\\". The other 25% is enhancing that ink drawing with watercolor. The pen & ink predominates everywhere. If this is the style of drawing you desire (e.g., detailed drawings where pen&ink predominates), then you will probably give this book 4 to 5 stars. I was looking for watercolor texture techniques and was disapointed.With that said, the drawings are very well executed and the instruction quality moderate. The author relies too heavily on step-by-step examples as a teaching tool. The addition of color greatly enhances the pen & ink drawings, with spectacular results."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great tutorial","review":"This book offers practical solutions for beginning watercolorists which will improve their representational skills while encouraging additional exploration on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creating Textures in Pen & Ink with Watercolors","review":"This book arrived in good time, excellent condition and I love it. A wonderful book that gives good information that is easy to follow. I will use it a lot. Thank you so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"The information is good but nothing out of the ordinary and nothing more than one would expect a beginner watercolorist to know. The illustrations exemplifying how to apply the techniques are unimpressive. 90% of the illustrations are mediocre, the hatching is repetitive and the end result looks like every subject depicted is made of the same texture; namely hairy lines. The artist's skill is like a hobbyist and less like scientific illustrators. This book should have big bold letters that read \\"creating textures in pen & ink with watercolor FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I really enjoy this book! I purchased it to get fresh ideas on how to use pen & ink with watercolor types of art. First, I will say, the pens and ink suggested by this author are very expensive. Be ready to spend some money on some expensive pens!! This book describes how to use pen and ink to create textures in your watercolor paintings. It is not really what I would consider a beginners book unless you are experienced with both mediums. She does not teach you how to draw in this book. I have used watercolors, but I am new to pen and ink. Overall, this is a good book for ideas an how to use color washes with pen and ink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slammin'","review":"for those who enjoy good club music, you will not be disappointed. awesome mix and choice of beats. one problem, junior used a pop song one of the tracks.... shameful, but I was able overlook this one blemish since the rest of the 2cd set is just phenomenal. well worth every dollar i spent on it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Junior's Best Work Yet","review":"As an avid fan of Junior's work, i give this compilation the best review from his past two. Junior took the best songs from Arena and Twilo and brought them together to make one of the greatest album out there. I agree that listening to these CD's is like being at Twilo and Arena. If you haven't had the chance to hear Junior live, then crawl out under from your rock and get to NY. Go to Twilo but make sure you have enough E-nergy to last till the early morning hours. Keep clubbing hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tribal Beats Do It","review":"While Junior's days of residency at Twilo are over, one can relive them with this CD. Junior lives up to his reputation, and as a result is the highest paid DJ in the world. The first disc mixes phat tribal beats w/ junior's garage/jungle, adn lets it rip. Junior throws down an amazing intro. to meet her at the Love Parade, and along with the effects sets it off. WHile the second disc is a little (a lot) tamer, the music feels more controlled. While I haven't seen Junior live in a while, I still like to look back on those days, especially when he was a resident at Sound Factory before it became Twilo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, as Junior always is.","review":"This CD is some of Junior's finest spinning. Upon it's debut, this compilation was spun over a TWILO on Saturday night back in 98 and it was pumping back then. This cd shows junior's flawless remixing style and gives a taste of the tribal style that he has mastered. As a resident DJ at Twilo on Saturday evenings, and as the old resident DJ at the once superior Sound Factory, he has withstood the test of time. Those of you who love this cd, look for his imports, they make this cd seem a bit simple. One of his best compilations is Junior live from Germany and London. He pushes the envelope there as he does for us in this beautiful city.Junior will always keep our city pumping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish, through and through","review":"What kind of cognitive dissonance must the author have suffered when Pluto was downgraded from a planet? Her made-up babblings about the connection of the planets to psychology are too goofy for anyone who knows anything about astrology or psychology.

She creates in this book some wonderful imagery and insights. She offers practical spiritual solutions to the age-old problems of life itself.The book starts with the signs of the Zodiac and then is divided into 'the planets' going backwards from Pluto.I liked the way Caroline adds her quirky experiences around the world, including what happened when she climbed up a Great Pyramid...She adds lots of rituals for various planetary challenges, which I especially enjoyed. You would have to be into the more esoteric side of life to enjoy this book, which for me added to it's charm.Super!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Caroline Casey's book is not a technical read! And yet... she conveys the intricate pattern of planetary influence with a depth that keeps me coming back to this book. She has stories that include ways of honoring particularly intense transits. For so many, learning astrology is not what they want to do. They want to understand their chart. If you have been told that you are going through a transit and you want more practical information for what that might look like... this is your book. If you are an astrologer... this book brings it back to the fine patterns in the sand that you just do not see in the other - very fine - books designed to break it down by study. What you will not get is a cooking recipe for planet in sign to house.... etc. I find myself coming back, frequently to this book to regain the respect that can be lost in too much study!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY INCREDIBLE","review":"I stumbled on truartrecords.com by chance and listened to the album Ceremonies.

Particular tracks that stand out vocally are \\"Why I Love You\\", \\"I'm Not Finished\\" and \\"Feel this Way.\\" Even so, tracks such as \\"Your Girl Chose Me\\" (though a favorite are mine) and \\"Here We Go Again\\" are basically only appreciated by hard core B2K fans.

B2K doesn't do much to separate themselves from regular teen r-n-b boybands that come and go. They're very very handsome and cute (well Omarion and J-Boog) but other than that they don't bring much to the table. The songs are enjoyable, but contradicting. Some material seems too mature for them, while others seems too young. I believe and hope once they find their theme ( and stop letting the annoying lil' fizz say his name on every damn track) they may have something to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"This album is very good even though the boys of B2k only wrote one song it still is very good.

So read the corrected version they made:Yeah, I bet you're saying this is another person that hates B2K. No, it isn't even like that, but truthfully, they can't sing. What do you think helped them sell, their nice voices? No, it's the image; that's all the music industry is about. Those cats have the image, so all they have to do is make a few decent songs, and POW! There you go; you made it big. No hating from me although I wish them well and everything, but I'm not a fan.

I obviously liked GOTS TA BE and UH-HUH, but there were some others I liked as well such as I'M NOT FINISHED and COME ON. Overall, I didn't really like the album because there weren't enough slow songs. Most boy bands of the past are known for their slow songs. There were only about three of them!I've never heard \\"Pandemonium!\\", but if you buy a B2K album, I suggest buying that one. But if you're a die hard fast song fan, I definitely suggest B2K's debut effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Feelin' It","review":"What's going on, here? When the Jackson 5 started out, they were subject to RIGOROUS rehersals and nonstop practicing. Nowadays, cookie cutter teen acts like B2K need nothing more than a hype machine, a good stylist, and a flashy video director to help sell a million copies. Maybe these kids need to speak with Michael Jackson, the original child star, about learning to pay your dues before you make it big! This record really upsets me, for they are singing songs that are far beyond their years. Listen, shorties: drop the mike and go to school and complete your education.

Puncture resistant?","review":"I didn't actually purchase these but got I think 25 of them free with my Medela Pump In Style. Love the pump, hated the bags. I've had a few of them come with holes in them. As we all know breastmilk is liquid gold, so these baggies cost me precious milk. Now I just pump into the provided bottles--which I mainly use for storage--then use Gerber freezer bags for freezer storage. The Gerber bags are self-standing and they have a zipper seal, which is so much better than fooling with those stupid twist ties that the Medela bags use. Bottles are much easier to attach to your pump. I hate to say anything bad about Medela, but I wouldn't recommend spending actual money on these by themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prefer Lansinoh","review":"I registered for and received these Medela bags. After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase. Wow!! I will never go back to Medela. The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak. Well this is the only good feature. The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top. With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that. My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that. But neither has my Lansinoh bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Gerber bags!","review":"Why on earth would you want to fuss with twist ties when you can just zip up the Gerber bags? The Gerber bags also stand up on their own and you can freeze them flat, which optimizes storage space. I've never had one leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"A one star review gives this product too much credit.","review":"I initially tried these bags because all my other experiences with Medela products were great. However, Medela missed the mark on this one. The twist tie bag closure design is horrible and more expensive compared to other brands.I decided to go with the Gerber storage bags instead and I like them 100% better. I have never had a problem freezing any milk with the Gerber bags and thawing the milk is easy using the sealed pouch design, we use the coffee maker and the bags hold up well immersed in just the hot water. The Gerber bags are sold everywhere and you get more for your money per bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medela needs to come up w/ something else","review":"I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them. These were just about the worst!! My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding. I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped. I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day. I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain. They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt. I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced, a seperate manual pump, and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months), I like their storage bottles, I even like their nipple cream, but these bags need some more work put into them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"I personally preferred the Lansinoh bags, they seem more sanitary, are easier to write on and close easier. These weren't bad, I just found something better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky!","review":"About half the bags that I stored in my freezer cracked and leaked, wasting milk that I had painstakingly collected before I went back to work. I wish I'd used the Avent cup system or the Gerber or Lansinoh zipper bags from the beginning instead. Also, I tried pumping directly into the bags, but the twist ties were leaky, and it made a mess. Medela makes a lot of good products, but this isn't one of them!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pump into a bottle instead and pour into a separate bag","review":"These bags are not only expensive but they are an exercise in frustration. The tearing feature doesn't work and you always use scissors which is a pain (and introduces germs unnecessarily). The twist tie method to seal the bags for storage is awkward at best. If you do pump directly into them be careful how you handle all the pump accessories after you pump(it is quite a balancing act) because you can't set these down anywhere after you pump so you have to balance the bag+ shield in one hand and try to put everything else away- If you set down the bag you will spill all your precious milk. I have tried all the bags and would recommend staying away from Gerber (too thin and get freezer burn) and the Medela bags. I personally like the Lansinoh bags the best, the double ziplock at the top ensures the milk is airtight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy design, hard to use","review":"These bags leave a lot to be desired. They don't stand up on their own so you have to set them in a cup when they have milk in them. They don't lie down flat, so you can't freeze them in a nice flat layer to stack in the freezer. The twist-tie top causes the bags to freeze with a lot of folds and ridges at the neck - this made it impossible for me to open a frozen bag to add more milk later on. And I've never been able to tear open the little tab at the bottom to get the milk out - I have to snip the edge with a scissors, which I'm sure defeats the purpose of having a nice, sterile inside. All in all, I'm really disappointed in these bags, and the only positive side to them is I haven't had any burst in the freezer...yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Mess","review":"If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you. First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself. Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out. It's not that easy. The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk. Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there. The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk. This never happened with the other bags on the market. My favorite is lansinoh. Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others. Pass on this and try others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cumbersome","review":"The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them. The execution, however, is lousy. Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying.I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal. Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I was not impressed with these storage bags. I prefer to use the other brands that offer ziplock type closure. This brand is harder to close, more time consuming and wasteful (due to spilling)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prefer Gerber bags","review":"After using both these bags and the Gerber bags, I prefer the zipper-style closure of the Gerber bags. I've never had a problem with those leaking or ruining my milk. They are also much cheaper as you can generally find them at discount stores (Target, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sour Milk; Devastated Mom","review":"These bags seemed perfect, as I was unable to breastfeed my son and was pumping full-time for him. Sometimes I would have extra milk at the end of the day, so I froze it using these bags and also some Avent freezer bags that I had. Once I stopped breastfeeding, I went to use the frozen milk that was remaining in the freezer (I had been using it up slowly as I decreased my milk supply, so none of the milk was in there longer than 2 or 3 months), and to my dismay 90% of the milk in the medela bags was complelety sour. The Avent bags, though they didn't fit on my Lactina pump, worked for 100% of the milk I stored. Don't waste your money and effort on these bags. You may be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most expensive and least useful","review":"I started off with the Medela bags but one day they fell to the side and spilled 13 oz of milk in the little black carrier and into my work bag. Then I moved onto the Gerber ones with zip lock but were not spill-proof either. Then tried the Lansinoh which have a double zip lock system and those can be carried upside down and not a drop is lost. Also cheaper than Medela."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible bags! They always leak and are hard to handle.","review":"This is a horrible system! The picture on the package shows them using some kind of screw top on the top of the bag, but that's misleading. There is no such thing in the package. The package consists of nothing but the bags and wire twist ties. In order to use the bags, you have to peel open their top seal, which leaves the entire top open and unsealed! You are then supposed to use the wire ties to close the bag. Well, I don't think that's all that great! Once they have milk in them they are very awkward to handle because the don't stand up due to the \\"convenient\\" spout on the bottom. The spout doesn't actually tear open either, you have to cut it with scissors, which means, if you're not fast enough to pull your scissors back, then the milk will run over them. And if you don't hold them upright, then the milk will start to leak out of the top that's basically open except for the little wire tie. Bad design! I'd never buy those again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like - Used First Years bags or Mother's Milk bottles","review":"I had some of these that came with my Medela pump and like some other reviewers I thought they would be a good deal since I've really liked my Medela pump. I really didn't like using them with the twist ties. That didn't make sense to me at all. I tried the First Years that have a zip-loc top and they've worked better. They sit on their own and don't need to be set in a cup!I do prefer using bottles to store milk and have found the Mother's Milk Mate storage bottles to be a great cheap alternative for storage bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"CSF Breastmilk Bags","review":"I cannot believe that, in this day and age, no one has come up with a better method for pumping and storing breast milk! As a resident physician, I pumped 3 to 5 times daily for 8 months and was always amazed that this was really the only way. Must the pump be so big, so loud? Has anyone with BREASTS ever looked at the design of the bulky plastic suction cups, the tubing, the hilarity of the 1960's design? I suppose that I must discuss the bags, although anyone who has spent a half-hour pumping only to spill the precious contents during the uncap, transfer, recap, wire-threading, de-airing, or closing phase knows what I'm talking about. Best of luck to you out there who plan to undertake this noble cause. I hope that somewhere there is a person out there who will come up with a better, more usable design."},{"rating":"1","title":"OKAY FOR EMERGENCIES","review":"I bought these bags thinking that I would be using them alot but I only found myself using them when I did not have any more bottles left. I didn't really like them because when I pour the milk out, I notice that I don't get everything out so easily. I keep extra bags in my car, at work or in my bag in case I forget to pack a bottle or I run out and I need something to store my breast milk. But that hardly ever happens because I definately prefer storing milk in the bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy... and NO LEAKS!!!","review":"We were using bottles to store milk when my mother bought these. I was SOOO skeptical at first, but I tried them. LOVE EM!!! I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars b/c they are a little bit akward to put on the pumps, but I love them!!! they save space and they are less expensive than buying 50 bottles to store your milk in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"These storage bags are convenient to use and reasonably priced -- plus delivered to my front door. Very eay to use with the medela pump-in-style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible storage bags","review":"I love my Medela Pump In Style but their breastmilk storage bags are awful. The twist-tie closure is complicated. They also spill milk easily when pouring into a bottle after thawing. I recommend the Lansinoh bags. They have an easy-to-use double zip closure to ensure that the milk will stay fresh and it's very easy to get the air out of the bag before closing. You can also lay them flat to freeze so they won't take up much space in the freezer. They pour great - no spills!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Found these bags difficult although milk freezed well","review":"I had been using the lansinoh milk storage bags and ran out so I tried these bags. I found them very hard to use. The Lansinoh bags have a zip top like the gerber bags yet I have not had a problem with them leaking. I was very dissappointed in these bags since you have to place them in a cup and they are awkward and don't lay flat when frozen. I have a supply of milk in my freezer and if I couldn't lay them flat I would have no room for my other freezer items. I was extremely happy with the lansinoh bags and would reccommend them instead of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"They leak!","review":"As a mom whose son was breastfed but not able to nurse, these bags were the bane of my existence! They were not easy to use and leaked horribly. Even if they managed to hold together long enough to be put in the freezer or refrigerator, they almost always began leaking while being thawed.I personally LOVED the Lansinoh bags from Target. They're cheaper and easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like having your milk leak all over your fridge","review":"I had been using the Gerber bags for quite a while when I ran out and decided to try some of the Medela bags that came with my pump.I frequently just couldn't seem to get the bags to completely seal - and I had NEVER had this problem with the Gerber bags.I always ended up making a mess when trying to use the 'spout' at the bottom of the bag.And the worst part - I didn't realize the twist-ties were cutting into the sides of the bags on more than one occasion. I took the bag out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw and ended up with a shelf full of breastmilk.Maybe these bags work for supermoms, but they didn't work well for busy, sloppy me. Apparently I can handle a ziploc baggie but not a twist tie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love These Bags...","review":"After trying several breast-milk storage systems, I have found these bags to be one of the best. I have never had any problems with leaks or freezer burn. I agree with the reviewer who said that it is better to pour the thawed milk from the top where the twist tie is than from the bottom (where the directions indicate you should pour from). I found it too difficult to pour from the bottom. I would highly recommend these bags to any breast feeding mommy."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible bags","review":"This bags are absolutelly horrible they don't close right, I have already spilled milk all over and also if you keep them in the freezer or fridge nothing guarantees you that the milk is going to be sterile since the bag does not close properly and does not use a zipper. I found that Lansinoh breatmilk storage bags are way better they come with a double zipper that seals the bag for extra security, don't waste your money on these bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medela vs. Lasinoh","review":"The Lasinoh bags have a double ziplock and are cheaper too. Also you can find Lasinoh bags at more stores such as K-Mart, etc. The twist ties with the Medela bags are a pain and I never used them to pump in anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best on the market","review":"While these are easy to use when you are pumping, they tie on the pumps nice and snug, they are not the best for storing. The tie doesn't make it leakproof and there can be spillage if they tip before they freeze.A better bag is the Gerber seal and go bag. They fit on the pump but you'll need to either hold the bag so it doesn't slip or use a rubberband to hold it in place. But, the reason it's better is because it's a ziplock bag. So, it seals tight and there's no spilling. The best part about these bags is if you freeze them, you can store them in the freezer lying down so you can have thin bags stacked up, keeping room in your freezer for food for the rest of the family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bags Leak","review":"These bags leaked for me from both the top and the bottom. The fold-down mechanism is very cumbersome especially because the plastic is very stiff. I lost three bags of milk due to leaks. If you have to transport the bags anywhere, like back and forth to work like I do, I would avoid these bags. They just leaked all over the place for me, even after I carefully re-sealed each one exactly according to the package instructions. I would recommend the Lanisoh bags over these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good if you use Medela Pump","review":"Initially I was renting a Medela pump from the hospital and I was attaching the bags to the pupm. (Although it was confusing at first to figure out HOW to attach the bags w/o the milk spilling after the pumping session.) But when I purchased another pump (Evenflo Comfort Select Dual- Awesome pump for a 1/4 of the price of the medela) closing the bags was a PAIN! I now use the Lansihoh bags with the double zipper seal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to use","review":"I've used the Gerber, Lansinoh and these CSF bags and I have to say that the CSF are the worst. The twist-tie method really does stink. Lansinoh is much more sturdier, easier to pour milk into and the double ziploc action is great. Plus the thickness of the bags is better. The CSF bags don't stand up on their own so you need a cup to keep them upright while you fold the bag over the twist ties, ugh..I can't be bothered. And the whole cutting of the bag on the bottom, what a pain. Isn't it easier to just open up a ziploc-type Lansinoh bag and pour it into the bottle?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This product is horrible.

Yes, you have to do some setting up for the liners, such as the twist tie, but after about a week, it only takes less than a minute to do. After your done you just seal it up. I haven't had any leaks. you do have to be careful when you are pouring it into the bottle as the stream of milk can miss the opening, but after the first spill you can figure out the right way to do it.I think these are great as they take up less space than bottles. I bring home 6 bags everyday and that would be too many bottles to handle. If you have any questions just email me. I love these bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gerber Vs. Medela? I vote Gerber","review":"I've tried lots of storage bags, and by far the Medela ranks the lowest. These spill, you have to store them upright in the freezer...and if your freezer is as compact as mine with food to feed five people, storing milk upright is just too hard to do. These bags do NOT have a ziplock seal on them, which means that they are leaky and unreliable if you are in a hurry (like if you have more than one kid and you work).Buy the Gerber or the Lansinoh bags with the zip seals on them. They can both be stored flat for more convenience, and they can stand on their own. Pumping into a bag is fine if you are someone who wants to fumble with attaching it to the pump (the Medela bags), or you can use your Medela pump with your reliable pump kit and pour your milk into a Gerber or Lansinoh storage bag for ease. I use the Medela Lactina Plus, and I find that this method works the best for me. Simple, clean and easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The milk tasted awful!","review":"I used these bags to store several gallons of milk over the past few months. I had to throw all the milk away because when I used the previously frozen milk to make cereal and tasted it,the milk tasted awful. I felt horrible because I had unknowingly fed this milk to my son several times. I don't know if the milk tasted bad because the bags don't seal correctly because of the twist ties, or because the plastic makes it taste bad but something wrong happened. I wouldn't recommend these bags to anybody. I would recommend tasting frozen milk before feeding it to your baby. I also recommend the Gerber bags because they are cheaper and keep the milk fresher."},{"rating":"1","title":"not easy to use","review":"I bought these to store milk before I went back to work. They work fine when I'm home with all the time in the world. I've back to work for 4 days and find these bags very time consuming...opening the bag, threading the twist tie, attaching it to the shield, pumping, deattaching it, and closing it. Pumping can take up to 25 minutes. Not something that can happen 2-3 times a day. And I'm never sure how much I've pumped. When the bag is attached to the shield it says 1 thing, but then you seal it up and it says anothers. Today, I'm going to buy bottle set. They close just as tight and are much easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another, better option-Pumpmate breastmilk storage liners","review":"My sister-in-law swore by Medela bags and they worked for her, however, we looked at them in stores and saw how they were to be used, and decided against them. I think that these and other bags like them are more complicated than they need to be.We have been using Pumpmate storage liners and found them to be much easier and simpler to use. They are shaped like playtex disposable drop-in liners and the starter kit comes with a screw-on adapter to use with your pump so you can pump directly into the liners. (You can also use it to pump directly into a playtex disposable nurser with a drop-in liner for fresh milk) It's as easy as pumping into a collection bottle. You can then seal it, freeze, thaw and feed directly from the same bag! No pouring involved!The Pumpmate liners are comprably priced to Medela bags and are so much easier and simpler to use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Twist ties??","review":"I find these bags really hard to use.

I feel like writing Medula and telling them they need to rethink their design. They expect you to be able to attach the bags to the pump things with a twist tie and then manipulate them without getting milk all over. The instructions actually say to prop them up in a cup or something to prevent from leaking??? Im sorry but pumping is a chore in itself and there is nothing worse than opening your freezer to LEAKED milk that you painstakingly gathered. Try the Gerber brand bags..they have a neat zip lock top and you can safely stack them on top of each other in the freezer!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Big Fan","review":"I had received these with my pump and although it may be nice to use them I found buying the bottles that fit on the end of the pump much easier and then i could combine the milk and place it in a storage container for the fridge or freezer. Also I am not one to spend money needlessly so instead of buying all of these expensive storage containers I found the Avent Via and just cheap gerber bottles with disks on the top the best and cheapest way to store breastmilk.

Propllerheads are great-they have a nice sense of groove, and also I have to admit, quite a sense of humor. They combine alot of funky basslines with old spy themes from James Bond movies, and the result is actually very inventive. It's obvious that they have many different musical influences: reggae, jazz, rap, funk....

I first heard it shortly after it came out, after my friends were raving about it. Frankly, I was not impressed. It was one of the very few times I have raised the question, is the whole world on mind-altering substances? Quite too frequently I hear people complaining about elevator music. In my opinion this is so close to elevator music, it is scary. Sadly, my friends who made me listen to this CD also hate elevator music. I am a fan of The Chemical Brothers, Prodigy, and Crystal Method. I was shocked to find that quite a few people who bought the Crystal Method CD also bought this CD.

The music is very repetitive, and not fit for repeat listening. Once you get to \\"History Repeating\\" you look at the irony in the name of the song, because history, and beats, have been repeating for a very long time. Although the album on a whole isn't very good, \\"A Number of Microphones\\" is awesome and made me want to beatbox, it is a fabulous piece of work in that field.

From the first track--titled \\"Take California\\"--I realized that I'd glommed onto a very different CD.Instead of calling the compositions on the CD techno or any other variation on that theme, I'd like to think that DECKSANDDRUMSANDROCKANDROLL may be what Jazz is headed for in the millenium.

I ordered this oriole feeder in hopes of keeping these beautiful birds coming to my yard and eliminating bee problem. Even though this product has bee guards, bees were attacted to it.

The one I got is almost the same but the bee guards are little spring loaded buttons that almost cover the feeding hole. I say almost because the button leave a space that allows bees to get to the nectar. I finally had to take the feeder down because it would be completely covered with bees and a nuisance around the patio area. If ever a feeder with a \\"real\\" bee guard is manufactured I'll be the first in line to buy it. As for the one I got, I give it a thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I used this feeder for three months and the hooded orioles were happy with it. They figured out the bee guard quickly. Other visitors were chestnut backed chickadees and humming birds who came to lick the nectar at the seams where the two part base is screwed together and lick the droplets clinging to the base.The tab on the top of the container prevents it from sitting flat on the counter for filling, so put it into a bowel upside down. Cleaning is easy, just fill it with a weak solution of bleach.I found that the best way to tighten the container and two part base is to screw them together upside down. Screw the top half of the base to the container and then screw on the bottom half of the base so you can press your thumb against the knuckle of the perch hinges. Getting it tight may be difficult for those with arthritis or weak wrists.A product that's designed to hold water and leaks rates only one star.

For some reason where the pieces screw together at the base for easy cleaning leaks and the feeder is empty by morning. Both of them. It needs some sort of seal I would think. This is getting really expensive replacing feed every morning so I am going to look for another feeder..

It allows them to freely move around the frame when selecting a hole.Here is the bad design!!! It is important to keep the feeder clean at all times... This feeder does not allow easy access for clean-up. Buyer, please be aware, this product needs to be re-design, and purchasing this as-is, is a waste of your hard earned $$$.Try the Fliteline Junior instead, if you care about a clean feeder on re-fills, while Opus Plus manufacturer make the needed improvement on their design!Fliteline Junior [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with design","review":"I purchased this oriole feeder, and when I used it the first time, I realized that the design of the upper part (that holds the nectar) caused a few problems. It has a very small opening where you fill it...so plan on using a small funnel. That's not a big deal. However....when it comes time to clean that part, it is an impossible task. If the fill opening were big enough to use a bottle brush to clean, and larger to make filling easier, it would be a good oriole feeder."},{"rating":"2","title":"best oriole feeder I have ever found","review":"I have used dozens of these feeders over many years.

First of all the container is a really awkward shape. It does not fit in your hand very well due to it's wide girth. An old soda bottle would be easier to handle! Secondly, it has a very small mouth which makes it difficult to insert a bottle brush. Then on the inside there are small plastic squiggles that hold the nectar dispensing buttons on which are also difficult to clean. The other problem is emptying the bottle. It's flattened at the bottom and even with vigorous shaking you can never completely empty it.If they were to change the shape of the bottle (make it smaller in girth and widen the mouth) It could be a great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not place where sun shines.","review":"The oriole's didn't like this, but it didn't last more than a week until the sun beating on it warped where the bottom connected to the middle section & then it leaked.

They liked the hummingbird feeder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bees In -- Birds Gone","review":"I purchased this item based on its claim of the patented bee guards keeping bees out. First off it does not look like the picture, the drinking holes are round and have a small button inside that the orioles will push down to feed. Unfortunately, the bees learned within about an hour how to push the button down. They then go in to drink, can't get back out and die. The entire bottom of the feeder was full of bees within 24 hours of hanging the feeder. Does not work as intended. And is definitely not the same product shown."},{"rating":"2","title":"good feeder","review":"I've had this out for a couple of weeks now and it seems to be working fine. Seems to be well made and has not leaked. The orioles went to it within a couple of days. The picture looks like the feeding stations are made of rubber or something, but the one I received is hard plastic with the little plastic balls to keep bees out. The orioles just push the ball through to get the nectar.

The story line, some of it taken from actual documented cases, and most taken stricly from the mind of the author, is spellbinding. It is all quite believable that this very scenario could play out in the not too distant future.There's a little (or a lot of) something for everyone: drama, suspense, passion, love, sex, murder, weapons, heroism, oppression, and triumph.

But despite Bogdanovich's self-serving cinematic rationalizations for seducing and manipulating a vulnerable beauty, the performances save the day; everyone from seasoned actors Audrey Hepburn and Ben Gazarra, to future star John Ritter, to emerging talents like Patti Hansen and Blaine Novak (and the luminous Stratton) are fabulous in their understated grace and charm.Includes an interesting interview with Wes Anderson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"The plot is hard to follow, and doesn't make a lot of sense.

Ben Gazarra was terrible. He just wallked around with a smirk on his face and all the women he knew were supposedly smitten with him. He was so miscast in that role. He is a short man and not very masculine. It is hard to imagine women swooning over him. I regret having wasted my time watching this.

I love wacky romantic comedies, however, this is neither romantic, funny, fun, or intelligent. It is simply lacking a script, and a good director.

I listen to her CD in my car everyday instead of listening to the radio or music. It is an incredible way of realizing how fortunate we are in life. Most importantly that we can create anything we want in life. Good or bad. It is a choice. Louise helps to make the right choices and to believe. Afterall, she never finished high school and came from an abused home. Look at her success. One day I hope I am fortunate enough to meet her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much time spent on the negative???","review":"I have really appreciated all that Louise Hay's has done throughout the years, but the CD that comes with the book spends way too much time on the negative. I thought it was suppose to be inspiring affirmations. Instead, each track starts out for the first couple of minutes on how bad we are, I can't even listen to the CD. I can see mentioning on the first track that we need to be aware of how many negative thoughts are ruling us then go onto how we can improve those negative thoughts. You are supposed to focus on what you do want so I guess I will have to make my own CD.

When God saved me, he saved my marriage and I've been kicking the enemy away from my wife for 5 years. Well, since then the Lord has been testing me, like he did Abraham. I rebuked the enemy and STOOD firm on God word and it seemed like the more I trusted God the worst things got. I mean really bad for me and my wife. Well, I did what Nancy talks about in this book.

This particular book looked like a humorous quick read, which it was. Actually, it read too fast (took me under 1 hour) and took constant jabs at American business and culture. Written by a French author, I wasn't surprised by the blatant anti-Americanism, and I would guess her cynicism towards business culture will be received the wrong way by many readers in France, where this book has already sold 300,000+ copies. In fairness to the author, she did also poke fun at French laziness and their long time high unemployment rate. I think most Americans who read this book would get a good laugh from this humor, but I seriously wonder how many French will take this advice seriously?

Only the last chapter covers the High Renaissance and it is the shortest one in the book. Instead it rambles on and on through some key artists and leaves things at that. They do not describe at all what distinguishes a certain city or period fom another - instead they hone in on one or two paintings, yak about it for a while and leave the reader to infer what they mean. The very worst part is that most of the paintings they babble on and on about are not even plated in the book.

There is no continuum, no logical progression in the teaching. When you reach the end of a chapter you've forgotten what it was about. I admire the central concept and the work but, frankly, as a book it's completely missed. It is not a textbook, it is not a popularization book, it's a 600+pages small print dissertation. Who wants to read that ? Who has the time to go to the library and check the details of any of the hundreds of referenced articles (all of them are treated only superficially) ?

She is very talented also, not only is she a great singer, but she also composed some of the songs that are on this CD. Majority of the songs are slow ballads and the music is very relaxing. She only has like one or two medium temp ones which were fun to listen to. If you have not heard any of her music and want to give her a try, this is a nice CD. But note: this is a live recording of her concert. Some people may not like that live recordings, if you don't like live recordings and want to listen to Matsu Takako, but never heard any of her songs, I recommend her: Five Years Singles, which contains greatest hit singles from the beginning of her 5 years music career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I really wasn't expecting it to be good as the original version by Kurosawa and Mifune, but this is exceedingly bad. I guess I was expecting a new interpretation of the characters and updated action sequences. No such luck. This is almost a verbatim script of the original and worst of all it's as if the actors were trying to imitate the orginal cast down to facial expressions. I wasn't expecting the masterful camera work of Kurosawa, but this one's down-right amaturish. The actor playing Sanjuro just doesn't have the maturity, toughness, roughness, uncouthness of Mifune. When they cast a younger actor, they should have let him reinvent the character.

I used Mylicon and it worked so well. The only thing is that you really have to follow the directions for it to work effectively.

I also used Colic Calm, which is an all natural gripe water type of medicine and it just didn't work as well for my baby. First, Colic Calm is black and it stains anything and everything it gets on, including your skin. It washes off skin but does not wash off clothing.

I bought it expecting folk-rock at its finest. I must say, I'm disappointed.Not only does this album not live up to classic IG such as \\"Nomads*Indians*Saints\\" and \\"Rites of Passage,\\" it doesn't live up to a lot of other similar artists' offerings (Dar Williams, Ani Difranco). Sure, there are a few songs that have the glimmer of the old IG magic, such as \\"Become You\\" and \\"Starkville\\". Most of the rest though blend together in overly-sappy pop ballads - with the exception of \\"Bitter Root,\\" which just seems woefully out of place.Maybe I'm an IG purist. Maybe I'm a snob. Maybe I'm like the REM fans that think anything after \\"Green\\" or \\"Out of Time\\" just doesn't live up. I don't know. Regardless, \\"Become You\\" just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD for the bonus disk!","review":"Buy this CD for the bonus disk! For me, the Indigo Girls have always been about the lyrics. Yes, the harmonies are wonderful, but it is how these harmonies work with the winding, twisting, turning journey of the lyrics that make their music stand out. I'm not sure that the IGs will ever again have the consistent journey-type lyrics like they did in the early years.The album \\"Become You\\" does have some of the old fire, but the best four lyrics are found on the bonus disk in amy's solo \\"Laramie\\" (\\"tolerance it ain't acceptance\\"). The bonus version of \\"Strakville\\" is soulful, and the bonus version of \\"She's Saving Me\\" is nice as well.

And then, through music, the indigo girls lead us back to this place....almost like a gospel, serene folk music weaved with the wisdom of social consciousness. This album is filled with incredible guitar & piano, exquisite & timeless lyrics & perfect harmony (which I am always amazed by).

I'm just unhappy that I'm stuck with five more bags of these things.There are two primary weaknesses:1) Lack of flavor. I think I need to try the other cracker flavors, because these are just whole flaxseeds with some Bragg Liquid Aminos (soy sauce, basically) and lemon juice, and the flavor is just not enough for me.2) Awful chewing experience. When you eat one of these, the flaxseeds stick. Everywhere. Between your teeth. On the roof of your mouth. Lodged around your jaw.

She seems to like it as well, and stares at it all the time. I like that Eeyore plays music, that is a nice touch. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that the sticker to press to make the music play is off centered, I have to press next to the sticker instead of right on it.

It took me a long time to fully understand the characters in the book. The other day, I heard this book being compared to a glass of water. This person said, \\"It is like water. It really has no flavor, but at least it goes down quickly.\\" I agree with this because overall, I did not like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book","review":"This was just a very boring story.

This is within my top five favorite compilations ever made. The tracks flow into one another smoothy and effortlessly. Jazzanova's arrangements of these songs apply different moods to the album that transend from melodic to jazzy to lounge-like \\"chill time\\" moods. This album is perfect for a dinner party, get together or a summer drive in the country. Plus the mastering on the album is so crisp and clean, that it is hard to believe that these songs were recorded over 20 years ago.Jazzanova hits the mark on making this album as one of the greatest compilations ever made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treat for Blue Note Lovers","review":"As a fan of both Blue Note and Jazzanova, this double CD was the coming together of two musical greats. Jazzanova, known for their forward moves in the dance music genre, was given complete access to the entire Blue Note catalog and came up with over two hours of perfectly chill jazz. CD number one (called Lookin' Back)exposes the listener to the likes of Bobbi Humphrey, Donald Byrd, Bobby Hutcherson, Herbie Hancock, and Freddie Hubbard. Hubbard's cut, Blue Spirits is simply hypnotic and should be experienced by all music lovers.CD #2 is titled Movin' On and features some of the same artists with the addition of Tina Brooks, Sheila Jordan and Eddie Gale. I'll admit to enjoying CD#1 more, but both are wonderful in their own right. It is an excellent compilation for one who loves jazz and for someone who wants more exposure to the art form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful time, wonderful album","review":"Let me concur with my Swedish colleague and add one thing: The arrangement on \\"Living in the Sunlight\\" is by one of the true originators and masters of big band arranging, Benny Carter. If you look at the personnel for that one cut, you can see why the album cost Geoff Muldaur a fortune. Truth to tell, Geoff's was the first version of the song I heard, thirty-odd years ago, but I've since heard one by Maurice Chevalier, in which--if I remember correctly--he claims that he \\"goes sweemin' with naked weemin!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"...A TIMELESS piece of music","review":"What? you haven't ordered this album yet?

AND .. they spent a ton of money in producing it. Muldaur may never see the return of profit but, ..may I suggest you buy it and play it while you are at home cooking, reading the Sunday paper, driving in your car and in need of a humorous lift to your day.

Basically it's little more than a \\"Laguna\\" pond products DVD. Yes, it covers the very simplest of basics but really doesn't provide enough information to build a good pond much less a \\"perfect\\" pond. It did include a calculation for determining a pond liner size but it didn't explain how to calculate/determine pump size, filter size or type. They essentially discussed their products with a few very basic pond ideas and that was about it. Nothing they discussed creates the \\"Perfect Pond\\". A couple pond magazines would provide far more information.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorites","review":"This was one of my favorite childhood books and I was delighted to find it on Amazon.

The book, however, was in good condition. I bought this for my 19 month old son.

I would like to know what Plantation, Florida thinks of the MUSIC, not Nebraska.Here's what I think of the music: Too much unrelated elements going on at the same time. Too many woodwinds. The drummer doesen't use enough toms, and he plays in 11/16 when everyone else is in 21/32.However, you've got to give them one for being brave enough to release this in 1978, the year after punk took over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"This album is stupid.

Not much filler here, this one is far more composed than their previous works.The final chapter to the band (unless there's more in the vault, Chris Cutler), the Cow, in their own style piece well-formed themes and rhythmic variations into a seamless work of art. Im gushing here, because this is the album I would have liked to create, to summarize the jarring inequities of Western Culture.If you like earlier HCow, without the long improvs and dangling cacaphony, this is the piece for you.

The setting is urban, the characters young and at that stage where they're either successful or bored and onto their next job. The male characters aren't as interesting as the female characters, but they're well done.FLRD is quite similar in style and approach to Russell Smith's novels (eg Noise), but she does a better job with her characters. Russell Smith's female characters are shallow plot decorations, but Roxane Ward's female and male characters are better balanced.Indigo, the main character, is the sort of person one wishes one had as a friend.It's nice to see a woman outdoing the men in writing a funny, urban novel for a change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable introduction to the labyrinth mysteries and powers.","review":"This book is probably the best way to start with the study of the multiple significations and applications of this ancient labyrinth science. Full of very good references, and stangely enlightened insights. Two flaws however: often stays at the surface of an idea, sometimes gets a little carried away.

I was sorely disappointed. I have nothing against bawdy or scatological humor on principle, but I found Rabelais simply boring, tasteless, and completely bereft of genuine humor. This is the sort of thing that gets guffaws from 12-year old boys who think that simply using foul language makes them endlessly witty. If you want early novelists with a tendency toward the bawdy and/or scatological, I recommend Boccaccio, Cervantes and Sterne.

I found it difficult to distinguish who wrote what. And a credit it is to Fred Franks for a brilliant career of personal perserverance and an outstanding performance of service to his country. But to an average reader of history, the book would have benifitted form a glossary of military abbreviations. Frankly, I got lost and eventually gave up trying to keep up. It was written by a military man for the military. As the subtitle states \\"A Study in Command\\". I'll think twice before spending money on a book with Mr. Clancy's name in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"Into the Storm: A Study in Command\\"","review":"This was a good book. It was a fancinating account of what a combat commander has to consider in all his deliberations while planning an attack or defense. The book follows Fred Frank's career from Vietnam, a VA hospital, to Desert Storm. It may bog down for some readers (like me at times) in the mechanics of tactics and strategy but it generally holds one's attention very well. One other point some may see as a detraction from the book is the Authors' tendancy to spend time rebutting what was written in General Scharzkopf's autobiography. The General was critical in some respects of General Frank's attack on the Republican Guard during Desert Storm. There is some obvious frayed feelings over this and it creeps into General Frank's writing. He makes a good case however. I would say it was well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good view of the Army in Gulf War, but slow at times.","review":"The first part of the book has interesting details about the Army's transition from the problems of the 1970's to the professional force of the 1990's. Once the focus turns to Desert Shield/Storm, the book moves at a slower pace; almost too slow.Gen Franks spends too much time giving us the minute details of his planning and execution steps. Although it gives the reader a good perspective of what a general's life was like in this type of operation, I often found myself getting lost in the details (and I was there!).This is not a Clancy-type book, as we have normally encountered in the past. Also, Gen Franks too often defends past criticisms from members of his chain-of-command (Gen Schwarzkopf, etc) that may have occurred during and after the operation.An OK book if you're interested in the Gulf War or the Army of the 1990's. Not a thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For Students of Military History","review":"This book is an excellent read for anyone who is interested in the living, breathing organism that is the U.S. Army. Tom Clancy and Gen. Fred Franks do an excellent job of portraying the team work required for any successful military operation"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book is interesting at points. The chapters regarding General Franks experiences in Viet Nam and his recovery from his wounds are very interesting. However, the book really drags, especially in the middle 250 pages. Unless you are extremely interested in the history of the army's doctrine, I would recommend skipping ahead to the end of the book.

A great book to read if you lead people, learn from General Fred Franks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Listening","review":"I enjoyed reading the book so I was skeptical that the audio would be as good. It was. Simon and Schuster have done a great job abridging the book onto tape. The audio is crisp and clear. Boyd Gaines and Ken Jenkins do a terrific job as the voice characterizations for the book. I felt as if I were listening to General Franks himself. \\"Into the Storm\\" is General Franks' personal story of his life from Viet Nam to the victory in the Gulf War. Great listening, well worth the price. 5 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title doesn't cover the story.","review":"Unfortunately, although I am sure Tom Clancy and Franks do try to give a spectator's view on the Gulf War too much time is spent on other aspects like Franks' military career which are interesting but are too elaborate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good! But be prepared.","review":"This book by Tom Clancy is great. It gives an in depth view into command, tactical and strategic. Yet it is very hard to read if you do not read it carefully. If you are a person who reads quickly and does not take the time to absorb some of the lingo then you will hate it. If you are into the Military and have the time and patience to absorb the terms in the beggining than this book is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Some authors have the knack of writing non-fiction and creating a vibrant, readable narrative. In this category, Winston Churchill, Bruce Catton and Shelby Foote come to mind immediately. Tom Clancy's fiction is good but I found this latest of his books mired in trivia and dull, dull, dull"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent study in the requirements of leadership","review":"There are a lot of books out there about leadership, but most of them are useless and stupid. This book, however, is extremely valuable as a tool to teach leadership. The book examines General Franks' life and command, and his theory of leadership.If all leaders operated as he did in the first Gulf War, then there would be far fewer problems. There is a lot of minutia and detail in this book as in all Clancy works and collaborations, but those details just go to show you how good leadership basics allow a person to lead even critical and complicated efforts.Scrap all those vapid management books that the worst managers read, and find out how a man with a proper understanding of leadership works."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Will Put You to Sleep","review":"I have read many of Tom Clancy's fictional books and have enjoyed them all. However, this book does not live up to his normal \\"can't put the book down\\" level.

I will never again assume that the Tom Clancy name implies a good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the Storm:is a terrible book about a fascinating battle","review":"I have read all of Clancy's books. He should be embarassed his name is one this one, his portion of this book is mediocre. Franks writing \\"style\\" if you can call it \\"a style\\" is not only boring but patently self serving. As a genuine war hero Franks should have used a first class writing assistant. This great battle in American War History deserves far better than this very poorly written and confusing book. Hopefully,someone of the caliber of Stephen Ambrose will give the men and women of Desert Storm what they deserve - An exhilerating fast paced action narrative history of the people, logistics and strategy of this great battle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tough technical slog for civilians","review":"Clancy does a superb job of researching the techo wiz factors for his excellent works of fiction. Then he trys to turn the research notes into books. For the military uninitiated they can be a tough read. INTO THE STORM is the rebuttal to the Schwartzkof book \\"It doesn't Take a Hero\\"(?) Far too technical. I was looking foward to Clancys treatise on Desert Storm in his usual style but was very disappointed with this Military Manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for historians and researchers","review":"This is quite simply the worst book I have ever finished. I must admit, that in places, I skimmed over the text.If you have ever been forced to listen to someone recount their golf round shot by excruciating shot, you know what it is like to read this book. It is virtually impossible to follow the troop movements without intense concentration or constant referral to the few maps included. Dry as dust.Like me, many Clancy fans will be suckered into purchasing this book on his name alone. This will be a mistake. I found no Clancy here. This book is an obvious response by General Franks (who I am sure is a fine man and an excellent soldier) to criticism levelled by General Schwartzkopf in his book on the Gulf War.If you are researching Desert Storm, this book may be helpful; otherwise, avoid this book at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just a great radio song....","review":"This is just a great new BLONDIE single.

I'm not a big rap fan but I do like what Blondiedoes here and the retro feel just completes this excellentradio ready song."},{"rating":"2","title":"The GOOD return of Blondie","review":"58-years-old Debbie is still impressive, her voice is passionate and Blondie... just ON TOP like they've (almost) always been. In these days people want to follow the tendencies of the early 80's to feel on top and alternative. Blondie just doesn't need to do that: they carry that atmosphere and spirit with themselves. This single is at the same time new wave and disco, and at the same time 80's and 00's. Blondie is brand new and at the same time the classic Blondie we love. The song is a wonderful born-to-be-a-hit track, with a pretty melody and infectious lyrics. The single brings remixes made by Donna Summer's friend Giorgio Moroder, an updated 80's must. The extended mix is just magic and must brig you to another level, where even on the dancefloor it was all about MUSIC. It's a magic return to form, much more impressive than the mega commercial hit Maria from their previous album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice bracelet with loose lock","review":"I gave this 10k white gold Diamond heart tennis bracelet to my wife on her birthday.

It's not a dual colored liquid goop machine like a lava lamp. It's a bunch of glitter in a colored liquid. And it doesn't keep moving either.

Outstanding tracks are \\"Kylä vuotti uutta kuuta\\" (The village was waitin for the new moon\\") and \\"Ukko lumi\\" (Snow man). These girls had a way of putting you under their spell - maybe it was the Eastern-Karelian mysticism that's so hard to resist for a Finnish audience.

Same old storyline tough cop exidrites a female prisoner brings her back so she can testify against the mob. But the Gauntlet was more satifying than this. I am sorry to say that because i'm a big fan of Charles Bronson, but i'm afraid ol charlie missed the mark here quite a bit. The only thing remarkable in this film is the breathtaking swiss alps scenery. And as for Rod Steiger has got to be the most pathetic villain in film history, a stutering mafiso in love with his mistress. Even the greats like Charles Bronson can make bad chocies at times and appearing in this terrible,boring film is one of those times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good scenic photography, but that's about it.","review":"Bland thriller in which Charles Bronson must deliver gangster's moll Jill Ireland to police while assassins trail them all the way by boat, train and plane. There's little suspense in Wendell Mayes' script (he also wrote DEATH WISH 1) but attractive scenic photography makes up for the movies lulls. This lumbering film is basically just an excuse for Ireland to change wigs every ten minutes, her Southern belle accent is also particularly annoying. Does she end up taking a bullet? Could there be a merciful higher being in existance to save us from her dreadful performance? If you're curious: watch it, if not: then don't bother. It's not the sort of movie you remember well the following day. In fact the most memorable part of LOVE AND BULLETS is the last 20 seconds.

It is laced with French and Italian influences, set to hypnotic dance beats and trancy synths.Personally I love the album. The Benassi Brothers dipped a hand for the track \\"Summer Souvenir\\" which makes it fun, exciting, and a bit psychotic towards the end.While some of the songs on this disc are similar, overall the disc is very appealing and a lot of fun to listen to. Her voice, while thickly accented, is easy and enjoyable to sing to, and the songs are simple enough to be universally understandable.I recommend it, it's a great dancey album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Buy!","review":"I am in love with this cd. I had previously limited my French cds to just Alizee and a little bit of Garou, but this cd is my favorite. It has that great hit Tu es foutu, but also alot of other songs that are cathcy and fun.

I love it and highly recommend it to those tired of American pop and especially those who liked Alizee."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This album stinks. Because there are two CDs, it stinks twice as bad. The only reason I can think of to explain the good reviews written about this album is that they all must be written by In-Grid's relatives. The music is so shallow and simple that anyone could go to Radio Shack, buy the cheapest electronic keyboard, press the DANCE BEAT button and a few other keys, and produce equivalent music. After hearing that same stupid beat over and over, track after track, I couldn't bear to listen to more than the first few seconds of the next track. The voice wasn't much better. If the music was good, I could deal with the voice. And, there were too many times when she ran out of words and we get to hear lots of la la la la, dum de dum dum's. Well, I don't like to pay for those either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"In my mind, this album is great. From the moment i started i loved it. There are two tracks on there that break the flow of the album, Ah l'Amour l'Amour & Va au Diable. I dont like these two songs becuase there flavour is totally opposite from what we heard for the first 10 songs.The use of the accordian with the music is spectacular. If the album removed those 2 songs as a whole i would have rated it 5 stars. The songs have catchy sounds to them, you want to sing along.

From their position, they could speak of what they saw as the deaths continued to mount all around. Many of the poems are awkward and sentimental, many rely on limp rhymes, many wear their hearts on their sleeves. Most ache with wounds that will never heal. The authors' courageous struggle to face the eternal suffering of war, to try to find words to express how others' suffering has deeply moved them, gives some of these works a rough edge that cuts the reader to the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visions of War, Dreams of Peace","review":"Book was advertised as \\"used in good condition\\" and that was a precise description.

I honestly do not understand what the editor was doing or how this landed publication with Tor. The author has a tremendous amount of great ideas but he simply does not know what to do with them: in fact, he does not know how to write. The subplot is hilariously contrived. The writing itself is stacked with adverbs, adjectives and similes. There is not a single paragraph that does not need some form of reworking. Some sentences are shockingly poor. On average, this book has the tone of a slightly confused writing exercise, and I exemplify: \\"Then, realizing in full what he was holding in his unworthy hand, he dropped the parchment to the desk with a quiet yelp.\\" I wish the author had been assigned a competent editor who is not afraid of using a read marker because the ideas are there. But the writing? Atrocious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"I'm a big fan of Brandon Sandersons work, but this one didn't have quite the polish of his others.

I do have to say that some parts of the novel put me off. At times the dialog just seemed to drag on as a lot of back history was given as speech. Also the names for people, places and things all started getting a little to similiar.One of the strong aspects that made me want to keep reading was the orginality of the piece. It was a totally differnt look at how magic could operate in Fantasy. Also there was a good mix of political and religious intrigue to keep me guessing on what was going to happen.The twists at the end were also a huge plus to make the book better. All in all i have to give this book a 4 star review, the dialog and general slowness of the story keeps it from being a 5. I have ordered the first book of the mistborne series to see how his writing goes from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ending...","review":"This novel had some fabulous inventive and creative ideas in it. I hope to see better dialogue writing in the next books. Unfortunately, the dialogue was stilted and manufactured (almost painfully so), like one would find in a book for teens 10-14, for those: they would enjoy.The ending more than makes up for the contrived dialogue and slow pace. :) I WILL read more of Brandon's books. I expect him to get better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT NEW ADDITION TO FANTASY","review":"What a joy it was to finally read a self-contained 1 volume long EXCELLENT fantasy novel. The best fantasy novel I've read this year by far! Sanderson is a fine new addition to the world of fantasy. Only reason he gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because there were several parts within the novel which I thought dragged a bit. This novel is in the same league with The Briar King. Buy it! Read it! Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I think a hundred pages could have been easily edited from this novel.

I assumed that the story would be a solid read seeing as it has had solid reviews and a 4 and 1/2 star rating. I was dissapointed to say the least.The politics of the story is my only gripe, but a big one no less. It seemed that the first 200 pages were bogged down with nothing but Victorian era intrigue and politics. This is interesting if spread out in a span 100 pages, but the book seemed to focus more on the manouvering of several groups to gain the throne of a kingdom and less and characters and a true story.Extremely disapointing. I have to say that I intend on reading his Mistborn trilogy but with lower expectations than I previously had."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable fantasy story","review":"Elantris is the first novel by Brandon Sanderson I have read and I am now keen to read more. The story is highly imaginative and richly detailed.In places I feel it possibly lost it's way in a story sense but overall when all is said and done I was very satisfied.

After reading this book, I find myself struggling to decide which one I like most. The unique cultures and storyline of Elantris are matched by the impressive characterization.

I wish he would write another book about this world because it's so well done and I want to read more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it.","review":"Good story, as with other Sanderson books most of the action happens at the end.

Great characters and a good complete story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"The only thing bad I have to say about this book is that it ended.

You have to read it to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very timely and enjoyable","review":"I generally avoid fantasy novels, but was assured by people I trust that this one was different and well worth reading. I now heartily agree. What I most appreciated was the thorough discussion of somewhat similar faiths differing in one flavor offering convert or die as its only argument, with others (and secular alternatives) seeking Truth, rather than only victory. This has obvious relevance to our own world, as does the idea of one culture being briefly so powerful and advanced that it feels able to ignore threats better not ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut Novel","review":"Elantris tells the story of a fallen city where the inhabitants were once beautiful and possessed magical abilities. The city and the inhabitants fall from glory when the Elantrian people lose their magical abilities, their skin turns a hideous color with dark patches and any wound the receive will never heal. Elantris is a very well written novel, and is a very enjoyable read. It is filled with politics, action, and some great new ideas. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but was somewhat disappointed in the ending. I kept expecting an awesome revelation about what caused Elantris to fall- with all of the the scheming and such taking place, I was hoping for something more interesting than what was presented in the book. That is my only complaint against an otherwise great novel. Definitely pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ok","review":"This book was just Ok. In some ways it was very unique because of the setting but I found the characters to be too perfect with no flaws which made them a little boring. I found myself trying to hurry and get to the end for the big climax which was again unique but it didn't make up for the lack of character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very long with little forward momentum","review":"I like the concept of Elantris and I bought it because I really liked Mistborn (another novel) and Orson Scott Card raves about it on the cover...This is a good idea that overstays its welcome. There is no forward momentum to the story. The merchant-king angle does not remain logically consistent. You have these brilliant businessmen who have no common sense. Tons of exposition in the dialogue. Then the ending is rushed through with several 'revelations' that seemed a bit convenient.Read Mistborn, which is a very worthy novel by the same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Very good book I wish there was another book to keep it going.

If you are looking for more Mistborn... look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"I have to confess I couldn't finish it. It was too silly and unserious.

This book was almost embarrassingly bad compared to the Mistborn Trilogy and the books he wrote in the Wheel of Time.

If this was the first novel I read of his, I probably wouldn't read another."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"This is my second Brandon Sanderson book. I actually started with his most recent book,Warbreaker (Sci Fi Essential Books). That was good enough to get me to look at his other books, so I read this on my most recent vacation. It met my expectations and confirmed that I like his style of fantasy.The setting of a glorious city gone awry created a fascinating background for his tale. The lead characters had intriguing personalities and possessed great leadership skills. The political intrigue was a very key and fun part of the story. I especially liked the princess and her drive and ability to take charge of things.The antagonists were also done well, especially Hrathen. The story had enough twists to keep my interest as I read the book.I recommend this book to anyone that likes or want to explore the fantasy genre. I will be sure to read his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Ribbon Reeboks","review":"I always wear Reebok walking shoes because they tend to be made more narrow -I have a narrow foot, so this is important to me.

But old Waller was against slaves reading or writing. Sarnyand John both knew it, but John kept teaching. When Sarny learnedher first word, she wrote it everywhere in the dirt then rubbed it out.But right when Sarny was about to rub it out old Waller came and saw.Sarny just stared at him.I would suggest this book to strong 4th grade readers all 5thgrade readers and slower 6th grade readers because of how big thefont is and how short the book is.

Nightjohn, written by Gary Paulsen, was a good book.Nightjohn was the main character of the book. John was a slave that could read. He tries to teach Sarny how to read. Waller didn't want the slaves to read because he doesn't want them to get together and make an escape plan.I think someone should read Nightjohn because the book tells you about slavery. The book tells you how the slaves work, sleep, and how they can't do much stuff. This story would be good for someone who likes stories about the past"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and graphic","review":"This story was assigned to me in a college class. It's content is no holds barred, graphic, and intense. I would not suggest children under 12 reading, and some would probably go with a higher age than that. The endearing story of a little girl wanting to learn to read, as taught by a heroic slave is the stuff good stories are made of. Is this a good book? Yes, no doubt.

In Sarny's case, a young slave in the book Nightjohn by Gary Paulsen, she had always wanted to be able to read and write. Since she was a slave, Sarny could never learn how to read or write. She could never learn until John, a slave that her master had bought. John then began teaching her how to read and write. Quickly she learned a letter every night, when everyone was asleep. After a couple of days she learned more about John's past. She learned reading and writing until he ran North promising Sarny that we would return.I have really enjoyed reading this short and memorable story. It has really changed the way I think about slavery. It is so cruel what the master will do to some of Sarny's friends. Read this book to find out if John returns.

After a while, Sarney got so excided about the fact that she could read and write that she wrote the words she knew in the dirt. The slave owner found Nightjohn teaching the slave how to read.Nightjohn got both toes chopped off with an ax. After that, Nightjohn took Sarney to a club he had started.

It only covers about half of the lords and includes a prestige class that should have been in the first book. Here, the class just takes up space that could have been better used with more darklords. Or, better yet, they could have made the book bigger to include more of the lords. I would have gladly paid more for a more complete work.On a positive note, the updated stats for the lords are useful and necessary for a Ravenloft game.

The books were in hardback and of course very cheap in those day. I sampled one and then bought the rest. Thurber is very witty, very funny and is easy to relate to. His drawings are wonderful - simple and look so easy. I liked the essays and I loved the cartoons - the one I like best is a chap introducing his wife to a friend 'That's my first wife up there (she is crouching on top of a bookcase and this is the present Mrs Harris.' Another lovely one is a couple in bed with a seal above the headborad and thei wife is snarling 'All right, have it your way -you heard a seal bark.'Thurbers dogs are so evocate.

With robotic voices, thumpy beats and a heavy synthesizer, it's the sort of thing that any child of the eighties would love. And yet, it's not at all retro.Satisfaction, the first single off the album, has this Stephen Hawkings robotic voice singing a duet with a female robotic voice. That woman's voice is present on the rest of the album. I also like the introductory monologue that starts out \\"No Matter What You Do\\". Although many of the songs have a similar sound, they are all very catchy and have me tapping my feet to the beat.The album is aptly titled Hypnotica, and this album could equally serve as a background to work or for dancefloor anthems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for techno fans","review":"I purchased this CD because Satisfaction was catchy. Unfortunatly, the rest of the album wasn't as great. All the songs pretty much sound the same, and lack the variety in beats that Satisfaction offers. I wouldn't buy this for more than $5. I could get on a DJ'ing program and whip this album out in less than a day. You've heard one song, you've heard them all.

Sure, Daft Punk got their sound and so got Modjo and other artists but this is crazy, the songs areso simular it's annoying.

Well, this is not one of those albums. What compelled to get this album because of the club hit 'Satisfaction', which is an addictive song to say the least, thanks to it's heavy bass beats. This whole album, however, is not so addicting. The whole thing sounds like Satisfaction regurgitated. The only other songs I really favored was 'I Love My Sex', and 'Don't Touch Too Much' - but even so, buying the whole album just didn't seem worth it. You might want to stick with the singles for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypnoti-Caca","review":"Like a lot of folks, I bought this CD based on the strength of 'Satisfaction' after hearing it on that Wendy's commercial.

I am a size 9, and I honestly could not believe what I got was a size 9. My toes felt so cramped. I couldn't wear these shoes all night, they were far too uncomfortable. Also, the way they wrapped them made the part that goes up your leg look weird and warped. They did look good, I'll give them that, but the pain wasn't worth it. The arch on them is so extreme and the material so slippery, that your feet push forward, causing your toes to spill out the front. I think that's what made them feel they were too small. They just aren't made well at all. They're made to look good, and comfort wasn't taken into account here. So, if you can deal with a lot of pain, get em. If you're like me and you'd rather be able to wear them all night without crying, then get a pair of flat roman sandals if this is for a greek or roman costume.

When \\"Cannonball\\" Adderley began producing for the Riverside label, he made it a point to record the less recognized of his colleagues. As was the case with Don Wilkerson's \\"The Texas Twister\\" (see my review), Adderley brought in a superb rhythm trio to support tenormen Clay and Newman on this April 26, 1960 session -- Wynton Kelly on piano, Sam Jones on bass and Art Taylor on drums. \\"Sound of the Wide Open Spaces\\" is an all standard affair with the Babs Gonzales penned title track and \\"What's New,\\" which showcases Clay on flute, the disc's strongest moments. \\"Wide Open Spaces\\" is a solid post-bop album, and being that the disc is a 2002 release, I'm delighted to see that there are still gems in the OJC vaults to be reissued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought for my little princess first birthday party","review":"My daughter's first birthday party was princess themed so I searched for a little princess costume for her to wear.

But it is a very very good and unusual kind of self-help book. Yes, the book is NOT about military strategy, but is is about strategy in personal life.

The crew, visual style, all had changed. However, allthough not at all like the original series, it stands out on its own thanks to classics like \\"The inheritors\\" and \\"The demon with a glass hand\\".The majority of the 17 second season episodes are, however, mediocre and some are downright awful. The Probe, the very last episode, is one of the worst. There is enough plot to fill ten minutes, and the cast fills the time by going through some absurd, senseless dialogue. It seems like it was written overnight. The story premise itself (an alien probe examining earth) isn't that bad and could have been the basis for a great story.Sad to see Mark Richman so lost..he was great in \\"The Borderland\\".

I hadn't realized that fact until I read some of the other reviews here, and was prepared to blast Dillard for simply filing off the serial numbers and putting the same plot into a Next Generation novel as had been used in an earlier book; I can only plead in my own defense that it's been a LONG time since I read that book. This book is much better-written than that one, though; I suppose that Dillard matured some as a writer in the intervening years.It would have been nice if that continuity had been more specifically referenced, although in retrospect I can see that it was hinted at.

Apparently this is an outdoor table. With several young children I decided that it wasn't all bad - especially since I was 2 hours into a 3 hour assembly process. There isn't quite the same soft tapping there is with a wood table, but it is considerably lighter and cups left on the table won't raise wood rings.The undercarriage is as solid as I can imagine a 190 lb. table can provide, but the table sways when 5-year old children lean against it. While I wouldn't want to repeat the assembly process, the end result was worth it and our whole family played (or began learning to play). The paddle and ball holders in the center are really handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised!","review":"The frame on this table is sturdy, but the blue top is not synthetic.

I've used it to take pictures, and they come out nicely, but the scope is -big- and I'm having trouble finding an appropriate carrying case for it, which is a bit of a pain. I'd have gladly paid more for the scope had it come with a custom case.That said, it's lighter than you'd expect, and I had to buy macro ring extenders to be able to take photos closer than 40' or so (the description when I purchased it said 15' minimum focal length. If all you're looking for is a scope, this is very nice for the price (but useless without a very solid tripod). If you're looking for photography adaptation, it's a little complicated and will definitely require those macro adapters. This makes for complicated field work, figuring out which macro adapters (if any) to use, depending on the distance of the object.That said, I -am- very happy with this scope."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Strong Start with a Very Weak Finish","review":"Mr. Ingram started the book out quite strongly with a fundamentally different way to look at relationships than has been done through popular culture and the media for the last 70+ years.

Only a scant few paragraphs are dedicated to addressing that which the author proposed in the front half of the book. In short, Mr. Ingram builds a nice head of steam but vents it off too soon.

Get rid of the proprietary battery. Reap your profits in repeat busines, not in milking each customer for all their worth.2. Give us the fast 1.8 lens found on the C-5050. This one's a no-brainer.3. Get the build quality right. I've seen too many reviews here and elsewhere warning of multiple returns for defective cameras.4. Make extension lens attachments standard.

As always with Plain, it's well written, with good character depth as she pulls you quickly in, and you come to really care what will happen to the individuals involved.Belva Plain's books are always great drama, hard to put down, and make good summer reading; this is a good selection to take to the beach.

You can actually feel the magnetism between Randi and Adam, I sometimes found myself even thinking, \\"stupid, don't go meet her you have a wife!\\" The twists and turns in this book get you hooked and the ending?!?

Probably for the beautiful illustrations on the covers of her books, and also for the plain, simply drawn characters. Unfortunately, I find the language to be outdated and not colloquial enough. You don't hear the verb \\"shall\\" too often. Also, the characters of all her books are pretty much the same. They have a crisis, they get through it, everyone meets a new mate immediately with whom they fall madly in love. I don't buy it, and believe me, I don't. I'll borrow it from the library first"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of touch with reality","review":"I don't understand how the author could think it could be believable that these three \\"perfect\\" children could be the product of such selfish, self-centered parents. Neither Margaret, nor Adam ever consider their children when they make decisions. Yet supposedly, while they were married, they were wonderful parents. I work with people every day who have gone through greater loss than either of these two parents and still have thought of their children before themselves. It is a fantasy to believe that these parents were ever good parents. In addition, I think it is a lazy author who instead of dealing with emotion simply gets rid of someone.

I didn't much like any of the characters, or believe in them for that matter.

Dunne is much too gay all the time (the role is best played when Terry is apprehensive and decision torn). Boyer is diminutive (particularly his head) next to her. The most important nuance of the entire film is completely blown when Michel/Boyer speaks in such a way as not to admit that he was waiting for Terry/Dunne (Empire State Building)and her reaction instead of poignant (as Kerr's) was sought of an odd knowing smile when it should have been the look of a question mark... as Michel had not as yet disclosed that he was actually there. Obviously,the director corrected this reaction and Terry/Dunne's annoying never ending gayety in \\"Affair to Remember.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality DVD!","review":"I have to agree that these are bad prints. I bought 5 of these Madacy DVDs and will return all of them. I am not usually very picky about quality. A good VHS tape is just wonderful to me. These DO NOT COME CLOSE TO VHS!The sound quality is so bad, I couldn't get through the film. The hiss is not only audible, it drowns out the soundtrack. The picture has weird artifacts that I have never seen before. I could have tolerated them, but the audio hiss gave me a headache. My guess is that the publisher bought a $2.99 VHS tape of these movies and transferred the tape to DVD. No noise reduction whatsoever. Its like listening to a cheap cassette on a $5.00 walkman--I kid you not! You could do just as good a job in your basement with a VHS tape player and a DVD writer. Come on Madacy, you could have at least suppressed that hiss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, poor digital quality","review":"This is a great movie but I couldnt get past how poor the digital quality was.

It isn't worth one cent of its bargain-basement price. Don't buy it -- get this title on VHS instead. Overall, both picture and sound are worse than the VHS version. It appears to have been produced by simply copying a tape version onto a disc. The picture is frequently blurred, and the soundtrack contains what appear to be fragments of conversations and music in the studio where it was recorded. The soundtrack also is done in a \\"pseudo-surround\\" format, consisting of distributing the entire track (voices and music) equally over all five speakers. The dialogue is also frequently hard to make out. I would be doubtful about any DVD from this distributor, MADACY entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic and absolutely loverly","review":"I'm not one to write lengthy reviews. So here's mine.

In her second miniseries, we find that in the small town of Hillsborough, Courtney and her uncle Aloysius are far from the only two magicians in residence. In fact, there's an entire coven of mystics. (You may have guessed that from the title.) One of them is intent on mischief, and it falls to Courtney to uncover the villain. Doing that involves all sorts of experiences she's never had before--such as doing her own homework. Absolutely wonderful, this. Courtney is a fine creation.

I prefer 3rd Person SOCOM type games but this one is different because of the Wii controls. You've never been able to feel more in the game than you can now. The non-stop action will never get you bored especially because you have to stay focused with the Wii Remote. If you have checked my review of this game for PS3 and are wondering why they are so different, let me quickly explain. I rented it and returned it within a couple days because it bored the hell out of me. The main question is... would you rather feel (Wii Gameplay & Controls) like you're in the real WAR environment, or would you rather it look (PS3 & Xbox Graphics) like you're in the real WAR environment. For this reason, as in for other games like Madden, DBZ, etc... is why I choose Wii."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of action","review":"This game keeps moving. It's easy to get lost in the action and lose track of time. You don't get killed at every corner you turn so it's not frustrating in that respect. Controls take a while to get used to. Couple of cons, occasionally waste time trying to figure out how to get out of a blown up house, 2nd the mounted machine gun is non-intuitive. When you lift UP on the butt end the gun nozzle (front) should point down. It's backwards in the game, you basically have to ignore the gun and concentrate on the cursor. It's a little weird having the Sarge tell you to lead the charge when you haven't got any ammo left. Large selection of weapons to shoot from single shot scoped rifles to machine guns, occassional hand to hand, binoculars, calling in tank rounds, etc. Overall lots of fun, I may even let my son play it sometime :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 Best Game on the Wii Launch (Except Zelda)","review":"Call of Duty is the best game that you can get for the Wii with its launch titles. Except for Zelda TP, of course. The story line is incredibly well developed as you lead the ally forces in their liberation of France. The game utilizes all aspects of the systems capabilities as you use the unique motion sensing capabilities to drive a jeep, plant charges, aim a mortor, and even fire your own weapon. The graphics are not quite comparable to those of the PS3's or the 360's, but it never becomes an issure. This game is incredibly fun and I would strongly reccomend it anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun singleplayer, NO multiplayer","review":"This game is actually a lot better then I thought it would be. However, be warned that there is NO multiplayer whatsoever, off or online. I keep seeing companies advertise it as having multiplayer but it really doens't. It would be nice if the game actually did include it, but the developer said it will not be added in the future. I wish companies would stop saying it includes it when it doesn't, because it's false advertisement and I bought it under false pretense because of such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate Sequel","review":"I would blame this game sucking on the Wii, it is unfortunate that the sequel to COD2 had to be this game.

After that I couldn't bring myself to touch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Play Control","review":"This game is horrible, if you have XBox360, purchase it for that system, as you will find the Wii controls way too cumbersome.

However, it actually has him using the remotes to do hand to hand combat, where he gets off the couch and gets active. It provides some pretend driving fun, tanks, jeeps etc. It's not only fun, but it also has built some confidence in him in a more defensive capacity. Aside from the more mature violent content, I really was surprised by the fun of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wii controls make shooter game more natural","review":"Call of Duty 3 is a fun game. I myself have never been good a first person shooter games and was doubtful on whether I would like this game. However, the ability to aim with the remote made it seem much more natural and fun for me. I was able to start feeling like a pro after the first couple missions.The game has some rough spots. Its frustrating to use the reomote motions to do things such as plant explosices as the game doesn't seem to pick up the motions very well, in those situations. I found myself frustrated having to repeat motions alot. The game is also shorter than I expected as I had just finished Zelda and was expecting more gameplay but the couple weeks of fun I got out of it (one mission or so a day) was worth it over all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game!","review":"This game is awesome!

There is no multiplayer mode so all you have is the single player campaign which has nothing even close to the depth of Call of Duty for the PC. On top of that the graphics are poor. I found it hard to tell the difference between a brick wall and an enemy soldier. Maybe I'm spoiled from the excellent graphics of my desktop PC but if you want to play Call of Duty on a budget, do yourself a favor and grab a $40.00 AGP (Radeon 9250 or Geforce FX) 128MB video card and the original Call of Duty PC game. I promise it will be way more fun (with better graphics and exciting multiplayer game play) for around the price of this Call of Duty 3 Wii game alone.

For centuries women have worked alongside men (granted, getting less credit, but working just the same) and only the privileged few could stand idly by while the 'menfolk' talked 'business'.

OK, so \\"brilliant\\" might be a bit of an exaggeration, but in a world full of power metal bands it's nice to be able to identify bands that stand out on their own & not sound completely like all of the other well known bands that are on the scene such as Primal Fear or Metalium, or maybe even the almighty Hammerfall.

A lot of sitar, a few songs in Hindi (I think), Arabic, or Farsi, etc... This is the overall feeling of the album. Also throw in a couple of African and Brazilian vibes here and there. I've played it at parties, and while I study or cook. It never disappoints. It's also a great a.m. drive to work album, as the title suggests.If you don't own any KC, get the original KC album first, just because that one is truly five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great South Asia-inspired club/lounge music","review":"I am so glad to have found this ... for the first CD. In the beginning, there are a couple of good ragas on top of a rhythm section. Other selections are more electronica with the South Asian instruments stuck in for flavor. There are also various Western-style jazz, rock and alternative selections with Middle-Eastern & South Asian samples and melodies. Good variety but it's important to note that it gets less and less South Asian and more California as it goes on. The second CD is mainly California new-agey mood music that would be decent background music, but is otherwise boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"This is primarily a map of central London.

I tried to find Portobello Road in Notting Hill, since a number of tourist information sources said that the shopping was good there, but no such road is listed in this map's street index.

I knew David Scheeres, he lived in my house which was T.K.B. at the time. I don't know about Julia's home life, but I can tell you from first hand experience that she has fabricated a mixture of truth and fantasy in this book concerning the program. We did have boxing matches, but they were strictly between students as a last resort if those students could't get along. In the 16 months that I was in the D.R. I never witnessed a boxing match. I knew alot of the folks that she depicts in her book. My memory is pretty sharp, and I don't recall any of them acting as she says they did in her book.

Her story reinforced my belief that parents who believe they are 100% right about any ideology can destroy their children. Every couple who plans to have or adopt a child should read JESUS LAND first.Scheeres' memoir about being raised in a fundamentalist Christian home parallels the struggles of any child raised with absolute values and beliefs. When there is no space for questioning or original thought a child with a good mind is going to suffer. Scheeres had a good mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read","review":"Julia is a gifted writer who translates raw emotions and pain into a beautifully writen tale of love between siblings against all odds.

Scheeres' writing is simultaneously funny and sad as she narrates the outrageous fortunes she and David suffered growing up in rural Indiana in a mixed race family. Blatant racism, shameful violence, and religious zealotry threatened to wedge them apart but never succeeded.Jesusland is a page-turner, the kind of book you can't put down because you come to care so deeply for the characters and the troubles they're having. I found myself rooting for David and Julia, and even when tragedy strikes, ultimately consoled by the saving grace of their love for each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly Comic","review":"GQ was right when it called this memoir darkly comic.

I literally could not put it down and found myself paging through it at work and at stoplights in the car. My world view was completely changed in reading it.I consider it required reading for Americans because racism and Christian Evangelicism continue to drag this country down, and Scheeres' experience with both is a one in a million story. Her account reveals the workings of extreme Christian fanaticism, how teenagers are abused and brainwashed. It is a call to look into the serious human rights violations of these \\"reform schools.\\"Second, it is an amazing story about two siblings, white and black, who are forced to be each others only family; in the end, the power of sibling love transcends everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"**One Exclent Book**","review":"This book is a collection of historical mysteries.

Not only is this album overtly violent, cliched, and cheesy, but the songwriting lacks any sort of real talent and the songs mostly rely on their use of audio clips from movies and other such sources. Quite frankly, the cover art and song titles alone would and should be enough to justify and solidify my review of this piece of trash. I am surprised Tribunal even bothered with releasing two albums from this band when they have released much better albums and ep's in times past.

Alcoholism is sad and serious; however, Lewis is a self-indulgent egomaniacal narcissist who thinks he is the most important person to ever recover from the disease. He offers superficial reflections on his disease and recovery, and is barely able to conceal what this book is truly about: his obsession with himself, his career, and friends he repeatedly refers to as \\"famous\\" but never names. No idea who gave this man a book deal, or who edited it for that matter - it could be cut down to four pages and it would offer the same amount of value.

I was looking for humor but generally found it to be a tedious read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Time (and money)","review":"What an absolute waste this is, and that comes from someone who's enjoyed Lewis's humor for more than twenty years. It's repetitious as hell, directionless, and not even clever or humorous. It seems to have gone straight from the tape recorder to the printer without the guiding touch of an editor who could have made this book a guide for those without addictions. Such a work could have been as informative as it was entertaining, but this work is neither, the total antithesis of what I expected from one as gifted as Lewis. A ponderous read to begin with, it crawls to a plodding pace as his health ostensibly improves. If the point of the book is to illustrate how a harrowing addiction drives away those who like you, then this book has succeeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"I love Richard Lewis, but this book was actually ... depressing. I had to stop reading and just skim the rest. It was repetitious. I never really understood what pain of his childhood he was trying to escape by drinking.

It was too shticky to be meaningful, but too serious to be funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE OF KNOWLEDGE","review":"This book may have a lot to say to people either in recovery or needing recovery but I was greatly put off by the foul language that appears to command Mr. Lewis' language skills. I hope he moves on to recovery of his communication skills next. What a shame to have a message to share and not be able to do it in a way that people who don't use profanity can relate to. Am I to believe that all people needing recovery from substance abuse are also consumed with disgusting expressions of the English language? I don't think so!!

They were SO excited when at 3, they were allowed to take 3 tabs instead of 2!These work. I don't think you have to be adamant about giving them to your child every hour like the directions say, though.

These contain what? 1 billionth of a billionth of a few real herbs plus lactose sugar. That is why you can basically give these to newborns, because all it really is is milk sugar. My little boy stopped crying because he thought I was giving him candy, not because this treated him. I know there are those who swear by this....it is a pure placebo effect my friends.

Even though there are many wonderful Disney films, this particular selection far surpasses most children's and many adult films I have ever seen. Julie Andrew's performance with a superbly chosen supporting cast could not be a more perfect accoutrement to P.L. Traver's book. In many cases, movies made from books are a disappointment; not in this case. I am a younger 'old-school' Disney fan, and like very few of the Disney movies made after the 60's and 70's because I grew up watching films like Dumbo, Bambi, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty.

This movie pleases everyone. It's got a great soundtrack (don't know if it's still available but I inherited my mom's old LP record!), great acting (anything with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke has to be good), and has some scenes where live action and animation are combined. This was all done without the technology of today, yet another reason to appreciate the work in this film. The remastered DVD editions are great.

There are numerous little facts and stories all throughout the bonus features that are sure to interest fans.

But we are all in on it and it makes it like a scavenger hunt, who can find what. He even got a signature from Dick VanDyke himself.

Nothing wrong with that when you can pop in one of the most cheerful children's classics ever. (Even grownups love the music--ok, admit it, you do.) The songs are brilliant, Julie Andrews sings like an angel, and Dick Van Dyke was a stroke of genius as Bert the chimney sweep--as lucky as can be!Other than the risk of hearing \\"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" to excess around the house after playing this film, what's not to like? The funny thing is that the movie is not exactly true to the more acerbic style Poppins of the P. L. Travers novels (she was NOT all sweetness and light, just read it.)

Now that I have a child of my own, I CANNOT WAIT to introduce this movie to him. I'm a firm believer in reading to your children. My son is not 2 yet, and I have constantly read to him since he was an infant, but...this is one time where he'll see the movie before having the book(s) read to him. I've introduced this move to a nephew and a cousin and they were mesmerized. It made me enjoy the movie even more, watching it through their eyes. The songs are EXCELLENT. Dick Van Dyke is AMAZING (also check him out in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang) and Julie Andrews is at her BEST (along w/The Sound of Music). This is the magic of Disney at its best.

This is not the case with Mary Poppins. The songs are still fresh and vibrant. As a whole this is the most re-watchable musical flick ever, so I'm happy to have it in DVD. Highly recommended to adults, even those that were put off Disney by \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and the rest of the Eisner era dreck-to-theater.However, I have to admit that from a technical point of view, Mary Poppins shows its age. The blend between humans and cartoons is not that good, so you have to try harder to keep your disbelief suspended.Anyway, it has great nostalgic value for me. Perhaps kids might like it, too... I'll show it to my little nephews and tell you later."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASIC 40TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION","review":"A great deluxe treament to an equally great film.

As an adult, I reconnect with that child's enthusiasm every time I see Mary Poppins, although the attraction I felt for Julie Andrews is better understood. There are not enough adjectives to describe it but enchanting stands out. Unforgettable and a touch of true magic from Disney. Julie Andrews will always be frozen in time for me and what a fantastic treasure she is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A feel good Disney Movie","review":"Is there no better movie out there than Mary Poppins. With stars Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, you are assured of great acting and music. Dick Van Dyke for me is one of the greates actors of all times, especially when you're talking his earlier works like this and 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'. His songs and acting are all fun and exciting.The special effects on this is definitely outdated by our standards but were cutting edge way back when.If you have kids, this will be worth your time. They love the way at the end when the kids take over the castle and put the 'Child Catcher' in the big net. He always disturbed me as a child, just something about the way way his face was made up. He has the same effect on my daughter as the Oompa Loompas of the orignal Wonka movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kid Loves It","review":"This is more like a play, we don't need much settings. We have fewers characters and a simpler plot than The Sound of Music.Having said that, this is still a marvelous movie. I like the chimney sweeper and one man band. I like the part of Mary Poppins or even Mr Bank and his woman-liberalizing wife and even the captain next door-- he reminds me of Captain Shotover of Bernard Shaw. Now that Harry Potter, The Worst Witch are so popular, winds are certainly blowing Mary Poppins' way too. I rank this right next to The Sound of Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family classic","review":"My 4 year old son, 2 1/2 year old son and 1 year old daughter all enjoy this film.

She's watched classics like the Wizard of Oz (a fave!), Black Beauty, and Dumbo countless times. While these films do show their age, they have nonetheless held up well over time and we've all viewed them over and over. I had never actually seen Mary Poppins until recently, and found this film to be quite disappointing--as did the grandchild, who was ready to hit the road before the kids even appeared. Everything about this movie is annoying, from the made-for-TV type effects, to the accents, to the very predictable story itself. It's neither fun, nor satisfying, and definitely not engaging for kids. Get the anniversary edition of Wizard of Oz instead--it's a far, far better film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie!","review":"I grew up watching Mary Poppins and loved it.

Yeah yeah, I have no soul or heart, but I just don't like this film one bit. I can't stand it when musicals come up with a musical number every five minutes. Musicals that do really annoy me, and this is an example. There's always talk that this movie was famous for combing live action and animation. but that's only for what--ten to fifteen minutes? There's no adventure, no heartwarming, it''s just people singing pointlessly. I remember getting bored with this utterly ridiculous movie. I'm not much a fan of the Sherman Brothers, or at least not in THIS movie. Mary Poppins herself is not an interesting character, correcting poor Michael when he's not perfect, just acting firm most of the time.

It's great all around, and Julie Andrews deserved her Oscar. What this reviewer would like to reiterate is the performance of Dick Van Dyke. A solid performance with a British cockney accent, singing, and excellent physical dance routines (i.e. dancing with animated penguins!) to rival Gene Kelly. Not bad for someone who really isn't a trained dancer. Dick Van Dyke's starring role equaled that of Julie Andrews and probably was the highpoint of his career next to his tv show. If given a lifetime award, it would be for this performance. If someone else had the part of Bert, the film would not be the classic it is today. Kudos to Dick Van Dyke and to MARY POPPINS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure to get your children dancing!","review":"My 2 year old LOVES this movie!!!

A Magnificent score restored!","review":"Here, at last, is the legendary Miklos Rozsa's COMPLETE score to the 1961 biblical epic KING OF KINGS, beautifully restored and presented by the people at Turner and Rhino. Those of us who love this score were subjected to an LP in the 1960s that only contained a fraction of the score. When KING OF KINGS finally arrived on CD, there was more of the score available, but it all sounded dreadful. Now, the errors of the past have been rectified, and all the beauty and nuance of Rozsa's music is here, and thensome! There are cues included here that weren't even in the film itself (as released). This is a true treasure for anyone who loves great film music, with incredible sound (hard to believe this was recorded 40+ years ago) and a beautiful package that lovingly re-creates the original souvenir program that accompanied the old roadshow presentations of this epic masterpiece. Grab this one, and you won't be able to stop playing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank goodness for meastering!","review":"I think was probably one of the last people to purchase the original deluxe edition of this disc in vinyl before MGM stopped making it. I paid about as much for it as I did for this wonderful new release.I even had the souvenier program that came with it. Only problem with the one in the new set is the very small print. Anyway, the newly remastered disc is a true masterpiece. I didnt realize how much music had been eliminated from the original recording,even though I purchased the video several years ago. I particularly liked some of the background information,which pretty much summed up my feelings about the movie being underappreciated for years. The same can certainly be said for this wonderous CD!Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mother of Soundtracks","review":"This is simply one of the most beautiful scores ever written!

The material is of high quality 18/10, heavy weight, continental size(which means larger than the standard place settings), and quite a nice polish. The problem I have is the side edges have a rough finish, almost like they forgot to buff out the square edges. Other than the serving pieces, all the forks and spoons have this rough edge, which does not match the high quality of the set. I don't know if this is the Riveria style, but I highly doubt it. I compared it to the pieces from Oneida at LNT, as well as the 2 styles from Costco, and they have nice rounded edges, unlike these. I don't know if others notice this, or I just received a bad set.

They used many aspects of science to prove this point, but twisted and molded these ideas to suit National Socialist dogma. Heather Pringle's book investigates and illustrates how various sciences were used to show that \\"Aryans\\" were the superior race. Heinrich Himmler, being the dreamer he was, tried to twist history(prehistory) to show that the Germans were meant to rule the world and that they in fact were responsible for all the greatness of civilization. He enlisted scholars of all sorts to \\"flesh\\" this out. Along the way he encountered charaltans and crackpots and even respected acadmeics to his cause. Pringle tells this ghastly story well, well qualified from her earlier book about Mummies. This story will repluse some, but the lessons it teaches are well worth reading, it has exposed another of the inhumane and incredulous facet of the Third Reich."},{"rating":"1","title":"A liberal, politically correct study","review":"As a librarian and researcher of this topic, I feel that Edward P.

About 10 pages have been bent inward and torn upon receiving the book. Somehow, the outside of the book is in pretty good condition, although not what you would expect from a brand new book.

Stick with it, though. I finished this as I sat in the back of my truck on lunch break at a construction site and the words \\"wow\\" and \\"holy sh*t\\" came involunarily from my lips. The ten million year history is wrapped up in a sequence of stunning stories concerning the ultimate fate of humanity and the Universe, and it was a rush of sparking imagination with a wonderfully melancholy finish.

For example, the entry under Black Cat said, \\"Perhaps the most famous of all superstitions is the belief that a black cat crossing your path will ensure good luck.\\" I've always thought that black cats were universally considered bad luck, but the book is British, so perhaps the superstition is different in Europe.

Solomon owns the sites Politicsforum.com, Authorzone.com, and Atheistworld.com. He may have also posted reviews of his own book using other names...which would have been the smart thing to do in the first place.If the author has absolutely no integrity and gives his own book five reviews with 5 stars to get people to buy it, why would you trust a book written by him to better understand a religion that has been under attack in recent years? Please, just ask yourself that question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorant scoundrel of an author","review":"This book is simply one of Tulbure's cars for getting more money. He has left a wide wake across the Internet in mercilessly spamming both his books and his websites.Then he drops them like a watermelon and leaves the members with the bag.His books are sophomoric at best. His doctorate and educational credentials are a figment of his imagination, and HE CREATED HIS OWN FOLLOWING! People think Amazon members adore him, but his testimonials were by him, and his fans were him with out screen names.I've tried asking him what his credentials are on his various websites, and all that comes of it is a banning. He simply can't stand by what he says.I recommend that before you even THINK about buying this book that you do a Google search for \\"Solomon Tulbure\\" and press the \\"I'm feeling lucky\\" button. A plethora of information about this internet fraud can be found there.Be wary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"First off the software that I purchased from a rip-off computer store was not what was promised on the box. On the box it states that the software is compatible with Mac OS X and Windows. I installed the software on my computer which runs OS X 10.2. I see this crap is running some print shop suite (not the business card software)and the business card section is extremely minimal. The grahpics are so elementary and I will be complaining to the manufacturer ASAP. It's a shame to advertise falsely. I didn't get what I paid for at all. I ended up using some shareware and the cards look beautiful. Overlook this product.

I found out about O'Neill from Stewart Brand's journal of the time, \\"The Coevolution Quarterly\\". O'Neill was the outer space guru of the age, just as John Lilly was the inner space pioneer. I assumed, as an enthusiastic youngster, that there would be millions of humans living at L5 by now. Unfortunately, we have a government run space program that, like any government bureaucracy, is inefficient and at the mercy of inferior minds (Congress and the White House).

If you like learning about galleries and what motivates material artists generally, you may like this.However, many of us may think this art is a bunch of nothing. Many of us wonder how artists who put a lot into their work go unrecognized but this stuff does.In the same way that a Paul Mooney documentary implied that you're a fuddy-duddy if you don't appreciate his jokes, this work implies that you can't appreciate high-culture art if you don't like his work.But really, I just didn't care for what he presented.

But it lacks many important points. Especially, for someone who is clueless in algebra. For example, in the section Solving Equations the author explains very well what you have to do step by step to simplify the equations. But the author never mentions reodering the terms. Without doing it, a person may get completely lost when he is faced with a more challenging equation. I would still give this book a big credit! But it lacks important points."},{"rating":"2","title":"What does letters have to do with MATH??","review":"I am 41 yrs old and have only ever been taught Business Math. When my girls were young, I started to college part time but avoided Algebra b/c I knew I had no clue what it was. I stopped college, then just decided to go back and finish my degree. I knew I needed knowledge of Algebra. I went to our local Educational store and found this book as well as another to \\"cram\\" for placement testing. I have never used the other book. This book is so easy to read and understand. I'm no dummy, my GPA is 3.7 in college. However, I struggled with algebra. No more. I went through 3/4 of the book in 2 weeks and retained every bit of info I read. I recommend this book for the young and older. It is worth every penny! You will not be unhappy with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks promising, but Kindle edition is riddled with errors","review":"I received this as a gift, and unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to return a Kindle gift, or I would. On the surface, this looks like a wonderful tool for learning or brushing up on algebra, but DON'T GET THE CURRENT KINDLE VERSION! There are formatting errors that make several of the equations un-solvable. It looks as if the Kindle edition was formatted by someone who doesn't know algebra...symbols are missing, exponents are attached to the wrong variable...this sort of thing. As it is advertised, and indeed written as useful to beginners, this will likely lead to confusion and frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I Get It!","review":"Time to go back to college. Math was never my strongest subject. In fact it was my weakest. I had forgotten almost everything I learned in Algebra.I tried two books that claimed to make algebra a breeze. Promises. Promises.Then I bought PAINLESS ALGEBRA for a mere $8.95 and was pleased to find clear step by step explainations. Explanations that didn't require three readings before they made sense.I think the best way to approach the book is by reviewing the previous chapter before you begin a new chapter.A minor complaint: Too few exercises, as is the case with most of these types of books. But you can always find a workbook that will have problems for you to work out and the answers.Being mathematically challenged I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book Is Really VERY good at teaching you algebra.","review":"Ok, I have got to tell you up front that I have NEVER been a Math wiz, but after reading this book I can do algebra. I have never really gotten the hang of algebra. However I will be starting College in the fall, and I knew that if I was to have a chance of making it Past the first few weeks, I'd better Learn Algebra, and fast! So, I found this book, and I was sceptical, but after only 10 pages or so, I started to get a grasp of how Algebra Really works. Now I have read the book, and now I have a good understanding of how Algebra works. (I CAN DO IT NOW!) I would recomend this book to anyone struggling in algebra. However I must warn you This book does OVER simplify things in a few cases. Just don't get confused, or sidetracked. That is the only reason I could not give this book a 5 star rating.In conclusion this book works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concepts clearly presented but too many disconcerting errors.","review":"The lay-out and range of topics are very attractive and useful for people who want to refresh their beginning algebra knowledge. However, in a quick read-through and working of about a third of the exercises, I found at least 5 errors in the text. Unfortunately, they were not obvious typos. Rather, they were errors that made me wonder whether I was mistaken in my understanding. As a mid-career, lateral-entry middle school math teacher who was already questioning her sanity, I lost a bit of sleep over some of these points until I could recheck my knowledge base in the morning.Maybe Barron's will do better with the 3rd edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Really Painless!","review":"If you ever had to have a \\"mercy C\\" in math to graduate from high school, then, this book is for you.

English, Literature, Science, etc., were a breeze for me.

For example, when asked to graph the coordinate (-4, -2), you go to -4 on the x axis first, then down to -2 on the y axis. She had it backwards. If you don't know what you're doing, and you're taught incorrectly, how are you to learn?Also, she will present simple information and then give some difficult, and I dare say impossible, problems to solve. If I were learning multiplication, and the teacher threw in fractions, integers, and other things I hadn't learned, I would, of course, get lost. Then my confidence would suffer.I'm gleaning what I can from this book, but there must be far better ones out there.

He's only in third grade, so I don't need it yet. However, I was explaining something to him regarding a calculation and wanted to see how the book would describe it. I thumbed thru the book and the first diagram I saw was on page 31. It was of the different number systems. It incorrectly showed that irrational numbers are a subset of rational numbers. I was a math major in college and know otherwise. Also, the book describes it otherwise. Because of this - the first thing I saw, now I'm questioning the whole series. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memorize Shortcuts - Comprehend Nothing","review":"The author reduces algebra to a bunch of simplistic formulas to memorize. While this may get a student through the test tomorrow it does nothing to further true mastery or comprehension of the material that will allow them to grow with mathematics or apply the material when presented differently than the author of this books presents it.The thought that this book was suggested by my son's pre-algebra teacher makes me nauseated."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD AFTER SALES SERVICE","review":"I bought the AL2021MS in March 2006 and in November 2006 it started to malfunction (kept turning itself off).

Horne examines the political and social changes in France following the end of WW I, and how these affected the French military and their ability to resist the German invasion in 1940. Horne examines the diplomatic and political attempts to resist, in addition to the ineffective military response by the French army and air force. Horne utilized an amazing number of sources and his narrative reads as a novel. I was completely absorbed by this book, and what I found particularly interesting was his examination of all aspects of the Maginot Line.

I ordered the 46's and will return the 45's. Overall wonderful comfort. There's no stitching or rough spots that rub against your feet. Great cushioning too. Buy these with confidence!

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I just received the ECCO Yucatan Sandal in the mail today. It has to be the most comfortable sandal I have ever owned. It has great arch support and the sole feels a lot like that of a running/cross training shoe. I actually found the sandal to be true to size and am glad that I did not go up another size...although I go from a 10 to a 10.5 and got the 10-10.5 sandal. People are also complaining that the front strap is not adjustable...well it is, but it only works to make it a little tighter on the toe...not looser. For me, it was perfect as I needed to adjust the front toe to be a little bit tighter.

The story begins when Professor Hardwigg finds a very old book with a piece of parchment in it. On the parchment was a form of writing in some secret code. When the Professor and his nephew, Harry, discovered its meaning they were both shocked to find out it was the instructions for a journey no man thought possible, the journey to the center of the earth! Almost immediately they went on the journey picking up a man by the name of Hans to be there guide. There were many hard times in this adventure. For example, the Professor thought that they would find water in an abundance only to find that there was none till Hans made the discovery by drilling through a wall. Who knows how they will ever survive.

In my view, I would have to say that there was too much science terms and in doing so it made things extremely confusing. I would definetly never reccomend this book to anyone unless they really like science novels. I think that the book described things a little fully and at a point I was bored. I only found about three pages that actually engrossed me into the book. There was a beginning middle and an end but the middle was very long. There was no lesson learned in the story therefore not alot of meaning.

I myself like to have a journey to the crater of a volcano. One of the exciting story about volcanoes is this book. Though it is somewhat surealistic, Jules Verne was able to present a life-like story that is able to draw the readers' minds, as if as they were in the story themselves. Through his words, we can feel the beauty of the scenery in Iceland, the suspense and thrill of the characters' adventure, the imagination of the living creatures inside the earth, and the joy of the characters after their success in 'go down to the centre of the earth and back in three pieces (the Professor, Harry, and Hans)'.

The characters wonderfully believable and the plot is absolutely brilliant. Okay, so you're not going to find many people that believe in the hollow earth theory these days, but who cares? It's easy to suspend your beliefs and just get caught up in the story. Admittedly, the discourses on geology can drag a little for some readers, while others may find it part of the 19th charm, it all comes down to preference. Personally, I love the 19th century \\"info dumps\\" it's an insight into how people saw the world at that time. Verne had a reputation for writing fast paced adventures full of unexpected twists and turns and Journey to the Centre of the Earth is no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really what you want!?","review":"One problem about ordering books on-line, is that you only have as much or as little imformation as the seller gives you. I was looking for a decent hard back copy of Journey to the Center of the Earth. This seemed to be what I was looking for. However, what the seller does not tell you, and something you can't see in the photo, is that this is a Barnes and Noble \\"Children's Classic.\\" I don't think it is unreasonable to expect that this type of relevant information is included in the description.

At times I had to force myself to keep reading because unfortunately the plot wasn't enough to retain my interest for the duration.

However, I just \\"read\\" it again via the unabridged audio version narrated by Barbara Rosenblat, and it really came to life. A lot of the book is told through dialogue, and her skilled portrayal of the many character voices brought out the humor and finally the humanity of the main characters especially well.

Wells. The way Wells wrote in Old English, required me to often reread the text to fully understand the concept. Secondly, I was surprised how limited the number of fighting situations there were compared to action films that I've previously seen. Instead, there was a lot of hiding and survival situations. I think Well's writing style showed that he was very specific during the first few chapters as he described the setting and characters. However, Wells did not necessarily allow more of the characters to develop, thus decresing the interest of Wells's writing. In conclusion, I would only recommend this novel to a reader who enjoys Old English writing and has fun with Wells's style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite read","review":"Gee, I know its a \\"classic\\" but I could't wait to be done with this book.

It is a wonderfully written story told by one of the masters of Sci-Fi whose visions of the future were amazing.The story of the invasion is eerily realistic and describes how an invading race of aliens who cannot tolerate our atmosphere and gravity use advanced technology to crawl out of there craters they have created and take on the military might of England.I don't want to spoil this very good story but I recommend to you that you read it for yourself and enjoy it. The book is worth reading and it is entertaining. One of the messages I got was that mankind, who thought themselves to be superior to all of the earth's creatures were at the total mercy of the alien invading force. The aliens were indeed brought down to defeat by the lowliest life forms on earth.A great story, even 115 years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always loved this book","review":"I was very pleased to find this book listed among the freebies on your websites.

It is in the 1890s when few cars existed and most travel is done by train or horse and buggy. So in the story the main character is an astronomer who saw some kind of jet of gas on Mars. Later you find that it was a gun that shot pods with Martians in them. The Martians looked like gigantic heads on three little legs. They didn't eat what they did was inject human blood into them.

Not only does it create a frightening vision of what might happen if an advanced society were to invade earth (though this \\"vision\\" was more political satire than anything and continues to have relevance in today's world), but it is well written (not true of all Wells' works) and contains very real human drama that by itself is an engaging story.

This book might have been good when it first came out decades ago, but it fails to grab attention now. As a plus, it probably broke new ground in science fiction literature at the time, but this matters very little to me personally. I read this book as it was part of the Masterpieces of Science Fiction Collection from Easton Press, and I did not want to throw down $40-$50 on a title I did not enjoy or value thoroughly.

It had a good plot, but had too many events leading up to the climax and too many leading to the resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, terrifying, intelligent, thoughtful, REAL!","review":"Not bad for 1892! A defining book, and in my top three faves. I first read this when I was twelve, and I have not been without a dog-eared copy since. The images it conjurs in the mind are terrifying, walking through the English countryside I often imagine those giant, pitiless war machines, striding over smashed artilery, burnt out houses, and men and horses suffocated by the unbeatable black smoke.I thought this book would be better received. I'm glad the book is not set in the US as although it is a great place to set a story in, we English need our own Apocalypse. The book is far from dull, and Well's narates it like a documentary, making you believe that it has actually happened. Do not hesitate, buy it.

What I got was a very enjoyable book that didn't pull any punches when depicting the chaos, destruction, and death that results from this invasion. His portrayal of the Martians and their technology beats anything that I've read in contemporary science fiction.The only problem I had with the book was Wells' narrative. The story provides far too much detail at points, giving exact times and locations for minor events which I'd think someone who survived a disaster would have a hard time recollecting. With the overwhelming number of locations for events presented to the reader, you'll need a map of the London area in order to stay on top of things.Additionally, Asimov's afterword is very insightful, and the cover by Roger Dean is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"ggreat book","review":"Was looking for a version a little shorter for my son to read, and other versions were too long, so he felt discouraged.

It makes me sick to watch the entire US population think the rest of the world should be just like them. As for the person who said that he didn't like this book, and rarely read anything, well that's your problem. Of course you aren't going to be able to read a classic and understand it if you only read at a 1st grade level! But overall, this is a good book, well-written and a fantastic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alien invasion!","review":"I recommend this book to someone who is interested in aliens. This is a very exciting book with aliens attacking Earth. It is a bit long with many difficult words, but if you like aliens, it is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I had not read this book since I was 17 (59 now), and it was great to revisit this classic after so many years on Amazon's Kindle. You also cannot beat the price: free. I plan to buy some other old classics for my Kindle.Amazon and its products are very high-quality across the board, and, no, I do not work for Amazon or own any of its stock; I simply appreciate the company's customer-focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrifying Story","review":"Wells is a master storyteller. He is good at developing a thick plot and providing you with enough information to suck you into the story. While his futuristic depictions are dated, his themes are not. His style is very cinematographic - he describes the actions frame by frame filling in the details of what stands in the foreground, background, and the sides. It's not unique but he's one of the best at it. If you are in for a quality story, check this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wells wrote one heck of a book","review":"Wells wrote a great story that has been redone so many times now. It wasn't written in the 50's as many people might think. It was actually written in the 1890's. And Wells creates a story about Alien Invasion that is so scary and well put together. It has Martian's coming to corral the humans. And the humans at first have no way to beat them. They keep getting beat and it almost seems as if we are going to be killed at any moment only for the humans to come out on top. A great Victorian style novel that stands the test of time (a la Independence Day). Though this book is ten times better than Independence Day. A great sci-fi book that will forever be the blueprint for Alien Invasion novels or movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular...simply amazing!!!","review":"The war of the Wolrds, written by H,G. Wells, was one of the best books I have ever read. No other book I've read has said so much detail in a way that still made the story enjoyable and not completely boring. Reading the book, I felt as if I was with the narrator and with him through all the action. The story's plot is intricate and compelling with no pauses or dull moments. I rarely wanted to put the book down becuase I always wanted to know what would happen next. Many times, when the suspense was at its pinacle, I would have to sit at the edge of my seat. This is an amazing book written by a genius author. This is one of the greatest martian books of all time. I defenently recomend this to all who read this resoponse. If you are into alians and sci-fi stories, I garuntee you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Series, Not-so-great segment","review":"This audiobook by Winifred Phillips left me disappointed.

Don't waste your time!","review":"This book may be a classic, but it is a chore to read. Very little happens in the way of action or character development. The plot is well known thanks to the famous radio broadcast and movie adaptation. You'd think the book would give you some insight as to the characters or a more involved plot line. Well it doesn't. This book may be one of the first ever Science Fiction novels written, but first does not equal best. Especially in this case. Do yourself a favor and read something a little more current. If you are looking for a good Science Fiction classic, check out \\"Dune\\" or \\"John Carter of Mars\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did he go wrong?","review":"Dull, dull, dull. Yes. I am talking about the novel The War of the Worlds about an alien invasion from Mars. And it's boring! So very, very boring. Wells writes like a passionless, uncaring observer, so when the Martians start roasting us, who really cares? I sure don't.

I got the Kindle edition but i'm gonna post the review here since i'm reviewing the content. I'll try to keep this short. Unless you're attracted to this novel for some reason or you have to read it, i wouldn't recommend it for random reading. I might be too accustomed to a cinematic style, fast action, intriguing stuff, but there is simply too much description in this novel, not written in the most recent English :) I kind of feel disappointed that in such a huge sci-fi mythos it seems like sci-fi action was only a pretext in the originating book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough action","review":"I personally thought this book was horrible. It was very boring and not once was I on the edge of my seat. I was never excited to keep on reading. The only thing that I liked about this book was how H.G. Wells described the Martians. I think he did a very good job at that but besides that the book needs a lot more action that will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I had to read it for IS AT practice and it was not good at all I chose the rating since it was boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"This book is very nicely written, but it just didn't catch me.

I had heard the radio show and seen the movie - so I was just planning to read a classic in the original words but wasn't expecting anything new or interesting in the content. I was very surprised. Setting this back in Victorian Times when it was originally written totally changes the story. The speed at which the disaster is communicated is different. The speed at which the participants can flee from the Martians is different. The tools that the humans can bring to bear against the Martian invaders is different. All of these things make the story surprisingly new. I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new sci-fi reader...","review":"I am not a sci fi reader but I was making a point to read genres I would normally pass over.

Perhaps in his day, Wells' writing would have seemed interesting, but today...All that happens in the book is the narrator scurrying from town to town without direction or purpose. He hardly even describes anything or anyone, so it's impossible to connect with any of the characters. And what he says of the Martians, which arguably are the only interesting things in this book, is fleeting and vague.No character development, no plot, no real conflict, no motivations. Damned waste of time, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks plot!","review":"The author, H. C. Wells, takes one of the most interesting concepts and creates one of the most boring books imaginable.

There was a war that raged in two worlds. Villages and towns were destroyed by akueb foot soldiers. These people were either captured or killed. The lucky ones fled out of the area of fire or even some of them formed rebel armies. For thousands of years this war raged, people died. Also alien technology grew even more deadly until they devised a heat ray to destroy the remaining villages. A lot of people died at the hands of the aliens. Many of them were lucky to escape from the heat ray's range. Those who were captured were never seen or heard of again. The survivors created legends about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"it deserves one thumb up !","review":"this book was okay but extended too long so it got boring at times. it should have been in the U.S. It should have considered making it in NewYork.

The people in it aren't even characters; they're archetypes, with no names (The Policeman, The Laborer, that sort of thing). Think of The Canterbury Tales; it's like that. It's more like a medieval morality play than an actual story.And, frankly, the moral it's trying to drive home is pretty dated by this point. Yes, it's possible for even the greatest nation to be toppled when it hits an Out Of Context Problem. But that's been driven home repeatedly over the past couple of centuries--most recently on 11 Sep. 2001. If you really want to read on this theme, pick some more recent author."},{"rating":"1","title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"The War of the Worlds is a science fiction novel and I didn't think it was very interesting. It is about a couple in London, England in the late 1900's. This couple was always interested in the stars and the sky, so when they saw red beams of light they got suspicious. So when people said that a flying suacer had crashed they were not suprised. The Martians started to invade the Earth as soon as the saucer landed. During the fighting this couple got split up. The main conflict is that he tries to fing his wife. I didn't like this book very much because there was not much action. The story would have been better if it was more exciting. I would recommend this book to 14 year olds and over, but more to kids who like science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"The War of the World","review":"I was very dissapointed after reading the book, \\"The War of the Worlds,\\" and found that it did not meet my expectations considering all the publicity (other people's reviews). A lot of chapters were very repitive if the fact that half of the time the book just talked about him wandering around. In addition there were too many references to Old English towns that made the book extremely confusing. Also I couldn't tell if the main character's brother survived or where he went. I was also displeased by the fact that the main character was merely an observer to the martian's defeat and the fact that his only real accomplishment was just surviving and didn't do anything to stop the martians."},{"rating":"2","title":"The War of the Worlds","review":"Not only was this story as good as I remember as a child, but the quality of the paper an print images was great.

HG Wells is the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best WotW version","review":"With apologies to Orson Wells, George Pal and Steven Speilberg, the Classics Illustrated version of H.G. Wells' \\"The War of the Worlds\\" was, is, and ever will be the best visual version of this classic book. The artwork by Lou Cameron is simply superb and Harry Miller's written adaptation faithfully captures the book without sacraficing any of the action. Although some may consider the appearnce of the tripods to be a bit dated by today's standards (they resemble Cold War era tank turrets mounted on water tower legs with vacuum cleaner hoses for \\"arms\\") they still retain a menacing appearance within the context of the story. The story itself thankfully remains grounded in the late 19th century when Wells wrote it. A pity that Speilberg decided to ruin the story by making it about a dysfunctional 21st century family. The image on the cover of the tripods attacking a World War I era artillery crew is not just classic; it's poetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"It's war of the worlds. It's legible.

Still rejoicing that the British invaded us back in the Sixties and several times since, Viola has put together a satisfying mix of up-tempo rockers and particularly strong ballads. Viola's hook-laden ditties are filled with clever word play and presented in his attractively raspy voice. There are still a couple of tracks that don't try hard enough and a couple that try too hard, but there's enough good stuff here to make us go back and re-evaluate that first album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Home video","review":"I would rate this video very poorly.

Not for the sex, for the protrayal of poor, white Southerners without compassion, or, in my opinion, any real understanding. Is making the same joke about physical deformities again and again and again satire or even good dark comedy? Not in my book. In well-drawn humor we are able to see our own wekanesses reflected and recognize the human link between ourselves and the most foolish. But Caldwell's characters are so devoid of humanity that poking fun of them just seems juvenile and cruel. Additionally, I found whole passages of the book poorly written and repetitious.

Being from the rural south, I struggle with the image stereotypical poor southerner, but, the Lesters make for a compelling composite of the worst elements of southern poverty. Pearl S. Buck's \\"The Good Earth\\" makes for a compelling comparison and contrast to \\"Tobacco Road\\".

Go with \\"The Third Man\\" instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad German","review":"What a disappointment this movie was...from the gratuitous sex scene with Spiderman to the perjured Casablanca type ending. Almost made me sick. Worst World War II movie I ever saw. This had such potential and they really blew it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to look at, but that's the only good thing I can say about it...","review":"It's beautifully filmed. Cate Blanchette in B&W;, filmed in profile, is classic. Aside from that, the film is a horror. Wooden acting. One-dimensional characters. Boring and predictable plot. Utterly unbelievable story (Jewish woman married to S.S. man and NOT sent to the camps?! Uh-huh... Whatever...). Toby Macguire trying to be threatening is just toooo comical, as are the numerous scenes where George Clooney gets the heck beaten out of him.As someone fascinated by the era in which this film is ostensibly set, I was too disappointed for words by how rotten this movie was. You'd think that a story like this would have at least a little bit of emotional impact, or would be somewhat interesting, or would maybe at worst be suspenseful fluff, but this movie really had nothing to recommend it except for being pretty to look at. It might be better as an art exibit, viewed with the sound turned off, purely for visual effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Imitation of Classic war/noir movies","review":"This is one of the worst post world war II noir movies I have ever seen. It is a cheap imitation of the classics such as Casablanca or Judgement at Neuorenberg. Apart from Kate Blanchate, all the major actors especially George Clooney did a very inferior and non convincing job portraing the key character. The theme of this film as with the majority of todays Hollywood movies is a message of anti-US sentiment. Furhtermore the director of this movie did a very poor job of the interplay between real post war Germany film footage and the actual movie itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad Idea","review":"They must have thought this was great in the studio producers' suite when they saw the bleached, scratchy, black and white film and the big name 'stars' hamming it up for all they're worth in a 'film noir' wartime thriller. Another artistic intelligent classic, eh, guys... one for the Oscars!But when you watch it and you realise the only thing going for this dreary and stultifyingly dull slice of old tat IS the grainy black and white film, you know you're in deep trouble. Mind, chances are you'll be fast asleep long before you give up caring what's going on, i.e. after about 10 minutes.Get Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid with Steve Martin instead - at least that's REALLY clever AND funny, and you have some fun watching the big screen stars of yesteryear grafted into it with some genuine style and panache."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment.","review":"The worst screenplay adapted from a novel I have ever seen. The plot clarity and witty dialogue from the book are completely missing. The murder of an American soldier that the book and movie center around is committed by a different character in the movie than in the book, and much less plausibly so. A Jewish (minor) character in the book has identified other Jews to the Nazis to save her own neck. In the movie, this collaboration is confessed by the heroine, which is totally out of character. In the book the Nazi rocket scientist goes to American with his wife at the end; in the movie his is killed. And Lena, the heroine, who in the book is a conflicted and sympathetic character, turns out in the movie to be capable of murder and collaboration. I rated the book 4 and the movie 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book Was Much Better","review":"I loved the black and white format of this film, but found the acting wooden and the plot tired. The book was much better. This film, albeit an interesting and creative technical piece, sorely lacked the nuance and brilliance of the book. One star for effort and one star for the black-and-white."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Stinker","review":"Steven Soderbergh unfortunately is a hit, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss director.

That has to be one of the worst mis-castings I've seen in a long while!Clooney and Blanchett are really good, but the plot twists are too predictable in following the WWII film noir structure. There was no \\"punch\\" in the script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Adaptation","review":"Soderburgh's attempt at noir failed and seemed more like an excuse to use footage from war-ravaged Berlin than a real embrace of the genre. Soderburgh's noir attempt also fell flat because there was too much unneceessary violence and voyeristic embrace of the bizarre (the legless Jew who had been experimented on, but suddenly is running a shop in Berlin a few months after surviving a concentration camp?) whereas genuine noir is understated. Noir aside, the real problem with this film is a disastrous screenplay. The novel's rich texture of minor characters (and even major figures like Gunter) disappear and, as has been mentioned other reviews, Lena's character is completely transformed and ruined. The \\"surprise\\" at the end of the film was a poor attempt of making a profound statement about morality and survival in the Third Reich."},{"rating":"1","title":"adjustment on the lighting anyone?","review":"read the novel. it was ok. saw the movie. got the director's intention. but some big problems. blanchett as dietrich/garbo. not a good idea. she's great, just poorly directed. too bad. clooney? he'll do. the problem is he is not a facially or emotionally conveying, expressive ennough actor to pull off a 'presentational' acting performance. he just comes across as moving stone. the soundtrack, at least on the dvd, is defective: dialouge is barely audible, have to raise the volume, then the music screams out. total imbalance and really irritating. my worst gripe is the lighting. sorry. it's all washed out. loved the black and white choice. obvious in this instance, but film noir did not wash out faces to the extent they are walking lightbulbs against a sheet of black construction paper. so who did the cinematography? i'm not in the film business, but the choices were right, just poorly executed. too bad. this kind of film, on paper, is what i dream of as a moviegoer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the book","review":"On what planet did they make this movie? It is so different from the book, e.g. Lena and Renate are combined into one character which completely changes Lena's relationship with Jake. I thought the book was an excellent read and was so looking forward to seeing it as a movie -- total disappointment! And when George Clooney isn't getting beat up, he looks jowly and worn-out. If you liked the book, don't bother with the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The one thing I would have liked to know before purchasing this movie was the use of the \\"f\\" word, plus the plot was thin. I was disappointed in this movie for the simple fact of the language and find this word to be soooo offensive. I also find this to be a juvenilistic approach to making a movie. Can't the actors act without using this kind of language. If they had wanted to make a movie in the old style maybe they should have paid attention to some of the old movies. I just watched \\"Twelve O'Clock High\\" with Gregory Peck which was great and no offensive language, the actors and the plot stood on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book!","review":"The movie was very disappointing to someone who read the book.

Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice. Can't remember much about the plot...","review":"They all look nice in b/w. But why is this movie so unmemorable? Maybe because I just could not bring myself to care about the story or the characters. I really can't recommend it except for the set design and photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak script and terrible faux-noir cinematography","review":"Classic film noir has a crisp, high-contrast look. \\"The Good German\\" has gauzy, soft-focus cinematography that would be more appropriate in a perfume commercial. The mushy images and consistently overexposed highlights make the film hard on the eyes and a chore to watch.The poor cinematography might be tolerable if the script were worthwhile. Unfortunately, the script is even worse than the photography. The story plods from one uninteresting plot point to another with no sense of momentum. The acting is nothing special, either -- not that anyone could save such an ugly, badly written film.The obvious comparison is to Jacques Tourneur's \\"Berlin Express,\\" a 1948 noir set in post-war Berlin. Tourneur's film is one of his weaker efforts, but it's a minor masterpiece compared to Soderbergh's failed pseudo-noir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a better German...any German...this isn't it","review":"Other reviewers amplify the film noir, historical accuracy of post-war Berlin, Soderbergh's artistic interpretation...enough. It's been done before and done better, Not even Clooney's charm and wisecracks can save this. As any good American will understand, this one's a huge swing and a miss.

While giving credit to Lisa McVey and Susan Replogle (victims of the book's subject), this piece of work is nothing but disguised effort to toot the horn of the book's primary author, and actual writer, Joy Wellman.Many of the ingredients typical of a true crime were missing from this book; such as details regarding trials, the investigation, many other victims, etc. The reader is provided pretty indepth detail about two victims, general information is provided about others, but some victims are mentioned only in passing. The remainder of the book focuses on the author and co-authors friendship, their desire to teach women to speak out against sexual crimes committed against them, and their lives following Bobby Joe Long, the convicted. And it for this reason that this book should be listed in the biography section versus the true crime category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just AWFUL writing!","review":"I was interested in the facts, but this book just rambles on and on and reads like a poorly-written soap opera. I will never finish it; what a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring bravery","review":"This book takes you on a rollercoaster ride of feelings and emotions. Anger,nausea,pity,anddisgust. The women in this book give detailed insight into their hellish encounters with a serial killer, and then are further violated by our court system. This story should empower all victims of crime to demand judicial change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Effort, Poor Execution","review":"It was a good effort. The storyline did have an unexpected twist at the end which redeemed this travesty of literature in my eyes. However the editing was non-existent, the characters were one-dimensional and unbelievable. (A woman as strong as Cynthia is portrayed would not stay in a domestic violence situation for 10 years.) There were numerous syntax errors which were very distracting and kept me from taking the book too seriously. The use of the different fonts was also distracting. An artist paints a picture and lets the viewer interpret for themselves what it means. A viewer of a fine painting tries describing what the painting is telling them. The author spent too much time spelling things out and not enough time painting her verbal picture, letting the reader explore the emotions invoked on Cynthia's roller-coaster ride for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good history of the people","review":"This is a good introduction to Appalachian history and culture. I liked the mix of interviews with a mix of entertainers, authors, politicians, and academics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appalachians","review":"Exaxctly what I ordered.

First of all it's beautiful, secondly the story of the area is extremely well written and the assembled cast authentic and articulate. Lastly - the music. The sound track alone is worth the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Appalachians","review":"I really enjoyed learning more about the Appalachians. The DVD's were insightful as well as entertaining revealing the rich history of the area, of how it became settled to present day existence.

But I've got to tell you, A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe has changed my mind. Mr. Cullen adds so much detail that the reader comes away with a sense of actually being in touch with the cast of limited characters and the events taking place. The twists and unpredictable turns make the book a truly unforgettable experience. You don't need to be a golfer or a fan of golf to enjoy this novel. Can lightning strike twice? Absolutely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are these reviewers as blind as Bobby Jobe?","review":"I mean, come on. A blind golfer? I thought it was an intruiging premise, too, until I tried to hit balls with my eyes closed. I'm a 2-handicapper, and I was completely hapless. So forgive me if my suspension of disbelief came crashing down.That said, Cullen writes a pleasant, if completely farfetched tale, with likeable characters. However, I thought the best parts of the book had nothing to do with golf. The subplot involving the mentally ill father was actually more interesting, believable and touching, and the best part of the book was a short bit about Allegheny men and their pickup trucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart and Soul","review":"I highly recommend this yoga DVD to everyone. Dr. Morell brings a great deal of experience and insight into this yoga program. She has a great introduction where she explains how this yoga program will help and she even has real testimonials at the end of the tape with women who have practiced her fertility yoga program and were either pregnant or had a baby. It really is inspirational. The practice itself has a great flow with many poses, most have variations so that anyone (experienced and novice) can practice. Her narration brings me through step-by-step yet I feel empowered like it is my own practice. This is a grass roots type of DVD. It seems to be made more from the heart than anything. How else could she have so much insight into what I needed? I liked it a great deal because it made me feel comfortable, and I truly saw some results in just a short time. Oh and did I mention the background music? It is right on point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your money","review":"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I have been practising Yoga for 8 years and so I have some idea of a good yoga session. The instructors voice is extremely annoying, there isn't a flow to the class and it is way too fast. She has you moving from sitting to standing to laying, absolutely no flow. She doesn't even join in on most of the movements and the other participants on the tape are obviously struggling to keep up. The dvd appears to have been filmed by an novice, so the quality is poor.I believe she has used the Fertility title to entice people into buying, don't be fooled as I was. If you are looking for a yoga tape for fertility, I would personally recommend Yoga 4 Fertility, which has been professionally recorded, the instructors voice is soothing and clear, the session flows together at a slow comfortable pace. You actually feel that you have benefited from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Beginners ....","review":"Some women might really enjoy this DVD; however, I was not one of them. I've been practicing yoga for about three months by taking some classes and using the AM/PM tapes successfully every day. This tape required balance and flexibility that I just don't have. In addition, Monica Morell is big on stretches for the \\"thyroid\\" which means a lot of back and neck bending. These did very little for me and actually made me feel sick. As I said, some folks might really love this tape; it just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Times of the Day...","review":"is the 50 minutes I spend doing Fertility Yoga!!

I started with classes, which I now take maybe one per year, and currently work with tapes. Most of these poses were beyond beginner (such as 'Threading the Needle', which can be dangerous for people with previous neck injuries) and didn't offer much in the way of attainable modifications.The production is amateurish at best and the yoga model looking into the camera is greatly distracting. The models were obviously people from her classes and not professional instructors as you can see them struggle with the poses as well as breathing.I recommend that you will better spend your money on 'Yoga 4 Fertility' with Brenda Strong. Her voice is soothing and her instruction is very thorough.Best of Luck!Krista J.

Since commencing this program, my stress level (including my blood pressure) has dropped exponentially, and I actually feel more at peace with myself. I have also noticed that I have been better able to manage the stressful issues that inevitably arise in my law practice since I began yoga. Monica's yoga program has significantly contributed to my overall health and well-being and I am confident anyone would benefit therefrom, just as I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST Yoga DVD ever!!!!","review":"Like another reviewer said this is really a trap for desperate women. She was clever to name it \\"Fertility Yoga\\" because otherwise she would not have sold a single copy!! Her voice is annoying and her cueing is awful. There is nothing calming about this and come on she uses \\"Crack open your chest\\" for chest opening instruction, and \\"Snoring with your mouth closed\\" is not the best explaination of Ujayi breath!! There was nothing in this DVD that would make it specifically beneficial for fertility as opposed to other Yoga DVDs. You would be much better off with Barbara Benagh's \\"Yoga for Stress Relief\\". At least she is a quality instructor and the DVD is well made. Don't waste your money on this one! All those positive reviews must have been from friends of hers.

Electric warrior stands as the one album that put their name on the US map. Songs like \\"bang-a-gong\\" and \\"Jeepster\\" were both US hits. The album contains much more than that, for example, the rhythmic groove of \\"mambo sun\\" sho off Mickey Finns frantic bongo style.

This version puts all previous attempts to shame. If you bought the 30th anniversary version that came out recently sell it and get this. None of the flaws have been repeated here. This version has complete ORIGINAL ARTWORK plus many beautiful PHOTOS, LYRICS, a POSTER plus ALL the SINGLES and B-SIDES from that period. It sounds amazing and the packaging is a collector's dream. The only thing wrong with this edition is the fact that I had to wait so long for it. THANK YOU RHINO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Influential Classic","review":"The most amazing thing about listening to this in 2003 is you can clearly hear the influence this has had on artists after it was released: David Bowie basically re-created this album's vibe verbatim while cranking the guitars a bit more on \\"Ziggy Stardust.\\" The vocals and arrangements on \\"Electric Warrior\\" are also dead ringers for several songs from \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\\" Tell me Tim Curry's Dr. Frankenfurter doesn't sound (and look) like Marc Bolan!I really enjoy the guitar sound on this record too. Unlike the album cover with Bolan posing in front of a towering amp stack, the guitar sounds like it was plugged directly into the mixing board, giving it a uniquely understated distortion, and allowing all the strings, congas, background vocals and a beautifully dense bassline equal time in the spotlight of this landmark disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I think this album's pretty weak. Most of the songs start out great but then don't go anywhere. They just end.. Like \\"Once upon a time, there was a mean knight and a good knight. The mean was mean and the good was good, oh yeah...THE END\\" After listening to it four five times the music got pretty bland and boring. I gave it a second listen after seeing all these marvelous reviews but it didn't get any better. If you like hearing bridgeless music that doesn't really mean anything buy this album. I don't think I get it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After hearing 20th Century Boy, I decided to check out T. Rex. I was familiar with the band from their only song on the radio, Bang a Gong. After seeing all the 5 star reviews, and the title \\"Electric Warrior\\", I figured this CD would rock. It didn't. The only song that rocks is Bang a Gong, which I have heard a hundred times on the radio. The rest of the songs are slow and boring. I was expecting a cd with at least half rocking songs like 20th Century Boy, but this only has 1 out of 17! I can't believe how high this cd is rated.

Remastered, the C.D. concludes with an excellent interview between Marc Bolan and a radio disc jockey."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is killer!","review":"The songwriting on this C.D. is simply exquisite. Marc Bolan's T.Rex sounds so fresh and energetic and raw. The music definitely shines today and fits with today's music. He was grossly underestimated in the states in the 70's. The song,\\"Cosmic Dancer' is haunting because he says \\"I danced myself into the tomb, Is it strange to die so soon?\\" As you probably know Marc always felt he'd die in a car crash before he was thirty and he did in 1977. His guitar work is at his best during this period. \\"Girl\\" is gorgeous and\\"Lean Woman blues' is a blues rocker. This is, in my opinion is tied with \\"Slider\\" as the two best T.Rex records or C.D's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't imagine life without T-Rex","review":"T-Rex fills a certain niche that can't be replicated. They are a little hippy-dippy with a heavy measure of glam rock. I think of them as 'summer music'; I always listen to them in the summer especially. This is the album with 'bang a gong' on it; their most famous song. Every song is a great donation to rock-n-roll history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as SACD 2003 version","review":"This is an awesome album, however, the remaster job is not as good as SACD version. Even CD layer doesn't have that punch. Try finding out the SACD version. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good record","review":"First of all, the title of the album, the cover of the album, and song titles totally contradict what is contained on this album. With songs names like \\"Monolith\\" and \\"Planet Queen\\" and \\"Bang A Gong (Get It On)\\" coupled with the cover of a guitar player in front of a giant stack of amplifiers, you'd think this would be a sonic assault on your ears. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In fact this is a VERY mellow album. Myself only being familiar with a few of T-Rex's more upbeat hits and in my 30's, I decided to pick it up. I was very surprised and somehwat disappointed in what I found. I wanted more of a straight up rocking record, but no dice. It's definitely a good record, very cohesive, nice flow, inspired the glam rock movement, but nowhere near what I was expecting. Unless you are a big fan of 70's prog rock or are looking for something to just lay around and chill out to, avoid this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes Change","review":"I remembered liking this album in the early 70s when it was released, so I bought the CD.

I have had the vinyl version of this record since it first came out. I originally listened to it on a very basic tube system. Fast forward 40(!) years and here I am queing it up again on a nicer, more modern tube system. I don't have the CD version of this record (it is now in my cart).When I first heard my original vinyl copy of Electric Warrior again I just about fell out of my chair! The T Rex sound is like no other and the production is outstanding. This music has a very timeless quality and sounds as fresh today as when it first came out. There are many well-known big name groups from this era that you can't quite say that about. Any of the first three T Rex albums have this sound to them so get one or all three. \\"Electric Warrior\\" is a great place to start. I especially, highly recommend the vinyl editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Suitable \\"Anniversary Edition\\"","review":"As much as I love the music of Marc Bolan, I was very disappointed with this release. As the previous reviewer mentioned, there's nothing going for this album: no original album design, no lyrics, and poor reproduction. In a way, it does spoil the album for me. With the \\"30th Anniversary Edition\\" one would expect to see a wonderfully packaged tribute to a great album; instead this seems to have been hastily put together, almost as an after thought. C'mon - Marc deserved better than this!Buy the old edition and let's hope justice is done on the next anniversary."},{"rating":"2","title":"START A T.REX COLLECTION HERE","review":"I've always liked Bolan's songs but have previously only had compilations. Even though I like most of the songs on these collections I rarely played them because as often happens the songs did not fit together well for me.EW works really well as a whole and is a great listen in its entirety. I have listened to it loud and it ROCKS, then at lesser volume it works well too, with Bolans vocal stylings coming over well. This is a real 'album' that fits together so well with each song complimenting the others and while there is a definite overall sound there is also great variety within it. Interested in T.Rex? Start here.

I first heard his bitter-sweet voice in the Velvet Goldmine movie and rushed out to find out who he was. I am a big Bowie fan, and I believe he sounds like the young elf-like Bowie. The only thing I don't like about this album is that I hadn't discovered it earlier in my life (think of all those wasted years!). Also, try making love to this album, it will be fabulous. The songs are tender yet naughty. If you enjoy Electric Warrior, try The Slider."},{"rating":"2","title":"a 1970's masterpiece","review":"T-Rex is the definitive 1970's glam-rock band. Electric Warrior features most of the most memorable tracks of T Rex including 'Cosmic Dancer', 'Get it on', 'planet queen', 'hot love', and 'Girl'. I would recommend this one along with David Bowie's 'Ziggy Stardust' as a good place to start in the genre of glam-rock. The music is a strange blend of simple riffs, mythically tinged lyrics, and interesting production. Truly a strange and beautiful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bolan Belongs in the Hall of Fame","review":"Electric Warrior is one of the best rock albums ever. Every track is pure genius and this albums rocks. Marc Bolan was unfairly neglected in the U.S., probably because he was worshipped by teenage girls in the UK--doubly unfair since so were the Beatles!! His body of work (also check out the UK box set, Marc Bolan 20th Century Superstar) stands the test of time, was totally prescient, and definitely rivals his main competitor David Bowie. Had he lived past 29 years, his commercial fortunes, which peaked with Bang a Gong on this album, would have no doubt rebounded. Marc Bolan belongs in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and shame on the powers that be for never nominating him."},{"rating":"2","title":"My All Time Favorite Album","review":"This is one of my all time favorites - if not THE favorite album in my collection. I remember seeing a picture of Marc Bolan in the early 80's and thought to myself, man, this guy looks wild - I've got to hear what his music is like. Thus began my odyssey to get my hands on anything associated with Marc Bolan.This album was the starting point - and it's a true gem. From the opening track, the hypnotic, sultry \\"Mambo Sun\\" to bombasitc guitars and violins on the closer \\"Rip Off\\", it's the perfect album - the centerpiece of UK Glam rock in the 70's.Tony Visconti's involvement here brings the album full circle. The mix of Bolan's poems set to music mingled with Tony's production and orchestral arrangements are captured perfectly in \\"Cosmic Dancer,\\" my favorite track on the album.There's not a bad song here.

Every song is great, and the extras make the album even better. Marc Bolan was a true musical genious, and one of the great forgotten artists.

And then, because we are all different, it helps to use some of the gifts of synchronicity to understand how our experiences can flow through cycles ... this book makes these understandings clear and rich and accessible.The book is a keeper. It is the kind of book you can consult for your own cycles and the cycles of others as a way to understand life as process.Christine DeLorey's emphasis on emotional literacy, free choice, responsibility, and the healing role of feelings is, for me, the unique contribution she makes in her numerology. People can also find her website by entering Creative Numerology in the search engine. There she shares her work in a way that allows visitors to do a quick check on their destiny numbers ... in case things aren't going your way at work at the moment ... a little reading and your perspective, balance, and inspiration return ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A POWERFUL BOOK!","review":"I received this book as a birthday present from a dear friend who has been following Christine DeLorey's work for years. Until I read it for myself, it didn't occur to me that numbers affected us all on such a deep and emotional level, but the impact it had on my perception of life, and on my life itself, was profound. Everything changed: my relationships with my husband and my teenage son and daughter, my relationships with friends and coworkers, and best of all my relationship with myself. Each chapter is like a monthly coaching session in which I feel increasingly better about myself and the poeple that make up my world. I would go as far as saying that this book has helped me realize that I didn't know just how deeply I was able to love. Life Cycles is written in such a down-to-earth, real, and caring style, and each time I read it I learn something new. It is the finest gift I have ever received."},{"rating":"2","title":"astonishing accurate","review":"This is the first book about numerology I bought. And I don't regret it.

I bought this program to do so and found it to be very good. I learned a great deal of Portuguese in a short period of time with this software. The conversation practices were my favorite part because I was able to learn many phrases and things to say in various different situations such as ordering dinner at a restuarant or asking for directions (this was very useful on my trip).

He leads us through the lampstands, seals, trumpets, bowls and thunders in a engaging conversation with the reader with details and Scripture for the student, and fine prose and an engaging style for the first time viewer.

I own some very old, paper-thin sheets that I got from my mother and I own a Vollrath. The Vollrath is heavy-duty and bakes evenly. It works great with parchment paper or on its own. Unlike my very thin baking sheets, this one does not burn the bottom of the cookies before the tops are done; however, it does add a few minutes onto the cooking time, usually 2 to 4 minutes. Also, I like to put cookies on a cool cookie sheet so that they don't start baking right away and the thin ones cool down almost immediately, but this one has to be run under cold water, which is inconvenient but certainly not enough for me to give anything but an excellent review to this baking sheet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baking with confidence!","review":"Quality heavyweight sheets performs exactly as described. I had borrowed cupcake pan recently, using it and one of mine this past fall. Noticed the big difference in performance and results.

I finally decided to pony up the cash and invest in quality cookie sheets. I am beyond thrilled that I did! The first batch of cookies I baked on my new Vollrath sheets came out perfectly! That's right -- each and every cookie was perfect! Browned slightly on the edges, golden on the top and bottom, plump in the middle -- you baking afficianados know exactly what I am talking about.

It seems that it would be difficult to investigate e.g. how old Bruce Lee was when his parents returned to Hong Kong. Only at the end of this book one could catch a small impression of Bruce Lee's philosophy. His carrier as an actor comes primarily up. The US Press didn't understand until Bruce Lee's death that his art wasn't Karate. I expected more philosophically thoughts and background knowledge of his martial art.

It wasn't awesome, but it was ok. The special effects were really cool and all, but the story itself seemed to move too fast. I then went and rented the original Time Machine. I liked the original far more than the remake. The scientist narrarates the whole movie and the story is so much better. I will admit--the special effects were cheesy, but what can you expect??This movie was made in 1960!! If you want to see a great movie that has mystery, horror, action, and suspense, this is the one to buy. I reccommend this highly to everyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"George Pal's 1960 Version Is Still The Best","review":"I know it's dated, but that doesn't keep it from being a decent and entertaining film. George Pal's version closely follows H.G. Well's book written in in 1895, except for a few changes. In the movie, the Eloi are normal sized people with blonde hair that can speak, instead of being much smaller and mute. The Morlocks resemble Troll dolls with light bulb eyes that make them seem less sinister than the book does. Weena, the female Eloi that almost drowned, is captured and eaten in the book, but Pal kept her alive so there was a reason for Rod Taylor to return to this time in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite the obvious sets","review":"and sometime stilted dialogue, this remains one of the most watchable and entertaining films of the genre ever made. FAR superior to the new version. A definite must-own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's go ahead with our Time Machine","review":"What a great movie. Rod Taylor Takes HG Well's George the main charactor through time. He tries to find a better world. Yet as far as you can go things remain the same. The special effects for the 60's was great. HG Wells was showing how he felt about society. Making the rich useless Eloi and the working people doing the work the monster Morlocks. Just sit back and enjoy a fun movie with great actors that you can feel that they were the charactors from the book. This movie was charming, exciting and a true classic. See it."},{"rating":"1","title":"campy","review":"Part of the problem with TTM, is that it was made in an era where technological restraints made it impossible to duplicate Wells story.

Recently I had the opportunity to revisit it, and was really let down, with the schmaltzy dialogue, cheapo sets and makeup and cheesy special effects. I dare say that any 12 year old today would think the same thing, as they're conditioned to today's more sophisticated sci fi movies.

Rod Taylor and Alan Young back together with Whit Bissell. This little film has more heart, warmth then that so called re-make last year. I have to say it was a joke. Also, I read that Simon Wells saw the small film on the DVD and said that the Time Machine prop was made by Don Coleman. WRONG it is the real Time Machine prop owned by Bob Burns. Mr. Wells do your homework, maybe that's why your film will never be a classic.

I still have drawings I did in grade school of glass-domed futuristic houses with large double entrance doors. The time machine itself, is so humorous, but it is what they would have had in the 1800s for such a contraption. I was entranced by the Eloi and their lack of emotion and having to do nothing but eat fruit all day. My infantile mind thought that would be a GOOD life. I consider this a much better movie than its \\"twin\\" Journey to the Center of the Earth, but they were both great and thought-provoking, especially to pre-teenagers. The scenes and special effects are phenomenal. It is because of this movie that I probably eventually decided to write a time-travel novel of my own.

When the Time Traveler gets to 1964 and the air raid sirens are going off, that was it for me. The movie was turned off! I didn't see it in its entirety until several years later and I outgrew (mostly) that fear. I even got a copy of the book and read (most all of) it, for it, too, is a chilling tale of \\"what if.\\" I happened to watch the 2002 remake last night and it was OK, and entertaining. It definitely has flashier special effects. (How is it that Guy Pearce can outrun those CGI speed-induced Morlocks?) Still, this one with Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimieux is the granddaddy. It won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy Classic Forever","review":"George Pal's classic movie is a delight from begining to end, and, surprisingly, much closer to Well's book than his great grandson's lame remake, with much creepier Morlocks. The documentary on the DVD is a mixed bag, with great stuff about what has become of the machine itself, it's rescue and restoration, and also odd stuff with Alan Young and Rod Taylor in a sequel scene that contradicts the movie. The documentary is dedicated to the memories of George Pal and Mike Minor, the latter a friend of mine who is much missed. Skip the remake and enjoy the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Intriguing Sci-Fi Film Ever","review":"With the idea of Hollywood making a remake to this instant classic, starring someone who is not Rod Taylor makes me shudder in contempt.See this. Buy this. You'll be taken on a journey of intrigue like you've never seen. Reject the laws of physics and just enjoy this campy '60s film. You won't be disappointed.Scenes of Rod Taylor using the machine to go forward in time is some of most must-see, and edge-of-your-seat moments in any '60s film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short as a wireless security reference","review":"Wireless networking is the hottest technological innovation of the past few years, but the unpleasant fact is that security is its greatest weakness. In a crowded market of computer security titles, a niche exists for a book that lays out wireless security problems and couples them with solutions.Unfortunately, this is not that book. While well written, the book is thin on security matters; security is only first dealt with in chapter six. That coverage is interrupted by five chapters on building wireless networks. Discussion of security doesn't resume until chapter twelve.Despite its title, the book is more about setting up, configuring, and managing wireless networks, with occasional digressions into security issues. Only about 35 pages of this 320-page book directly deal with wireless security. The book would make a good introduction for designing wireless networks, but it falls short as a security reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"The song's pretty cool and the remixes are even better","review":"I listen to this song on Music Choice and I love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERONICA MARS ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Great product.

A lot of the characters I enjoyed watching (Wallace, Weevil, Mac, Lamb, etc.) were relegated to appearing once every 6 episodes or so. Veronica's still snarky and bitter even though she's had no reason to be since Season 1. Jason Dohring puts in a performance as Veronica's doormat. All I can say for the third year is hey, the new opening credits looked nice, and maybe there are a good 3 or 4 episodes in the lot. Veronica might have been better off if it had been like Freaks & Geeks - brilliant but ended way too early after only one year.

MARS","review":"So as you can tell from the title I\\"m a huge V. Mars fan. The main question is why aren't you? Season 3 has more snappy comebacks, more edgy plot lines , and more adultish situations. By no means is Veronica a push over but there are situations where she is \\"put in her place\\" in a more adult sense than when she was in High School. All in all the third season is both more and less realistic. In both cases however it is totally awesome and in my opinion better than the first two seasons in the show has progressed to this point naturally. Someone should slap the faces of every WB exec who voted to cancel this show it was really beginning to come into it's own. Anyone who liked the girl let cast of Buffy and other such shows should be watching Veronica Mars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as season two, but good.","review":"This season ended really abruptly (20 eps).

I don't use past tense here because even thought he show has been cancelled, I still love it. I still watch the first two seasons on DVD and have kept a few of the Season 3 episodes on my TIVO.That being said, Season Three had its ups and downs. Kind-of like Season 4 of Buffy, taking VM out of High School and into college came with his great moments and it's failures. There were some brilliant episodes, some just plain amazing, and some that were just okay (But an okay episode of VM is still 10 times better than most of the crap on TV)! I feel that if the CW had let Rob Thomas do his thing, we would have gotten a stronger season. And maybe a 4th.Season Three was great VM. The season as a whole wasn't the strongest (most would say 1 still is but I argue for 2 - loved the whole year-long story arc) as the others but still it was pure Veronica Mars.I'm going to miss Veronica Mars but I still very much love the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the bonus features","review":"For all the VM fans out there, it is very bittersweet to watch the (extensive) bonus materials included in the VM season 3 dvd. There is a season 4 pitch (about 10-15 mins), but it was just enough to get me salivating for more.

When Smallville which is sorta just dragging on these days is going on to it's 7th season. But hey at least that's way better than 7th Heaven which at least isn't coming back. Why can't the CW bring back Veronica if they could bring back the lame 7th Heaven after canceling it. I got into Veronica Mars the most this season, so it really bugs me that it got canceled. Hell I think everything was canceled but Smallville and Supernatural, so why would they have to cut this show too ? It was actually good even if Veronica could act just a little too much like an overly goofy version of Buffy. It was still a really good unpredictable teen detective show and beats a lot of the crap shows that actually weren't canceled this year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Season 3 -worst of the lot","review":"For fans of the previous seasons, season 3 leaves a lot to be desired--a whole lot. The once outcast Veronica is now the apple of everyone's eye. The once charismatic Logan is whipped. The once best.father.ever Keith now trades creepily sexual banter with his daughter. The once intriguing plot lines are now reduced to entitled Veronica all the time. What happpened to the ensemble cast? The funny, snarky dialog? The emotional intensity?

TCM 2003 and TCMTB are grat movies, modern visions of an old story. They have their fair amount of plot, lot of gore and suspense, fair enough for a horror movie, just entertainment. By the way if you seek a horror movie that change your life or did a horror movie changed your life you might need some help.

So today I went back to the theater. In some ways I thought this film was better than the 2003 remake. The gore was taken to a whole new level, and Leatherface is one really bad dude this time around. I couldn't believe some of the gross out gore they got away with here, and I believe some will even be thrown back in for the DVD. Jordanna Brewster was very hot (could those jeans get any lower?) and a decent actress, Andrew Bryniarski was a menacing Leatherface yet again, and R. Lee Ermey stole the show yet again as the town \\"sheriff\\". This movie is worth checking out if this is your thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Massacre","review":"I have seen most, if not all, of the versions and sequels fo the TCM. This is the best by far. This is one of the best slasher/horror flicks I have ever seen. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this movie. It actually deserves a 4.5 rating. I would recommend this fo any horror fan. I fear this movies' success was cursed with the same curse as Halloween H2O, Jason X and Aliens 4; great movies all, but by the time they were released most poeple were tired of the franchise. This just isn't the best of the TCM franchise; this is one of the best horror/slasher flicks ever. I know this movie is supposed to be based on a true story,but being a romantic, it would've been nice if the girl had survived at the end. I hope this is not the last in this franchise, especially if these same writers can perform this same magic with another script."},{"rating":"1","title":"well, it has gore...","review":"mildly amusing and zero percent thought provoking or original.

While the picture and sound are very well done, and super sharp, that is ALL there is to this disc. No trailer, no featurettes, no deleted scenes. The American dvd has all of these and a few more tidbits to gnaw on, but Allied's bare-bones offering is movie-only. If you love the film, get it, but don't toss or trade the dvd just yet. Maybe Warner/New Line will give us a good blu in the future, but the optimal chance for a good release came and went with the premier of Texas Chainsaw. Sure, Warner didn't make it, but with a Chainsaw in the theater, a blu would have \\"made a killing\\" so to speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing With No Redeeming Qualities","review":"Simply read the other one star reviews and that will sum up my feelings about this piece of trash.

If you're a horror fan I dont see how you could say this is ''overly gory''. It had its moments but thats what this genre is about. It had a lot more gore than the original but it was still an entertaining movie.Setting: 60s- 2 brothers and their girlfriends are on their last road trip before getting sent back to Vietnam. They end up getting in an accident and when the sheriff comes then the terror begins. This movie tells the story of leatherface and the family. It reminds me more of the second film and third films in the series. Its nowhere near as good as the original but I found it to be better than the fourth film and the remake of the original. It was somewhat different in the way that no one survives. It has a lot of unexpected twists to it. This was no masterpiece of horror but it was entertaining enough and a decent addition to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"Although it started slow the second quarter started picking up steam but the second half is a waste of film. Exhibit A in the case of the horror genre being populated solely by lazy genre-loyalist writers and directors who wouldn't know a creative idea if it disemboweled them. I spent half the movie willing it to get to the point and half the time when it did wondering what the point was. Boring sterile conventional suspense and climax, no plot points or characters to wonder about, no chance of anything coming out of leftfield, it just sets a tone and hammers and drones away at it. No big things needed to be changed to improve the film, it's just the little things that weren't there to hold your interest and make it worth watching, no attention to detail. They've got a perfectly functional skeletal plot outline for a movie, they just needed to let some creative writers do something with it before it was ready for filming."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never thought I'd say this but","review":"This movie was as good as the one with Jessica Biel (as far as the scares).

There really isn't much to be said for this film. The prior remake from 2003 wasn't exactly great filmmaking, but at least it did what a horror film was supposed to do: it scared the audience, gave you some characters to root for, and created a whole lot of supsense. This film does none of those things. Walking out of the theater, the only word I could think to describe the film was pointless. If you thought other horror films had nihilistic endings, just wait to experience this. Oh wait, don't experience it. Don't mistakenly give this film any money like I did. It will only encourage the studios to keep adding on unnecessary installments to once-respected horror franchises from 30 years ago. This film is a travesty and a disgrace to the amazing movie that was made back in 1974. I'm shocked that Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel would even attach their names to this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOD AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie really sucked i thought it was going to show his life from the start it showed him born then did this little slide show thing threw his younger ages then all of a sudden he is like 18. i think they should of made the movie longer and showed some more of his childhood. also the movie wasnt really scary and it was far from exciting. but i gave it 2 stars because the acting wasnt bad at all, and the killed somebody it was in a sick and cool way, and the deaths did look very realistic. if you are going to buy this to complete a collction thats why i did. but if you are looking for soemthing as good as the 2003 remake this isnt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SADISTIC PLEASURES","review":"Since we know that this prequel will have several follow-ups, we pretty much know what awaits our four young victims in this cruel, sadistic and unnecessary entry in an already bloated series.The film relishes in the sadism it supplies as each of our four heroes meet gruesome, bloody deaths. It's sad because these four youngsters aren't your typical sex-starved teens you want to see offed; these four seem more mature and their fate is doubly disgusting. Add a performance from R. Lee Ermey in which he seems to enjoy the perpetration of these acts of sadism and you have a horror movie that repels more than frightens, and hopefully the last in this series honoring a brutal clan of misfits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leather face with his chainsaw mackes one heck of a goar feast","review":"Fist of all for you people that like extras you might want to pass this up it his no extras at all there arent even sceen selections on here but... put all that aside and you got a good horror movie.The effects looks so real its unbeliveable.This movie shows how leather face was born plush it shows how the sheriff became sheriff thit is the only reason it's called TTCM:The beginning.If your a horror fan you shuld pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"another swell performance by r.

The 4 characters/victims where so undeveloped that you couldn't even make enough of a connection with them to even care whether they lived or died. It lacked scares as well as good writing. The characters were making unrealistic mistakes, one after another, throughout the duration of the movie. The acting was mediocre to downright cheesy at times. The only reason that I am giving this one star is because of the very realistic make-up artistry that was used to show gore.

AC/DC+bluegrass: Two crappy genres that manage, somehow, to sound just ducky when melded into one. But Mountain Love lacks the twisted, psychobilly focus of that effort. It's merely AOR+bluegrass.The only songs that work to any campy degree at all on Mountain Love are CENTERFOLD, CAT SCRATCH FEVER and FEEL LIKE MAKING LOVE; the latter of which sounds, at best, like it was a SOGGY BOTTOM BOYS outtake. I LOVE ROCK AND ROLL and BIG BOTTOM are just plum embarassing; the latter being a travesty of a parody of a sham of a travesty... FAT BOTTOM GIRLS doesn't belong here, at all.My advice to Hayseed Dixie: Next time make another hillbilly-hardrock tribute. There are tons o' worthy/lousy candidates for the pickin': KISS, Metallica, Black Sabbath &/or Led Zeppellin come readilly to hand.

There's no systematic teaching of sentence structure, grammar rules, etc. - it's very poorly designed as a \\"language course\\". Also, the program (I'm using the Mac version) is many years old, and hasn't been updated for OS X. The sound and video are low-resolution and grainy.On the other hand, I do find it useful, if only because a cd-rom is a better tool for practicing than a cassette tape. You can easily skip around the texts, click on individual words or whole sentences to hear them, see the (not always helpful) translation, etc. - so I would say that in conjunction with a *real* language course (maybe a good book) this could be helpful for extra practice. But ideally I would like to find a good-quality cd-rom language course. Anyone know of one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a CD designed for English speakers who want to learn Dutch, Learn Dutch Now 10.0 failed miserably. The content must not have been reviewed by a native English speaker, because some examples are given only in French or German, and many examples that are given in English are incorrect! Obvious errors and poorly designed learning structures abound. Of course some useful content is contained, but not content that one can rely upon if your reason for learning Dutch is for more than entertainment. This is my third language and my fiance's sixth, and neither of us found it useful enough to be worth the money or the time we invested in studying. We now have to invest in another program and spend many more hours studying from the beginning. We're not pleased at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!","review":"I purchased the lingerie cage at the same time as the original blue braball to see which one I liked better.

Shelby was back too. Her husband had been murdered and his killer had almost gotten her too before the police captured him. Shelby was in town to heal.Shelby's grandmother was recuperating from a broken hip, so Shelby ran her store for her. But her Uncle James was out to take over the store and get rid of Shelby. And someone was out to hurt Shelby, permanently! Once again, Nathan would be her protector and, he hoped, even more.**** Not bad at all! A bit predictable, but I had many things totally wrong.

My other favorite section is the Welcoming Windows, about making the all important first impression.

Now that I'm older, the old folks are gone and I've missed out hearing their stories forever. In a way, this book is a second chance. Lawrence Ritter has made a Herculean effort tracking down all these players and getting their stories. Baseball fans owe him many thanks for the job he's done. There are many interesting stories told between these pages, but one of the most surprising to me was that these players called the games themselves most of the time. No coaches and the managers sat back and let the players play, for the most part. I especially enjoyed the story by Rube Bressler about three players ending up on third base at the same time. This is a must have collection for baseball fans.

Many thanks to Lawrence Ritter for capturing moments in time with these baseball legends. I'm sure that they all had a million stories to tell, but I'll settle for just the few that are represented in this book. In today's baseball world of outright sheer greed and selfishness, it was so refreshing to hear stories about baseball's yesterday when times were simpler and the game was just a game.

I thought the crap that the ex husband got away was above & beyond unreal, only to then be 'rewarded' with 68 million of the winnings for finally seeing the light & realizing he had treated his 'overweight' wife like s&*t for their entire married life.

Words are far too cheap to describe how badly I detested this book. If I could give it zero stars instead of one, I would.What struck me right out of the gate was how elementary the dialogue was and how one-dimensional the characters were. Their emotions turned on a dime, and they did complete life-changes from one chapter to the next. The dueling plotlines - from the main character's speedy weight loss and perfunctory slips to what to do with a winning lottery ticket - rang false and made-up to me.There were also too many distracting subplots to even care about, and the gratuitous mysticism was ludicrous.In the future, I will not feel any kind of obligation to waste my time reading another Fern Daniels book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Round File","review":"I got to page 13 before I did something I've never, ever done before in my long life of reading - I threw this book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A promising start, but dissapointing overall","review":"When picking up this novel at my local bookstore, I was excited to get to reading it after an enticing description.

I read anxiously as to what was going to happen to these characters.But in the end, I was very dissappointed. Maybe I'm idealistic, but the sudden, and I mean sudden change of heart by Kent gave me whiplash. I wanted for him \\"to get what's coming to him\\" and have the heroin triumphant and rub it in his face. Also, Vickie, Rosie's best friend has such a minor role in this novel.

The drive wheel is shorter than the front wheel and there is a spot where the belt goes around a metal surface...seems to get real hot and degrade the belt until it fails. Otherwise seemed like a nice device with great ergonomics, but this belt shredding flaw completely obliviates any positives. If you do even a rudimentary amount of sanding, the attractive price will be overwhelmed by a gluttony of sanding belts.

Pond's unique voice pulls the listener along for a rewarding experience. Some songs are exuberant such as \\"Closest\\" and \\"Claire\\" while others are laid back and meloncholy, \\"Last Song\\". Pond shows more variety in terms of tempo and emotion, than he has shown on other releases. However, the artful, perfectly composed sound is never compromised on Emblems.

I'm a long time Sublime fan and I enjoyed hearing these reworked versions of their songs. The most noteworthy songs, to me, are Jack Johnson Badfish/Boss DJ medly (check this guy out if you've never heard him- killer acoustic guitar sounds,) No Doubt's DJ's (good cover,)and The Ziggens Paddle Out (The Surf Band that majorly influenced Sublime covering a Sublime surf song- good stuff.) The other songs vary from Filibuster and Half Pint's Get Ready (Good, More classic reggae sound than the original) to G Love's Greatest Hits (sounds too much like a cell phone ringtone at times.) If you like Sublime, just buy it, you'll get some good listens out of this CD and the good songs certainly make it worth it. If you're not coming into this purchase as an existing Sublime fan go buy 40oz. to Freedom RIGHT NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic Covers","review":"Not bad! Great mix of funk, jam, blues etc. There are a couple styles of music on here I could do without, but it was worth the purchase!

Love, so how could I go wrong. Well, JJ and G. Love come through, but beyond that, there are only a couple of good songs. Los Lobos version of Pawn Shop is solid. That's about it.I should say, also, that the No Doubt live version of DJ's is a good track, but has been widely available for years. I found that to be very sad seeing how Sublime and No Doubt were all friends and came up together out of the same music scene. Pretty lazy of No Doubt in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok","review":"sublime is my favorite band, so i got this because i saw it at the record store and was curious. it's not really bad, but when i listened to the songs, it just made me want to listen to sublime instead. i think the jack johnson song is mediocre, the fishbone song is total crap even though i sorta used to like them, and the rest of the songs, with the exception of a few, are totally boring and complete filler. the exceptions - the live no doubt performance, because it has the original energy of the song (\\"djs\\"), mike watt & petra haden (although i think it's really gay that they say '2004' cause i hate that they're 'updating' it somehow), half pint's \\"get ready\\" and the g love song is pretty cool. i'd actually put that one on a mix. it's a neat concept, but, yea i'd rather just listen to sublime.

I concider it one of the best books in my financial library.If you concider buying this book, insure you have a new highlighter and pencil at your side.

This CD covers her later, WB years, with \\"Dont It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\\" thrown in for gravy. Nothing from her Columbia years, or her first big hits from United Artists.

In 2002 West Point celebrated its bicentennial. In honor of this milestone, the USMA Department of History hosted a multi-disciplinary conference focused on the Academy and its place in American society. The topics ranged from the Academy's role in developing officer professionalism, to its influence on the careers of distinguished graduates, to institutional challenges and changes, to the experiences of women and minorities at West Point, to the evolution of the Academy's academic curriculum.

This CD is worse than NOW 2, and that's pretty bad.

I am so sick of most of the songs on this album that I cannot wait until \\"Totally Hits 2002\\" comes out. The only good songs are at the tail end of this album, from Aerosmith to Adema, and that is IT. Pink's remix is just plain bad (don't worry, the original is featured on \\"TH 2002\\"), Ja Rule's song is tired, Mary J Blige's song is WAY TOO overplayed, and Mr. Cheeks shouldn't even be here.

So there were 2 rock songs. Big whoop. What would be nice is an album, completely made with rock. The problem may be that there are so many different kinds of rock, and some people wouldn't buy the CD because it had, oh, let's say, christian rock on there.(namely Creed b/c POD is tight).

The first Guardian novel, You Slay Me, had me burning. Fire Me Up was great; however, not what I expected. Although I would have loved to give the 2nd novel 5 stars, there was one major downfall--not enough romance! There were too many dilemma's and characters to really concentrate on Aisling and Drake. But what can I say? There has to be more drama left for Katie's next novels, so I guess we can't have a perfect romance right away. I was also somewhat disappointed in Aisling. Aisling needs to have more dignity and not always go running into Drake's arm. In FACT, why shouldn't Drake come running into her's? Drake obviously hasn't changed. I do hope Aisling wisens up and learns from past mistakes.Katie MacAlister, hats off to you. Cannot wait for the next novel. This doesn't mean to rush the writing; we do want another steamin'HOT novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave it Back!!!!","review":"I was waiting with baited breath for this book. When it finallycame out I read it in about 4 hours. After I finished it, I took it to my favorite used bookstore and gave it away. I would not even take a credit for it. Yes, I agree that Aisling whines. Part of it is that everyone one expects her to play by the rules but no one ever explained them to her. It was Drake'sbetrayal I could not stomach. I do not know if I will read the next one"},{"rating":"2","title":"More great books from Katie MacAlister","review":"This selection in the Aisling Grey series was worth waiting for. I hope the next in the series isn't far behind. Aisling Grey seems to always get herself in a fix, with Drake and more murders, she is right there in the thick of it. I can't wait to see were Katie is going to take these two in the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy, hilarious and entertaining","review":"I picked this book up from the library and didn't know it was book two in a series until I started reading, but it was fairly easy to figure out what I'd missed in the first book. I found that the humour and the quirkiness of the book grabbed me right away and made me keep reading even though I was missing the first piece of the puzzle. I laughed out loud many times (the Incubi were hilarious, and so was Tiffany the Professional Virgin). The scenes between Drake and Aisling were powerful, but I would have liked more. The mystery over the murders was interesting and kept me reading at the end to find out what was up, although there were some weak points in the story.Definitely an enjoyable read... I'm going to go and track down the first book now for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Expected SOOOOO Much More!","review":"The first book, \\"You Slay Me\\", has some really interesting takes on the supernatural with its totally messed up main character. However, after I read the first book I wondered if the main character was strong and independent, hated Drake, or just hated men in general. The next book, \\"Fire Me Up\\", especially the ending, answered the question. It is pathetic. It is almost as if the author is going through an \\"I hate men\\" spell.I hope that Katie writes another book in this Guardian series and finally has Al \\"grow up\\". Drake's character deserves better. ;) Yes, I know that she feels that he betrayed her, however, it is in his character to make her think. She should have spelled out to him more of what she wanted prior to accepting to be his eternal mate. ...and then to threaten him with another dragon. Shame on you Al! Al is a selfish, whiney, brat who needs to have the tables turned on her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"I glanced through this book while waiting for service in a local bank.

Thus, I succeed in getting a new job."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK book but seems hurried","review":"I used this book when working on the TOEIC. The good part was that it doescomprehensively cover the test; the bad part is that it seems like it was writtenin one week.

I think there are better TOEIC books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far-Fetched","review":"I bought 2 videos like this to hopefully use for a retreat we were doing that focuses on Jesus' parables. We found the analogies to be a bit far-fetched and we felt like we couldn't even use them. I do not recommend this product. Had it not had an explanation to the videos I probably wouldn't have even put these videos with the parables Jesus told. The videos are good quality, I just didn't quite understand the content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeder","review":"I like the feeder. It does require that you must take it down to fill it, as you cannot move the cover to the side enough to pour any food in with it hanging by the chain. It is built very sturdy and looks very nice hanging in the yard. It seems to be limited to the small birds, because the perches are very close to the feeding area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I was very disappointed in this novel.

There were some words and expressions that I had to explain to him, but he asked for \\"more Jennings\\" after he'd finished the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burnham at her best!","review":"I loved every word of this book! I could not put it down. I love the big message in the book about stereotyping. Def. an important message for everyone, especially in High School. And way its addressed in the book is great! Not so preachy but seen from another side.Summer is at an end and Chole's 2 year relationship with her boyfriend, Sean, comes to an end unexpectatly when Sean moves across the country. Now her no longer being part of a couple she starts seeing herself as a whole new person. Her friends on the other hand are pushing her to get back with her ex and try the long distance thing. But is her new found self better than she was just seen as Sean's girl friend? or does it have something to do with the mysterious guy from her fave pizza hangout?I completely enjoyed reading this book. The events and characters are very realistic. And I can not wait to read this one again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wins for worst album ever","review":"This really is the worst album I have ever hears. I listen to a lot of kids music as my son has been crazy about music since he was a baby. I don't always love it - can do without some of the kids choruses, or the super-happy singers. But this is ten times worse. The songs are trite, and rhyme badly, Donovan's singing is unpalatable, the orchestration entirey insipid. There is one exception -- a woman sings with Donovan on the song \\"Colors\\" and her voice is extraordinarily beautiful. And then, unfortunatly, he takes over and ruins it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, a true travesty","review":"Are you kidding me? These old and lovely songs are presented in a ridulous style. Children are more intelligent than the simple-minded cuteness of this recording. The inclusion of cute children's singing and talking makes this unappealing to an adult. This is not a Donovan album. Forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doll-sized tea pot","review":"Although the capacity was listed in the specs, it is much, much smaller than I anticipated and looks like a joke sitting on my stove.

I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"hums...but no whistle","review":"I bought this teapot as a Christmas gift. I received it the beginning of Dec., shipped it to my mother in New York to be opened on christmas morning. My mother loved it but said it only \\"hummed\\" and didn't whistle but it was okay because she could still hear it from the next room. Within a week, it stopped humming, and of course, never whistled. It was inexpensive...so I guess you get what you pay for. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"drawing table","review":"The table has a nice large surface which is nice. However one side of it was damaged in shipping. I used it for the bottom.

Where are the other three songs?We are very disappointed in this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the music, but...","review":"We love listening to this CD, but we were a little disappointed when we found out that the written lyrics were NOT included. In my opinion, that's a huge part of the educational value of buying a product like this one. The good thing is that I find my 8 year old daughter and 4 year old son trying to sing along anyway and we've only had it for a few days. So we will keep listening because it is fun & upbeat with a wide range of musical genres."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"Made me take the time out to check my spirit.

It provided an understanding to who I am and has caused me to seek a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for Much Improvement","review":"After reading the reviews for this book, I was hyped for a good read. My expectations were not met. The book was riddled with grammatical errors and changes in tense. The writer's POV was awkward. Sasha's story started out slow, so much so that I did not want to finish the book. I struggled to do so, but did because I had paid for the download. Some of the conflict in the story was resolved way too easily, unrealistic. I would not recommend purchasing the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got product","review":"I ordered this and never got it. I emailed the seller twice and got NO response Very disappointed.

So simple and easy to use. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading in the Labyrinth of Chaos","review":"As I began to read the pages of this book, I immediately began to draw comparisons to Umberto Eco, due to the intellectual flow of the prose. I have much respect for Umberto's work, and Brian's hit me with the same feeling. The only knock I would give to it is the excessive use of \\"ten cent\\" words. I have an extensive vocabulary, and Brian had me reaching for the dictionary with every chapter. Purpose and flow are intriguing, and it is a satisfying read. The subject matter is approached very well. This is definately a book that begs to be evaluated by each reader. I would say it is a challenge to complete, one worth noting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WISH I could recommend","review":"I searched long and hard for a reasonably priced kettle with the harmonica whistle. I thought I'd found it with the Calypso but unfortunately after less than a month of use the plastic lid on the spout, and the edge of the handle near the hinge have both started melting. And I don't think it's from using the kettle in any other than a typical fashion. BTW for those who report that the whistle didn't work, there was a care/use insert that told you how to adjust the screw in the spout lid to improve the whistling - alas, I won't get to enjoy it after all. I guess I'm going to have to spend the $ on the Chantal model and hope the hot handle is manageable. Maybe you'll have better luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks are deceiving!!!","review":"I looked for a long time for a tea kettle to purchase for my sister's wedding shower. She is designing a 50's retro-style kitchen and thought this tea kettle would be perfect. Bought this in the summer, because that is when I happened to find this on-line. Anyway, her shower was this past weekend and was I embarased when she took it out of the box and it was chipped. The pink enamel was chipped and I had never taken it out of the box. Now it is \\"too late\\" to return and I'm stuck with this piece of crap teakettle. I guess I should have thoroughly checked it out before giving it as a gift, but because the box had a see-through front, the product looked fine, and I never removed it from the box. Companies should stand behind their products if they were shipped defectively, no matter the time frame. I will never buy anything from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I really needed a whistling teapot because I get busy and forget it is on.

Not happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whistling Kettle that doesn't","review":"After waiting for two weeks for delivery to New Zealand I was delighted to find that the colour and style were exactly what I wanted and it looks great in my kitchen. Unfortunately disappointment followed when I found that for some reason the whistle doesn't work. There is probably a very good reason, but when buying off the net and having it shipped half way round the world, returning it to the supplier and getting a replacement is not an option. If the whistle was working it would definitely rate five stars - it looks good and heats water like it's supposed too. Will this experience put me off purchasing off the net again? Probably not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Sound!","review":"Ok....so I didn't order this teakettle for a long, LONG time because reviewers were saying that it didn't whistle. I thought it didn't make any noise at all. But, I loved its looks so I decided to order it anyway. The yellow color is a buttery yellow. The kettle is good and heavy and the enamel seems to be thick and evenly applied. But the sound....the sound is SO cool! It doesn't whistle like your Grandma's teakettle but it does make a sound. It starts out low and gets louder the longer it boils. It is a low and deep sound like a warning siren. You'll never have to worry about your kettle boiling dry. This kettle will alert you in plenty of time. I'm really enjoying the whole item from shape to color to sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for gas ranges","review":"It was a disappointment to find this pot was only for electric stoves.

I'm not sure what kind of QA the company runs but I've seen better quality at a swap meet. The kettle came chipped. Not just a little chipped but chipped to the point that it you'd find it in the 95% off bin at a retail store. Specifically, the whole top of the kettle was chipped around the rim as was the spout. In all, 7 chips with the biggest one being half an inch long - seems to me it's a small island and not a chip at that point. This one will be sent back first thing tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"whistling tea kettle has asthma","review":"The first one we receive wasn't capable of whistling at all (imperfections along the spout let pressure escape).Exchanged the pot, and the new one barely whistles. It's a very low tone similar to blowing into a jug. You might not notice it in the next room. Does boil water, just like the non-whistling teapot we were trying to replace. The whistling is what was desired, and this pot don't play that game."},{"rating":"1","title":"whistle works but...","review":"well the whistle works fine but the spout does not have a trigger to open it. You have to do it manually when it's hot or the water does not pour out well. Also a big chip knocked of the finish the first month we had it.

It has the harmonic whistle and I love that. Other reviewers said they had problems with the whistle, but I thought I'd try it. Well, didn't work, even after tweaking it. My husband forgot it boiling on the stove because it didn't whistle. I emailed customer service, because I thought they could mail me another whistle part, since it just unscrews.

It's definitely good for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it","review":"First off, I have to say that the tea kettle is very cute. The yellow color is exactly what's seen in the picture, and the shape is very nice. Unfortunately, the enamel was already bubbled in a couple places, it flaked off more when the stiff handle was turned, and the lid was very hard to put on. The spout looked fine, but for some reason didn't whistle, which was disappointing since I was interested in hearing the whistle mentioned in the other reviews. It sounded intriguing!The lack of whistle was the last step for me, so I returned it.

Midway was an extremely close call and victory for the Japanese might have meant conquest of Hawaii and therefore a war lasting some two years longer for America (my opinion). Prange excellently presents the intelligence dilemma and the precise interpretation which presented Admiral Nimitz with his opportunity to ambush Nagumo Chuichi and his four carriers. The author gives credit to the American commanders, Spruance and Fletcher for their flexibility and all the Americans for their courage and stamina. Midway was won by American naval airmen and Prange makes that clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on the Battle of Midway","review":"I have read several renditions of the Battle of Midway, but this is by far the most intriguing and interesting one to read. The author writes it like a story and draws you in-it was hard to put down. He has many sources and looks at the battle from both the Japanese and American perspective. This battle was probably the most important one we fought in the Pacific. If we had lost, the Pacific would have been Japanese home waters.

I'm now on my third set and my baby's only been in his own room for four months now. Both receivers in the first set made a constant, loud buzzing sound that started the second week of use. I tried both channels to no avail. I exchanged it for the second set. It worked okay for about six weeks. One of the receivers on this set started making a loud sound like an alarm clock that came on and off intermittenly no matter what channel it was on. I exchanged that for the third set. I had that one about two days before one of the receivers stopped working totally. Changing batteries did nothing. I'm now working with a hodge-podge of an old set a friend gave me with one receiver and the lone working receiver from the Fisher Price set. I refuse to exchange it again. Don't buy this model if you want peace of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Fisher Price","review":"These monitors are not worth the money!!! I purchased these locally and have extremely disappointed. The vibrate feature is worthless along with the \\"belt clip\\" and so called long range. You can't turn the volume up all the way without being deafened by the static. We continually battle the clicking,buzzing, and neighbors' conversations coming from well over 300 yards away!!! This is one of many disappointing products we have purchased from Fisher Price. I recommend doing some further research before purchasing these monitors"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second receiver stopped working","review":"I received this monitor as a gift for my second baby. I have a Graco dual receiver monitor that I use for my older toddler. I have had no problems with it. The second vibrating receiver for this Fisher Price model stopped working after about 2 months. So now only one receiver works, and I'm stuck dragging the receiver upstairs and down several times a day. There is also alot of static on the receiver if there is anyone standing nearby.

It's horrible! We have the receiver in our room and the monitor portion in the baby's room and we hear constant static on the receiver. When the baby does make noise, yes the monitor picks it up but the static is unbearable to listen too. Our bedroom and the baby room are not very far apart and no matter what channle (A or B) and what volumn level the receiver is at, we still here a contact static noise. I used to have a cheap 15.00 monitor that worked perfect.. I think I'll try to buy a cheaper model and see if we have better luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good monitor","review":"This monitor has done pretty well for us.

The other issue is that you have to take a seat out to get stuff out of the storage area at the bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice stroller for twins","review":"This stroller has been great for our twins. It is light weight, easy to fold up, and stores in a reasonable amount of space.

Overall, I'm very unhappy with this purchase, but I do feel we got what we paid for.Pros: great storage (although near impossible to access with both car seats attached) and cheap priceCons: incredibly difficult to steer, flimsy constructionEvery time we attempt to steer this stroller it puts such a strain on the frame, I swear the stroller is going to break. And, as many other reviewers have noted, it has become unusable as the twin in the back seat gets his feet pinched by the front car seat. 4 months of use, and now we need to replace it before the boys have outgrown their carseats. Not an ideal scenario at all. Wish we would have just bought our full feature stroller from the beginning - it would have saved us more money than buying 2 strollers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"As a mom of twins i thought this would be the perfect solution for the beginning. And i used this thing for way too long. It is IMPOSSIBLE to steer and you will find yourself straining and backing up a million times just to make a turn. Id say its pretty handy for 2 months max. But you might as well spend $50 more and buy a Graco Duoglider which accepts two carseats as well, steers great, and will last you because its also a real stroller!This double stroller frame is too expensive for what it is (or isnt)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit Chico Keyfit 30!","review":"This absolutely does not fit the Chico Keyfit 30 car seats.

Not a horrible thing, but still defective. What is horrible is the customer service that we have received from Baby Trend. First don't even try calling them, because every time you call you will be put on hold for 10 minutes and then told by a recorded message that they are experiencing higher then normal call volume and you're hung up on.

The instructions for customizing for your car seat are terrible - would it kill them to include some pictures so that you could see what they are suggesting? After setting the stroller up the way it is suggested for the Graco Snugride seats, the seats are not level, and they wobble terribly, you'd never want your precious babies riding around in this contraption.

It arrived on 07/09/2010. I have purchased new Graco Snugride 32 also on 07/08/2010. Just now I have assembled and modified the bars on the storller to fit for Graco. Great all looks wonderful. Here is the catch... after placing both the infant car seats on the stroller frame, I have noticied that front car seat rests on the rear car seat.I purchased this stroller frame with a useful life of 9-12 months not 3-4 months.This will reduce the useful/shelf live of less than 3 to 4 months. After 4 months, baby sitting in the rear seat will be hitting the front infant seat back. May have grearter chances of his feet get stuck in there also.

It's lightweight, easy to fold and unfold (I can do it with one hand) and is very easy to steer (again, one hand). We have Snugrides and they fit well.The only reason I subtracted a star is because the directions could have been a lot clearer. It requires some assembly and the pictures didn't quite match the parts I had. The drink tray wasn't even mentioned in the directions. Now this isn't an essential part and it just snapped into place, but when you are assembling something that may affect your children's safety, you really don't want to have pieces left over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with Chicco KeyFit Car Seats","review":"This stroller does not function as advertised with Chicco Key Fit car seats. The seats do not snap into the stroller they just rest on the frame. There are two straps that are suppose to secure the seats to the stroller however they are barely long enough to fit over the car seat and still allow it to slide around. The stroller may work great with other car seats however it is simply unsafe to be used with the Chicco seats."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does work with the Keyfit 30s","review":"I used this for a good 5 months with our twins and the Keyfit 30 seats. It works. I saw the video on youtube, but I actually put them in a little differently. I put the back seat in first, and then put the front seat in. You have to push it down deeper than you think. It takes a little pressure to get it in nice and snug. But once you get them in and strapped, you are good to go! The seats do not lock on, but you don't need them to if you have them sitting in there and strapped properly. For the price, I got more than my money's use out of it. My only complaint is that you really can't reach the bottom basket very well with the seats on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stroller Does Not Work with Graco Snugride 35 Car seats","review":"Putting together the stroller is easy although I do not like the straps you have to use to securely hold in the car seat. My husband had everything put together within a span of 20 minutes. You may need a Phillips head screwdriver and needle nose pliers if you have to change the bar spacing like we did. Once everything was put together we put in the car seats and the car seat, closest to the parent, almost sits on top of the back seat. It wasn't worth keeping for just a few months worth of use so we decided to send it back. Now our only problem is trying to remove the front wheels to make everything fit back inside the original box. The return process was super easy and UPS is set to pick up the package and bring the address label. Do not purchase this stroller frame if you own the Graco Snugride 35 car seats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have for Twins!!!","review":"I am absolutely thrilled with this stroller! It easily folds up and fits comfortably in the back of our mini-van, it's even easier to unfold and snap the carseats in...without waking babies up to switch them from carseats to strollers! It steers wonderfully as double strollers go and the storage space underneath is a godsend! We easily adjusted the bars to fit our carseats using the manual.I would reccomend this product to anyone with twins, you absolutely can't go wrong with the price or the style!

The new Cd is excellent. So, naturally being such a huge fan, I figured why not spend the $15 and buy the new DVD.From the first song I was bummed. Stapp's vocals are horrible. Not only does he sing off key but he is too dramatic in between songs. Obviously, vocal quality will suffer at a live show. But man...this disc gets unbearable. The visual quality is perfect. The audio is a problem. The first disc purchased froze in various spots, then my replacement disc has audio cut outs on each and every song. Stapp does not sound good on the new songs and it's too bad.The rest of the band is tight throughout. 17 songs on the disc is a bargain.Since this is the only official live dvd out there, many fans will still buy it.

I honestly would have rather he just lip-synced. His stage presence was great. The rest of the band was good, the production was great, lots of fireworks... but Stapp's voice was horrible. I honestly couldn't appreciate any of the songs. During \\"with arms wide open\\" he actually forgot some words and stumbled to recover the beginning of the second verse.

They appear to have poured a TON of money into this concert (the record 239 cameras, the stage show, etc.) and it seems like they really wanted to record an amazing concert, but it is just messed up by the vocals.

Not to mention, he acts like a tool on stage. Really a joke of a concert. I like Creed, but this might have been the worst concert I've ever seen.

Also in my opinion they never properly filmed the entire stage and the back drop of the stage..which was a record breaking stage presence with numerous lights and effects ect.. Creed got shanked! They claim to have 239 video cameras filming but the whole DVD is nothing but upclose shots of Scott Stapp. Which of course he did a great job! In my opinion the people who filmed this DVD did such a horrible job of not capturing the entire stage presence..and all the special effects. Just Terrible! Creed should demand their money back!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"First off, I WAS a huge Creed fan.. \\"Bullets\\" on Saturday Night Live is an all time favorite of mine.

And just as I loved it before, I still love it now! It is a great read for those who are born into Orthodoxy as well as for those who have just been introduced to it. Schaeffer's writing is easy to understand and keeps you interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to have a certain 'righteous indignation' to read it.","review":"I have read _Dancing Alone_ several years back as a catechumen in the Carpatho-Rusyn diocese. It was a stumbling block for me, as I did not feel any hostility towards my background (Methodist), but rather was simply looking for the Truth (and I went searching in all sorts of religions - Buddhism especially was quite attractive, but still lacked 'something'). Perhaps those with a righteous indignation - windmills to attack, or legitimate issues - and there is a place for righteous indignation (or zealotry), and it can be a good thing. It is not my temperment however, so if you start reading this book and find it a stumbling block, then by all means, put it down and read another text on Orthodoxy. But for many, this book has been a help in their journey, and these are my mere opinions, from somebody who really doesn't know much of anything, so take that into account."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does this book have to do with Dancing or being Alone?","review":"I recently read Frank Schaeffer's \\"Dancing Alone.\\" I was expecting to hear of his joy in his new faith (thus the dancing) and the sorrow of his possible estrangement from his former extended family of believers and how he dealt with it (thus the alone). However, the book revealed very little of the author's personal odyssey. It was more on the lines of a very long sermon or perhaps, term paper, analyzing the decay of western versions of Christianity and promoting the eastern version through somewhat rose colored glasses.I have read other books by this author, fiction and non fiction and he always comes off so angry. Sometimes humor and pathos is mixed with the anger making him seem more human but not in this book. I was disappointed.."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for information on the Orthodox church...","review":"This is not the book for you.Mr. Schaeffer is an ARTIST who happens to have a famous evangelist for a daddy (Could it be why he published this book?) with no expertise in orthodoxy.Please understand that his 'expertise' is personal experience. If you're going to read this book, please read it as if you are reading a testimony of ones walk to orthodoxy. His unresolved anger with his former evangelist self clouds his arguements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lopsided","review":"It's unfortunate that Schaeffer, like so many Protestants who search for the truth, stop at Constantinople rather than completing the journey to Rome. Despite enormous patristic and historical support for Rome's papal claims, so many move from the Protestantism stemming from the heresies of Luther and Calvin to the Protestantism stemming from the grandfather of them all, Photius the Proto-Protestant. I made the same journey as Schaeffer, at the same time, but I actually read the Fathers and ended up in Rome. A much better select would be \\"Rome Sweet Home : Our Journey to Catholicism\\" -- Scott Hahn, Kimberly Hahn (Contributor); Paperback"},{"rating":"1","title":"half good, half bad","review":"When Frank Schaeffer spoke at the Festival of Orthodoxy in Dallas in February 2005, he said that he was too harsh in this book, and that were he able to do it over, he would rewrite half of it. I don't know which half or which parts he would rewrite, but I agree with him about the harshness of his tone, which to me seriously degrades the value and trustworthiness of this book. It's interesting, but Schaeffer's jeremiad makes for wearisome reading after awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"History That's Easy to Digest","review":"I had previously read Williams' \\"Stoner\\" -- and thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't know what to expect when he tackled an historical subject, but should have figured that he'd get the human aspect of it just right. That's exactly what he did. \\"Octavius\\" retells the story of the Roman Empire in the years of Octavius Caesar's reign, following the assassination of his adoptive father, Julius Caesar. The story is riveting -- well told through excerpts from the diaries, memoranda and missives of Octavius and many of his contemporaries. The characters are wonderfully drawn. A very easy and informative read. I have no idea if Williams' depiction of the title character's humanity and personality is accurate, but if so he was a remarkable ruler.

However, people looking for technical details will be disappointed, as it does not provide any technical information or way to protect or safeguard corporate information.I like this book because it takes your attention to places that are ignored by many people. Remember, installing and configuring Firewalls, IP Sec, and Encryption is useless if you leave your server room accessible. That's exactly what this book tells.

I started the book after I saw 3rd episode of The Broken and a friend told me he has just bought a copy while visiting London.I expected an eye opening and high-tech hacker book, but I was very disappointed. In his book Mitnick lists plenty of social engineering stories, couple of which do represent a fresh way to look at things, but after reading couple of them, he just starts to repeat himself. Another disappointment was that there are absolutely no practical hacker hints or tricks and almost no computer related stuff in this book. After every story Mitnick gives advice, but that is typically just common sense and I have doubts how his methods of keeping a company safe of social engineers could be practical in a professional world.So, if you don't have any other idea what to read on the beach this summer, you can grab a copy.

By being sensitive to human behavior and taking advantage of trust, they learn to bypass your security systems. The book teaches you how to ward off such threats and educate employees. Yet, problematically, this information could also help con artists be more sophisticated. In any case, this highly informative, engaging book includes sample conversations that open the door to information, along with tips about how various cons are used and what to do about them.

Most of the stuff he talks about - such as the Statute of limitaions applies to very few people. And the chapter on grants is good but Mathew Lesko has better informtion on that subject.

Thank God I was able to gently get his hand back out. I later had my husband hold 2 fingers in the square (3/4 the size of the regular squares) where our son had his hand and I then attempted to unlock the gate and just the motion of unlocking the gate COULD HAVE created the space smaller, pinching into our son's wrist even more. THERE ARE NO WARNINGS ON THIS GATE ABOUT SMALL CHILDREN GETTING THEIR HANDS OR FEET STUCK. It is common sense though and one would think that a child would be able to bring their hand back out. But because he got it between the end where the gates overlap, the area was smaller. I see the far edges are smaller too. I wouldn't even trust this gate for an animal.

There are set notches, you can't just adjust it to whatever size you need. While all our hallways and doors are standard sizes, this fits in none of them. The rubber ends aren't even, so you can't get it to hold firmly at all. When the top one is tight, the bottom one is too loose and there's nothing you can do to adjust that. My girls got the gate down in a matter of seconds and they're not even walking yet. I had it in as tight as I could get it. Another time, I had tightened it and it came down and scraped my ankle when all I did was walk past. Imagine having a baby or toddler pulling up on it. What kind of harm can it do them?

Ours is going back asap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this, doesn't hold tight and fiddly to use.","review":"My 8 month old was strong enough to pull this down, even when I had it adjusted so tight the center beam was bowing.

So they went to go live with their Grandma and Grandpa and Elliot. Robert did not like Elliot at all because in school he chewed on skin and he would also be selfish. Other than that he would make really good drawings and not tell anybody that he had amazing drawing skills because he could have became an artist.The book took place in Rhode Island. I don't know what other books Janet Taylor Lisle wrote because this is my first book by this author.

It is gorgeous, ravishing, creative, original, inventive, and a whole lot more. But it is too short. It could be twice the length and still be too short!!The music is hard to pigeonhole, but I would call it \\"contemporary\\", but strongly inspired by the spirit, rhythm, and melodies of medieval music (but one could easily switch the terms \\"contemporary\\" and medieval in the above sentence and still be equally accurate). All the songs are evocative and transporting, but Dringo Bell is the apogee of the disc.This disc is also a celebration of the glory of the feminine. Truly so in an aural sense.

Absolutely lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"The girl is hot, and so is the band","review":"This is the type of recording that makes you want to go hear the act live and in person... they are such good musicians, and she is so, um, evocative in her song renderings, and on top of all that, they all seem to be having a GREAT time doing it. It's \\"swing\\" music but don't be misled, in case you think that genre limits this record. It's swing, its got some soul, its got some blues, and it's all wrapped up in one package. Somebody mail this disc to Letterman or Leno, it'd be nice to see an act with talent, who enjoys their music, have some success.

Lavay Smith is constantly revered as the purist swing group in existence, but she and her band are in essence nothing more than a hepped up blues band.Her attempts at covering jump blues material flail wildly, and her voice falls flat.Stick with the bands previous debut, where the instruments better conceal her sophomoric vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You, Amazon.com!","review":"I bought this CD on a whim, on an Amazon recommendation. Well, thank you Amazon for introducing me to Lavay and Her Red Hot Skillet Lickers! This is one of the best CDs I've heard in years -- superb musicianship that SWINGS, a mixture of blues, swing, and r&b that is as thrilling as it's eclectic, and, in Lavay, one of the sexiest voices since Billie Holliday. The original songs hold their own with the reworkings of numbers pioneered by Dinah Shore, Count Basie, Jay McShann and Dizzy Gillespie.

I hate pop (though not as much as I hate rap) and if you actually consider the words okay, good, awesome or anything related to those words to describe this album then you are smoking something like crack, pot or crystal meth. This is terrible, just the words pop and especially trl make me stay as far away from this piece of crap as possible. Whoever came up with the idea of making a 'Best of Trl pop' anyway? All it is is useless overplayed songs with little meaning and no inspiration (good inspiration). Its albums like this though that make me glad that N'SYNC, Backstreet Boys and O-Town are here no more.*Note: Amazon needs to get 0 and negative star options.*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pop album!","review":"I've had this CD for 2 years and still play it sometime. But while some of the comments have been negative, you have to understand how much these pop songs were major hits within a 3 to 4-year period. Their videos were shown a lot on MTV's TRL, but the songs were catchy and addictive. This album keeps a consistent flow within its 56 minutes. And one of the rare ones to have boy bands NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees and O-Town on the same album. Would have liked Britney's Baby One More Time on here, but they might have had to go through record label permission and licensing issues to get it on there. I still love 3LW's No More, Mya's song, Sisqo's song, Willa Ford's song, Souldecision's funky Faded, BBMAK's song and others on here as well as Enrique Iglesias' tasty Be With You.

(Of those that come close, I'd include 'SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE, DIFFERENT SEASONS, PET SEMATARY, DOLORES CLAIBORNE, and THE GREEN MILE.) MISERY is without a doubt (in my opinion) King's greatest horror novel, an excellent exemplar of what constitutes a good horror/suspense tale, a memorable work indeed. I strongly recommend that anyone who enjoys being fraught with terror read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. A thriller until the end","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I've read the book several times and I've also seen the movie by Rob Reiner numerous times. King vividly portrays all of the characters. It is very suspenseful and the action plays out nicely.

Of course, that only contributed more to a wilder imagination! Like all other SK novels, Misery carries an element of supernatural. I couldn't consider the story as horror since there were no ghosts,apparitions nor exorcism --- but still paranormal in the sense that Annie Wilkes was acting abnormally. She was sort of a lunatic too obsessed with \\"Misery\\" & its writer. I also admire SK for being able to capture the readers' attention considering that the story was too tight-spaced ---- limited to 2 characters trapped in one house, with nothing to do but talk, write & axe each other :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I read \\"Misery\\" in about a week.

King puts the reader in Paul Sheldon's head and you can actually feel the pain he is going through. Unlike other unrealistic monsters,Annie Wilkes is totally believeable. The movie is alright too,but it leaves out the most suspenseful parts in the book (The amputations,the state trooper that is killed by Annie,and the other troopers that come to investigate).Plus,the movie kills Buster,the likeable sheriff.

It took away from the suspense of the plot since i was always trying to figure out what was going on with the punctuation."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Thrill Ride\\"","review":"Probably the greatest piece of work Stephen King ever did, \\"Misery\\" tells the story of how a famous writer, named Paul Sheldon, drives his car off a road in the middle of a snowstorm in Colorado. He is rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes who brings Paul into her home where she nurses him back to health. She confides in Paul that she is his #1 fan as she loves his \\"Misery\\" novels, a series of books that Paul is most famous for. However, once Annie realizes that Paul has killed off Misery in his latest book, Annie displays signs that she is totally unhinged and Paul is swept into absolute horror. It is then up to Paul's writing skills to escape the hell that Annie has put him in. \\"Misery\\" would be turned into an excellent motion picture in 1990 directed by Rob Reiner, and it would garner Kathy Bates the Oscar for Best Actress for her mesmerizing performance of Annie Wilkes. The book, like the film, is a must-own."},{"rating":"2","title":"King at his best","review":"This is how Stephen King should've written all of his books: straight to the point, no nonsense thriller.

Lets just say its my way of bringing Mysery back to life and giving it to the world. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars","review":"This was bone chilling. This book was hard for me to put down, and the movie never came close to be as exciting as the book is."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of King's best","review":"Although Misery has only two main characters and one setting, this book manages to astound you with surprise at every turn. This is a book where King uses suspense very well, and I found this novel almost impossible to put down. I was horrified by Annie, and at one time almost puked at the thought of her (so go out and buy this book right now!) King made us almost feel sorry for her, and as you see into her past, you can start to see her slow decay into madness. Paul's inner strugles to write a good novel instead of the Misery trash is also intriuging, and that part almost seems to come from his own life. Overall, this book is up there with Salems Lot and the Shining, and is a \\"must have\\" in any horror collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is better than the book.","review":"I was interested in reading this book after I saw the movie. The book is in my opinion, very disagreeable. I had a hard time understanding how the hero of the book gave that evil woman chances. One moment he's saying how you can't reason with crazy and the next moment he's sorry for her and not wanting to hurt her feelings. He had an opportunity to get away or die trying, and did not take it. I couldn't buy his reason for not leaving and then she came back and hurt him super bad. There are none of those brain teasing games in the movie; the woman is nuts and he tries everything to get away from her. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best Work","review":"If you are a really big Stephen King fan, you might be a little dissapointed with this book. I think it was alright, but it was really slow and dragged you through most of the book. By reading the back, it really sounds like a good read, but the only parts of this book that I really enjoyed were the exciting parts where Paul Sheldon was in danger, and the ending. I found this book boring and slow and I would not really recommend it. There are plenty more Stephen King books that are much more exciting than this particular book. I think it is a good piece of writing, but I don't think it is really that good of a book. I would suggest that you pick up a different Stephen King book before you read this one because most of his other books are a lot better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery","review":"I didn't like the book Misery written by Stephen King because it draged on until the very end. There were some parts in it that were very discusting. The story draged on and it made it confusing cecause you didnt't know if he was dreaming or it was really happening. The oher thing I didn't like about this book is it curses to much, and it had hardley any kind of action till the end. I wouldn't recommend thios bokk to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The word monotone could have been coined to describe this","review":"very interesting to read the other reviews. This book was completely wrecked for me by its unrelieved er ... misery. In all Kings best work (and I'm a big fan), happiness and unhappiness compliment each other nicely, balancing the tone of the novel.The other very simple fault King is prone to, an american disease almost, is too many 'happy' endings. In his best works, like pet sematary there is always doubt and ambiguity. Why are americans so addicted to happy endings in horror novels?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that's easy to put down and walk away from.","review":"Misery is perhaps the worst book I have ever read. From cover to cover, nothing but predictability. Paul sheldons attempt to decieve Annie, and her naivety to fall for it every time got very old. By the time I was halfway through I wanted one of them to die. It didn't matter which one it was. If you are new to the Stephen King scene, pick a different book. I would hate for you to get the wrong idea about this writer by reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Ending-Nothing Else","review":"The ending to Misery is absolutly hoffiying. It made me cringe. It, however, is the only good part about the book. The story doesn't even start rolling until Annie takes the ax to Paul.

Love+hate at it's best will she kill Paul before he finishs writing the book dedicated to her. The Movie lacks in suspense that is why you need to read the book, like I did.

It is almost 400 pages, and the first time I saw this book, I didn't really interested in it because it is long. But after I read a couple of chapters, I started to like it, specially in the middle of the book when the main character tried to escape from the house before the phycho woman came back. If she caught him trying to escape, she would punished him. Her punishment is unlike parents punishing their kids. She would make him feel pain. She could even cut off his leg. This woman has her own reason for doing this, but I don't understand her reason, but who can understand a psychotic's motives? I don't think so unless you are phycho, too. Anyway, I recommend this book for those of you who are looking for new books to read. It is good. Try it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Put A Little Misery In Your Pipe And Smoke It!","review":"Undeniably in my opinion, another one of King's great triumphs in a long list.

I love the book misery and i love the writer Stephen King. thank you Alair"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic, and certainly one of King's best!","review":"It is a very good book. King is leaving his regular style of dealing with para-normal phenomenon, and start dealing with the most normal, and yet most para-normal thing: the Human soul. More than it is a horror book, it is a thriller, and a very good one. You feel the sweat dripping down your neck and your breathe getting faster when the hero is in tension and fear (and there are many moments like this.). This is a story about a situation that we wouldn't like to find ourselves in, and that's why I personally symphatyzed the hero, it is the story of the human soul in its struggle to survive and in the depthes of madness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente","review":"Esta novela es super buena, se la recomiendo a cualquiera.

I first read this book in 1989 and it was an absolute page-turner from the very beginning. As the story unfolded we found out about a writer in serious pain after crashing his car somewhere in Colorado, a nurse who took him in who seemed quite competent except for one thing-it soon became very obvious that she was absolutely crazy. So good was King's description of his wounded writer-held-prisoner that I as a reader almost began to feel what he was feeling. I had to keep putting the book down and reminding myself that this was \\"just a story.\\"This one is terror and suspense all the way and the many detours the story takes en-route to its dramatic conclusion only add to the already richly engossing tale it is.

Annie's oogie vernacular tends to stick in my mind long after the read (can you tell, you dirty bird?).Romance writer Paul Sheldon never should have gone driving drunk near Sidewinder, Colorado. He crashed his car in a snowstorm, only to have Annie Wilkes, ex-nurse turned serial killer, pull him out. When she recognized him from the back of her Misery novels, she, being his number-one fan, takes him hostage, forcing him to write a new book for her.If you're reluctant to read this because you've already seen the movie, read it anyway! I loved the film version with Kathy Bates, but the book is even better. Things happen a bit differently, and you get an inside look at everything that goes on in poor Paul's mind during months of horrific torture.I LOVED this book (so vivid!) and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery didn't really interest me","review":"I read books a lot and when I read this book It was really boring.

I saw the movie, thinking that it might be better (but, of course, movies are never better than books). Boy, was I wrong! The book was bad, and the movie was worse. King does not develop characters well in general, and he does a particularly poor job in \\"Misery\\". In any good book, I will find myself anticipating a knowledge of the characters' fate. Not so in \\"Misery\\". Within 100 pages, I had no feelings for either of the main characters. I considered it *work* to finish this book. Believe me, if you can get through this, you can get through anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, uneventful, worthless","review":"The main problem with this book is that you just don't care about the fates of the characters. Sure, you've got all the wham-bam gruesome action, some well-described scenes of torture, but even during these sequences where your interest should be at it's high-point, the mind tends to drift, to imagine alternate scenerios, to develop a better telling of the story itself. Every dead-end page after every drudging leaf of cheap, sanitized paper it goes on and on and on and who the hell cares in the end? Stephen King has never been a great writer, just a man with a fertile imagination and enough ability to get by with a fully created world. But, when the story lacks depth or incident--like Misery--then all that scamming and lying to conning for prestige is gone and you're left with a hack churning out yet another volume of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Misery","review":"True misery is reading this novel. By the time he'd written this, King had succumbed to the \\"my every word is golden\\" delusion, so the thing is much larger than it needed to be.

Considering he was probably around less then a year before he left. Apparently this girl led a sheltered life. Gem is desperate and irritating and fell in love with someone she hardly knew.

Instead, the action proceeds much like a soap opera and never reaches any suspenseful or frightening climaxes. Example, young girl being used as \\"bait\\" for vampire waits nervously unaware that the vampire is advancing upon her from behind. The camera pans down so you can see the advance of the vampire from under the couch the girl is resting on. What should be a terrifying, suspenseful scene is undermined by the view of blue slippers and the bottom of a dark blue cloak on the \\"creature\\" (an attractive but blah, middle aged mom) walking up on her.

Captain Kronos is a lame attempt at a vampire tale. It ignores most of the traditional rules which you will either love or hate and is pitifully acted. The first 1/3 of the movie is all set up and exposition with no pay off at the end. Most of the movie consists of Kronos flashing a colgate smile and giving lines to his new found girlfriend that even Austin Powers would find chessy.The rest of it are scenes of young girls who suddenly have a black robbed figure appear out of no where while on a frollick some where or another and have their youth drained away. The climax if you can call it that is as about as scary as robin hood men in tights without the humor.If you read these other reviews and are tempted remmeber this 99% who write them are die hard fans who will love it no matter what because it's a hammer film.

The cast is perfect, and includes the stunningly beautiful Caroline Munro.

Heartbroken and perplexed as to why this was happening, I went online and did some research. I was AMAZED at the reviews I found and am stunned that everyone has had the same results! I immediately moved \\"goldie\\" to a new home. Thanks to all your reviews we still have our beloved carnival fish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"The biggest educational value this tank provides is the lesson of life and death. This tank kills all fish!!!! They should recall this horrible tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!!","review":"My children,ages 14, 10, and 8 really enjoyed this book. The main character,Myles, gets into all kinds of mischief. He makes the book fun. We used this book at the end of a homeschool Middle Ages unit study. I wish we would have used it in the beginning. This book, in my opinion, is the best by Howard Pyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look at coming of age in the days of chivalry.","review":"This timeless classic is a great look into the thoughts and dreams of a young boy growing into adulthood in the days of castles and knights. Well written and filled with suspense as Myles Falworth negotiates his way in a sometimes hostile feudal environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature Book","review":"This book was purchased for my son to read for his history class for a particular time period. Nothing more, nothing less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand old classic of boy becoming man in the Age of Chivalry","review":"A wonderful story of life in the Middle Ages. A boy finds himself sent by his impoverished, blind father to a castle to serve as a squire. There he grows up, learns to become a knight, and begins to learn the reasons why his father had sent him there: to position him to challenge his father's enemy at the court of Henry IV and restore the family fortune and good name. A little romance even occurs for the lad. The style is a little quaint, as I believe this book was written at the end of the nineteenth century, but in the context of this tale of ancient times, it feels right anyway! A good tale for young men and women about the triumphs of right over wrong, and the importance of standing up for what you believe in. Great illustrations by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of Age, Coming of Honor.","review":"This is a classic coming-of-age story set in the age of knights and fair ladies. Myles starts out as a lowly squire, but he gains in strength and skill, wisdom and honor, and ends up a knight. Also read Otto of the Silver Hand by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men of Iron The making of a young man to a knight","review":"This was a time whena young man who had to be carefully taken in the steps of knightlyhood. With the days going by, he had o fight his father's foe.I would recommend this book to a friend of mine who would like to read classsic books, and hopefully he/she would find this book enjoying. I wouldn't say the boook was totally boring, however, it could have been a bit more exciting. It always counts to the persons' opinon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss it!","review":"Ewa Podles' voice is incredibly rich, her technic is astonishing and she sings so expressively that really brings tears in my eyes. She is definitely a diva and performs these wonderful pieces the way they should be performed. The booklet includes libretto with English translation, which is very helpful for those who don't speak Russian. However, the music and the performance are so emotive that can touch you even if you do't know the words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs of Ewa.","review":"There is simply NO BETTER recording of \\"Songs and Dances of Death\\" by Mussorgsky. Ewa Podles voice in Lullaby makes your blood freeze in your veins; her interpretation of Death is terribly beautiful. It adds to the effect knowing that in Russian \\"death\\" is a feminine word, contrary to Latin languages, so a female voice singing for both the Mother and Death is stunning.One can compare this with also a very good recording by Sergei Leiferkus or a much worse one by Brigitte Fassbaender. Alas, Russian cannot be sung properly by those who are not linked to that language, and since Ewa Podles is Polish, her pronunciation is as good as Russian. And her voice caps it all; she is a stunning, amazing diva; the adulation she receives fro her unique range and beauty of her tone, mastery of her tuning is well-demonstrated by this opus.Truly this is the best \\"Songs and Dances\\"; HIGHLY recommended for Russian music lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"foundaional approach to homiletics","review":"I was looking for a basic homiletics text and have found it in this book. Cantalamessa looks at the Word of God itself, rather than methodology. He proposes a foundation for preaching and evangelization based on an experience of Jesus as a person rather than as a theological construct or concept. He does not eschew discussions of difficult topics, e.g. verbal inflation and absolute truth. His familiarity with a broad sampling of the Fathers of the Church and other literature both grounds and clarifies the presentation. The Alan Neame translation is a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"This product is great.

I was so excited.Sometimes it whistles, sometimes it doesn't. Also, there is not a tight seal on the lid. I am disappointed but exhausted from the long search and would rather have a \\"sometimes train sounding\\" kettle than one that won't do it at all. .. so I kept it.Maybe when I am rich again, I'll go get the other one ...but who would spend $75 on a tea kettle? Something seems just wrong about that with people starving in Burma and all.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb book for anyone interested in Germany's version of the world's game.","review":"Uli Heese-Lichtenberger's account of the history of German football is amazing. But anyone who has ever followed his regular columns before reading \\"Tor!\\" will not be surprised. I recommend this book to anyone who is the least bit interested in not only Germany's version of the world's game, but in a bit of German history too.My seller here at Amazon was awesome too. My book arrived faster than expected and was in wonderful condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock Opera - Not Symphonic Metal","review":"There is some good singing here, and some ok music, but the metal aspect is minor and out of place. Imagine Celine Dion doing a Disney movie soundtrack with double bass drumming, but with little to no guitars. This band is nothing like Lacuna Coil or Evanescence, and nothing like Dimmu Borgir - who are real symphonic metal kings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but hard to find!","review":"I spent 6 months looking for this CD after I first got \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" and finally got my hands on, \\"The Phantom Agony\\". I turned my attention to finding this album and it was worth my wait! Every track on this album is great! I especially love \\"Mother of Light\\", \\"The Last Crusade\\" and the beautiful duet, \\"Trios Vierges\\". It is SUCH a great album and I recommend the other two Epica CDs as well! They just keep getting better and better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Variety","review":"This is Epica's second album and they have improved on their first one. The first one was somewhat repetitive (but since it was repeating something pleasant to hear, that was okay). There are still a nice balance of soprano and growls that marks this CD as a Beauty and the Beast or Gothic metal. The music is the one with the major face lift. With a variety of time signatures and more intricate instrumentation, this effort keeps the replay factor much better than their first disc. The sound retains the distinctive sounds of Mark Jansen found on the first two After Forever discs and the first Epica CD. However, Mark seems to have grown musically since the songs have variety to them. I recommend this album if you like After Forever or other Gothic metal bands - it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Another fine effort by one of my new favorite bands, Epica. This one has less of the cookie monster growls than either Phantom Agony or Divine Conspiricy, therefore it all sounds a bit more accessible. However, there does seem to be a small price in that the music, while still great, doesn't seem quite as strong as Epica's other efforts. The difference is very small indeed. Perhaps those growls are the key...hmmmm..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner","review":"A very interesting book, very well wrote. I enjoyed it very much! I want to read more of Hall's books. Keep up the good work!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book.","review":"I loved this book. I've read it twice and know I'll read it more in the future. This book was full of suspense and surprises from beginning to end. I highly recommend it to young adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"the second Once Blue album","review":"Jesse Harris writes in the liner notes of this remastered & re-issued album that indeed the 9 bonus tracks on this CD were from the recording sessions from what was to be the 2nd Once Blue album. If you were looking for another album from them, look no further.... you've found it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes Good but bad Ingredient","review":"I really like the taste and the cute bottle. I would put it all over alot more things if it didn't have xantham gum in it, which is a lab created product made from genetically engineered bacteria. Who knows what that stuff is doing to your system and reproductive capabilities down the line? I have used this stuff when I was dining out and was very impressed with the flavor. It tastes good on burritos. I just would not want to buy it to use every day because of the chemical ingredient. Maybe they should try organic cornstarch or arrowroot powder to thicken it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price Comparison","review":"My wife purchased this item at \\"Shoppers\\" supermarket in Laurel, MD today. She was complaining that the price was raised from under $2.00 to $2.98 when the item was moved into the Gourmet section of the store. Still, the $2.98 she paid is a far cry from the $13.20 this company gets, when shipping is included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Business rules bible","review":"This is the book I was waiting for. Before this book I spent hundreds of hours researching business rules on the internet and still didn't get the detailed material that this book contains. I agree with other reviewers that you can use this book to base a business rules implementation on, and you can also use it to teach business rules to your team. I think it has a perfect balance of implementation, concept and practical information and recommend it to anyone who is interested in business rules. I skimmed through the Morgan book that others have recommended and like it too, but it is basic and will not help you in implementation. This (von Halle) book is the one to get and it's the most complete book on the subject available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I bought this book based on some of the enthusiastic reviews here but was very disappointed. I think people who see rules engines as the next big thing and are very excited about it may be enthusiatistic about this book because it pushes that line very hard. However, there is very little in this book that reflects hard practical experience or that is likely to surprise an experienced software designer with a basic understanding of rules engines. Good books on this subject are still waiting to be written.Instead of this book I would recommend reading \\"Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software\\" by Eric Evans and the documentation for whatever rules systems you are considering."},{"rating":"1","title":"They may have liked it, but I didn't at all","review":"It has always amazed me at the amount of money I spend foolishly. I read reviews and I purchase expensive books (like this one) and can't wait until it is delivered to my door so I can gain a better perspective on a specific subject. If that's your goal too, then you're wasting your time and money just like me.Business rules are important (that's why I bought this book) but I didn't learn a thing that I already knew. Actually, I could probrably write a better one than this and I'm just a lowly DW architect.I'm not going to get into the facts, the other reviewers didn't either. Just take my advice and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller than I thought it would be.","review":"Smaller than I thought it would be and took a long time to arrive. It was to be a birthday gift and it arrived long after the date that I expected it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 2 men's bikes","review":"Purchased the HR8000 based on the positive reviews. Unit is solid, easy to connect to my hitch. However, loading any 3 bikes on it requires expert Tetris skills. I gave up after spending more than 2 hours at it. Even if I could have gotten the pedals and handlebars and such to play nice, the spacing of the forks is too wide for a girls' mountain bike. Spoke with Hollywood's customer service, they suggested purchasing a special adapter. The adapter was expensive relative to the cost of the carrier itself, and from the description I was concerned whether this would securely hold a bike on a bumpy road (such as any SF Bay Area Hwy). Fortunately, Amazon accepted the return at no charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Duty Carrier","review":"We have two older model ten (10) speeds that weigh almost 50 pounds each. This rack supports them with no trouble. When the hitch bolt is tightened to hold the rack rigid, it does not move. Make sure all the nuts and bolts are fastened securely and tight before using. There is some sway when the bikes are on the rack when moving, but this would hold true of any carrier. With the removal of key pins, the arms lower, and the rack itself tilts at a 45 degree angle to allow access to the vehicle. As it is made of steel rather than aluminum, it appears to be stronger than some of the more expensive racks. You can pay more, this isn't a cheap rack, but it is doubtful you can find one any better.The only fault and it is common in hanging racks,is that when carrying a woman's bike or some hybrids, it will be necessary to be creative in methods of securing the bike to the rack. Buying a top post adapter will solve many of the bike positioning problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk bike rack","review":"bought this rack because i was told it was the best made got it assembeled per directions placed bikes on it first time straps broke on 2 of the 4 bikes on the rack and trashed my wifes new bike and tore the seat on my sons have not been able to talk to anyone with customer service was hung up on once!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Bike Rack!","review":"Great 4-bike rack at a great price. Light enough for me to easily put on and off by myself, as a 47 year old woman, but very sturdy. Easy to snug bikes up, anti-sway works well. I can even open my back hatch on my Lexus 330, without hitting it. Get a pad lock to replace the Carter key, and it is secured to your hitch. But you still need to lock your bikes onto the rack with a cable, if you leave them. Excellent product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not fit most bikes.","review":"This rack is sturdy and well built, but has a major flaw. The support arms are too wide to accomodate most modern bikes. Even with the top tube adapter (which I also purchased) there is still not enough clearance to fit smaller frame bikes on the rack. I'm not talking about children's bikes, but smaller frame adult bikes. The rubber cradles help cushion and secure the bike, but they are also bulky and it is difficult to fit the bikes over them. If you have large frame bikes with straight top tubes the rack works fine, but with the modern road bikes and mountain bikes with sloping top tubes the fit is difficult, even with the adapter. If the support arms were about 3 to 4 inches closer together the rack would be perfect, but the way it is now it's almost useless for many bikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"Seems like a solid product (especially for the price) and was easy to install. Tilt-back feature works as intended and is very simple to use. I am satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"What i expected","review":"Happy with the product.

Carroll manages to mix mundane with mystical in a very charming way. Glass Soup continues whereWhite Applesleft the story of Vincent, Isabelle and their child messiah. This makes recommending this book very straightforward: if you've read White Apples and enjoyed it, Glass Soup is a must read book. If you haven't read White Apples, start there.That said, I think this is quite a worthy sequel to White Apples. The story is quite as odd and profound as it was before. Carroll weaves the events beautifully, as the main characters travel around Vienna and cross the borders between life and death. There's odd humour, curious characters, and fairly deep thinking. The opening of the book is delightfully surreal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I read in 2005!","review":"I give major credit to the people who can write really long reviews. I can't. But I can tell you that this was an amazing book! I stumbled across Jonathan Carroll through a Listmania list, and I'm glad I did.

She said that it is her favorite book and that everybody should read it.! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into this one","review":"I've anxiously awaited every Jonathan Carroll since I got hooked reading From The Teeth of Angels back in 91. But his later works have started to dim that anticipation. From Marriage of Sticks until this book, my enjoyment seems to be on a steadily downward path.What drew me to Carroll was his fantastic ability to create a scene from the \\"normal\\" world, and then show us what really lies underneath. The fantastic and metaphysical that turns the first view on its head.With this book he seems to jump into a swirling pool of the metaphysical and it doesn't seem to bear any relation to the \\"normal\\" world. If others enjoy that type of book, good. But for me it is unsettling enough that I'll read reviews before I automatically pick up the next Carroll book (unless its a reprint of an earlier great work that I've not been able to acquire yet)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolutely Necessary Tool for the Classroom","review":"There really isn't any need to spend significant space on the overall quality of this product; Crayola is a known brand with high standards which follow through to this as well. What is more important is expressing how important it is for schools to incorporate the multicultural coloring products into their classrooms. It is not easy to find these products outside of online and catalogue venues (which is unfortunate), however it is critical for young students of color (or Caucasian students, for that matter) to have a full range of options when asked (as they so often are) to draw themselves, their family, or their general community.

The title of this album is accurate-Mayall is recalling his youth from middle age.A good deal of his youth appears to have been spent masturbating and fantasizing about sex.That's inescapable-the lyrics of \\"Wish I Knew a Woman\\" frankly describe an adolescent Mayall\\"jacking off pretending I'm the lover of them all\\"as he stares at the pinups hanging on his walls.The tunes are flat and the songs simply don't swing.This isn't rock and it fails as blues. Sorry I can't find a way to sugarcoat this, but the album stinks.I'm sure Mayall would be the first to admit that in his career he's put out some duds.This album doesn't come off at all.Grab \\"Bluesbreakers\\" or one of his other classics instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely a remarkable woman","review":"I also bought this book in Auschwitz. I read is as soon as I bought it. While touring through the concentration camps you see all the horrible things that these people had to go through. But when you read the book, you experience the whole thing again, but with more heart. You go through the steps with Halina, you cry and you can almost feel what she felt. She is a remarkable woman for not possessing hatred, instead she encourages love and wisdom. Because of Halina I have become a more understanding person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it","review":"Great book easy to read and easy on the eyes.

The idea of being able to listen to my little one's heartbeat at home was thrilling. Every month, I had loved going to my prenatal appointments just so I could hear her. Unfortunately, I tried time and again with this device and was unsuccessful in ever really knowing what I was hearing. I tried from week 20 until 34 weeks when I just gave up. Although I followed all of the directions, this product only helped me hear one thing - my husband complaining about all the money I wasted!!! Please don't make the same mistake. If you want to hear a heartbeat, rent a doppler like your health care provider has. Check the classified ads in mom/baby fitness magazines. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I purchased this in my 5th month of pregnancy and I am now in my 8th month. The only thing that I have heard with it is my own heartbeat and the sounds of my own stomach growling .

In my opinion, it is a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE dont waste your money","review":"We were anxious and wanted to hear our baby's heatbeat at home, but were shy at spending the money to buy the more expensive dopplers so we got this. PLEASE check out Baby Beats.com - for as little as $20 you can rent a doppler just like the one they use at the Dr.s office!!! This one is very poor sound quality, and we were frustrated very quickly. By 28 weeks you may be able to hear the baby's heartbeat just by puttin' your ear to the belly, but before then just get a doppler!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only because 0 stars isnt an option","review":"WARNING - YOU CAN'T EASILY RETURN THIS PRODUCT IF IT DOESNT WORK.I bought this at ~ 20 weeks because I was getting concerned when I couldn't feel her move. I am now 30 weeks, and I still can't hear a heartbeat with it. What a piece of junk. There is absolutely no sound insulation on the monitor itself, so the pressure of your finger as you hold down the button makes more noise than anything inside you does. The only thing I was ever able to hear was stomach sounds when I had indigestion. I tried for over an hour the other day, being very careful not to let the monitor or cord touch anything and still couldn't hear a thing. Then I tried listening to my own heartbeat. It was barely louder/clearer then when I lay my ear on my husbands chest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tool.","review":"This product specifically says in the directions that you may not always be able to hear the heartbeat (depending on the baby's position). My husband and I appreciated this product because we were able to speak to the baby through the speakers and play music. If you have that desire than this is a great product to buy! As far as what you hear...you'll hear his movements, and may occasionally hear his heart beating, but don't buy it just for that, you will be disappointed if you plan to listen to the beating consistantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars, if possible.","review":"I also purchased the Bebe Prenatal listener from another store. I just returned it today. I tried it everynight as detailed in the users manual and only heard faint wooshing and my digestive noise. Never heard anything as described in the manual...kicks, hiccups or the heartbeat. My husband was always worried that I could not hear the heartbeat and I had to calm him saying \\"the manual says it may take awhile to hear it or that we would not hear the heart beat everyday\\".... Well that got old, my baby moves all the time and at some point, the heart should have been in a favorable position for me to hear it. The manual stresses to read the directions closely and don't get discouraged...2 months of trying at 6 + months was enough. It only took one month to get pregnant, and that should be the effort, not trying to hear on this device. I'm buying a stethoscope tomorrow from a medical supply store as I've already missed out on 2 months of hearing the heartbeat at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste...","review":"As many others have stated, this product is NOT worth a penny. It's a waste of plastic unless you're interested in hearing the quietest sounds around you rather than baby.I've heard people say that it might depend on the weight of mom, but I can tell you, that is not true at all. I'm a thin woman, and not once did I hear baby's heartbeat, and I tried EVERY DAY, until my last month when I finally gave up. Baby was moving so much that I didn't need to hear the heartbeat to know everything was ok.Save your money on something more useful. And if you're that concerned about hearing baby's heartbeat, try renting a doppler from a hospital or typing something like \\"rent fetal heart doppler\\" in a google search and rent one online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of money","review":"I purchased this in hopes of hearing my little one. I am well into my third trimester and so far all I can hear on it is the noises from every part of the house.

I hope no one else wastes their money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly useless","review":"Mostly useless says it all.Spend the money on something eles.If the lovely sounds of amniotic woosh woosh wooshing, or your own gasses burbling is your thing, buy this item.

I was so excited after hearing my baby's heartbeat at the doctor's office that I ran right out and bought this product when I was just 3 months pregnant. When I got it home and read the directions I learned that it wouldn't work until I was at least 5 months pregnant. I started using it at five months and still to this day 32 weeks into my pregnancy have never heard my baby's hearbeat using this product. All my husband and I have ever heard is loud clicking noises when pushing the button and static every time the cord moves slightly. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We bought this product when I was 28 weeks pregnant. My husband is convinced he has heard the heartbeat, but I'm not sure. We definitely hear lots of other noises, but whether it's my digestive system or the baby, I don't know. I am now almost 34 weeks pregnant and we'll try again to hear it this week, but I am not very confident. We bought just the monitor, not the gift set.

I would actually give this product LESS than one star if I could. I was so eager to buy this product, but my 9-month pregnant girlfriend insisted I shouldn't waste my money, and instead gave me hers a few days before she delivered. It never worked for her, and now, at 7 months along, it still hasn't worked for me. All I can hear is gurgling-type noises, which sound EXACTLY the same as when I hold the device up to my HUSBAND'S stomach! I have lots of pregnant girlfriends, and I have yet to find a single person who has used this product with any amount of success. If you really want to clearly hear and acurately measure your baby's heartbeat at home, consider renting a doppler device instead, (see babybeat.com or storkradio.com). These devices are of doctor's-office-quality, and you can rent them for around $30 a month. Otherwise, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THE BEBE SOUNDS!!!! THIS PRODUCT IS A JOKE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst baby product ever","review":"We have purchased this item when I was 5 months pregnant and even though my baby has a really strong heart beat, i was never able to detect the heart beat with this prenatal listener...

I hear the movement of the monitor's cord, the creaking of the joint in my finger, and the slight movement of the monitor over my stomach as I inhale and exhale, but I don't hear the heartbeat. It is very frustrating to try to use this product. It says to be patient, and I am a very patient person, but I know when something isn't going to work -- and this won't work, no matter how many times I try.

There are many other things I would recommend giving as a gift, like pregnancy pillows for sleeping, but not this. If you ask me, it's just another wasteful product geared for eager first time parents. Wanna hear the heartbeat? Your doctor can do that for you at each visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money and your hopes","review":"Luckily, I did not buy this product.

So far we have heard nothing except static and the gurgles of my stomach. The button, which you have to hold down constantly, is a major pain. If there is any noise what so ever in the room, the listener amplifies it into your headphones. I am a nurse and I'm accustomed to finding fetal heartones with a doppler and I can not get this thing to pick anything up. I even placed it over my own heart and barely could hear that! I would not recommend this product for purchase with the intent of listening to your baby. The only thing that I have found useful are the speakers that come with the set. They can be plugged into a cd player and you can play music for your baby. This is the only useful thing about this product. If you ask me, it's too {costly}e for a pair of tiny speakers. Maybe at 40 weeks I'll pick something up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It -- My Guesses at others problems w/ device :)","review":"...

The only baby sounds we heard was the \\"swooshing\\" sound from blood moving through the placenta. My wife and I once thought we could hear a heart beat but were disappointed to find it was her own pulse from an artery near her waistline. This product says you should be able to hear the heartbeat and other baby sounds (i.e. hiccups, gurgles, and kicks) during the 2nd trimester (5th month). I do not recommend this product to anyone.

They said they would give me a refund, but never sent it and said they didn't receive the monitor which I had shipped back to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine if you know how to work it","review":"My husband and I bought this product because we were excited to hear the baby. I read the manual cover to cover and bought a brand new battery like it suggests. You just have to have patience with it. It picks up every movement of your hand on the listening part and if it touches anything like blankets or clothes then it interferes. If you're patient with it then it really works. It does take a while to find the baby's heartbeat and when you find it it is really soft so you have to listen hard. I don't think people are giving it enough time. I find the sound of my baby to be the most relaxing sound. I am in my 32nd week and insomnia keeps me up and wakes me up in the middle of the night. The sound of the baby puts me right to sleep. Also, we've found that our baby reacts to it. Our baby starts kicking where we have the bebesounds thing and it's a good way to interact with the baby. It's only $20, I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea Terrible Product","review":"Waste of money and being first time parents we buy everything regardless of price.

I'm sorry my friend wasted their money. I have tried listening for something other than my own heartbeat, stomach growling and noises in the house since I was in my first trimester. I now have 4 weeks to go and have yet to hear anything related to the baby. Do not waste your money buying this product for yourself or anyone else. I think the nurse at my doctor's office summed it up best...it has no way to transfer sound. Think about it. They use gel on your belly and have direct contact with the listening device in the doctor's office. This item has a funnel with a sponge on the end. It's just not designed to transfer sound effectively. Spend your money elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"My husband and I tried patiently to hear SOMETHING with this thing. We finally gave up when, at 27 weeks, we both SAW the baby kick the very spot where we had the listener placed. The manual says that kicks sound like a \\"thud.\\" We heard nothing but the same old \\"whooshing.\\" I was shocked since this thing picks up every sound outside and around the belly loud and clear. Anyone who hears heart beat or hiccups with this listener must have a much softer internal \\"whooshing\\" going on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to be on a weird angle to hear","review":"I tried from 4.5 months through my 6 month of pregnancy to hear my child's heartbeat.

OF COURSE THE ONLY THING WE HEARD WAS ROAD NOISE, BUT WHEN WE GOT HOME WE STILL DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING (EXCEPT STOMACH GROWLINGS & OUR OWN HEARTBEAT). THE BABY DID MOVE AROUND ALOT MORE WHEN WE LISTENED FOR HER. THE ONLY THING THAT I LIKE ABOUT THE SOUNDS MONITOR IS THAT WHEN WE USE THE DEVICE TO SPEAK TO THE BABY, SHE MOVES AROUND ALOT RIGHT NEAR THE SPEAKERS. WE READ TO HER EVERY NIGHT WITH IT & SHE SEEMS TO ENJOY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful product!","review":"I also own the basic model with one set of headphones and it is a waste of money. My husband wanted to get one from the day we found out I was pregnant, but we waited until I was 6 months. You can't hear anything going on with the baby.

A word to the wise, do not waste your money on this cheap item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I tried this several times throughout my pregnancy. Each time I really could not hear anything. Mostly what I hard was the moving of the device over my belly. I had to sit really still in order not to hear the device moving. I even tried it when my baby had the hiccups, I couldn't even hear that. I also had to be in a very quiet room with no one talking and the tv off. Once I heard a swooshing sound, but other than that- nothing. Don't waste your money on this one.

It was a waste of money for me. I NEVER heard my baby's heart beat, all I do is rely on my doctors visits. I see her kicking all the time, but I never hear her kicking. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody.The only good thing would be the microphone that is included so that you can talk to your baby, but you can pick that up a lot cheaper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!","review":"This item was the biggest waste of moeny!!

You cannot hear the fetal's heartbeat but everything else. You can't hear your own hearteat when you put it against your chest. I was going to keep it for the Microphone but by 6 months my baby can hear everything outside the womb. I can just play the music from the CD player and the baby can hear it.

I am now 38 weeks and decided to give it another try today. I heard a very faint heartbeat. I thought I could FINALLY record something via computer as suggested by the product to send a file to baby's grandparents in California. Even worse than hearing the static through the headphones is hearing the TREMENDOUS static and background noise after replaying the .wav on the computer. It even overshadowed the heartbeat which was inaudible on the playback. I am so extremely disappointed that I am considering writing a letter to Bebe Sounds about this bogus product.

I even heard my husband snoring thru closed doors in the headset when I was trying to get it to work one night. Besides all my other internal noises, I can say I could hear the kicks when my baby moved, but that's not enough to persuade me to keep the monitor. It's going back to the store tomorrow. If you want to spy on someone's conversation down the street, this product is for you... Otherwise, you probably won't have much luck hearing your baby's heartbeat over all the other noise.

(I've been listening for it from 18 wks on). I read the directions from cover to cover and even used it when his back was against my stomach (the best place they said to listen), but heard nothing. As for his kicks and hiccups, they are fairly easy to listen to as long as you lay still. The only part worth buying in the package is the microphone to play music to and read to him because he responds, but I'm sure regular headphones over your tummy work just as good.

We kept trying right on through to the end. Now, at 39 weeks and knowing precisely where the baby is resting, we are still unable to hear the baby's heartbeat with this device. My sister-in-law also bought the system and had similar difficulties. The only redeeming feature of this pack is the microphone with which you may read and speak to your baby, as well as play music, but this is something that can easily be achieved with a regular walkman or other such device, which most people already have.

This monitor is an absolute disappointment, don't waist your money or time on it....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luck be a pregnant mom","review":"After speaking with my doctor about this item, she laughed and told me \\"If you and your husband want to speak to the baby, just open your mouth. Never underestimate the power of nature.\\" I still wanted to try this \\"wonder toy\\" for myself. I ventured over to my best friends house (also pregnant) and put this triangle object on my stomach. After blowing out an eardrum from the clicking sound and cord movment, I decided my doctor was right. The baby and I still have plenty of time in the near future to talk, listen and bond together. Until then.......I saved myself some money. Hope you do too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonding","review":"I liked this item, because it gives you and your husband or partner the chance to bond with you baby. My husband gets so involved now with the microphone and the headphones. It is so nice to see that. You have to listen really really hard to hear your baby's heartbeat, but that is not the only feature of this item. I have been able to hear our baby moving around a lot and it is really great. I recommend this item!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk!","review":"I bought this because I wanted to be able to hear my baby in between pre natal visits. Well even after following the directions EXACTLY I could never hear anything but my own stomach. Also the classical CD that comes with this set is junk! It skips and sometimes won't play at all. It's not worth the money or the time you have to put into this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for something that works!","review":"The heart monitor doesn't work at all. All you get is outside noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piss Poor Product!","review":"Even after reading the bad reviews, I decided to give this product the benefit of the doubt. I was completely disappointed!!! Especially since I was so excited at the thought of being to hear my babies heart beat on a regular basis as oppose to having to wait until the monthly doctor's visits. I agree, save yourself the cash!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"heard everything EXCEPT baby","review":"I borrowed this product from a friend who told me it didn't work. I was slim and 22 weeks pregnant, so I thought I should be able to hear something. Turns out the microphone is so sensitive, all other noises beat out any noise from baby! I heard my finger joints move, the air conditioner turn on, and since you have to hold the button down the entire time, any hand movement is detected and hurts your ears! Perhaps if I waited until 30+ weeks, I might have had better luck, but as an anxious Mommy, this product didn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Just to reiterate, this product is junk. we live in a quiet area so no car sounds, and we turn off the television. I am 28 weeks and nothing. I thought maybe I heard a faint sound, but it's nothing like my doctor's doplar sono that she uses to listen to the heartbeat and is pretty much worthless. The only thing I can hear is the sound of my own body. I strongly advise against purchasing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I bought this device when I was approximately 3 months along. I had no idea that it would not be of any use until around 4 or 5 months. This in itself lead to some disappointment when I brought it home. I have since (now 6 months pregnant) tried it 10 or so times all with no luck. I have not heard a single thing even coming close to a heartbeat and my child is very very active so I know it is there!! I would not recommend this product to anyone especially if you get let down very easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I was so excited about this product and everything it promised that I bought it as soon as I could. Of course no where on the outside of the box does it tell you that you should be at least 5 months pregnant to hear the heartbeat (they do mention it in the instruction booklet once you've opened everything). So I had to wait about 4 weeks. I am now 8 months pregnant and have yet to hear the heartbeat no matter where I position the monitor or how still I lie. I can only pick up stomach noises and my own heartbeat. It's very disappointing. As for the music aspect- the baby doesn't require the microphone to hear so I'm returning this product and using my regular stereo to play music to him- [money] is too much for something I can do for free and the money can better be spent on something that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bummer","review":"At first I thought it was neat what I was hearing. The gurgling sounds and kicks, until I put it on my husband and heard the same thing. I'm almost positive he does not have a baby in his belly. Very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too expensive","review":"I bought this product and it is sitting on my dining room table. First of all when you read the booklet it tells you that you should be 5 months pregnant or more. I am 4 months pregnant and I cannot hear a thing and I don't think that I will ever hear anything. My advice is wait for your prenatal appointments. This product is way too expensive and it is a waste of good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars (if that was an option)","review":"This product does not work. I was glad that I wasn't the only one not hearing my baby's heartbeat. Pretty much everybody that I have spoken to who has encountered this piece of junk agrees that it doesn't work. Those that have heard the heartbeat are lucky. Bebe Sounds should be ashamed for marketing something that does not live up to its expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"QUITE DISAPPOINTED!!","review":"I bought this product at 5 months of pregnancy expecting to hear my baby's heartbeat. I am now in my 7th month and still cannot hear anything except the thump of when my baby pushes on the monitor (which is kind of cute). I am quite disappointed cuz I read all the directions and followed them to the T and I try listening every few days in an absolutely quiet room and nothing is heard by myself or my husband. I can hear my heartbeat when I test it - but not the baby's.Its disappointing cuz I looked forward to hearing his heartbeat in between my prenatal visits - but now I go every 2 weeks, so at least its not a long wait anymore! Wish I could return the product!! I don't recommend this to anyone to purchase - first try it in the stores (if you can) to see if you get anything out of it. Wish I had the luck the other good reviewers had!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get Too Excited","review":"I had purchased this monitor for my husband who insisted on having one. I was so excited to give it to him but the excitement didnt last long. Maybe if you are experienced and know what your listening to it could be enjoyable. But all you hear are your own stomach noises. I was tempted to bring it to one of my doctors appointments so he could shed some light onto what I was listening to but I was too embarrassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst MOVIE I've ever seen","review":"This is definately the worst movie ever. I can't believe I watched the whole thing. It keeps getting worse and worse as it goes on. The plot goes from OK at the beginning, to down right horrible at the end. The soundtrack has got to be one of the worst ever also. Don't waste your time on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"An old plot","review":"While it's true that it goes downhill after the beginning. The movie goes away from the basketball player Jackie Stewart and focuses more on the coach. The coach is so desperate to protect Jakcie that his own family sufferes with his wife getting raped and his son holding the bloody remains of the family dog.I would probably say that this movie sounds more like something that would be a Law & Order plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time, film, and Drago","review":"This thing was just dreck. Mindless. The only thing worse than the plot and most of the acting was Billy Drago's haircut. Billy, I love you, but, put down the Flowbee.The only good parts were the scenes between Drago and Richard Lynch--two old pros who know their way around thin plots and amateurish film making. If you're a fan of either man...well, I'm sorry, there's not much to recommend here. They do what they can with what they have. Otherwise, stay far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Educational DVD with limited educational value","review":"Sound and picture quality has that quaint homespun quality. Offers dozens of questions but does not begin to answer most of them. Captions contain at least three spelling mistakes. Drifts off on strange tangents e.g. modern flags of southern states. Leaves crucial areas untouched - e.g. failure of Confederate foreign policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description is wrong or packaging is wrong..which is it??","review":"I purchased this item for my Toyota Tundra only to discover that when it arrived there is only ONE set in box for the front. The carton says TWO. So, I thought thatperhaps the carton came open in transit and one was lost. I contacted Amazon C/s, who was great, they sent another carton. It arrived today and again, there is onlyONE set even though the carton says TWO. My conclusion is that the description is incorrect and the carton,although marked two means that 2=1 set for the front only. I have returned both cartons as the price is way too high for a single set. Beware if you order this, as it is not what it seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a bigoted person could find this book he;pful","review":"I have read this book and bucailles book, i am neither muslim nor christian as such but have to say that Bucailless book is considerably more convincing.

I highly recommend it.Just one comment to those who claimed that Naik defeated Campbell. It is true that Campbell did a vey poor job, but that is because his skill is in writing not debating. Far from refuting Campbell, Naik managed to tap dance his way around many of the arguments and give the misleading impression that he actually addressed the issues..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, responds to Bucaille's thoroughly.","review":"..Answers the wildly arrogant claims to \\"objectivity\\" made by Bucaille in his now DATED \\"authorative\\" book that \\"proves\\" Islam correct. the number of contradictions of physics, common sense and reason that abound in the Koran are answered in all manner of pages on the net. But that a christian author had the stuffing to take on one of the primary \\"evangelical\\" books used by muslims is commendable. Too bad he doesn't turn the same baloney detector on the christian claims..does a good job of shoring up the claims for pre-christian Biblical faith, though.."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you believe Dr Campell, then read this","review":"Anyone who believes this book should buy the video debate between Dr Campell & DR Niak, which shows all the errors in the book. You can find it at islamicbookstore.com. search for Dr Campell & youll find the video of the debate they held in Chicago. See for yourself how poorly his book stands up to true facts & agreed upon translations. Its sad that people are motivated by hate to write such books."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak attempt to discredit Bucaille","review":"the book is a sorry attempt to disprove Maurice Bucaille's book the Bible, the Quran, & Science. other people that agree with Dr Campell ( who claim to have read Bucaille's book) seem to overlook a great detail about Bucaille. He was not a muslim when he set out to write his book. he specifically learned arabic to study the Quran. The facts given in his book are thorough & percise. Dr campell's attempt to disprove him is cleary just an angry response which has blinded him for being truly objective. His examples are weak & sorry. I urge people to read Bucaille's book & see for themselves. Anyone who supports Dr Campell & thinks Muslims are trying to attack the christian faith are mistaken. People should not forget that muslims beleive in Jesus & his miracles. If your looking to buy a book that compares the Quran & the Bible ,i suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorance","review":"I believe that Bucaille's book was a revolution in dealing with the holy books.it was very logic,giving proofs for what he is talking about.But the truth is often sour,so that some people don't listen to it,or just make a lot of noise.Campbell's book was some of this noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falsehood by its very nature will perish sooner or later","review":"This is a below standard book written by somebody whose heart is full of deception and lies. This book does not even deserve 1 star. Poor Dr. Campbell challenged every Muslims in the world to refute his claims in the book. Dr. Zakir Naik took that challenge and in an completely one-sided debate defeated Dr. Campbell soundly. In terms of Basketball scoring it would be 100-0 in favor of Dr. Naik. The people who gave him high ratings (just because it is anti-Islamic) should have the guts to watch that debate. It is available at islamicbookstore.com and follow the video links at the left and go to Debates and speeches of Dr. Zakir Naik. Falsehood by its very nature will perish sooner or later. Amen."},{"rating":"1","title":"hose too short","review":"I guess I assumed that portable AC units would be portable beyond 6 feet from the window. Clearly these products are designed for situations where a window unit cannot be employed because of the window and the weight it can support.The exhaust hose is literally 8 ft long and does not allow you to place the unit between two rooms or move it around the house as needed (because you would need to connect it to a different window) - which is what I thought they were.Buyer beware...if you intended to use it as it is designed, works fine. The unit is a little large, but it does pump out a lot of cool air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Cooler","review":"This unit is easy to use and easy to move around. It provides plenty of cold air. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs a portable air conditioner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recomended","review":"This item is not worth it. It takes hours to cool down my 100 sq ft room. I have a 5,000 btu window unit that kicks butt compared to this one. Also, not convenient at all. You need to place a drip pan underneath to catch the water and it only allows a 1\\" space at the base.

I find it very difficult to follow when each page is scattered with little side projects for the student to try with the cd-rom or with a calculator. Just glancing at any page it is hard to find the heart of the material. I much prefer a text that focuses on straight forward explanations of concepts rather than what seems to me as mere gimmicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid hitter","review":"Baseball fans should find this book most entertaining - great reading during a rain delay. Luciano was an American League umpire, famous for his way of \\"gunning\\" out batters on the base paths and his legendary on-field arguments with Earl Weaver. This book, his second, and much like the first, recounts humorous stories while umpiring from the minor leagues up through the majors.

I love this album its a great collection of all her previous works, and best part is that it all sounds 100 times better than when they first came out.

I feel abused as a fan that I was suckered into buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet","review":"I highly recommend this CD for anyone interested in quality Christian music, especially those individuals who miss the quality sounds of the 1980's. This CD does include her later hits, which showcase her maturity, but some of Amy Grant's best earliest work is also included. These earlier songs show an innocence that is not often heard anymore, but this does not outdate these songs. The Christian messages they include are timeless. In such songs as \\"In a Little While\\" and \\"Old Man's Rubble\\", timeless Christian messages are presented in new and innovative ways. Her later songs, including the masterpiece \\"Sing your Praises to the Lord\\" and \\"Thy Word\\" show her talent increasing with the years.This CD is not only for Amy Grant fans, but for anyone wishing to add quality and variety to their Christian music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired re-release","review":"No life, no spark, nothing new- not even arrangements.

In my library we have a permanent display of these books and they simply fly out of the door in the arms of patrons of all ages. Rebecca Goodale's book is one of the very best.

But I was disappointed with what I read. The first two chapters were great, and truly were introductory and easy to read: the first was a basic introduction to the brain, and the second provided reviewed the history of brain research through the ages. Starting with Chapter 3, however, the book became overally technical and difficult to read. The Chapter on memory was interesting, and overall I did learn things, but as a \\"layman\\", I found myself very confused and overwhelmed as I struggled to make it through what I found to be a very 'Non-Introductory' introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read if you are very curious and very patient.","review":"The topic in certainly not for the casual reader.The first part is clear and full of interesting revelations.The second part is a little too technical for the layman, but rewarding if you stick to it.At the beginning of the book I would have liked a clear description of the parts of a human brain with 3D pictures and 2D sections.Otherwise, a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome value","review":"I have owned my Kingmax 1 GB flash drive for over six months now, and I still love it.

I have experienced no technical issues with it. It does get a little warm during use, but I figured that was normal.

In other cases, we should consider ourselves unfortunate that the loser wasn't the winner.Originally written in the 1940's by the late Irving Stone, the book is woefully in need of an update by a prominent historian who can add Dewey, Stevenson, Goldwater, Humphrey, McGovern, Mondale, Dukakis, Dole and Gore.

I have read a fair number of books written by scholars of the Middle East and can't remember a single one ever citing Mezvinsky's work.There is nothing in Mezvinsky's list of publications that even remotely suggests that he has any expertise on Judaism as a religion.Incidentally, years ago, Moshe Menuhin wrote a book entitled Jewish Critics of Zionism.

Each kit had a different consistency. The end result was a garage with three different shades of tan. Very noticeable. The product takes much longer to dry then the instructions state. It has been curing for a month now and today I moved a tool box with wheels over it and it left marks. Would hate to think what parking my car on it would do. I will have to see how this ends up after a few more months and will report at that time.

This style with their excellent musianship struck a chord in my soul. This album has great guitar work, keyboards, percussion and is generally very well orchestrated. The vocals are poor. It really is upsetting because the first 30 seconds of each song are great and then the singing starts and the song goes to hell. The vocals are frequently sung too high and off key and without any emotion whatsoever. I think this album would have been excellent if the style was of the gutteral growl with some selected clean.

I couldn't name a single track that stuck in my head or that I'd listen to again.I'm not saying the music is terrible because it's not.

If your tastes run to the highly modern and institutional, you may find some inspiration, but if your interested in anything other than cold, white, spartan surroundings for your child, I'd steer clear of this book. Granted, the photography of these sterile rooms is lovely...but I was not interested in how to stylishly photograph unadorned spaces...I was looking for inspiration to create an imaginative, innovative nursery for my son.

And given her level of accepting completely ridiculous things such as \\"tarot\\", etc., it is my guess that the scientific advice she gives is just her take on whatever random studies fit with her theories, and probably does not reflect a good grasp of current research.

For example, taking CoEnzyme Q10, which she highly recommends, may be fine after it is proven to be effective for menopausal women in clinical trials, but where is the backup? Where is the proof?I am sorry I spent the money for this book. It is going in the trash, where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"Do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish. There is factual information here, but it is buried in gushy self-absorption. I bought it for psychotherapy patients who are going through menopause, but I'd be embarrassed to lend it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Amazon experience ever","review":"We were greatly dissapointed with Amazon's customer service. We ordered this book through your web site. Having not received the book we contacted Amazon for support. They referred us to a third party, Z Books. Z Books has the worst customer support that we have experienced in the years that we have dealt on line. This negative experience was enough to convince us to NEVER use Amazon's service again. We have yet to receive our book, which we paid to recieve, and we have yet to receive any communication from Amazon or Z Book. Please do not send me any more communication."},{"rating":"1","title":"????????????????????????????????????","review":"Scary book.I happened to \\"gain insight\\" regarding my \\"self-sacrifice\\" at 23.I did an \\"inwardly focused assessment of my life\\" at age 24. At age 27 I successfully \\"changed my diet\\". At age 35 I discovered how my miserable \\"attitude\\" was affecting how rotten i felt. I divorced at age 36. I'm 42 & I started menopause at age 40. Clearly what happened to Dr. N during menopause is only what SHE experienced during that time. So it took her till menopause to look at herself? So what. For some it happens at age 23 or maybe 33 and for some never. This was HER path that happened to coincide with menopause. PS - Does she really want us to believe that during menopause we are all going to get in touch with our anger & self-sacrifice and divorce our husbands? Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not far enough","review":"The Wisdom of Menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman's body during and after ovarian failure (menopause). This book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause (ovarian failure) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace. I don't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail, instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Spiritism of Christiane Northrup","review":"How very disappointing that Dr. Northrup is all caught up in \\"New Age\\" Spiritualism. She calls it \\"Wisdom\\"; I'd call it Superstition. I had hoped for a good scientific reference work. Instead, it was very hard to read: difficult to get past her absurd analyses of the \\"causes\\" of various health problems. She continually \\"blames the victim\\"--i.e. If a woman has a hormone related health problem, she needs to look within and change her life (Therefore, it must be her fault?!) Spend your money on a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nurse Dorie","review":"The fact that this poorly written jumble of medical fact, witchcraft, and embarrassingly personal autobiography could ever make it to the bestseller list demonstrates the desperate need that exists for a well written but easy to understand book explaining menopause. Tarot cards for stress...drapes over mirrors for insomnia...unspoken words cause hypothyroidism???? The good doctor could use a refresher course in medicine and some good counselling for her unresolved emotional problems. With all the loot this rambling tome brings in, these will be affordable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Northrup missed some very valuable information","review":"I recently purchased and read this book and feel that while it contains some valuable information, many important facts were left out. Dr. Northrup is so high on progesterone that she is unable to communicate the fact that this hormone can also cause some troubling side effects. Think about how you feel during the last half of your cycle when progesterone is dominant....mood swings, weight gain, headaches, anxiety etc.. Now, tell me that you want to feel that way all of the time?? I think not. I recommend a fantastic book titled \\"screaming To Be Heard\\" (sorry, unable to underline) by Elizabeth Lee Vliet. Dr. Vliet gives you BOTH sides of the progesterone story.... please educate yourself before making such important life choices!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a useful resource","review":"I bought this book after seeing Dr. Northrup on [a television] show. I was very disappointed in the book as a whole. I find it difficult to lend credence to someone who relies on tarot cards to answer difficult life questions. I also do not adhere to the concept that hormone imbalances, hypothroidism, etc. are all due to unresolved issues in one's life (specifically involving family, and partner). The idea that thyroid dysfunction develops as, \\"the result of a lifetime of 'swallowing' words\\" a woman \\"is aching to say,\\" is laughable at best. I believe many could potentially find this book more harmful than helpful. I'm sure there are wonderful resources available for today's active, educated women....this unfortunately is NOT the resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Wisdom","review":"The author has a lot of problems that have nothing to do with menapause. Her personal issues and lack of grounding will only add confusion to the average woman who is looking for direction. The author who is obviously unhappy with life wants to seek a complete new and questionable value system. I think most women will only be cast adrift using the book for \\"wisdom\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-body approach to menopause","review":"Menopause doesn't have to be a dreaded curse of aging during which we can look forward only to hot flashes and whacked-out hormonal mood swings. According to Christiane Northrup, M.D., menopause often marks the beginning of a woman's most sexually passionate, creatively inspired, and professionally productive phase of life. While this may sound like wishful thinking, Northrup backs up her good news with solid medical expertise. As an obstetrician and gynecologist, Northrup has specialized in using a mind-body approach to women's health for decades, which means she doesn't just write about hormones, but also examines how a woman's lifestyle, emotions, and beliefs are affected by menopause. I also highly recommend \\"Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Wisdom\\" by Taro Gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"How far back do you guys go?","review":"Fellows- I purchased this hardcover book over 10 years ago from Amazon. My wife read it, not me, and I have no idea what it was about.

As a peri- menopausal woman I was hoping for a bit more scientific approach to this middle age malady. However, the reader gets a dose of new age tripe. Furthermore, you can tell the author is from the ME generation..Her favorite subject, as she rambles on about her crumbling relationship with her husband. Who cares???We want sound medical advice, not voo-doo!! Maybe she should uncover that mirror and look at herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I was very disappointed when I read this book. I had seen the author on [a show] one day when I was home suffering with the flu. The show made me want to read this book because I thought it would answer many of my questions about perimenopause. Instead I found the book to be depressing and full of the author's own issues...issues that frankly have less to do with mid-life hormonal changes than her personal marital crisis. We all have our issues, but I was looking for fact based information, not self-justification. Yes, there was some information in the book I found interesting, but not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Credability, QUICKLY!!","review":"I admit, I haven't finished this book. A friend recommended it to me as I have been having problems with insomnia. I was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing UNTIL she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels. Granted, I am not a firm believer in just \\"the hard facts\\" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by an MD?","review":"The book starts out with her poor marriage to a \\"cold\\" husband and \\"cold\\" mother which I thought was a little strange for a book written by a doctor. Then she starts talking about fibroids being caused by stress, which made me wonder so I started skipping through the book and quit reading after her claim that thyroid problems are caused by \\"swallowing one's words\\", i.e. anger. Then I wondered where was she a doctor- some small town in Maine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The self deception of this book","review":"I purchased this book because the reviews I had read made it sound as if it were full of sage advice from a medical professional. I was sadly mistaken. Ms. Northrup has used the stage of menopause to cover her needs to assert her self as a valuble human being. It was disapointing to me to hear someone who should command respect expound the use of things like Tarot cards ro decide her future. The most bizarre part of this book was her comparison of her fibroid tumor to an embryo... But instead of getting the appropriate help she 'nursed' her tumor and used it as a way to explain her need to release her inner self... She consistantly makes blanket statements concerning medication and herbs... Please don't use this book as an excuse to become self centered and please don't believe all you read!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wisdom of Menopause","review":"I would have given this a 5, based on the medical information. I was disappointed that there was no indication on the book jacket, or anywhere else for that matter, that Dr. Northrup chooses to use tarot cards and other such media to determine paths for her life's journey. I think that would be a significant topic to address in a review of such a book, especially by a medical professional. THe medical information is quite good, and I will use it for such. However, I will not recommend this book to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"an odd mix","review":"An odd mix of medical information and pop psychology. For example, here's an excerpt from p.119: \\"In many women thyroid disfunction develops because of an energy blockage in the throat region, the result of a lifetime of 'swallowing' words she is aching to say.\\" This kind of writing may be just your cup of tea, but I found it hard to swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Book at the Right Time","review":"Dealing with perimenopausal issues, I thought I'd take a gander at Dr. Northrup's self-help book. Boy, am I ever relieved. I thought I was going nuts. I appreciate the way she has laid out all the symptoms/complaints/feelings/issues women are dealing with during this time in their life. Finally someone to tell me my feelings are legitimate and the reason for them and not just suggest I try HRT. Thank you, Dr. Northrup!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Liked This Book. . . .","review":"When You Think You're Falling Apart, by Dr. Kathleen Wilson was loaded with current information I could use about myself. I think it will be as important as The Wisdom of Menopause in teaching women how their bodies work, how to keep themselves healthy, how to reduce stress, and how to manage in the medical system."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Horoscope Please","review":"The author's pervasive interest in occult practices such as astrology and tarot card strained her credibility to the point that I returned this book. Inclusion of religious beliefs whether they are conventional or new age are incompatible with the standards of objectivity one would expect in publications involving personal medical matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best-written catalog of Patterns","review":"I have two volumes and I am looking forward to future volumes!The explanations here are more clear than those in Go4 or other pattern catalogs I've read.

This is one of very few books that have not disappointed me as a text in a course.I have not looked at the source code that comes with the book.

Given that many of the reviews are so poor, I may not read it. But, can one of the disgruntled readers suggest another alternative that addresses pattern designs specific to Java?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sketchy treatments at best","review":"The patterns in here are brief, which should not be a problem. But the examples do not do the patterns justice. The first pattern I picked out used a \\"foo\\" and \\"bar\\" example -- why even bother providing an example if you cannot make it concrete? I had to read many of the patterns several times before understanding them. Overall, I found this book more difficult than the original Design Patterns. This stuff is really not that hard, and Patterns in Java doesn't do much to clarify things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing.","review":"The code examples are sketchy and incomplete, and often utilize techniques that may be good practice but that obfuscate the concept the reader is trying to learn.For example his coverage of the Delegation pattern (which I have yet to see documented in any other book, I'm still looking :) is verbosely explained but the accompanying example code is so vague and has so many ...'s as to be almost unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for learning","review":"If you are a hands on Java programmer and want the design patterns explained as you can understand them in code, this book is worth it. I notice other reviewers slate this book, picking up on what they consider to be \\"errors\\". Well, ultimately GOF4 is always going to be the authority on patterns but GOF4 is very dry - this book gives a practical java code explanation of the patterns. I often browse through it looking for ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"No substitute for GoF","review":"Because I'm a Java programmer and think UML is cool, I chose this book over GoF, and I was disappointed.

Unfortunately, after reading the book I came to realize that the author has only a superficial understand of design patterns, what's even worse is some of his explanations were completely off the mark!

The veteran will be surprised by the author's inaccurate treatment of the examples he borrows from Go4 (\\"Design Patterns\\" / Gamma et al), and will be annoyed by the book's numerous \\"forward-dependencies\\" on Volume 2 (still unpublished!). This book fails to live up to its potential as a new catalog of design patterns, because of the author's lack of mastery both of the essence of those patterns and of their clear presentation.

The author doesn't truly understand the subject matter at all with numerous bad implementations of the GoF patterns.

However, it turns out to be a nightmare to most. The material in the book was so poorly explained that I got lost reading it even after a few times. Sometimes, the author tried to illustrate the implementation of the Pattern by presenting a Java Code fragment. the code was so incomplete that I had no idea what is going on. Furthermore, in the chapter about Snapshot Pattern. The author first describes the pattern by mentioning a typical computer game example which is an interesting introduction.

As long as birds are flying, and not sitting or walking on the ground, I see nothing wrong with hunting.

Certainly not when he is so well placed in the publishing industry. If only all interested laypersons had the connections needed to get their theorizing into print.And a layperson he is. There is nothing in point of research or development of ideas that is not thoroughly amateurish. The writing quality is such as one would expect from an indifferent English major, tolerable for ten or twenty pages and no more.

I suppose I deserve what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"The B.S. of Silver Spoonery","review":"Bellow's book is a fascinating read; partially because the subject is infuriatingly destructive to any business and partially because Bellow managed to trade on his father's name to get it published.

Each candid chapter is a pleasure.Galbraith, as always, is consistently sagacious. Like his friend George W.

The book also revealed a great deal of information about the Jewish ghetto in Riga, Latvia that could almost be a book in itself.However, halfway through the book I became very disappointed. The plot degenerated into a cheap thriller. Such a cleverly researched book should never have been coupled with such a poorly written plot.The horrors of The Riga Ghetto recently made news because of an investigation by The Latvian Holocaust Commission.

Why?, cause he had taken a dose of cyanid while in British captivity in May 1945.Then there's the ODESSA, what Forsyth says is that it was a worldwide organization founded with millions of dollars in true it was a legend.

The book move along with very little padding. The characters are interesting. The interrogation of Miller by the Odessa Chief could have been improved. The questions asked by the interrogator to see if Miller was really a former SS soldier (instead of someone else) appeared to correlate very highly with the training he received.

Likewise I'm not a big fan of stories involving thievery an occupation. Perhaps if Blu had been several years into her new career and developed some humanity I could be interested in her. But, her lack of emotional development, actual age, and inexperience in human relations made her sexual encounters uninteresting and virginal.I do think Hauf's writing is technically quite good.

Therefore, for those of us who have \\"poem-phobia,\\" I recommend this delightful little work.In this work, Eliot ask the question of what is poetry and the use of criticism in poetry as well as the relationship between the former and the latter.Eliot proposes to start the enquiry by reviewing the history of criticism starting from Elizabethan era untill that of his time. Through the course of the exploration, I was enthralled by Eliot's insightful opinion of critics and their opinion as to what is poetry and its uses.I was particularly drawn to the final chapter of his work which does not offer any final word to the questions which he posed but rather giving us advice as to how to read poems (in particular the modern poets, i.e., 20th century). I was very glad to have read this work because it sure beats reading a heavy college text on how to read poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Thought provoking material; primarily Bible-based and unbiased.

Alice Thrift has so little personality of any kind, it's difficult to think of her at all, either with affection or ill-will.However, this book is being marketed as a comic novel, and I don't believe I found any of it amusing in any way at all. The only emotion I recall registering was mild melancholy (because Alice Thrift seems to represent a banal mean seen in too many people these days who mistake a job for a life). Perhaps I prefer a bit more aggression in my comic novelists (Patrick Dennis, Dawn Powell, Jonathan Coe, P.G. Wodehouse), but I don't think this is comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe some people didn't love the heck out of this one!","review":"This was my first Lipman novel and I loved it. As a physician fairly recently finished with residency, I couldn't get enough of Alice's trials within the medical field. And there was not an inaccuracy in the whole thing, which is unusual when non-MD authors try to write about MDs. And the portrayal of Ray was perfect. I listened to the audio version, which was great since it was read by Lipman herself -- the tone was perfect. A really enjoyable story. Spent a lot of time in my car just to hear more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even foolish passions . . .","review":"A great story about how a simple, even foolish, passion can change a shy, unsociable person for the better. The story comes to life, is always entertaining, never flags and feels real. But it could have gone so much further if the hidden depths to the characters suggested initially, and carried through, were kept going at the end. Opposites don't just attract - they make each other complete, and solve each others quandries. I felt there was too much here to just accept the unsatisfying ending. Elinor: toss out the last few pages and write another 200 pages please. Isn't everyone a little bit of a con man? And isn't it the case that a con man is only persuasive if there's something real there as well? Plenty of interesting characters whose further adventures we need to hear about. Still, I found it a rewarding read with vivid details that have lingered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"When I first started reading this book, I didn't think I was going to like it, but the more I read, the more hooked I became. Elinor Lipman is a marvelous writer--skillful, clever, and witty. Moreover, she writes with sophistication and honesty. Her characters, no matter how odd, always seem real. They are three-dimensional, complex, and interesting. Alice is one of her best characters yet. Even when you wanted to shake her, you understood exactly why she was acting the way she was acting. I won't synopsize the story; others have already done that. What I will say is this -- buy this book. You won't be sorry. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming value","review":"Dull, dry, depressing, and devoid of any point. Alice is socially akward, lonely, and inept in group settings.

Laugh a minute this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary little book","review":"What a small, dreary book! The author gives away the ending in the first few pages, so there is zero suspense. The main character is a charmless victim who doesn't drive the action - just lets events unfold. And too many of the others are stereotypes. If there were any plot I could forgive the dull characters, or if there were exciting characters the dull plot, but the combination was uninspiring. Too bad, because Lipman can write, but her readers deserve better."},{"rating":"1","title":"hasn't figured out her genre","review":"I can't quite figure out what's wrong with Elinor Lipman's novels. Nothing has touched The Inn at Lake Devine. She's clearly an intellectual, as evidenced by her language, but her characters all sound the same. They're fairly intellectual too, with lots of clever wordlplay. But the plots are predictable and the characters all sound entirely the same. Lipman falls just short of being a truly comedic writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay","review":"I agree that inn at Lake Divine was by far Lipman's best book. The rest have been entertainments that sort of slog on with uninspired dialogue and what I think are improbable scenes that have no ring of truth in them. I did like this story a lot, but using an emotionally frozen character as the point view makes things feel stilted and it's hard to feel any empathy for Alice. I didn't really believe the ending (which I won't give away) but I could see where it was going. All in all, this is an easy, enjoyable read. Better than some of the other crap out there, but not as smart or original as Lipman's finest work."},{"rating":"1","title":"roller coaster book from interesting to absolute boredum","review":"As a cavalry history buff I was very interested to read this book. It took all I could do to finish this book. If you are interested in the daily orders that range from oders for deserters, forage, arrest, sickness, or as the author states daily life then you will love this. For me it was a struggle.

He stands up and shakes it back and forth, and has many times either fallen forward or backward because the gate didn't stay put. I can only put it up for a few moments, because I don't feel like he is safe. The other thing I don't like about it is that it takes longer than I'd like to get it positioned correctly. The wood isn't entirely straight, and my door frame doesn't seem to be either, so it takes some wiggling to find a place where both the top and bottom are securely in place.

It works well, stays up nice and sturdy, small enough to step over easily, but tall enough to stymie our year old girl. But it always took (notice the use of past tense) me a couple of minutes to get the damn thing to lock every time. I put it in the right slot, and it always slipped out into another one. Then the metal brackets slip out when I'm trying to lock the locking mechanism in place.Fortunately, my lovely wife snapped the locking bar in two less than a week after we got it. We went to Target and got a The First Years Safety Latch Gate (First Years Item #: Y7187A). It took about 11 seconds to install and lock it in place. Just pull a plastic lever down and pop it in a notch. Even my wife can do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use, easy to climb","review":"I found this gate very difficult to use, no matter how many times I did it. I don't like that the notches are set so far apart. When I tried to use it in one doorway, one notch made the gate too big and the next made it too small. When it does actually fit in the doorway, it does seem to fit snugly. However, my son (who had just mastered climbing) made over the top in under 5 minutes. I don't use this gate anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpensive but hard to use","review":"We bought this gate to put in a standard doorway between our kitchen and home office. I liked the inexpensive cost compared to other gates and it seemed like it would be easy to use. Either we received a defective gate or the design itself is flawed. Our doorway size was such that the gate's metal locking hinge landed between two of the pre-cut grooves in the gate. Despite many efforts (including those of my engineer husband) we could not get the gate to lock at a length tight enough for the gate to stay in place. We will be returning this gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gate pushes right over and won't stay locked","review":"This gate won't stay locked or secure. On the appropriate setting for my opening, I can push it right over pretty easily. (It's at the top of the stairs too, so this is very dangerous). If I tighten it one more notch, as soon as I push the bar down, it pops right back up. I'm sorry I bought this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful","review":"No matter what we do, we cannot get this item to stay firm against the wall.

The low cost is a disguise for its ineptness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"crappy?\\"","review":"I'm very disappointed by this gate. I purchased it to enclose my dog in the kitchen. My current gate (Four Paws brand) is only 32\\" high and my dog jumps over it. So I decided to purchase this one to place on top, thus creating a 5-foot barrier.This gate feels flimsy and doesn't fit properly, even on the same exact width setting as the Four Paws gate.I have a feeling this gate is going to break after a few uses. The price is cheap and so is the quality. I should've bought another one by Four Paws for a few dollars more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it's job","review":"This gate is basic, pretty much what I expected.

The gate was exactly the wrong size for my hallway. I did get it into place and locked, but I could tap it over with a slight shove. It would have been no match for my baby. I could not exert enough force to get the gate into the next locking position--perhaps if I had walls made of rubber. This gate can serve as a decorative barrier for a family with a minimalist aesthetic sense, but if you are like me and are trying to find a gate in order to protect the safety of your child, look elsewhere. I am going to take the gate back to Wal-Mart in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and works","review":"Got two of these to keep 5lb puppy within the family room, kitchen area since he is not yet house broken.

So I scrapped it and ordered a First Years Hands Free metal gate with a foot pedal - which also requires no drilling into the wall and is available on Amazon. This gate is strong and fantastic!

The wood is more flimsy. Can't lock the width in place. Bought one of these recently and tried to tighten it snugly in a doorway, and the wooden lever snapped in two. I had to throw it away the same day I received it. Cheap plastic grate. If you have base boards, this won't fit because the width between the base boards is different than the width between the walls higher up. Also, everytime you take the gate down, you lose the place of the width you had selected. If you don't want to go to the hassle of taking the gate down, you have to climb over it, and that becomes a pain. Would recommend one of the more expensive metal gates that can open without having to remove the gate. You get what you pay for. Nuff said. Don't expect this gate to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This gate is not very high and the product is not sturdy at all. Not worth $20.

I can't get them to fit snugly in the doorways of my kitchen, maybe because the notches are too far apart and I can't get the needed width. Also, the wooden parts that stick out at the top and bottom make it impossible to secure in an opening that has a baseboard.

Cathay Che's literary voice is a bit too gaga for its subject for my taste. She oversells it a bit in other words, which makes it feel like fan magazine stuff and not really a biography for adults. Still, it's Debbie and Blondie, so even a poorly written book is better than none! Sadly however, the photo sections are very skimpy for a band whose appeal was so visual. What the market really needs now is something along the lines of \\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\\", a coffee table book on Blondie that is mostly images by different photographers.

I have been following some great technolgies over the last 10 years. With Web services, I was overwhelmed with the bundle of various APIs, tools, standards, specifications that emerged. I picked up this book since it looked like the right fit for a hard core Java developer wanting to learn web services and I was right on.I think the book is a great handbook for developers who want to program prototypes. I have reused lots of code from the examples, which showed me exactly how things need to be done.This is one of the only books I have seen that had a complete case study using things like UDDI and JAXR, which was the part that puzzled me the most.I am looking forward to more books by this trio.

I have some advice for this guy: start drinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitve and shallow content","review":"This book is too repetitive and verbose. Pretty much everything is repeated over and over again. When you repeat something over and over again, it becomes painful to read and comprehend. Repetition also increases the number of pages. May be the publishers feel they are providing value to readers by giving them a thick fat repetitive book? When you repeat something repeatedly, you lose the gist of what the person is trying to convey. Repetition makes the discussion verbose. I don't particularly find verbosity and redundancy as positive qualities of a book. The authors also have not scoped the topics to cover well. They are all over the place trying to touch upon in little depth a wide range of topics. That allows them to repeat themselves even more.Or you could have just read the title of my review. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good examples and case study for Java Web services","review":"Web services is very interesting and it is the most talked topic in software development field.

This book has an excellent real-world case study which walksthrough how to develop and deploy complete web services with all Java API components showing all Web services components (SOAP, WSDL and UDDI) working together.

I expect them to show much better expertise on web services, even I admit this may not be the book's intension.1. The book is like an aggregation of tutorials on basic stuff of each topic. There is no technical depth and you are far from building practical web services after looking at their examples.2. The concepts are not well explained. Easy topics are repeated while important topics are ignored. It's hard to learn something you don't already know.3. The book is not well reviewed. There are numerous technical errors and typos.The book does have a good scope, and can be a convenience of browsing the field, as it puts the related topics under one roof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I bought this, hoping to be able to use it on a web services project I'm doing.I find it's completely out of date.

You can keep their environment small and cozy and adjust the position as the baby grows.

She sets a record about the Holocaust. She makes a monument rather than writes a diary.

I was driving a newer Honda Accord, not some crappy beater. We hit another car head-on going 55+ mph. We were thankfully not seriously injured but after examining my car afterward, I noticed that right above where the Mighty Tite held the seatbelt was a small rip in the car's seatbelt. I am not confident that had the accident involved more force than our did such as rolling or hitting something else following initial impact, that the seatbelt would not have completely ripped through, thus throwing my son in his carseat around the interior or out the window.

Great with chips, but even better on eggs in the morning. (We who grew up in the Southwest ate hot sauce with our breakfasts of mother's milk!) My only reservation, and it is really not a reservation, is that the salsa is inconsistent. Differing levels of saltiness should not happen, as it occasionally is too salty, but differing levels of 'heat' are due to the fickle nature of the jalapeno pepper.

Place it on the cooktop and an error flashes indicating a non-inductive pot. More than that, after seeing how chincy the pot is constructed, very thin, lightweight. That was the first clue when we took it out of the box, the lightness which somewhat assured you that this was not a good steel pot. It went back within hours of receipt. Very frustrating to have to travel to a UPS store to return a misrepresented product at our expense for gas to and from the UPS store."},{"rating":"1","title":"John's","review":"customer service does not reply to your e-mail and they give no tracking info or shipping info"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic pot for the money!","review":"Non-reactive stainless steel.

For some reason this version has more songs on it than other CD's of the same name and makes for a great selection of tracks. There is a small essay inside as well which puts the music into greater context. If you're new to Jazz then some of this will take some listening to, but once you get a feel for it every nuance and tone comes shining though. Dizzy is a recognised master of his art and the music on offer here goes some way to showing you why that was. In addition you also hear the musicianship of Milt Jackson (one of the first Jazz performers I ever heard) and Charlie Parker who is also revered in Jazz circles. This is a solid Jazz album and well worth considering.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, But not exactly accurate","review":"I have just recently bought this book and i must say, this is a great book! I am a big fan of the \\"Kingdom Hearts\\" games. Although the books are fairly accurate, they do NOT go over all of the worlds that were in the game. For example, the series does not go over my favorite world, Halloweentown. The series is great though if you love the story, but don't want to play the game to hear the story. The Anime style artwork is great, and at the end of each book, there is a bonus section full of either character sketches, comics, or even a mini story (mini story based on Winnie the pooh, in the 4th book).

While not necessarily as great as their 1st two albums, it's still the same GK you know and love. Stand out songs include 'enemy' and 'one thing', easily up there with 'guilty' and their other hits.The only tepid point for me was the cover of Depeche Mode's 'personal jesus', it's hard to sell me on cover songs unless they can take the song to a whole new level. This cover didn't do it for me...But the rest of the album is a must for any GK fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gravity Kills Junior Album","review":"This is Gravity Kills' 3rd outing and some people probably wondered why it took them almost 4 years to put out another album.. Well back in 1999 and 2000 GK was having some problems with their record company and ended up leaving TVT, which had produced their first 2 albums. I guess while looking for a new record deal their drummer left the band. In 2001 they got a new record deal with Sanctuary records and begun production of their 3rd album.. which was released in 2002. This album doesnt have the feel of gravity kills though.. the songs seem more commercialized then before. there is 13 tracks on here as opposed to GK's 10 track norm.. but since they had more time to write tracks then the previous times thats understandable. I'm hoping they try to go back to their old ways with their next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow up to two great albums","review":"If you like NIN, then you will like this and is worth getting. The cover of Personal Jesus is great and the rest of the album is a good mix of metal and industrial rock.

It was very comfy, BUT no pad or support at all (I am not a big girl with size 36C). They are just like a thin layer of cloth and what make them unacceptable for me is that my nipples were poking out. I can see them though my t shirt and this is summer, not even cold out.

They scratch and make me itch like crazy. But 100% cotton bras are hard to find, because too many places don't take into account the elastic or seam support that may have a low cotton content. So I've been trying a lot of different bras hoping to find one that uses materials in their construction that don't bother me.This one didn't work. It looks and feel like it's well made, but the elastic around the edges is horribly rough. The ends of the weave on the elastic are looped back into the material in a wide loop, leaving thousands of small, stiff loops on the outer edges to rub against my skin. But not only were the edges rough, the flat part of the elastic is very rough as well and feels like harsh woven nylon.The shoulder straps and elastic edging were like sandpaper. I couldn't even wear it for five minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor support","review":"This cotton bra had little or no support for those who require some lift.

I've actually spent most of my life wearing racerback or cross-strapped equestrienne bras to get around this. Not any more! Now I can wear normal bras that don't further flatten what little I have, and I don't have to worry about the straps falling! I haven't had any trouble with the band riding up, and since these are full-coverage, nothing pops out of the tops, either. Hands-down, my favorite bras ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable!","review":"I bought this bra to accomodate my growing maternity size.

Only complaint is that the straps are not adjustable enough, I've got them out as far as they will expand and they are still too short to be comfortable and they are not stretchy so there's no give at all. Straps needed to be a little longer for maximum adjustment flexibility to be perfect. Best price I could find anywhere so pleased about that.

I was shocked at how constricting the sides were while the cup size fit. Let me explain that I am a very petite woman. Most women as small boned as me don't wear a 34D! So that is why I was shocked at how tight the bra is. I purchased a two inch extender at Walmart which helped and I am planning to purchase a second two inch extender. No point in feeling like Scarlett O'Hara. I recently heard that wearing bras can cause breast cancer because they constrict the lymph glands in the breast. Being a three year breast cancer survivor I now feel good about wearing my old bras that are loose. I have bought Bali bras in department stores in the past and they have been great but the one I purchased on amazon.com did not fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cotton Bra","review":"I have very sensitive skin and prefer natural fibers such as cotton; which are extremely hard to find.

But this one fits the bill. Great product! Flattering and I love the heather grey color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Construction....","review":"Just plain bad fabrication. Unacceptably scratchy and rough, the ribbon straps fold in two where they attach to the rings at the top of the cups. There is no way to straighten them out to lie flat, so they bulge out under T-Shits.Also, there is so little material under the cups to form a band which would support the breasts, that the bra justs cuts you off there, again, causing bulging (and sagging). The Bali Women's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra #3036 looks nothing like the picture when you get it on; what tiny bit of fabric constitutes the band is immediately swallowed up by the large breasts it purports to support. The only wire-free bra for larger women that has a substantial support band is theGoddess Women's Alice Soft Cup Bra, which I discovered in a bra-buying binge this summer.Finally, Bali Women's Double Support Cotton Stretch Wire-Free Bra runs large. I wear anywhere from 40DDD - 42DD in other bras. In this, I wear a 40D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overall","review":"I purchased this product for around $22, including shipping. I think this bra is a good value, considering that a Bali bra will cost nearer to $30 in a store. The sizing is accurate, and I consider myself lucky because my size (34D) is generally difficult to find. But this product is available in many sizes and colors.The lack of aesthetic appeal lowers my rating of this item. This bra is neither youthful in fashion nor particularly feminine. I may be biased; I am only 18 and still rather vain regarding undergarments. But I don't think that I will ever wear this around my boyfriend, rather to the gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabric tore after several months","review":"This is a very comfortable bra.

Based on other reviews, I can see that I need to try again, possibly with a Stephanie Plum book. Full House is shallow, mindless, and only occasionally fun. Most of the novel's plot seemed paper thin and too ridiculous to be enjoyable.I read most of this by the pool, and my suggestion is that's where it's best enjoyed. Otherwise, just don't even bother.

Maybe Janet E. shouldn't have teamed up with someone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I couldn't wait to read a romance written by Evanovich. Better yet, getting to read her earlier work written as Stephanie Hall. I honestly don't know what I expected, but this book highly disappointed me. One thing for certain, after reading Full House,there could be no doubt about how far Janet has evolved from writing romance to mystery. For sure, she needs to stick to mystery because she obviously isn't a romance writer. She's still one of my favorites because of her humor, but this book shows undeveloped talent prior to the Stephanie Plum series. I can't/don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have always loved Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series so much and was so disappointed with this book. I found the candy coated characters and plot so amateurish that I just skimmed through the last 100 pages to find out the ending -- which I never do but frankly just didn't want to waste my time. The plot was predictable and boring. The love interests were so unrealistic and they didn't seem to stay consistent. I even noticed on one page there was a typo -- the wrong name for the leading male character. Now how can you miss that. If you are compelled to read it, take it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full House","review":"I picked up this book at the airport, trusting it would be similar to her mysteries, although I understood it to be part of her earlier romance attempts.

Stick with the mysteries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is too short and I am too old . . .","review":"Like many others, I purchased this book based on the fact that I enjoy the Stephanie Plum books . . . let's face it, they are not literature, they are a fun read and allow me to escape for a few hours on a weekend. Full House on the other hand was a waste of time . . .Did others wonder, as I did, what could have persuaded Evanovich to agree to the rewrite and the republishing of this book?

The intricate plots, loveable cast of characters, and genuinely humorous dialogue present in the Stephanie Plum series are not to be found in Full House. The book is said to have been written before the Plum series and to have be rewritten for this publication. While Echos, or perhaps precursors, of Plum's character can be found in F.

It wasn't bad, so I grabbed Full House as soon as I saw it.It was pretty dire.I don't know what happened but it was like a reflection in a fun house mirror; all the elements of the Plum series were there but distorted.It probably didn't help that the heroine was 38 with two kids. So am I and reality kept creeping in. Where's the millionaire who's mad for me because I can bake cookies?The secondary characters were oddball, yes, but not in the least bit interesting. The spark between the two main characters wasn't there. Ranger had me drooling, this hero couldn't do that if I were biting into a lemon as I read.And the villain?

While the mystery is not all that intriguing, the humor and sweetness make it a great read. I loved the side characters most. Dee Dee is a spoiled but sweet ex-beauty queen, and she is marrying (how many times has she been married?) a wrestler Frankie the Assassin. Her brother Max, a do-gooding supergenious is also cute. The two leads, Billy and Nick, are prototypes. Billy is a single mom who wins Nick with her cookies, and Nick is the rich, sensitive playboy who finally settles down. The sweetness isn't as apealing to hard edge Plum fans, but to those of us who love romance and humor, this was a real find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book I ever read","review":"I am still amazed I finished this book - just a sickness I guess - I never allow myself to NOT finish a book.

I decided to pick it up because Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series amuses me greatly. Fans of that series will surely enjoy this book. There isn't as much action as the Stephanie Plum series but the same wacky humor is still there.

Don't waste your money, it's nothing like Janet Evanovich's newer books."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting read, but not the usual Janet","review":"Picked up this book on the spur of the moment finding Janet Evanovich's books a must light read. For those seeking a fix before the next full length Stephanie Plum novel, this might not be the best choice. The tale is certainly light enough with divorced mother of two Annie finding love and excitement with handsome Nick. The story moves quickly with usual red herrings.

Overall, a definite library checkout or purchase for a hefty discount only read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full House","review":"I'm a big Evanovich fan. However., I consider her latest book incredibly insulting to her millions of fans. From the beginning I kept reading and stopped at page 132 because I couldn't take it anymore.

I still have hopes for her upcoming books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"My husband and I have read every Stephanie Plum book and loved them. I was intrigued by this new series \\"in the Plum tradition.\\" Instead of laughing out loud, as I often do with Stephanie Plum, I grimaced repeatedly.

I threw it out after 10 pages. Maybe I didn't give it much of a try but anything that starts off as that bad of a romance novel (the equivalent of \\"it was a dark and stormy night\\" would have been 100 times better) had no potential for me.

I couldn't even finish the first one. I love the Stephanie Plum novels, but this was awful from the first page.

I wish I'd sat down with it in the bookstore for 5 minutes and I wouldn't have wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have a hard time believing she really wrote this...","review":"This book is a collaboration with one of Janet's friends, and I have a hard time believing that Janet actually had much to do with the writing of this book! It starts out as a VERY cheesy romance (hey, I'm an avid reader and have been known to read a few romance novels) novel and it's just awful. The second half of the book picks up a bit of speed and becomes slightly more interesting, but then at the ending the speed is so fast you can barely keep up. It was as if the authors decided they'd better make this all a little more \\"Stephanie Plum\\" to keep the readers interested in the \\"Full -\\" series, and... it just made no sense.Of course I bought Full Tilt (the 2nd in this series) at the same time, so I had to read that one. That one was a touch better, but I'll review it seperately (;In conclusion, if you loooove Stephanie Plum, um... don't read these just because you feel loyal to Janet, like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"bigger but not better","review":"Janet Evanovich is very honest about this book: 'I wrote and published the original in 1989....Charlotte Hughes and I now have made it bigger and better.'Charlotte Hughes may have made it bigger, but she did not make it better. Friends who have read the original smaller version liked it; no one I've talked to has liked this version.The characters are typical Evanovich and delightful; the plot seems to be going along nicely, and then the padding begins. Plot is going in all directions and the charm of the Evanovich books is no where in sight.I bought this book after reading the first four or so chapters; they were a delight. Then the book got boring; I started skipping paragraphs, then pages, then raced on to the improbable ending.My advice: save your money for the new Plum. Don't go here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overstuffed and unbelievable","review":"This book took a lot of patience to complete, and I still can't believe I read the whole thing.Stuck in midstream without a paddle, it floats between romance, mystery, mayhem and madness. Evanovich's usually quirky characters fly off the believability radar like stealth bombers, unfortunately undetected by my bad book warning system.What starts out as a rich man, divorced woman love story in a horsey setting, becomes a comedy circus of professional wrestlers, crazy people, insects and endless (and I mean ENDLESS) repetition.Evanovich and Hughes seem to have forgotten the KISS principle for effective writing, and I would recommend you forget this one.Amanda Richards, February 26, 2005(KISS = Keep It Simple, Stupid)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt cheated after starting to read this book......","review":"I felt cheated after buying this book and starting to read it. It was horrible. And yes, I knew this was an early work, but I can't believe Janet Evanovich wasn't just putting this one out for the money. IT STANK. The characters were flatter than cartoons. It was ripe with cliche's. I agree, you definitely could see how far Janet has come with the Stephanie Plum books, but I thought her re-writing this would be better than it was. I could have written a better book than this. I had the urge to rewrite it every time I picked it up. I finally stopped picking it up and never finished it. I can't believe she did this to her fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait","review":"Wait for the next Stephanie Plum book. Do not waste your money on this unless you're looking for insight into Evanovich's evolution as a writer. This is not the worst book I've ever read, but if you're expecting the brilliance she's evolved to and we've come to expect from her you'll be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I bought Full House and Full Tilt based on how much I liked the Stephanie Plum novels. I thought anything by the same author had to be good.

I was so un-impressed with Full House I didn't even bother to read Full Tilt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! No comparison to the Plum Series","review":"I love the Plum books. This one is no comparison. Hard to believe it is from the same author.A boring and cheesy romance novel. A very small portion of the plot is mystery - and which is slowly dragged through the story and then crammed into the last 30 pages. As for the laughs you get from the Plum books - forget it, not here. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's going on, Janet?","review":"Wow! What a disappointment... I certainly never thought that the author who created the wonderful Stephanie Plum would EVER be associated with a book like this! It was pure \\"dreck.\\" It read like a first offering from a struggling new novelist. No tension, no suspense, no plot, no nada!I felt after the Christmas book fiasco, (weren't we ALL victims of Diesel) that perhaps the lure of the \\"big bucks\\" had altered Janet's integrity. THIS book certainly confirms that.Shame on you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe she wrote it","review":"I think Janet Evanovich didn't write this book. I think Charlotte Hughes wrote it and Janet Evanovich is trying to get her friend established (published!). This was one of the worst books I've ever read and I'm a devoted Stephanie Plum fan. I think Janet Evanovich should think twice about putting her name on these books by Charlotte Hughes. I note there's a new one out right now. I have no problem with romance novels, but they should at least be entertaining. This book was not worth the paper it was printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full House","review":"I'm a hopeless Evanovich fan, but even so, I couldn't make it through this book. It's very poorly written with implausible characters and situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"--This is a boring dud!--","review":"FULL HOUSE does not deserve the time it takes to read it. It's not worth the money and I feel annoyed that I even paid for it. The story is stupid and has nothing amusing about it or the characters. I purchased it on a whim because while I was in the store someone mentioned to me that the book took place in my area of Virginia. That was a big mistake! Where it took place didn't really make much difference to the sorry plot. Janet Evanovich is trading on her success with the Stephanie Plum books, and this story has nothing redeeming about it.This is the first time in years that I've purchased something without looking it up and reading the Amazon customer reviews. I apologize to my fellow reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm confused...","review":"As I was reading I noticed in one chapter that Nick is referred to as Neil and Joel is called Joey in several paragraphs. I'm not sure if this occurred because of them making the book \\"bigger & better\\" but it was very distracting. Why would the editor not catch this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fun","review":"I checked out the audio book from the library before purchasing for my collection. Several parts made me laugh out loud until tears ran down my face. I like the characters, most of them anyway. I agree with other reviewers that it did start to drag during the last third of the book and the ending wasn't great, but for just relaxing or running around doing housework (audio book), I enjoy it quite a lot.I like most of the \\"Full\\" series books, my other favorite being \\"Full Bloom.\\" The reader, Lorelei King, has a pleasant voice that seems more suited to the stories than the voice of C.J.Critt, who narrates Janet's other audio books."},{"rating":"2","title":"full house","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. It was written just like every day life with its problems in families. Theirs was a little more chaotic than most.

It didn't keep you hanging on at the end like Stephanie Plum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"I was so disappointed by this book! I know it was originallywritten in 1989, but I really expected something much better since it was supposed to have been re-written to be bigger andbetter. I skimmed through alot of it. The characters and storyline were totally unbelievable and the romance and proposal happened way too fast. First Billie is supposed to be this strong, smart single mom, next thing you know she is marrying someone she met 2 weeks ago...Unfortunately this book is another case of a newly popular author putting out a not very good book to cash in on recent popularity. I'm surprised Janet Evanovich would get on the \\"Put Out Anything to Make Money\\" bandwagon, butthe proof she did is Full House. Stick with the Plum books, which are truly awesome, this one is so disappointing to Stephanie/Janet fans it's heartbreaking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmoric!","review":"I am a big fan of Evanovich books; I love the Stephanie Plum novels. However, this novel was very sophomoric and quite predictable. I felt very let down by this effort with Charlotte Hughes. I would have rated this 0 stars if given that option!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about cashing in on Plum readers!","review":"This is an old book that was \\"reworked\\" and, IMHO, Ms. E should have let sleeping dogs lie. The author appears to have done this reworking to give we Plum fans \\"more of the same.\\" Sorry, but this is so NOT that. I suppose if I was a fan of romance novels, this may have been a pleasant enough way to pass a few hours, but I'm not. For a while, I wasn't even sure I was going to be able to finish it. Granted, the last half isn't as bad as the first, but if this is what the author thinks readers of the Plum series want, I will be very wary of buying any more non-Plum Evanovich novels after having read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I have always looked forward to the next Stephanie Plum book byJanet Evanovich, so I was very happy when I saw this book andbought it. When I realized it wasn't a Stephanie Plum mystery,I thought it still would probably be good since it's written byEvanovich. Wrong! I found it dull, with little humor, andquite boring. The characters were flat and the dialog wasterrible. I devoutly hope that Ms. Evanovich will treat us toanother Stephanie book soon. I don't plan to buy any other bookwritten by her unless it's a \\"Plum,\\" always outrageous andhilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly Dreadful","review":"I was sooooo excited when I saw this book in the store, as I love Janet Evanovich. What a disappointment! It is nothing but a junkie romance. To be honest, I only read 50 pages and had to put it down. It was so awful I couldn't see wasting another minute on it. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full House is a Bluff","review":"A Full House is what Janet Evanovich claims to have in this alleged improvement on an early novel -- but she's bluffing, big-time. Stilted writing, a banal plot, and characters shallower than most politicians. I'd feel guilty re-selling it for 50 cents at a garage sale. Shame on the publisher and Ms. Evanovich for conning those of us who enjoyed her later writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck, Yuck, and double Yuck","review":"This is like teen-love-fiction, and by that I mean it's like a teenager wrote it, one who uses bad detail, cliche phrases, overused idioms, bad dialogue and poorly crafted plot.Meet mr. millionaire who teaches polo to a woman -- and they of course fall in love, slowly, boringly, painfully. Then the kids come in and the remainder of the book is like a couple dealing with kids, with no plot development. Yuck.She says on the back she's responding to a call for something like energy and thrills and sexy writing. Uh, not in this one. The only sexy scene is on page 138, and that's not very good either.The best part of the book is that it proves she really does need to go back and learn the craft of writing because either she never learned it or she forgot what she learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring","review":"I happen to really like Evanovich's \\"Stephanie Plum\\" series, so I decided to pick up this book. After reading it, and it was a struggle to read, I can only say I am glad I didn't pay hardcover prices to read one of my favorite authors. Ms. Evanovich has let me down.The book obviously didn't make the bestsellers list years ago - but now - the author is marketing it again....why, probably because she has a following who buys her books.Well, if the next book isn't any better than this.............I'll probably decide to read a few chapters in the bookstore before investing the money (hardcover OR paperback)."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Full House\\" is every bit as good...","review":"as the old TV show by the same name. You know, the one that featured John Stamos' hair, and introduced the Olsen twins? Well, this book is just as probable as the show.Evanovich starts with an interesting heroine and premise, and things go well up until the wrestler, Frankie is introduced. From that point on, the woman who's slapstick humor fuels her Stephanie Plum series gets carried away into the improbable zone.I finished the book and didn't hate it. Hope Evanovich continues to publish now that she's increased her skill and doesn't succumb to going back to her old work, which wasn't published widely, for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Interest","review":"I really look forward to Janet Evanovich's \\"Stephanie Plum\\" series, so tried \\"Full House\\". While the beginning held some interest for me, in getting to know these new characters, the second half of the book just seemed to go down hill pretty fast. Dialog dragged and the characters just weren't fleshed out very well. By the end of the book I found I just didn't care any more and finished it just out of curiosity. There just wasn't any feeling of excitement, and no real sparks between the characters. I was glad it finally ended. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Plum?","review":"A single mother of two becomes engaged to her polo instructor after knowing him only a few days. This is a story Ms. Evanovich had written earlier and resurrected it now that she's famous, adding some things to it for this publication. It promises to be like the Stephanie Plum novels, and it does not deliver. Characters are wooden. Dialogue is corny. There's no excitement. The only suspense is at the end, which perks up the story but it's not enough to make up for the rest of the book. Very disappointing, when this writer is capable of so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I couldn't wait for another book by this author but reading this book was a huge dissapointment. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. If I wanted to read a romance novel I would have bought one (which I never will). Her other books are funny and entertaining. Ms. Evanovich needs to skip the sex and go back to detective stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Predictable, and Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed to say the least. The Stephanie Plum series are awesome and I do have to admit that I had the expectancy that this novel would rank among her others. I think that Janet Evanovich should stick to what works, not venture into something that is clearly not her expertise. I won't be buying her next novel in this new series, \\"Full Tilt\\". It will probably be \\"Full Wilt\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's no Stephanie Plum","review":"I was SO disappointed with this book. I didn't even finish it. It had NONE of the snap of the Plum series. It was sappy and tacky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This is the most trite and unconvincing writing I have read since -- well, now that I think of it, maybe ever.It is extremely disappointing that Janet Evanovich was willing to have this published after her very engaging, funny and convincing Stephanie Plum books -- as wild as they are, they have a ring of truth.There is no such ring in Full House -- it is straight out of Ladies Home Journal -- handsome, rich, sensitive guy who happens to be still single at 35 falls for cute divorced housewife who smells like chocolate chip cookies and has a good attitude. There is an undeveloped villian who pops up at the end; some almost funny side-characters -- but everything is too sterotypied to even be worth reading.This book makes me worried about the next Stephanie -- is Janet grasping at straws?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a huge Janet Evanovich fan and was delighted she has something on the market outside of the Plum series, however, this book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of What?","review":"This book was sophomoric, dull and an insult to all the loyal readership of Janet Evanovich. I am very disapponted. A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"As much as I enjoyed reading Stephanie Plum series, I was sorely disappointed in this book. I can't beleive it was written by the same person! The book is flat, predictable and full of cheap romance novel clichés. I don't know what was this book doing in a mystery section at the bookstore; there is no mystery in it, and it's missing the down-to-earth humor of Stephanie Plum series. I couldn't bring myself to finishing this book, it was so bad. Janet Evanovich, I want my $8 back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"we've been swindled!","review":"I want my money back!This isn't a new Evanovich novel, it's recycled garbage! This book wasn't even good enough to be a Harlequin the first time it came out - it was a Silouette - and now that Evanovich is fanous for her Stephanie Plum novels, they've recycled this piece of dreck to capitalize off of her reputation.I have never felt so cheated by a publisher as I did when I tried to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Janet Who??","review":"It is amazing that this book is by the same author of the Stephanie Plum series! This book was corny, predictable, and so unrealistic that the characters were not endearing at all to the reader. It was extremely hard for me to finish it at all. I kept thinking it would get better and I was wrong. The poor editing was my biggest complaint considering the main male characer is referred to as Neil instead of Nick right in the midst of a love scene! It doesn't get any worse than that. If you enjoy the Plum series, you will not enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother - really, just don't bother","review":"You know, warning bells were going off in my head when I bought this book and I should have listened. This is a revamped, recycled early effort of this popular author, done in conjunction with another writer. In other words, she's a money maker, the publisher wanted to milk her for all she's worth, but she's too busy/not interested in bringing the old stuff up to date. About all I can say that's good about this book is that the characters are promising and in the hands of another author (think Jennifer Crusie) they could have really come to life. As it is, this book is a complete waste of time and I have only myself to blame (always listen to those inner voices). The irony is that I have not read any other of Ms Evanovich's wildly popular books - and I'm so disgruntled over this rip off, I probably won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full House","review":"This was horrible. It's hard to believe that it was rewritten and was still this bad. Now, if I had never read an Evanovich book my reaction might be less harsh, but I've read all her Stephanie Plum's and loved them. This just doesn't measure up. It seemed too worked and too trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"First in series ok, rest get better","review":"I love The Stephanie Plum series and keep on the look out for more by this author. This first book in The Full Series is a rewrite from an older version. It is a typical romantic novel that is enjoyable once in awhile, but the mystery is predictable. The read is quick and light reading. HOWEVER the important thing about this book is the introduction Of Max since he is one of the lead characters in the upcoming series. The other books are better mysteries with a light, fun atmosphere you find in The Plum books, including the sexual tension between the main characters. I have read Full Tilt and Full Scoop and have now just started Full Blast. They are not as meaty as The Stephanie Plum series, but I still enjoy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full house","review":"I was very disappointed with this book after reading One for the Money.

The writing is very different and it's written to a low reading level.

Well, this book didn't help.It is so obvious that it is from her Harlequin days it isn't even funny. I'm halfway through and I'm not sure how I got there. I dread picking it up, I can't wait to put it back down. I was going to force myself to finish, just in case it got better, but I don't think I want to waste my time anymore than I already have.If you are desparate to get a Janet fix, get one of the old Plum books, but if you absolutely must read this book, then get it from the library and don't waste your money. It's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Vaughn is my great-grandfather","review":"This book was originally written by my great-grandfather Robert Vaughn who came to this country from Wales. He wrote the book for his daughter, Arvonia Elizabeth Vaughn Sprague. The original book is extremely interesting, as it gives a very graphic view of what life was like in Montana during the latter part of the 1800s. I am intentionally spelling Vaughn this way because it was altered when he was getting a title for some land that he purchased. In Robert Vaughn's original book, the spelling of his name is the same throughout the book. I have not read Walter's reprint of Robert Vaughn's book, but the incorrect spelling of Vaughn's name and the fact that none of the descendents of Robert Vaughn were ever consulted about this book raises concerns about the accuracy of this book. My rating reflects the quality of the original book."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for replacing the water bottles in Habitrail Ovo cages.","review":"I have several Habitrail Ovo cages with the vacuum water bottles and some of the residents (mice, gerbils, hamsters) have had difficulty with them.

Lixit has always been my go to choice for water bottles and I recommend this bottle for use in places like aquariums and the Habitrail Ovo. It is not chew proof, so where ever you hang or place it will have to be unreachable to the rodent.In one of the mouse cages, I hang it from the enclosed hook and make sure it is not near anything they could climb on to get to the top.

Another plus is that they are considered raw, processed at low heat and organic as well.If you are into Raw food, and looking for a quick snack-type food, these flax crackers are great to have on hand.

Singing about the nuances of life, and the difficulties of living in Brazil in the mid-1980s, as well as the frustration of being in a relationship, Longe Demais das Capitais is a work of quality if not of volume.With a minimalist approach to instrumentals, but with lyrics that inspire the mind, Engenheiros manage to rock while making the listener think.

Breastfeeding is such a touch sensitive thing that if you don't understand how something feels, you could get the latch wrong.The book does describe potential problems, such as mastitis. However, the descriptions are also very technical and left me without knowing whether or not I had mastitis.I wish I skipped this book and went right to Nursing Mother's Companion.

The writing style, with sappy made-up stories in each chapter, felt juvenile. The benefits of breastfeeding were pushed hard, and the particular stance about continuing to breast-feed for a long time feels like an unreachable goal. I'm not against breast-feeding -- in fact, I plan to do it -- but this book left me feeling more overwhelmed than prepared.The biggest frustration I had was in the chapter titled \\"A Father's Role.\\" That chapter would have insulted my husband if I'd let him read it!

I suppose they help soak up SOME of the leakage, but I certainly wouldn't trust these to hold back all leakage from coming through to clothing.

After a few more initial washings (hot water, clear detergent, no softeners), they didn't seem to improve much but were doable if I was out of my other brand. I tried them out at home, just to see if I was being too hard on them without trying them out, and discovered that the pads' absorption rate is poor at best, and wicking abilities are practically nonexistent. I looked like I wasn't even wearing pads, except for the circular \\"frames\\" they created around the milk spots in my shirt.

The stitching is rough and itchy. Once the pad is washed it's very ripply and won't sit flat (which is the biggest annoyance for me).

You can even wash them with your baby's laundry since they're only dirty with breast milk. I've tried other reusables such as nuuk's and they would leak after 2 hours. I pump during lunch which are taken after 3-4 hours. These pads absorb up to 6 hours. I also use disposables while out such as medelan and advento which are great but add up over time as you buy more and more over the year.

Even though the session was recorded on two different days (11/22 & 11/24/57), and with two Joneses (Philly Joe and Elvin) spliting time at the drums, the album has a wonderful cohesion. I find this is due to the musical understanding Red and Ira Sullivan have. Ira, playing tenor here, also plays trumpet (and wonderfully on the Blue Note \\"J.R.

I bought several of these tubs in 2 different orders. 1st batch I thought I was getting 12.5LBS tubs and got those .. i figured I needed much more for the job so on my second order I selected 25 lbs tubs. This is simply a lie I got the same 12.5 lbs tubs. If you see 25 lbs tubs don't count on itthe product is easily to mix and use.. I mixed about 1/2 tub at a time because I had to regrout a bunch of seams in an outdoor firepit.. Do it when you can have above 40 degree weather for 48 hours ... after 3 months the concrete seems to be set well and not seeing any cracks and we have had massive fires in the pit. PS we are covering our outdoor firepit with a cover when not in use to prevent water from building up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for us neophyte bakers!","review":"I have read and used many different books on baking bread.

Great job Dan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Homemade bread!!!","review":"This book was suggested by a chef at the college where I am taking a wonderful baking course. Bread Alone gives you the basics of baking as well as answering the many questions we all have. Great recipes. Buy it and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed: need a new editor","review":"The book has many good features, and I've made some great breads with it. But it is very annoying to run accross silly errors that a half way decent editor should have caught. The worst mistakes are in proportions, which are obviously very frustrating (particularly if you've spent money on the expensive flours Leader incorrectly suggests are crucial). Other reviewers are correct that the number of pages could have been drastically reduced. Frustrating is the fact that while there is an enormous amount of repetition, some important aspects are given only cursory treatment: e.g., how to form the loaves, how to make breads from straight dough. Also annoying is his suggestion that you reuse plastic wrap. The fixation on temperature is too much as well. When my house is warm, it's warm, and when it's cool it's cool, and the bread does fine in both, although it moves faster the warmer it is. My book fell apart very quickly, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book focusing on traditional, organic breads.","review":"Daniel Leader's passion for traditional breads is contagious in this book. Bread Alone has inpired and taught me how to, in my own kithcen, make the best bread I've eaten. From making fairly simple breads with a poolish to more complex soughdough breads the book is easy to follow and enjoyable to read. Daniel's personal favorite Pain Au Levain is worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I loved the look and feel of this book. I read it and reread it before attempting the beginner recipe. Went and bought all equipment necessary mentioned in the book, bought the precise ingredients and then followed the recipe religiously. I just spent the last two days (for the second time) making this bread and to say the bread is disappointing is an understatement."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unpopular review","review":"While there are a few shining moments on here... this overall is an unworthy purchase. I confess that my personal prefence in live material sways towards the \\"Primal\\" period of 69 - 73. Most of the material on here is from the late 80's and reflects many of the weaknesses prevelant in live recordings from this period: Bobby Weir's often jokey / off key vocals and Jerry's sometimes listless playing. The lone track from the early 70's (#6 - It Takes a Lot to Laugh...) is a peach, featuring Dicky Betts playing ying to Jerry's yang in an extended jam. The last track is the only one actually sung by Dylan & is quite an improvement on the universally panned \\"Dylan & the Dead\\" material (and shows what that projecct/tour could have sounded like on record if they had meshed a little bit better).But, then that's just my opinion. And opinions are just like [back cracks]..... everyone has one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful when Garcia is singing....","review":"...but Weir's phrasing is just awful. And that falsetto, man! Not to mention Phil Lesh murdering the lyrics to Tom Thumb's Blues: who in their right mind would change a great line like, \\"I started out on burgandy but soon hit the harder stuff\\" to \\"I started out on HEINEKIN but soon hit the harder stuff.\\"...? The stars are for the Garcia material, which is beautiful and sublime, especially \\"Baby Blue.\\" Weir and Lesh, on the other hand, are hams."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have CD","review":"Live Dead never sounded better and how can you go wrong with Dylan covers (that was rhetorical, you can't!). The sound quality is pristine for the most part and the musicianship is top notch. Tapeheads already have many of these songs already, but for the casual Dead enthusiast (ie, most of their albums, many side projects, and seen a show or two) and the casual Dylan fan (of which I am not 'casual' but fervent!) this is the disc to own. Dylan's stories/songs meld perfectly with the freeform exploratory Dead sound. Postcards of the Hanging II would be nice.......Get the cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Jerry?","review":"This is a real disappontment.. I am not a huge Dead fan but I love the way Garcia does Dylan's tunes--he always seems to find something in the songs I didn't know was there. So why is this a disappointment? Well the songs were chosen by Bob Weir and surprise!! all but three feature his vocals. I felt gypped especially after hearing the great versions of \\"She Belongs To Me\\" and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" turned in by Jerry. If you like Ratdog go right ahead..but if you were hoping for the definitive \\"Jerry Does Bob\\" go to the Jerry Garcia Band Live record on Arista from 90 or 91."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, terrible execution","review":"Maybe its because I saw them play an incredible Tom Thumb and Desolation Row on consecutive nights in '92, but many of the songs on here are just bad. Phil has never been a great vocalist, that's just part of his appeal. But listening to him on this is painful. Bobby omits an entire verse and screws up the Ezra Pound/TS Elliot line in Desolation Row. The bonus disc Quinn just stinks. \\"It Takes a Train\\", \\"Queen Jane\\" and \\"She Belongs\\" are the only decent tracks. I find it hard to believe that David Gans couldn't come up with better takes of these songs. I was so excited to see the track list- then I sat down and listened to it. Anyone who says this is \\"The Best Ever!\\" can't possibly have listened to many Dead shows. I'll stick to my boot tapes, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"goofy concept, but excellent","review":"If you love the Dead, Dylan, or music, buy this. There are no bad cuts. We all could complain- I wish \\"Visions of Johanna\\" was on the disk, but we got \\"She Belongs to Me\\" and that is just fine- a little too heavy on the Bob, a little light on Jer-I wish at least on Vinnie/Bruce jam was included- perhaps a Tom Thumbs Blues-With one exception- A \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh,\\" '73 with Allmans in DC,it is all Brent era. Personally, this is exactly the type of CD I generally do not buy- A commercial concept CD invented to suck my cash-But it is so good-All I can say- if you consider buying this, buy it- well worth the bucks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The good news is in the liner notes","review":"This cd is pretty good. I'd like it if Jerry had more songs on it. When Bob Weir does his warbling voice I'm afraid I want to leave the room. I'm glad he has several cuts where he sings solid and steady. But, the liner notes allude to the possibility that the 1987 Dylan/Dead rehearsals \\"hopefully will be harvested someday for a fascinating release.\\" Having heard the unofficial (bootleg) release of those sessions, all I can say is THAT will be a good cd-mistakes, false starts, coughs, mixed up verses, and all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read book on history of engineering and technology.","review":"This small book contains valuable information regarding life andall round genius of Westinghouse.
