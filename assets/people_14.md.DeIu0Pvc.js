Product bent after putting a DJ coffin on it, would have expected it to be a bit sturdier. Also, it's hard to get it to sit flat, and the adjustment bar requires a wrench to make any changes, there are other models that are a lot easier to use. If you're using a light weight keyboard and just need something cheap to get you by, this should work pretty well, but if you require a bit more performance take my advice and spend a little more money and get something that's going to last, work well and be easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"On Christmas Eve, I opened the keyboard stand which was to be a special Santa present (with a keyboard) for my autistic son and NO HARDWARE was included.

It \\"locks\\" into place, and is not easily folded or adjustable. It can be done, but it requires unscrewing and changing bolt positions, it is not the \\"folding\\" style implied by the picture. There is actually an additional securing beam that does not appear in the picture, that makes the stand more secure, but less convenient for folding and adjusting.For the price, it is sufficient, but this is far from a quality product.

I had to repack it and return it to Amazon. What a waste of time. I also noticed that it is designed so that, when seated, your knees hit the stand legs, making it almost impossible to use (should you ever get all the parts).I have since bought a very strong, properly-designed stand by Kaman in a local store (already assembled). I suggest Amazon stop selling this Casio stand, as all the necessary parts often are not included.Kona"},{"rating":"1","title":"missing parts and terrible customer service","review":"Our box also arrived taped up, with no external protective packaging. One of the 8 screws was missing, and the special screwdriver was missing too. The Casio customer service number referred me to a Parts Replacement number. The Parts Replacement number referred me to a local parts distributor. The local parts distributor number has a constant busy signal (we've dialed it for days). The next closest parts distributor (1000 miles away) said they don't support Casio products anymore (but Casio had given me their phone number). The screws are an odd metric measurement that our local hardware store doesn't carry.This has been one big hassle. It looks like it might be a decent stand once we have the pieces to put it all together, but I recommend that you buy it in a STORE instead of on-line, and check that all the parts are there before you leave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible documentation","review":"I am happy with the product.But I had to waste quite a bit of time assembling it simply because of the terrible documentation.

By examining the picture, I was able to put the thing together correctly the first time, but I could see how some might put it together wrong. Once you find everything and get it put together correctly, it works just fine. I don't have any problems with my knees hitting it. It's very stable if you get the screws connecting the legs in tightly, unfortunately, I had to get a little rubber thingy used to open jars to manage that since the heads of the screws are round and lack screw holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware of shipping damage via UPS","review":"I ordered mine but when I got it from UPS, some parts were missing already since both end of the Casio box were damaged, some of the h/w already felt out and could not be found.UPS/Amazon needs to put the Casio stand box inside of another box while shipping, or use lots of extra tape on it.Also, when I went to Amazon's \\"return center\\", I could not find that item on the list since it was shipped to me already, so I had to send another note to Amazon to see how I can obatin a shipping lable to return that item.

When I pulled up my bench, I felt like a 4 year old at the piano! I even went so far as using an office chair to raise me up. I set the chair to the necessary height, then I couldn't reach the sustain pedal!So, to the designers of this stand, I only have one thing to say. NOT ALL AMERICANS ARE 6 FEET TALL! I'm not a tall person, but neither am I a dwarf. Before I bought this Casio, I had a wonderful Yamaha keyboard with a stand. When set to its lowest setting, it was perfect for me.

Got a couple of things to build, but when exploring the world in the example of chapter 15, there are bugs and holes in the display or render errors or something. Or maybe this is the way that it was engineered.I think when they provide proper support for this book I will probably give this book 4 stars, because I think it is well written and goes over the topic of Game Engine programming very well. Too bad they did such a poor job of quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"THe author should learn how to program first!","review":"C'mon - at least get a CD with examples that actually compile!

This book is about building tools like a big game engine or a level creation tool. That is refreshingly different from most other books out there which only treat game programming and tie all the graphics rendering code directly into their demo programs. This book does always separate the demo projects from the graphics engine, the audio engine, and the network engine. Now I learned how to write reusable code that does not need to be changed for different projects. That is what I wanted from this book.The broken CD-ROM is of course a bad thing. But with the online updates the problems are fixed. I'm happy with this book and learned a lot from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, with publisher mistakes","review":"First of all - this book isn't for someone, who wants to get started with C++ the first time.

Nearly every small detail is well explained by Mr. Zerbst.He covers MME, SSE and Shaders, as well as Character Animation and skeletal systems.The worst thing you could say about this book, is that the CD is crap. It seems that the publisher did not reviewed it or anything like that. But Mr. Zerbst knows about this subject and has a good update page for any problems. So you will get support :) And honestly - you want to code, or? So why do you need a CD?But after all... it's a great book with well explained details and nice topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"italian charm","review":"The charm is very pretty in person.

I highly recommend this pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product, but check it out","review":"I've purchased 3 of these through Amazon, and my experience with the first 2 was 5 stars. It works good for high pressure tires and the built in gauge is nice. It's a bit tight of a fit on the valve stem but a little wiggling gets it off.That last one I got appears like it was partially disassembled for some reason. I tightened the loose pieces and it started to work so I guess everything is OK.

Haven't had a chance to use it yet but wanted something as a backup to the CO2 cartridges as if you run out and have no pump it could make for a long walk back home. The price was excellent as my wife bought a different model, same pump family but the pressure guage was on the nozzle end, and she paid more. since I already purchased this one, I returned the other to the shop that my wife bought it at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middling performance, irksome design flaws","review":"Foremost, I smack the beegeebus out of my knuckles when I use this thing. It really ought to stop the stroke high enough that someone with normal-sized hands doesn't have this hassle. (seriously, my glove size is M across the board). I end up having to forgo the flip-out handle feature and move my hand in-line with the barrel. Also, I have some minor issues with this chuck grabbing valve stems, but it eventually gets there and doesn't leak or let go once it does. The flip-out cleat is not locking, doesn't really brace the unit, and is generally worthless. The gauge (almost requisite for road tire psi) is helpful and accurate.I wish I had bought a Lezyne. If it were not because I use frame pumps so infrequently, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turbo Morph pump","review":"I just purchased this and have only tried it once. The displacement on the pump is not large, so you will get some excercise getting to 70psi. The plastic foot rest is not sturdy but can be used carefully to balance the pump while inflating. The Guage is small but surprisingly accurate. The unit is somewhat long and limits where on your bike you can mount it. I opted for under my crossbar so I wouldn't have to sacrifice a bottle holder. The Valve stem receptacle fit easily over the valve stem and clicked into place easily. So far, I really like the pump, but if you value lightness and compactness, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Poor Product, Worst Documentation","review":"Like the title says, it is:a. A good idea to have a morph pump with a pressure gauge.b. A poor implementation because the gauge is pretty useless (i) highly inaccurate (ii) usable range is cramped because gauge goes all the way to 160 psi (iii) highly inacuratec. No mention anywhere how to convert pump between Presta and Schrader. I had to watch a youtube video uploaded by a good Samaritan that showed process of dismantling the value and inverting the rubber busing and the plastic air channeler. Topeak SUCKS.2 Stars because pump will get the job done"},{"rating":"2","title":"small and powerful","review":"I have been happy with this frame pump: it is small enough reasonably to be called a frame pump, and powerful enough to 110 psi my tires call for. The pressure gauge is a plus for me, as is the design that allows it to be stabilized against the ground when pumping. It's a bit of a work-out to get the tires filled, but I suspect this is the nature of the beast for all compact frame pumps. The pump converts between Presta and Schrader valves, but you have to disassemble the head in order to do so (and I found the directions a little hard to follow, but that may just be me). The pump doesn't replace my full-sized bike pump, which is easier and more convenient to use (and which can switch between valve styles with a flip of a switch), but is great on the road and when traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great small pump!","review":"I'm not a biking expert, just entered the sport to start triathlons. The pump is well worth the price, I was easily able to get 110 psi on my wheels. I'm not an idiot, but the directions were lacking, so it took a little while to figure out that the lever used to secure the head onto the stem was the opposite of every other pump I've used in the past. You place the head on the stem with the lever perpendicular to the stem, then extend it out so it's in-line with the stem to secure it.Up side: price, nice gauge, easy frame mount options.Down side: Small foot, needs better directions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lil Pump","review":"Best pump I have ever owned.

Thankfully this has very little in the not so good category. The only thing I can think of to hold against this mighty little pump, is that its not so little, I had only one place I could mount it on my Mtn bike under the main top tube. What it makes up with that size though, is incredible pumping power, and a very very handy fold out pressure gauge and fold out foot rest (small yes. but still helps). The pressure gauge is easy to read, and so far is holding up well to the pressure (pun intended) of dealing with a mom, a dad and 2 boys, one being a toddler. 2 proverbial thumbs up from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aggravation","review":"Well packaged is about all I can say for this - it came in a nice box.You can use both type of valve on this pump but it's a pretty tricky set up.

While I may prefer individual songs of other artists, I can't think of a collection that samples the music and sentiments of rock 'n' roll era. The Beatle-esque sounds and 60's idealism of Seeds of Love. The transciption of the sci-fi story \\"The Last Night of the World\\" by Ray Bradbury into \\"Famous Last Words\\". Cultural/personal struggles of emancipation in \\"Woman in Chains\\".If you only heard of \\"Seeds of Love\\" and think the CD will sound like a pothead's 60's protest CD, forget about it.

All I was looking for was an adequate portable stereo without the bells and whistles. Unfortunetly the bells and whistles this thing lacks are intelligent design features and basic reliability. Two examples of the former: The blue backlit display is almost worthless, you can't see the readout unless your staring down at it a few inches away from the unit. Also, the cassette player lacks an auto-stop feature for its fast forward and rewind modes, making it quite likely that some of your older cassette tapes could be damaged during rewind unless you hang around and listen for the stop.As to the reliability, well just a few months into use and now the mode operation select is failing. The cassette player still operates but selecting the radio or cd player now just brings up a blank blue screen with no data and no sound.

Probably a bad motor or poor belt drive design. We left it new and unused for too long so nothing we can do about it now. Hooked the old player back up and will look for something that may actually work.Stay away from it. It's just premature landfill garbage and will be a pain to recycle. Emerson [Funai} trash.

The radio reception is below average, and it can be hard to read the digital tuner screen if you're not at the right angle.

Such theories have been disproven logically countless times by many, many, many people. Also to suggest that no expert has ever disproved a single statement in the Bible is just plain wrong. This type of apologetic slop may convice those who don't really want to think about the issues, or Christians who are biased and already believe in God and are just reading for confirmation of their faith.

Was the difference noticeable? No. They couldn't distinguish. Monster charges out the butt for those, and they're sold because the margins Best Buy makes off of them are *insane* compared to other electronics.Monster is laughed at around the audiophile/videophile world because if the terribly quality for the high price they offer. The same goes for their power cleaning technology. Even if it were good, I wouldn't buy this anyway just because of how they treat their customers.

The album is well crafted and there is plenty here for the rock fan (including Floyd fans!) including some wonderful guitar solos. There is a lot of fun music here ('This Heaven' is so funky!). 'Then I Close My Eyes' is one of those laid back slow relaxing tracks - delicious! 'Smile' is a nice blend of acoustic and slide guitar. 'Where We Start' is a really lovely song.

I think it's the finest of all solo albums and I am a HUGE Waters fan. It's defnitely mellow but beautiful. The guitar work is magical. His voice clear and methodical.

I'm sorry to say that I was severely let down. Aside from \\"Take a Breath\\" and \\"The Blue\\", this album is no more than mediocre at best. David Gilmour is certainly showing his age now, trying to appeal to people closer to his own age and never truly \\"rocks\\" like he did with \\"Until We Sleep\\", or \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\" just to name a few. While his guitar work is truly magnificent on this album, the lyrical effort is a glaring reminder that he should have made ammends with Roger Waters years ago. Gilmour's wife writes the lyrics on this album and once again begs the question \\"how on earth can you call yourself a poet?\\" If you're a hardcore Gilmour fanatic like I am, buy it but don't expect much.

I am a Floyd fan, and like David Gilmour's first two albums. But his song writing skills are weak. Nothing on the par with Roger Waters'. The songs on this album go no-where. \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" where melodic songs as well, but they evolved and the music took you along for the ride.

I love David Gilmour, but there's very little here that isn't strictly light weight fluff. Very nice light weight fluff, but fluff just the same. I'll just go to iTunes and spend 99 to buy track #4, \\"Take a Breath\\". It's the only track that remotely resembles Pink Floyd or features the meaty guitar work that I love so much about David Gilmour. I would recommend his first solo album, but I just didn't find enough on \\"On An Island\\" to warrant a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"David Gilmour is undoubtedly a great musician and his years fronting for Pink Floyd have secured his position as one of rock's great guitarists. While I wanted this to be a great album, it simply is a let down; not because it doesn't sound like Floyd, but because it doesn't have one good song on the entire album. David's new vision, represented here on \\"Island\\", has truly worked to polarize him. The music here cannot possibly engage any listener and move them in the way that his sound has in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very well made album which will leave you comfortably numb","review":"On an island is a very well made album from the master himself.This is as good as about face though a bit slower than the last floyd classic The division Bell.I have listen to it probably a hundred times and enjoyed it.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best solo work yet!","review":"\\"On an Island\\" is definately David's best solo album of the three he has released. His voice is top notch and sounds very dreamy at times. As always, his guitar playing is great, it is some of his best guitar playing - IMHO. It's great to hear fellow Floyd Richard Wright harmonize with him on, The Blue - takes you back to some of the early Floyd. David Crosby and Graham Nash also do a wonderful job on the title track. If you love Pink Floyd and David Gilmour, you will definately love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album!!!","review":"Very, very Floydian... Same beat, the distingushed psychedelicsound of David's guitar, solos, awesome sax.... Maybe even the best of David's ever. I was listening to it yesterday while driving in a pouring rain and it was unbelievable experience... Out of space sound..... There is only one drawback- the album is very short........you want more and more and more............I was lucky to get tickets for David's concert and I am looking forward to his show. Highly recommended album!!!!! I love it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even for laid back, mellow music , it's average","review":"If you've already got the title track song, you've got the best thing about this CD, imo. I put this CD on at work, and it went by completely unnoticed...If Gilmore was interested in making a poignant, from-the-heart CD that captured his feelings, disposition, metabolic mojo , etc,etc...he probably succeeded brilliantly here. Unfortunately for me, that equaled 1 long, uneventful, musical listening nap..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a snoozer","review":"I like Gilmour and after reading other reviews here, bought the album.Yeah, the sound quality is excellent. But....The tunes here are absolutely forgettable. I've listened to the album several times and there are no cuts I really need to hear again. Pleasant, boring background music.Get Dave's first solo album. It's light years better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"Had this record a week or so and I would say that dispite my 2 star rating there are a couple of tracks I quite like. But this album is far from a great work. I think the truth is Gilmour is a superb performer and improvisor but a lousy composer of structured works. I would rate Richard Wright's compositional skill significantly higher, he wrote some beautiful bits on Dark side and Animals. Ultimately I think its a crying shame that Gilmour and Waters can no longer work together. I cannot image how good Amused to death would have been if it had been given the Gilmour treatment. That's basically how pink floyd worked on golden albums like Animals, waters comes up with a demo tape and the thing evolved into greatness using the other band members considerable talents. For me the closest to something like Animals is a Roger waters solo album, Amused to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good background music","review":"This album is not what I expected as a long time fan of David Gilmour/Pink Floyd. I understand his approach and intention wasn't the same as his previous solo albums. For me, it took alot of temptation not to skip any of the tracks in the hope of finding a song that will rise above the rest. I would have hoped to at least have one decent song on this album. I have to admit; David still has a wonderful voice and is a awesome guitar player. However, I wished that I did not rely on his past success in order for me to buy this album. I recommend previewing the tracks before purchasing so you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wasn't expecting a Pink Floyd album","review":"I was expecting a David Gilmour album and I found it. It's not as good as About Face but it is still great.

From my point of view, I really love the first 2/3 of this CD. My first impression was \\"this is awesome\\". Its like hearing Pink Floyd's newest album. Remember though, its not Hard Rock, but more like \\"Soft Rock Floyd\\". It contains the same electronic sounds and great electric guitar sounds that we have enjoyed though the years. But it moves to an almost \\"New age\\" easy listening album on the last two or three songs. I didnt really care for the latter few songs. If you are a Floyd fan, I would highly suggest buying this. Its like Pink Floyd again. Just beware that it does mellow out on the last 1/3. Its like what's really happening to all of us as we get 50 and 60. We mellow out some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"This CD was a gift to my dad who is a huge Pink Floyd fan so I haven't been able to listen to the whole CD, but from what I've heard it is a good CD. I was surprised when it arrived because it came long before tue estimated delivery date. I would totally recommend this CD to those who enjoy listening to Pink Floyd but are skeptical of a solo performance by one of their members! Those who aren't familiar with Pink Floyd (shame on you!) will like this CD as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's wrong with some of these reviews?","review":"Why should a great guitarist/musician/singer stick to just one genre? What, do you only sing Godsmack songs in church? Only listen to Megadeath at a funeral?Cross-overs are appreciated by many and they never get redundant. Is rock music the ONLY type of music you listen to? How boring you must be. Broaden your horizons...come loose, be freeThis CD is great for mellow rainy days where you just want to relax...the title of this CD muight be an indication of relaxation..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far from boring.","review":"I've listened to this twice and my first impression is this: it's one of the best solo pink floyd albums to date. Like many have said before, it is pretty mellow and sounds very similar to meddle in a lot of respects. That is definately not a bad thing! I'm guessing it will be to the people who think Pink Floyd is solely dark side of the moon and wish you were here. Great guitar solos and excellent vocals .. overall 4 and a half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow Gilmour","review":"I really like this CD. I didn't expect this to be the next \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". It is what it is-good compositionas with excellent guitarwork....As someone once said, Gilmour can make a banjo sound like a stratavarious...His guitar sings on \\"Blue\\" and \\"On an Island\\"... There are some heavier, blusey moments on \\"Take a Breath\\"...\\"Where We Start\\" could come off Division Bell...Excellent guest appearances by Graham Nash,David Crosby and Richard Wright. This is definately a great disc to bring with you \\"on an island\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor. This album is BAD.","review":"I bought this album based off a long love of Pink Floyd music and various solo albums done by the members of the band. Sonically, the album is above par, but the lyrics stink. Dave should move to an island for the next effort and make sure to leave the Mrs. behind. He can do much better then this. As for the die hards who are giving them album 4-5 stars, put down the pipe and be honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money.","review":"Pink Floyd has been my favorite band for as long as I can remember, and when Roger left, that was the end of Pink Floyd. As bad as David's self titled first album and follow up About Face Albums were, I would give them 5 stars compared to this. I would even give Momentary Lapse of Reason and Divison Bell, which were both awful, 5 stars compared to this. I can't believe he is actually charging people for this. If I could have given it 0 stars I would have. Unless your a die hard Gilmour Fan (NOT Pink Floyd Fan), don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"To think this record was made by a member of one of the greatest rock groups ever, Its sad really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring from Gilmour","review":"This is bad from Gilmour. But this is more Pink floyd than the last Pink albums(1986-1994).This is a bad blue copy of Waters and Pink Floyd.booooooooooooooooring album."},{"rating":"1","title":"David on Prozac","review":"I found this album to be a waste of time and money... not what I expected from a guitar god. Not much energy and muddled lyrics. Not at all Pink Floyd type effort. As a Floyd fan and having been to several Floyd concerts as well as seeing David's solo concert I am saddend to see David produce such drivel. 1 star for nice packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Gilbore!","review":"This year, David Gilbore of the so-called \\"legendary\\" band Pink Floyd released his zillionth solo album, and it FLOPPED BIG TIME everywhere around the world! While people are digging Kelly Clarkson, Chris Brown, and the Pussycat Dolls, America completely ignored this borefest of an album, which also got a two star rating by Rolling Stone. Just avoid and wait for Nick Lachey's new CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a waste of money.","review":"I've been a David Gilmour fan for years. Spend the money and buy the DVD titled \\"David Gilmour In Concert\\". It's awesome! This CD is a joke. David, you could have done better. It's all about the money is it not? It's all about the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is superb pallies!","review":"David Gilmour can still come up with great musical riffs which was something that the dumbkuff Roger Waters[...] couldn't do. On an Island, whilst slower in pace than his last two solo records. My standouts here are the title cut, This Heaven, Where We Start and Take a Breath. To say that Bratananey Sneers would write better lyrics than Polly is like saying Ashlee Simpson is better than Neil Peart at lyrics California Coool a/k/a Slip and Slide. You are a k-nucklehead for degrading this. Buy now or HEEGOTCHA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When did David Gilmour get old?","review":"I know that About Face wasn't going to top the charts, but it had so much more energy. This album is so unstimulating it's amazing I can stay awake at all. The only other thought that comes to mind while listening is that I'm is some cheezy smoke filled lounge w/ a mirror ball glinting slowly around the room. I'm disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star is really pushing the envelope!","review":"I bought this album after hearing/seeing an ad on CNBC saying that the new Pink Floyd album was in the stores. Then I got on Amazon and found out it was a new David Gilmour album and so I read a bunch of the reviews. All were positive. Oops, can you say family and friends. Or maybe record companies and promoters.First let me say that I'm a world class Floyd fan and Gilmour is/has always been on the top of my list. But, what happened here is, as another reviewer put it, very forgettable.I hate to bag on David Gilmour project here, but I've listened to the album a couple of times, and have just stuffed it back in the shelf because I don't know what else to do with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZ...zZZZzzzzz...","review":"Couldn't wait to get home yesterday and listen to my new Gilmour CD. I won't bore you or myself with long overdraw comments and analogies of the disk. Look at my stars and know that I agree with others that posted the same scale.Basically, the first 5 songs are tollerable. The rest... I'm still confused about? Actually, upon further review, the word BORING describes the entire CD best. The Guitar solos almost take off ... maybe the solo in Blue is innovative, but the rest of them stay grounded. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, dear!","review":"If I were alone on a desert island with this album, I wouldn't stay long.

Now add the masterful amalgamator's talent to meld music that Gilmour has indeed for pushing the envelope - here is the new album ready for your next journey.\\" ...P.S. Thanks David,Harry K"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilmour hasn't changed much over the last 20 years","review":"On an Island isn't a bad album. The only slight difference between this album and his previous ones is that he is not afraid to show his solid blues roots. He has always been a great blues guitarist, but I get the feeling he wanted to hide it a little bit in previous releases. \\"On an Island\\" is a flat out blues album, and Gilmour makes no apologies for that.It is also extremely mellow. I wouldn't listen to it in my car for fear of falling asleep. It would be an excellent album to listen to late at night, with candles burning, and a loved one by my side.There is a slight problem with this album. I expected that after 15 years or so, Gilmour's style might have changed a little more significantly. It is a very \\"safe\\" album for him. I'd like to see him take a few more risks in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I was alone on an island with only this cd, I might like it","review":"Neat packaging (a mini book; reminds me of Pearl Jam's \\"Vitalogy\\"), but the music, well, don't expect any Pink Floyd flashbacks (think Pink Floyd on valium instead of acid or even a clear head). I do respect Gilmour's greatness, but I just didn't care for this cd. I gave it a real shot, too, but it's too slow and introverted. You can sense his sincerity throughout, but I couldn't relate or get excited about it. It obviously has suited many people favorably, just not myself very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Gilmore On an Island","review":"Very unhappy with this copy compared to the Blu-Ray of David Gilmore looked like a home video"},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak effort typical of the post-Waters Floyd","review":"On An Island is basically a continuation of the mediocrity that was A Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell. Both were de facto Gilmour solo albums and both had 1 or 2 good songs on each with just a bunch of filler for the rest. On An Island is basically the same. The title track is decent, as is the Island Jam that isn't actually part of the album but the vast majority of the rest of the stuff is boring filler. And just because a song is slow doesn't mean it's boring. Compare \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" and you'll see the difference. Basically if this wasn't David Gilmour, nobody would care and this would be quickly forgotten. The man can play music well but has trouble coming up with good music on his own that isn't written by other people, like Waters for most of the Floyd stuff, his co-collaborators on Momentary Lapse of Reason or his wife on Division Bell and this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring album.","review":"I'm a huge Floyd fan. I don't like \\"Momentary\\" that much, but the songs from that album played live on \\"Delicate Sound of thunder\\" are excellent. \\"Bell\\" was definitely better than \\"Momentary\\". I wanted to point that out to let the people reading this review know where I'm coming from, and if they have similar tastes, let them know that this album is not for them. Great production, great solos, but overall slow and boring. Of course there are good songs (\\"The Blue\\" comes to mind), but come on! I want to stay awake! Too many pointless instrumentals and too few songs (just ONE) that pick up the pace. If you MUST have it- OK. I can't stop you. Just don't listen to it while you're driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coool Dude, Roger Waters is awful compared to Neil Peart or David GILMOUR","review":"Toro: Say Pancho who does the dirty gringo Coool Dude think he is, GOD. Pancho: Si Toro, he is not Coool Dude, he is that loco California Coool gringo! Toro: On an Island proves David Gilmour is the guitar and voice of Pink Floyd. Pancho: Roger Waters was just a great wordsmith and stinks without his former Floydmates and sucks compared to Rush's Neil Peart(I dares him to bash Rush's Vapor Trails or any Rush album or is he a coward)! Toro: On an Island is a great solo album from Senor Gilmour. Pancho: The title track, Where We Start and The Blue are great songs. Toro and Pancho say vaminos to the store and buy now and don't be stupido like the gringo one-star reviewers who are either Waters fans or fans of that dirty mamacitas like Orange and C*ntney Sneers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd Light","review":"For all you Floyd/Gilmour fans if you're expecting some heavy,aggressive Floydian style music forget it. If you're expecting anything like his last one was \\"About Face\\" from 1984, nothing like it. It is definitely on the mellow side which isn't entirely bad but for my personal taste prevented it from being a 5 star review. I would have liked a few more rockers myself. IT really reminds me alot of the film soundtrack \\"More\\" by Floyd from 69'if any of you old timers are familiar with that one. Moody,light & smooth. Definitely night time music. He has his bandmate Rick Wright on keyboards for a couple of songs, Crosby&Nash on the title track & Phil (Roxy Music) Manzenera ironically enough on keyboards too instead of his normal excellent guitar playing. Still Gilmour managed to come out with an entertaining & enjoyable disc. As long as you don't mind \\"Mellow\\" you will still be pleased with the results. Think of it as listening to Pink Floyd \\"LIGHT\\" - Larry Anger"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too choppy and too many distractions","review":"As with the rest of my fellow die hard Floyd/Gilmour fans, I was expecting great things from this album. I even set aside an evening to listen to it for the first time through my Sennheiser HD280 pro headphones in order to get the most listening pleasure.About ten minutes into the album I found it to be somewhat choppy and difficult to listen to. David's guitar on \\"On An Island\\" and \\"The Blue\\" was classic Gilmour, but I soon felt like I was forcing myself to listen to the rest of the CD. The bells, whistles and other assorted mixes of noises was a big distraction.I have listened to it several times since then, and it is beginning to grow on me somewhat, although very slowly.For Floyd/Gilmour fans expecting to be totally blown away by this album, I doubt it will happen, at least the first time you spin it up.I'll put it away for a few months and then give it another listen. Who knows, maybe I'll fall in love with it. Or not.Shine On You Crazy Diamond..."},{"rating":"2","title":"batcall","review":"It was a shame that Syd Barrett had to leave Pink Floyd, yet I don't think that the group would be near as large, great, nor talented without David Gilmour.

I hope they all get together and tour, at least, one more time , like the Stones, or Paul McCartney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Musicianship","review":"David Gilmour is an incredible Song Writer & Musician. David has technical prowess on the guitar, in fact, many instruments -- his choice of notes, melodies, harmonies & rythyms keep me thinking of the possibilities, even in my own playing of Bass, Drums, Keyboards & Guitar. David's writing abilities have always been a source of inspiration with his thoughtful insight about Time, Space, Earthly Delights, etc. We will only get one David Gilmour. I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"On an Island","review":"David Gilmour is a great guitar player with outstanding vocals, but he has done much better in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geat Album","review":"This is a mellow album. If you do not like well written mellow music then do not buy this or write reviews saying it sucks just because you do not like it.This is not a Pink Floyd release. It will not sound like Roger Waters. It is no longer the Floydian hayday of the 70's (unfortunately).What you have hear is a wonderful album with well written songs. It is mellow, ambient, and full of melody. Gilmour's guitar work is at it's best (well almost)..This is a great album, which does have some dull moments here and there, but don't get on here and trash it because it doesn't sound like The Wall or Darkside."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband loves it!","review":"I bought this as a gift for my husband's birthday and he absolutely loves it. He's been a long time fan of this artist, and was not disappointed in the least about how great this CD is. He keeps thanking me for getting it for him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unforgivably dull.","review":"A huge disappointment after such a long wait. Mostly leaden ballads, the songs are deeply uninspiring and repetitive while the lyrics, mainly written by Gilmour's wife, Polly Samson, are trite and seem designed simply to give her husband something to sing. Gilmour seems strangely reluctant to show off his guitar prowess on most of the tracks, which struggle to get underway. Take A Breath is a positive embarrassment and the worst thing the maestro has ever done. I didn't expect a new Floyd album but surely we deserve something better than this. Far and away the best offering is the brooding, 6-minute Island Jam given away with the album by Best Buy as a promotional CD. I suggest you pay the earth for this one outstanding track and try to forget the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Bummer","review":"Being a DG fan and A pink Floyd fan since the beginning I personally find this album a letdown. I am travling from Alaska to see two shows in the LA area and I'm sure they will be great but I won't be dissapointed if he leaves out most of this CD. Take A Breath and The Blue are my favorites but the rest of the album sounds like Dave wrote it while sitting in a rocking chair. I've waited almost 20 years for this!!! Sorry Dave. I hope you do another soon and that you get a second wind. Short and Sweet!!!!!

I didn't expect this latest release from David to be anything better than his previous solo albums or Rodger's, or Nick's or Richard's.The simple fact is when the four of these guys were together as Pink Floyd that is when they shined.So why keep releasing solo albums? Probably to fight of boredom. It can't be for money cause they are already setup for life.Despite which member of Pink Floyd who you believe to be the heart and soul, none of the solo albums they have released compare to what the four of them created together as Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's lost it.","review":"Let's be honest here people.

The title of the review says it all; do not attempt to operate machinery while listening to this album. Not a single track is designed to keep you awake long enough to listen to the next track. What's unfortunate for me is that, while so many 70s rockers are now writing and recording funeral dirges, I still like to keep my blood flowing. Expect NOTHING like Floyd; then curl up with some soft food, a warm bed, and this CD. Do not, however, expect to be conscious by the last song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"Been there, done that, done it better...That should be the title for this album. At best, this can be described as background music. Just chill out and make mellow love with your woman to this.Typical Gilmour with his unique guitar sound on this. I love the way the man plays and sings. Unfortunately, there's nothing AT ALL memorable about this album.The funniest thing about this album is that the guitar on the track \\"Smile\\" sounds like something off of Roger Waters' \\"The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking.\\"I am wondering what Gilmour was trying to do in putting out this album. Everything here is rehashed from Pink Floyd albums and there's nothing vaguely original about the album at all. Many of the tracks sound like instrumentals off \\"The Division Bell\\" and \\"Momentary Lapse of Reason.\\"Unless you're the ultimate Pink Floyd \\"collector,\\" you can safely skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really major league disappointed","review":"After buying the single first, I couldn't wait for this to come out. Literally counted the days. Really disappointed. Major bummer. Lots of this feels like rambling new age ez listening stuff.

I will be seeing the Radio City show in a few weeks and am just bumming how let down I feel right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I woke up to write this after being knocked out by Sir Gilmour!","review":"WOW!, This album is magnificently boring and highly uneventful.I don't know what else to say besides that it has all been done before and in a much better way. I find it hard to believe that someone out there can enjoy the two uptempo songs \\"Take a Breath\\" and \\"This Heaven\\". Similar thoughts are expressed regarding the remainder of this narcotic. Regarding his guitar playing... read the second sentence above. Melodies are also unmemorable.I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd and consider David Gilmour to be my favorite guitarist but maybe it's finally time that he retire if these are going to be the results of his labor.This disc should come with a warning label informing the consumer to not operate machinery while under the influence of \\"On An Island\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"contemplating his navel","review":"This is the kind of music that I think should be performed at home, in the dark, with complete privacy.

David Gilmour has a wonderful voice, but this album doesn't reflect anything but noodling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Mellow","review":"4 stars? I give this 4 stars because:1) \\"On An Island\\" is a pink floyd song, even if it isn't.2) \\"Pocket Full of Stones\\" is one of the most amazing mellow ballad songs I've heard in a while. It's somber yet not depressing somehow, even though it's classic 'place in this life' songwriting like DSOTM3) \\"Take A Deep Breath\\" isn't very good.4) Blue is good, except the whammy pedal is kind of distracting.5) Listening to this album makes me want to float away on a cloud...6) The repeated use of island / water imagery gets me inside, perhaps because I spent 20 summers on a small island in Lake Huron in northern Michigan and because it's a part of how I am...7) \\"Red Sky at Night\\" has sax in it. Music today needs more saxophone.Conclusion: If you want something mellow, laden with classic over-bent blues guitar from David Gilmour, without hard rock tinges and with some shocking Pink Floydisms (well, not really shocking), buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better with each listen","review":"I love it. Just wish he'd included Island Jam. Pretty mellow stuff but it takes you back. Thankfully no cringing tunes at all (like Dogs of War and a couple off of About Face), and several that are real standouts (Where We Start, On An Island, Smile, The Blue).Congrats to Dave for making the album he wanted to make and not cashing in completely on the PF brand.

Not just because I am a huge Pink Floyd fan but I loved David's other two solo albums. This album is a huge disapointment. The songs are boring, bland and lifeless. There is nothing very memorable on here. I heard it maybe two or three times and I just can't get into it. If you want to check out his good work then buy David Gilmour or About Face. Those two albums are great. This one is just forgetable.

I listened to it through twice in the hope that I'd missed something, but I fear that I didn't. The voice is still like honey, and the guitar work remains exceptional. But the whole album is like a whisper . . . hypnotic and soothing . . . with neither a wail nor a roar. No one can begrudge David if this is where he is in life. But part of what made his whispers in the past so powerful was the thunder that often preceded and followed them.

I was not expecting (nor necessarily hoping for) a repeat of past albums, but I was also not expecting an album whose lyrics seem to be written entirely by someone other than David. His musical arrangement, likely crafted around the previously penned lyrics, almost sounds like he \\"mailed it in.\\" Knowing DG and his work ethic and perfectionist nature, the results are surprisingly subpar (and I hate to admit it, but the lyrics do come across as a bit sophomoric as suggested by previous posters.)I'd not go so far as to make comparisons to Yoko Ono or Linda McCartney and their musical involvement with their spouses, but there may be more than a passing resemblance to David's working relationship with Polly.The David Crosby cameo is a nice touch - proabably a highlight of the album. I'd not be looking for a radio hit off this album, and cannot recommend it to all but the most hardcore of PF and DG fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same from Dave","review":"Once agian David takes 2 cups of water and adds it to water agian whips in air to produce more of the same predictable nothing that he has made his trademark during his post Roger music career. Makes me value Roger more and more.Those folks who missed Pink Floyd during the years they were a bright creative light will scurry to obtain this mass of Fraud-floyd-kinda sounds like it don't it?.The only redeming factor that raises it above the terrible junk he produced before is that thankfully he didn't try to palm this one off as \\"another Pink Floyd album\\".

Unfortunately, I bought this unheard, and I will never do it again.If I think back, however, his solo efforts have always tended to suck, and venture into the wierd, in an inane effort to distinguish the work from that of Pink Floyd.I feel cheated.

I found the more I listened to it, the more I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very dull, hard to stay awake","review":"The album was extremely disappointing. The references to sounding Floyd like are well off base, the whole album sounds like it needs finishing.I would strongly recommend that you listen to this before purchase I believe that most Floyd fans would give a positive review to an American Idol preliminary round failure if he was associated with the band.This is an album thats trading purely on name recgonizition and the album was released so late in case it affected ticket sales for his current tour.Alan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointing","review":"I'm not sure why David Gilmour decided to waste his time on something so incredibly bland. Every song sounds the same, same slow mediocre melody, no energy, no creativity. The sad thing is that this might be good for a fading star like David Crosgy but this is David Gilmour. He is so much better than your average rock artist, so much more creative, lyrically as well as musically. What was he doing at the piano, sleeping? That's my only guess as to why this album turned out to be so monotone."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"this is a horrible record for fans who waited more than 10 years for original material.I learned to play guitar with pink floyd and the 2 other solo albums by gilmour. but this is a complete joke. recycled solos, stupid lyrics... i could go on. i don't know what happened. while some guitarists keep their grace with age, like mark knopfler, gilmour and a few others indulge in these beautiful tunes that just make one sleepy. probably the worst floyd- related release ever.in the first few days, the reviews here at amazon were terrible. now, it's getting a little better. don't tell me that this \\"grows on you\\"...terrible record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrewarding","review":"When that fat old sun [Gilmour] in the sky is falling...Quite frankly, I expected more. My feeling is that David Gilmour really has nothing to say in this album. Not only the lyrics, but the music itself is mediocre. At most, maybe one or two tracks (\\"Take a Breath\\" and \\"This Heaven\\") are acceptable (by no means great!). I went back and listened again to \\"About Face\\" - it seems so much more interesting. Ditto for \\"A momentary Lapse of Reason\\" and \\"The Division Bell\\". I think these lyrics from \\"The Wall\\" are quite appropriate for Gilmour now:There must be some mistakeI didnt mean to let themTake away my soul.Am I too old, is it too late?Where has the feeling gone?Will I remember the songs?The show must go on.I'm asking all the reviewers who rated this album highly: would you still buy it if it were released by a totally unknown artist? I wouldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum, We Want FLOYD","review":"Ok, this album does have its moments. Unfortunately they are far and between the rest of the Sleepy-time stuff. I do like the older feel, like Obscured and Meddle, but it misses the mark lyrically and playfully. I guess I was hoping for some kick ass guitar work here. Even the solo's seem predictable and bland. To wait this long for a solo effort and get such a laid back effort tells me he has hung up his gloves. It is a sad day for us all.All I can do is ask for Dave to give us one last grand moment and get back with Roger and the boys. Your fans have bought your album, now return the favor and get The Floyd back together. Please! It's not to late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightful","review":"This CD reminds me of the line from \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" - something like: \\"the musical growth of this band cannot even be charted.\\" I have reflected in other reviews how refreshing it is when an artist is not caught up with the need to progress and change, but continues to make the good music that made them successful in the first place. In Gilmour's case, however, the lack of progression is fatal. \\"On an Island\\" sounds like the second half of Gilmour's first solo album. The fact that almost 20 years separates the two efforts is dismal testament to Gilmour's lack of creativity.Now, I'll be the first to agree that Gilmour is a marvelous guitarist - his phrasings are without peer, and his versatility is incredible, particularly his ability to alternate tremelo & vibrato.But left to his own devices, or without a template to copy, Gilmour creates the most forgettable, empty music that could be imagined. \\"On an Island\\" is where this CD should be played - some unpopulated island that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying solo outing by Pink Floyd guitar hero","review":"David Gilmour has no careerist reasons to make records any more; he makes music because he wants to. The odd thing about this recording is that although it has a star-studded cast of helping hands (incl. Phil Manzanera, Crosby and Stills, Georgie Fame, and Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright), it sounds very intimate, a pure expression of Gilmour's personal happiness. As one might expect, it's very Floydian (think Meddle-era) but about as far removed from Roger Waters' paranoia as one could get. People who require a high testosterone content to their CDs might get bored with the peaceful, contented soundscapes here, but for those of us who need a sonic oasis in the midst of a gangsta-rap desert planet, this is heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"For one who has been waiting a long time for some new familiar sounds, David Gilmore delivers in this CD.

I enjoyed most the Island Jam that was released seperate. If you didn't get it, find it. It is the missing piece to this puzzle that will complete what you are hoping for.

And for pink floyd, I would give 6 starts!Enjoy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE YOU DAVE, BUT BUY BROKEN CHINA TOO!","review":"Hey, everybody, go buy Broken China, NOW, by Rick Wright, 1996. See my review there. As to this one, well,Man... What a bust!First an overture. Cool! We're gonna get a symphony, four movements. We're gonna go on a trip... by the fifth cut I had landed in Candy Cane Land.Sorry, man. I think everyone who has a collection going will want this, and it's got some incredible hot points, but it's a bit too into the shuffleboard... with a textbook shuffle sound.Just a bit of virtuoso on the drums would have helped.Cool. It's your statement. I can abide that. I'm gonna go and see you in London. But it's not one which will be remembered 200 years from now.All the best,Steve In Spain"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best","review":"Not David Gilmour's best work but it's OK. The first cut is an instumental and acts as an intro to cut #2 \\"On An Island\\" which is a decent song both lyrically and musically. He get's help on this from Crosby and Nash (no Stills). 3, 4 & 5 are sleepers as in they will put you to sleep. 6 \\"This Heaven\\" is a really nice \\"Bluesy\\" cut and I think it is my favorite. 7 is an instrumental but it is very forgettable. 8 is cheesy, just not at all what I would expect from David Gilmour and you will never ever hear this on any radio station. I listened to 9 ONCE and now I skip it. If I make a copy of this for the car I will leave it out. The last song \\"Where We Start\\" is ok but again it is very laid back but it does have a nice guitar solo. There is some excellent guitar work sprinkled about the whole album. This is an album that many PF and DG fans looked forward to for some time now and I suspect that many of them will be disappointed. (Where is Roger?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over","review":"I read in a UK music magazine that David Gilmour sold his rock-aristocracy-country-pile in favor of a houseboat on the Thames, which is equipped with a priceless collection of high-end analog recording equipment and miles of audiophile oxygen-free copper wire. Perhaps that accounts for the somnolent but technically adept quality of this recording.Basically this is a collection of undeveloped ideas that probably would not have been released had it not been for Gilmour's name and reputation. The tempos are lethargic. The chord changes, when they finally come (\\"C'mon, give us an 'A' now, Dave, you can do it!\\") are predictable. And while I'm sure Gilmour's nth and current wife is a charming companion she is not a lyricist of any obvious talent.If you're looking for some of the magic of Pink Floyd, you'll not find it here. On the other hand, if you're having trouble getting to sleep there are worse things to have on your iPod ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"David Gilmour is my favorite guitar player, but I was very disappointed with this cd.

When Django did show up then Joe played rhythm. This recording of Joseph, made in the early 60's, show that he was quite a good soloist. Unfortunately, the guitar he is using is an acoustic archtop mounted with what can only be described as the worst sounding pick-up in the world. It sounds as if he was playing from inside a metal trashcan. It is a pity that he didn't use a better guitar, for his playing is quite good.

This is not the case with these guys. I have heard them live a number of times and they sing without music so well together that they don't need the music backup.

Poor sound quality my a**. The songs are great. Maybe they do sound a little tired, but most of the Deads music isnt fast paced and speedy. He's gone, and Mississippi half step are two of the highlights, to me, on this album. But i dont think ive ever heard a jumpy version of those songs. Worst dead release ever? Wow, you guys are really Grateful, arent you?! I laugh when I hear people judge a band like the Grateful Dead so harsh. All of the fame was put on them, they never asked for it, they didnt try and look pretty, and sound like music from the heavens above. they had fun and jammed. it aint supposed to be pretty.if you get confused, listen to the music play."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much better Dead to choose from....","review":"The sound quality on this release is horrendous and the performances aren't much better. The drums come across like cardboard boxes while the bass sounds like a dull thud with the occasional annoying buzz.Some have argued that Winterland, where these performances were recorded in October 1974, had such horrible acoustics that a good-sounding live album was next to impossible to record there. The stunning and highly recommended Closing of Winterland CD puts that falsehood to rest. Needless to say, this set will MAYBE find its way into your CD player once or twice before it's permanantly and justifiably retired.For GOOD live Dead, try any of the 32 volumes of Dick's Picks along with Europe '72, Live Dead, the aforementioned Closing of Winterland, and Without a Net."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated Grateful Dead release.","review":"I never understood why people called this \\"steal your money.\\" This has always been my favorite dead release. I'm a keith fan, and he has to be in the mix for me to be happy. He is at the forefront on this collection and his interplay with Garcia is noteworthy. Yes, there are no extended jams and mostly set one material but the set two material from these same nights is plentiful in the Grateful Dead Movie releases. I actually love the imperfections in the sound on this recording. It really makes me feel as if I'm there. (I also prefer Garcia's mix on the GD movie rather than the new mix.) Keith, you are my GD MVP! If you only own one GD CD this should be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly the worst live album released by the Dead","review":"Lackluster sound, a setlist comprised of 1st set material, ie no extended improvisations usually found in the second set and while the playing is good, it's nothing special. But the worst thing about this album is the way it sounds. Every bit of energy the band might have put into these songs is sucked dry by the lifeless and flat mix/recording. Considering the wealth of superior live material the Dead have released in the Dick's Picks and From the Vault series, Steal Your Face can safely be passed by. There really is nothing to recommend this album either for the Dead fan or newbie. Neither the song list or the playing are that interesting and the sound stinks. You aren't missing anything. The Dead themselves considered this to be a subpar album. Phil Lesh going so far as to say it was the worst live album they ever released. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this and get GD Movie Soundtrack","review":"Anyone who tells you this is a good buy, has no clue what they are talking about. Sure the performances are strong, it was their farewell shows, but the sound quality is horrible. Easily the worst sounding Dead release. Phil Lesh, himself, said this CD set sounds awful. However, there is an alternative. A few years back when they issued the GD Movie on DVD, they released a 5 CD set from these same Farewell shows. Simply called the GD Movie soundtrack. The songs are pulled from the exact same shows but the sound quality is amazing. Well worth the buy. So pass on \\"Steal Your Face\\" and buy the GD Movie soundtrack. Same material plus much more and much better souund quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Performance","review":"The musical performances on this album are as good as or superior to any Dick's Picks ever issued. This recording will stand shoulder to shoulder with any Live Dead Release! The sound quality is nothing to complain about those who do should dig the wax out of their ears because they are robbing themselves of enjoying some great music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phil probably just has good memories from this tour.","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer.This is a horrible album.Why they released it I'll never know.Nobody in the band seems to have it on this one.The music and the vocals just sound tired and un-enthused.Not a shining example of the Dead's live shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Think About It","review":"It's impossible to play thousands of hours of music and never play a wretched note, but why on earth these numbers were ever released is beyond me. It is terrible. Not unlike many a Deadhead, I've heard countless shows over the past thirty-two years, and listened to virtually all the commercially released stuff, and this is easily the worst of the lot. When I purchased it back when it was first released, I was horrified; it's sluggish, there's very little improvisation, most of the tunes are among the band's least inspired. As for the couple of positive reviews, well, I guess it would be nice to be so easily amused, but considering all of the other options for your hard-earned money, there's no reason at all to invest in this. In an interview, Jerry Garcia said: \\"None of us liked it. I'm sure even Phil and Owsley didn't like it that much.... I think part of it was that we were not working, and we didn't have anything else to deliver.\\" Need a more expert opinion?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Dead Album?","review":"I think Phil Lesh likes this one--\\"warts and all\\" he once said--but it has crummy versions of good songs, just plain crummy songs, and none of the magic. There's a lot of great material out there, but this ain't it. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ask for your face back!","review":"This album never should have seen the light of day. If you're trying to turn on a friend to the Dead, nothing will turn him/her off more than this mess. Most of the Dead bootlegs I've collected have better sound quality than \\"Steal Your Face.\\" Which is too bad, since, underneath the muffled, muddy tracks, you get hints of performances that must have sounded great at Winterland. The \\"Wall of Sound\\" PA system (which was retired after these Winterland shows) was capable of incredibly clear delivery, even at very high volume. The only good thing about this album is the cover -- probably the most enduring of the Dead's logos."},{"rating":"2","title":"fit my 2005 Honda Pilot perfectly!","review":"cross-referencing part #s showed this would fit my Pilot and it did.

The bass player follows the guitars' lead, providing great support and a huge low end. The drums are probably the most impressive; the double-kick work is some of the best I've heard in a long time, and the overall drum sound is just huge. I recommend this cd to EVERY fan of true metal out there, as this tops my list of the best metal cd's of this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"racism and dance","review":"Another Way to Dance by Martha Southgate is an intriguing story about a 14-year-old ballerina named Vicki. Vicki is one of the best dancers at her school back home in New Jersey, and to her surprise, she gets accepted in to the School of American Ballet in NYC. There, she lives with her aunt and takes classes everyday during the summer. The only aspect of Vicki's appearance that makes her different from everyone in the school is that she is African-American, except for Debbie, a girl in all of her classes that is also African-American. Vicki befriends Debbie and they both go through the troubles of being a different race in an environment they chose to join.I recommend this book to anyone who is a dancer or can relate to the situations that Vicki deals with because it may give you another look on how it feels to be a black teenager trying to fit in with people who are like you, but are still so much different than you."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap price... for a reason.","review":"crap crap crap crap crap.......Buy better wire... this stuff is crap.

The title track from the album, their first single, is one of the best songs i've heard in a long while. My favorite song on the CD has to be \\"Made it Fine\\" a song about leaving the one's you love in a hope for something more, I also used the opening lyrics as my senior quote.

This entire album sounds almost exactly like radiohead. I'm a radiohead fan too and this music is good, but it isn't their style.

I was blown away by the talent and beauty on this CD. From the first track to the last, it's simply gorgeous. Each track can stand on its own as a fully developed, all-around great song. The lead singer's voice is clear and lovely, and perfectly harmonized with the sophisticated yet effortless melodies. The lyrics are extremely well-crafted. It's an amazing achievement from a unique band.I was entranced from the first moment, but after listening to it a few times, I'm convinced this is one of the best and most beautiful albums I've ever heard. A must-have for any music-lover. Buy it - you won't regret it!

It's quite possibly the best CD to be released this year, period.Obviously I can't get express everything that makes this album incredible-- you'll really have to hear it for yourself, and there are many places online (including the band's website at jumplittlechildren.com) where you can do this.

Mocking Samuel Johnson's theory on writing a biography, Lewalski, without eating, drinking, or living in social intercourse with Milton, has succeed in writing an impressive biography of Milton through, as she mockingly asserts, living in intellectual and artistic intercourse with Milton.

I will again purchase the calendar, but like the last, not even bother to remove the shrink-rap.Heroic epics such as TLOTR and The Hobbit deserve much more appropriate art.

I don't object the time adaptation per se, but this one does not enhance this masterpiece, on the contrary it takes away the essence of it, it makes following the plot and sensing the music difficult.

He also dwells, like all political theorists, on obscure notions and not on practical realities. He does offer good backgrounds on some of the issues, including a scathing criticism of Smith's lack of moral thought, the neoconservatives' unquestioning of the capitalist system and American conservatives' rejections of papal statements on an ideological basis.

It turns out to be a rather pedestrian, very derivative, anoyingly unimaginative superhero tale in the \\"Twilight Zone\\" mold, in which Fort (an employee of the New York Public Library) welcomes a visitor from space who is on the trail of an escaped monster-virus killing off New York's business elite (why just them?). Gov. Theodore Roosevelt has a supporting role, as does a young H. P. Lovecraft (who did *not* live in New York as a child), plus a couple of others who are never explained.

A must for the collector of rare works of mysticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent","review":"This is a pretty good depiction of what might have happened to a number of people in the Afghanistan action. It's obviously a fairly one-sided portrayal of events, especially once the detention parts start, and it's doubtful that everything happened exactly as portrayed, but in a general sense, I think the movie got things right. While the movie certainly suggests torture and mistreatment, I think the thing to take aways from it is how a situation that is normally seen by both sides to be rather black and white, in fact has a lot of gray areas. You almost have to watch the movie a couple times to be sure of what's what. The characters aren't developed very well, and that along with action that develops quickly and chaotically can sometimes create a bit of confusion as to what's happening to whom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspension of Disbelief","review":"This, for me, failed to bridge the gap between fiction and reality. It presented itself as a documentary, but in now way convinced that the \\"scripted\\" scenes rang true and were anything other than contrived. Sure this torturous stuff happens. But this film, in my humble opinion, comes across as one sided. Actually, at times, I felt they wee indeed bin Laden supporters who had indeed been caught. I'm not saying they were terrorists, just that the filmmakers weren't up to the task they burdened themselves with. Too bad, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful film","review":"Guantanamo from an innocent prisoner's account...it's an important story to tell. Hopefully stories like these will finally convince Bush and Co to shut the place down. The film shows some of the horrors-- described by Don Rumsfeld as \\"consistent with the Geneva Convention, for the most part\\"--experience by three men unjustly arrested in Afghanistan.Winterbottom's technique of interviews mixed with dramatic recreations is an effective approach at visualizing these real-life horrors, while still lending the credibility of a documentary. The interviews prevent the viewer from slipping into the comfortable feeling of \\"this is just a movie\\", it lends credibility to the story, and makes the prisoners' treatment all the more shocking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"The premise is absurd: three all-British blokes go to Pakistan after 9/11 for a friend's wedding and through sheer accident and bad luck end up in Kandahar?The fact that Ruhal Ahmed has now admitted that he was indeed in Pakistan for terrorist training makes the whole story a lie.

Even when surrounded by wooden performers and performances like those in Diamond Dogs, he's bad.The lead character narrates this story on himself - a down on his luck mercenary. The oft-referenced mystery of why he was booted from the U.S. Army as a Green Beret is never revealed. He kills people with the ease of clipping fingernails and as a soldier is neither believable nor fun. It's just a stupid, embarrassing attempt to get back into the movie limelight.In reality, you could replace failed \\"mercenary\\" with \\"actor\\" and this work becomes Lundgren's autobiography.I had a free rental at Blockbuster for this, and still wanted to ask for my money back.Save 94 minutes of your life for something worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accidentally FABULOUS!!!

The writing team that comprises Libby Street continues with the fresh, witty & realistic dialogue that originally caught my attention. Living in Manhattan, I continue to be impressed with how well Street captures the city and highlights it as one of the main characters.The \\"real\\" characters are believable as well, and I again found myself laughing out loud (and groaning - hopefully to myself) at their trials and tribulations.Sadie Price is Everygirl - full of self-doubt and confidence, intellect and ditzinesss, good humor and bit of bitchiness.Bravo, Libby!

This album contains some of the most pop-chart-friendly songs in the VU's repertoire. But they are all still great songs from any perspective. Although the version of Heroin sounds different than the one on the Nico album, it's excellent. If you're a die-hard fan I don't see why you'd need this but if you want a great light retro album to play in the car or at work, and you miss the songs of the 60's, you've gotta get this! I understand the negative reviews because the 1st time I listened to it I was hugely disappointed. But after listening a couple more times I realized it's really a great small collection -- not as challenging as they were known for, but thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This compilation successfully takes the edge off of the Velvets and makes them accessible","review":"This is an introduction to one of the most important bands of all time.

The closest thing to do this is the box set Peel Slowly And See, which stays true to the albums. This compilation, however, does not. I agree with all the other reviewers, all the songs on this CD are incredible, but that shouldn't be done to VU. I do think that this album might be a good starting place. However, that may not be true. This was the first CD I bought by VU, and I honestly didn't like it too much.

Although I love Raphael Saadiq solo, I would love to see the Tonyies come back together, if not for an album, at least for a tour. It's time for another \\"Revival\\". Anyway, back to the album. The only reason that I think that this is a notch below the aforementioned albums (aside from the difference musically) is that all of the singles are on the first half of the CD (Side one from the cassette), whereas the other two albums had the hits evenly spread out.

I heard about dry shampoos and wanted to try some out. This is the first product I have used and I love it. WOOT!

It's also blondish and getting darker every year. I've tried many dry shampoos trying for the ultimate (for me) every-other-day-wash. Some of them worked but made my hair look weird - sort of grayish and with way too much static - if I didn't put it in a pony I looked like a dandelion. Batiste actually makes my hair look blonder - adds volume and my hair is shiny and manageable.Shake the can well and keep shaking it while you're using it - it seems to work better that way. I'm careful to not use too much and only spray on the roots - wait a few minutes and then brush the heck out of my hair to get the powder out. It does have a scent but isn't objectionable - on the flowery side.I can't say if it will do the same for anybody else but I let one of my girlfriends try it and she \\"borrowed\\" it in her suitcase somehow..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well.","review":"I bought this on a whim because I have been travelling a lot lately and I thought this would be nice for the times I cannot shower after a long car ride and need to freshen up.The smell is alright, nothing overpowering or severely unappealing.

My hair no longer looked oily , which was great. However, the smell wasn't the best in the world. It's a little too tropical for my taste... whenever I'd get a whiff, I wasn't happy about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WORKS!","review":"I have an oily crown, but other parts of my hair are pretty much okay. Having heard that dry shampoo removes excess oil, I decided to give it a go.I have to say, this is amazing. It works well in removing the oil from my crown, and given the price, I got to say I'm satisfied.I'm asian, so of course, I have pretty dark hair. When accidentally sprayed too much, it would leave a white residue in my hair, but it brushes off well, thus no white residue in my hair after brushing and not leaving a greyish tint in my hair.However, it does not provide much volume in your hair, but it works well overall in removing oil, since that's my main purpose in purchasing this. Oh, and I love the smell, it smells citrus-y.Would I buy it again? Of course, and I would recommend it to my friends too. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"leaves residue","review":"i know how to use this, i had used several cans of this before the one i bought on Amazon.i don't know why, but it left white residue on my hair (my hair was blonde) since when i had about a half of it left..which hadn't happened before. i used to buy this product at my local Ulta. but i ordered it online because i didn't have time to drive to the store. i don't know if the product was old or wrong, or i used it in improper way.anyway, after using several bottles i thought it was waste of money and time(to make sections, brush, and get rid of residue), so stopped using this.product works ok though."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works!","review":"Simply put, this does what it says it will do. I like the Blush and Diva fragrances best but the formula is the same. Use too much? rub it out with your fingertips. Don't spray on the outer layer of hair, spray in layers underneath. My hair is left silky, with plenty of body. My hair is very dark and I do NOT get ashy, dull or gray from using this. It rubs, brushes out clean. My favorite use is to spray the roots before bed on day 2, 3 or even 4, rub the scalp with my fingers and put my hair in a large sockbun to sleep overnite. I get glorious volume intense hair in the AM, brush and fingerstyling is all that is needed. Just great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Experience","review":"This is the 1st Dry Shampoo I've ever tried. I read all the reviews and this seemed like a safe bet. I was a little afraid that the smell would be over-powering or cheap. In fact, it is quite pleasant. I sprayed it on in a sweeping motion along my part line. I used it sparingly. It goes on white and feels very cooling on the scalp. I allowed it to dry and absorb the oil for about 3-5 minutes then brushed it through. It was not flaky or powdery. The was a slight residue left after brushing so I used a dry towel to fluff my hair. Guess what? It came out great! My hair looked freshly washed,shiny, smelled great, and had incredible body.

I've researched them and trying to find one was becoming a bittersweet task. I saw Batiste dry shampoo seeing it was economical in price and had great reviews, so it was a win-win for me. I have fine oily hair that I'm required to wash everyday just to get that clean feeling and avoiding an oily scalp.

But was unpleased with the results. This product turned my hair white [my hair is dark blonde/light brown]and although the white color brushed out easily, it really didn't do anything for it.

This makes it hard to aim without spraying toxins into one's eyes, and is unneccessary, since it's just a type of cornstarch powder product.

It was great working with my hair, and every single time I use it, I get compliments on my hair. Go figure!

I have been known to be overly scent-sensitive, which certainly could be a factor in this, but as has been mentioned, the smell of this product made it impossible for me to use - I wound up throwing it away after trying to get used to it a few times. it's this weird citrusy/babypowderish combination that is utterly sickening. on top of this, I didn't find the product itself to work all that successfully when compared to other similar products I have used. all in all, I do not recommend the batiste dry shampoo - the price is enticing, but the poor quality ruins any price advantage."},{"rating":"1","title":"weighed down hair, did not soak up oil","review":"Ok, so I did read one person's review that was bad saying she thought it was due to her fine hair that it did not work, but I have curly hair and tons of it (though it is actually semi fine but coarse).

I didn't know it was white powder so was surprised to see my very dark hair covered in white powder, though it did brush out. Didn't do much for my scalp which is what really needs freshening. Expensive for what you get. I found the Weave Organic Root Stimulator hair freshener that eliminates odor and freshens hair, oil free, 4 oz at $4.99 at a beauty supply store that caters to African-American clientele. It's non-aerosol. I spray it lightly in my hair and in my hands that I rub through my scalp. It dries pretty quickly on it's own; or can blow dry. It works well but use a light tough; otherwise your hair will be soaking wet. Bumble and Bumble's hair powder is AWFUL and very very expensive -- do not buy!P.S. the new Suave dry shampoo works pretty good but use sparingly otherwise will get that gunky feeling on your hair (5/6/2011)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves residue","review":"I wouldn't buy this again. I mean, it does absorb some oil, but it leaves white residue in my dark brown hair even if I brush and blow it out. Also, it makes your hair really dull/matte...like, not in a good way. So then I have to use some shine spray. When it's all said and done, the time it takes to spray this stuff in, brush, blow, and refix...I could have just washed my hair again. I have thin, fine hair. Maybe it would work on different hair. Good luck dirty hair dudettes!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dry shampoo","review":"I love the way it smells.

It's a renewed idea of prayer that returns to the Gospel, that says \\"to enter your inner room, shut the door, and pray in secret.\\" The language of God is SILENCE! This is the prayer of silence. The understanding that God is not \\"out there\\", but God is present inside me changes the prayer. It's the Holy Spirit who is praying and brining me into closer relationship to God.Prayer is just that a relationship with God, ABBA, the all loving Father.This book is very insightful and gives great suggestions for improving your prayer life.Jim \\"Baldy\\" Cremin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta Can Never Break Our Hearts!!!","review":"Watching the DVD was like reliving the concert all over again.

From \\"Billy Who?\\" to the daring, teasing taunts of Sharon Redd on \\"Can You Handle It\\" provided the soundtrack of the late '70s through the 1980s. From midnight Sunday morning until...well until the cops shut em' down...we children partied! Gay, straight, black, white, young, old! John Gacy ran through at least one of Frankie's parties.

The only problem I ran into was that the package holding all the nuts and bolts came open during shipping. I had to dig through all the wrappings to find all the pieces, and in the end was missing 1 washer.

This one takes me back to when I was still just a dumb kid, although just smart enough to appreciate great music when I heard it. There's not a weak song on the CD. My personal favorite is \\"Makes No Difference\\", I am a professional drummer and to this day Tommy Aldridges' playing still inspires me. I love the energy of this CD! I always thought that it was recorded at an outdoor venue. Does anyone know this? Anyway, if you like good time party music played incredibly well with an excellent live sound then ya gotta have this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another beautiful album","review":"The lyrics of \\"Time\\" are worth the price of the album.

I mean, the entire album stays on the same wave lenth, all the songs sound the same. In fact, Afterglow could be one long, song....there is no get up and go in Afterglow. I'd say it's all glowed out.This album brought to mind post birth depression. She should have waited another year or so and wrote something else. It depressed me, has no life to it and was weaker than anything she has ever done. It's a fluffy album with no substance, songs that sound like they belong on Fumbling and it left me bored.I waited seven years for Afterglow. I am content to wait another seven years until I listen to it again. Hopefully by then, it'll actually be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Anyone who has heard this cd and comments that it is not just as wonderful as Sarah's last cd, must not know what beautiful and moving music is.

With her amazing voice and vivid lyrics, this cd is sure to be one that will rise to the top of the charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Sarah is awesome once again.

The songs on this CD are good overall, but after a while, they tend to blend together. There's just not much differentiation in the CD, and the lyrics, while poetic, seem more vanilla than on her past CDs. High points: Fallen, and World on Fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"The first time I heard Fallen, it seemed to me that Sarah McLachlan had reached her best sound; and after listening the first songs of Afterglow, I definitely think she did. I loved this disc as much as i loved Surfacing. When hearing the songs of this album you can feel the smooth environment her voice brings and how she has grown as an artist. The songs are really good and I'm really enjoying this album, except that some of the lyrics are not as good as Surfacing and she should have worked more on a couple of songs that are not on par with the rest of the album. Despite those facts, this is the Sarah's album that best sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"fluff, fluff, and more musical fluff","review":"I don't enjoy writing bad reviews of the works of talented artists, but I can't lie. This album is a total letdown. The lyrics are good and perhaps more personal and darker than ever, but the music is pure fluff. This is Sarah pandering to the mainstream, Britney Spears-loving, musically mindless masses. Most of the songs sound the same and except for the lyrics are quite boring. I do, however, enjoy her single \\"Fallen.\\" This song retains some of her former grace and originality, but I wouldn't waste my money on this album if I were you. It's nothing new. Her previous albums are much more superior, especially Surfacing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her \\"nice\\" album","review":"It's better than anything else out there these days...I see it as her least depressing album, it's kind of nice and uplifting in a way, not as emotionally heavy as previous work, not as much personality in the songs. Still I will listen to it more than Surfacing, and album that I find to be truly depressing.The best will always be Fumbling, followed by Solace, where her raw talent appears in pristine form."},{"rating":"2","title":"five stars artist","review":"How can you rate Sarah if not with five stars?\\"Afterglow\\" is an album describing mature love, after \\"Fumbling\\" described the leaving of adolescence and \\"Surfacing\\" the entering of a new love dimension. It resembles to \\"Fumbling\\" for the steady inspirational tension (there's no weak songs on it) and to \\"Surfacing\\" for the sound. Difficult to pick up a favorite: \\"Train Wreck\\" if you're looking for Sarah's usual sensuality or \\"Push\\" if you're looking for her usual tenderness. \\"Time\\" and \\"Stupid\\" if you are looking for \\"Fumbling\\"-themes. \\"World On Fire\\" is new and unexpected for Sarah: written by her and Pierre Marchand, this are so far the most beautiful September 11-related lyrics to me (and I've adored Bruce Springsteen's \\"The Rising\\").Definitely worth the wait, and for the ones who say it's too short...remember Joni Mitchell's \\"Blue\\" was only 36 minutes and also ten songs long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort","review":"Obviously not her best work. But she still sounds great and it's a great to listen to her voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back, Sarah","review":"I eagerly awaited this release and was not disappointed one bit. Sarah's beautiful voice is wonderful, as usual. The CD is one that I easily played from song 1 to the end from the first day in my CD player without the urge to give it a rest because the songs are all so enchanting. I know it got some bad reviews about how it's \\"no Fumbling\\", but this is a different Sarah- she's older and now a mother. I can't help but see the changes in her writing style that may reflect this. Nevertheless, it's *still Sarah and it's very much worth the listen (and listen... and listen... and listen)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately I have to Agree with Jeff Above","review":"I was really looking forward to this CD based on Surfacing and Fumbling, and bought it without hearing even one song off of it.

Get Fumbling instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad News, Then the Good","review":"For McLachlan's zealously orthodox fan brigade who forbid even suggestions of heresy, allow me to save you further trouble:0 of Billions found the following review helpful:Bad news is that Afterglow doesn't come close to being McLachlan's best work. Nothing in this album hooks on first play; repeated plays are uninspiring. Afterglow is flat--in spots, downright Enya-esque--and it creates a McLachlan-craving it isn't able to satisfy (pop another McLachlan CD into the player to get the job done).Good news is that some of the time, even the gods are entitled to be less than brilliant. Now that McLachlan has released a mediocre record, she can go back to being brilliant again. Until then, take heart: The afterglow is never as fun and interesting as the fumbling and the surfacing...which may have been McLachlan's point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly anticipated, but unfortunately disapointed","review":"After 6 years of wondering when Sarah McLachlan was going to have another album, I was very happy to hear about her release of Afterglow.I felt that her previous album and popular songs off of Surfacing would be a tough act to follow, but if anyone could do it, this master of words and music could.After listening to the entire CD, I was amazingly disappointed. I failed to find anything but songs that basically sounded alike with no variety.One thought came to mind. Good elevator music but that's about it. And to think, I was previously ready to put her in the ranks with Joni Mitchell.Sarah failed with this one. Perhaps (and I hope), the next album will be better. She has written and performed some great music, but not on this album.Anyone want to buy a slightly used CD?I suggest holding off buying the CD and borrowing it from a friend first and make up your own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"got art?","review":"Can someone tell me where all the original and amazing art has gone because we need to get it back!! Two days before being stunned by the mediocracy of this cd, I sat stunned by the droning 3rd Matrix movie. So much potential from both Sarah M. (Fumbling Towards Ectasy) and the Wachowski bros. (Matrix 1) and such milquetoast! I preordered the latest Sarah M. cd because I love her work so much. Unfortunately this cd all sounds the same, with no distinctness anywhere except Fallen and Answer. The rest of the songs don't evoke any feelings other than mourning for the original, evocative art that Sarah M. is beyond capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd, Great Lyrics, Great Music, It's Simply Sarah","review":"I have listened to the cd over and over and I can't stop. It's a great cd, her lyrics are great, the music enigmatic, and her voice is mesmerizing! I have waited over 5 years for this cd and it really was worth it. Sarah has delivered a great album that holds true to her art. I am so glad that she didnt change her music to be something she's not. If you liked FTE and Surfacing, you will love this one. It is a bit softer, but it is as touching if not more than her previous work. Put the cd in and put on your headphones. Grab the lyrics and just follow along as it plays. That is the way to appreciate this music and really GET what make's it great!Some personal fav's:...1 - Train Wreck (absolutely the best!

'fallen is not enough to make it a good album. bottom-line: refrain from purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment for a true fan","review":"I'm one of those fans that jumps at any new album by Sarah (or Tori for that matter) but consider this one close to a waste. The album flows so much from one song to another that I can barely tell when one starts and another stops. All the songs are ok, but it's overall its lackluster to fans who love her more up-beat early albums, remixes or B-sides. If you're just getting into Sarah from her radio playlist, look for her Rarities, Bsides and other stuff album instead-- it's fabulous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial success stifles another true artists evolution...","review":"A poor album. Glossy, weak, boring, and overproduced. Her previous studio efforts were sophisticated in their production but the artist was authentic and soulful in her delivery. It is amazing how such a beautiful voice can fail the listener when you can't feel the same soul behind it. Sounds like a boring pop country album (of soft adult contemporary pop/rock). Everyone I have played this album for dislikes it. There is one descent track tucked away in this album, but overall the quality of songs are poor and very much the run of the mill. Very little originality here. The commercial masses will be satisfied but die hard fan will easily know the difference. It will still sell but not nearly as much as her last album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull","review":"I'm not a huge Sarah fan by any means but I quite enjoy her older work....songs like Into the Fire and Possession. Her latest cd, \\"Afterglow\\" lacks spark and passion. The first single, \\"Fallen\\" is a put me to sleeper. Not her finest work by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah does it again","review":"When I was first introduced to Sarah's music many years ago it seemed like it sounded all the same. But because of the emotional ties to the track I listened over and over again and by the third spin I was picking up the differences.The first time I listened to Afterglow I was distracted and it all sounded too similar. It isn't. The cd is well put together: the songs are different in lyric, speed, and sound and flows from beginning to end. I have found myself at the end of the cd without realizing how long I was listening. I have already used it as a lullaby cd when I couldn't fall to sleep.It's one of my favorite cds although they all run close. I couldn't choose a favorite track because they all grab me in one way or another. I love it and would recommend it to anyone who asked."},{"rating":"1","title":"A low rating, coming from a huge fan","review":"As a borderline-obsessive Sarah McLachlan fan, I was thrilled when I got news that she had put out an album after a five year absence from the industry (besides some work on soundtracks). But upon listening to the album, I was nothing but disappointed. Fallen and a couple of other songs have catchy tunes, but the lyrics are nothing compared to her past work. Compare the lyrics from any song on Afterglow to songs off Surfacing, Fumbling or either of her two early albums (Touch, Solace) and you'll see what I mean. The songs in Afterglow lack the subtlety and imagery that made her past work so brilliant and captivating. Furthermore, her voice does not get the attention it deserves in the album, just about caged by the instrumental parts in the songs. If one is looking for some catchy soft pop, Afterglow is not a bad place to go. But for deeper music that can one can actually identify with, Sarah's earlier stuff is unparalleled."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely, nice CD","review":"I like \\"Afterglow\\" a lot; you will find Sarah's unique sound; for me, each song have a texture, being the favourites \\"Push\\" (I think of my daughter when I hear it) and \\"Afterglow\\", although is a very enjoyable record overall.I don't give it 5 stars because no Sarah's record match hers \\"Fumbling...\\" and \\"Surfacing\\", but I'm sure you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A counter to all those faulting every post-Fumbling Towards Ecstasy release","review":"I'm tired of reading reviews comparing her work now to Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. Fumbling was more than a decade ago. A lot has happened in her life since then. For one thing, she's a whole lot richer than she was back then. From what I can tell, she has a great relationship with her husband, Ashwin Sood. They've recently had a baby girl. As much as I love FTE, which was of great comfort to me in my teenage angst years, we're all supposed to be different now--older, wiser, calmer. I don't expect and most certainly don't want Sarah to be putting records out with content such as that found in FTE in this chapter in her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Voice of Contentment","review":"Admittedly, \\"Afterglow\\" took a listen or two to begin to grow on me; the songs seemed kind of blah upon first impression. There was nothing that ripped my beating heart out of my chest, as on prior albums. However, a closer examination reveals that Sarah is as intensely forthright and emotive as ever. The difference is that she sounds more content overall in the substance of her life (parenting will do that to you!). While she has not gotten entirely away from critical, at times searing introspection, she does not need to be living an emotional trainwreck to come up with meaningful songs.Musically, the production, while a little densely layered in places, does not obscure Sarah's considerable talents-- in particular, her angelic voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah has Fallen","review":"Sarah's latest album \\"Afterglow\\" is one of 2003's worst albums. There is no good reason to buy this album. Don't be fooled by the first single \\"Fallen\\", which might give the illusion that this album is worth anything. There is only 2 decent songs on this 10 song album: Fallen and Stupid. Ladies and Gentlemen do yourselves a favor and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been a long wait for not much content.","review":"10 songs in six years? Wow. You would think that there might be a little more to write about with all the turmoil of 9/11, birth and death--there's little hints of this becoming a better record than it is. Remember on FTE that little hidden track of \\"Possession\\" naked with only the piano and a little hand percussion-thingy? Well, this record will make you beg for those days. The vocals are almost completely hidden under layers of synth strings and outer space beepy sounds--and a host of other wasted effects that are a distraction designed to help convey a musical and lyrical depth that just aren't there. If you had 20 songs left in you, and you picked these as the ten best, there are maybe 2 that really belong. I should think you would throw all 20 tracks on there and let the fans decide. I hope there aren't any more tracks left from these sessions and she just chucks whatever may be left and starts anew with maybe some different producer/songwriters."},{"rating":"1","title":"downward slope","review":"Sarah is heading steadily downhill. Her first album, Touch, wasn't that great, but it showed a glimpse of greater things to come. Solace, the second, showed her beginning to really take form in her songwriting, which fully blossomed in Fumbling Towards Ecstacy. FTE is probably one of my absolute favorite albums ever, and I will always love Sarah for it. But Surfacing, the next album, began to show a dilution in her potency, leading us to this album, Afterglow. Pain creates great art, and I don't think Sarah wants for much of anything anymore, leaving the songs on Afterglow as nothing more than what anyone else could have done. If you want to hear Sarah Mclachlan, listen to Fumbling Towards Ecstacy, Solace, or her B-Sides. Leave the rest to her radio babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sarah","review":"Dispite bad critic reviews, I truly enjoied this album. It's a more mature, introspective Sarah, and very refreshing considering the current trend in popular music. If you like her previous albums...this is a sure bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD but far from anything great.","review":"I am a bit dissapointed with this newest outing from one of my favorite singers on the planet but even then, \\"Afterglow\\" is a really fine album that shows great depth and emotion.The main dissapointment in my opinion is that the music is a bit too mellow and tired compared to her previous outings and the album playing time is a joke being only 40 minutes long!Despite the short playing time, this is a really excellent work of art that shows Sarah's continuing maturity and that it shows that she shows no signs of slowing down and the trademark sound is still there if a bit more subdued than before. \\"World On Fire\\" is just beautiful and ranks among the greats. The same goes for \\"Train Wreck\\".By all means go for this album but try to look at it one it's own merits and don't try to compare it to her previous albums and then you'll be a very happy camper with this outing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEEF JERKY","review":"Same old thing, slightly different flavah - teriyaki, smoked, original.

I'm a real fan of Sarah, and have been for years. Afterglow is boring, directionless, and self abosorbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull dull dull","review":"like everyone else i was really excited that sarah was releasing a new cd, but listening to 'afterglow' killed that pretty fast. i hate to say this, but its not a very good cd. the music is very dull and sarah's voice is no longer lush and full, but flat and just well...dull. for want of a better word, the whole cd is dull. the lyics cannot be faulted, they are beautiful, but the music is not what you would have expected. though there are a few instances where you can see a glimmer of the old sarah, these are nonetheless fleeting. it sounds terrible, but i think sarahs happy personal life may be interfering with her music! bring back the rich and emotion filled music we know! Lets hope the next cd is better. In the meantime, i have surfacing and fumbling towards ecstacy on repeat :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I always look forward to new music from Sarah - but the wait on this one wasn't worth it.

I was THRILLED that she finally came out with another album. A bit hesitant as I first popped it in I found myself wondering if it would measure up to her other albums. I was and am not disappointed. While not as strong as Fumbling, it still delivers. Her voice is as soothing as it always was, the music strikes that special chord as the others.

However, I cannot express the disappointment of her latest effort, Afterglow. Clearly an afterglow is all that is left of her once unique and creative songwriting. I can not even force myself to listen to the album even once through completely. Sarah seems utterly dull on this album and lacks emotion as well as any creativity with her lyrics. Additionally, the string arrangements are shallow and do not compliment the music or McLachlan's beautiful voice. It's such a shame.

She is a pitiful musician and is in my opinion only 'average'. Her new C-D is one of her typical depressing and boring albums.

That's one thing I can say for her, she keeps true to her faith with her typical half-hour set. As for the content of the album, I just wished that I had reviewed this set in the store before taking it home. I was so disappointed in this cd.There are 2 good songs on this cd , Fallen and answer. and the rest is just filler.

It's truly a good album, but the songs sound too much like each other, and too much like Surfacing. Her previous works had so much raw emotion and originality-- this seems too mainstream, too much like it was thrown together to meet a deadline. It is unquestionably beautiful start to finish, but it's less than what Sarah could have made it."},{"rating":"1","title":"tired and formulaic","review":"Like some other reviewers, this is my least favourite Sarah McLachlan album.

I'm shocked that Sarah allowed Marchand to bury her voice underneath all that Wall-of-Sound effects, since her voice is as good as ever. The biggest problem of course is no edge in the songs, trite lyrics. Fumbling was devastating album, Surfacing a bit less so but still had punch.Afterglow is simply product, nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!!","review":"SARAH HAS REALLY DONE GOOD ON THIS CD!!

It's rare for an artist to keep producing such high quality work. I love this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallen into perfection...","review":"I've been a Sarah fan since the Fumbling towards Ecstasy CD (yes kids, she was wonderful before Lilith Fair too) and will remain one forever with releases like this. The songs are amazing and you get such a great feeling when listening to the whole CD. Of course \\"Fallen\\" is an astonishing song but my favorite and, in my opinion, the next single is \\"Train Wreck\\". Yes, listen to \\"Fallen\\" then go to track 5 and enjoy :) \\"Time\\" is another great song on the CD as well. Thank you Sarah for another incredible CD!!! And to those who only base/know Sarah from one or 2 songs off Surfacing, please get a clue and buy a vowel. She has ALWAYS been and incredible singer :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be a 5 if it wasn't too short","review":"I can appreciate the fact the Sarah Mclachlan wanted to take some personal time off. Six whole years of it. And in that time she had many ups and downs. When I heard she was finally releasing a new studio album (not another re-hash) I was overjoyed. Being Canadian, I always cheer more loudly for Canadian made content. I was a little disappointed with the length of the CD. Now quality is better than quantity, but just a little more bone would have made this CD really shine. It's frustrating hearing interviews with Sarah Mclachlan and how she seemly doesn't care about her music or her talent. She is so gifted it hurts. I hope someone can talk some sense into her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow up to Surfacing, completly different chemistry!","review":"Sarah has this voice that instantly melts one into a simmering goo! I love her, It's that simple. There are some great tracks on this cd, it' still growing on me. There is less guitar \\"effects\\" on \\"Afterglow\\" than \\"Surfacing\\". Its more of a stripped down production. One major part is noticably missing, No Camille Henderson! What happened there? \\"Afterglow\\" hosts a different band and a whole different chemistry between the players. I was looking forward to the Camille/Sarah harmonies...oh well, not to be. Hopefully Camille will tour with the band on the next tour. For those of you looking for a repeat of \\"Surfacing\\", It's not this cd. If you want to hear a more honest, basic version of what Sarah can do then this is a must! I agree with other reviewers that It's good to have Sarah back! We missed you girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Record from Sarah","review":"Sarah turns in a piano record that is marvelous and improves with every listen. A lot of people came out complaining that the songs all sound the same. While it's true they due sound similar, it's only in terms of the production, and it's deliberate because the CD has very melancholy themes. The arrangements and songs themselves are as diverse as any Sarah has done, though it's true they are all piano based. And who doesn't love that? Drifting and Train Wreck are highlights!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"This must be one of the most beautiful records ever! I'm a long-time Sarah-fan from Norway and I'm really blown away by this music!I especially like the fact that it is so slow and melodic.This is Sarah's best CD I think!She's got one of the best voices ever!Her choice to write and perform the songs on piano certainly was a good one.\\"Dirty little secret\\" is my favourite so far!What a pity this CD isn't out here in Europe yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Growth","review":"I'm just really surprised at some of the previous reviews. Musicians must develop and change their sound and she's grown as a person - of course that's going to influence her music.

The CD is a shocking disappointment. The producer seems to have thrown every instrument made plus some unidentifiable sounds into the mix, obscuring what might have been a good listen. I feel cheated and unless she goes unplugged next time, Sarah's off my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed after waiting so long","review":"So after what, 6 years of waiting you get really excited when an artist you love comes out with a new alblum. Well I had heard it was \\"nothing new\\" and \\"the same old Sarah\\" but to me its not, its nothing near as good as weve heard before. One song sounds like the next and the next. Nothing stands out and its all a blur of a cd.I wish I could love it since I loved her last cd so much and it has been such a long time but I just cant.Youll end up buying it anyway if your a Sarah fan and come to your own conclusion but dont get to excited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"All the songs sound the same and all the songs sound like the same material she's done before.

Now it's a matter of the same old songs reguratated. Falling is great and Push is great. But shame on me for paying $13.99 for 2 good songs and the rest fillers.Note to musicians everywhere - This is why we download MP3s. Here is a perfect example of a honest music buying person paying for crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I have enjoyed Sarah's music for some years and was fortunate enough to see her in her Lilith Fair days. She is a stellar musician and sings songs with heart. However, I didn't find any of that on this CD. I found this depressing and boring. To her credit, it sounds from the songs as though she has had a lot of conflict and chaos in her life during her 5 year hiatus and perhaps this hindered her creativity and spirit. I will still look forward to her next CD, but can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"is this not worship most heartfelt?","review":"a new friend recommended this, and i loved it because it sounded beautiful and romantic and sweet and all the other amazing things that sarah can do with her voice. then i listened to it. and now i need it.the whole album to me is a prayer. please, listen again, think of whatever to you is God, and listen to each and every lyric. think of your relationship with your God, move yourself through the music, take a different approach to what and who she may be singing about.what does it mean to you now?this album is precious to me. as a prayer tool. a meditation tool. a way of focusing on everything i need to be aware of, of what and how i need to change.yes, it's just music....but it got me.if you're already a christian, take it to study group and play it. listen to it with people who care and share it. if you're not already there - please, take a listen and sneak a preview into how it feels. it's beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This is Sarah's worst album. I don't know what happened to her. All the melodies are so boring. Her best album was \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" by far. And \\"Surfacing\\" was okay. Don't buy this CD - it's way too mellow and the songs are really poor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"Thia ahould have been titled \\"Stumbling Towards Mediocrity\\". Imcomparibly inferior to all of her previous work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enough","review":"How can you not love Sarah? She is gorgeous, and so is her voice. Was this album worth the wait? Almost. I would have liked to see some creative growth, but like the other alt-chanteuses like Loreena McKennitt and Enya, she seems comfortable continuing to create breathy, ethereal tunes. And like them, she does it so well. Melodically and lyrically, she has still to top Fumbling Toward Ecstasy, one of the great albums of the 90's. But this album is growing on me with each listen. \\"Fallen\\", of course, is the high-profile song, but \\"Stupid\\", \\"Train Wreck\\" and \\"Time\\" are also worthy of airplay. All in all, another solid effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steady At [not Fumbling Towards] Mediocrity","review":"Too boring to ever really loathe, McLachlan has long remained on that cusp of mediocrity and frustration - hints of beauty surface here and there every few years, but the compendium is always the same - dull songs, listless vocals, uninspiring and lazy musical arrangement. Nothing here as breathtaking as \`Ben's Song' or \`Possession' or \`Do What You Have To Do', but we have a host of replicates of the dreaded \`Angel' and \`Into The Fire' and \`Solace' and any other countless fungible melodies from her pretty-enough canon. She might or might not be a hack, but if she is, she's a fancy hack. My grade: C+"},{"rating":"1","title":"It really is just an Afterglow...","review":"The other two Sarah McLaughlan CD's were much different; each song on them seemed to be one that got stuck in your head. They all had wonderful, deep, original lyrics sung with an amazing voice. Afterglow is simply awful in comparison. The only song that really jumps out at you like the old ones is 'Fallen' - the rest is, plainly put, filler. Not only are the lyrics less original (dealing a lot more with the industry standards of 'love' and 'love you, but can't let go' and maybe a little more of that overdone 'love' stuff) but a lot of the vocals seem like a monotone in comparison to her other songs; and even those are overshadowed by a too-loud piano track and many useless sound effects.Maybe it grows on you after a while, but I wouldn't know. I haven't listened to it enough if that's the case. The best word to describe it would have to be overproduced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for my wife","review":"She had been looking for a replacment for the same CD, that had been damadged. She had no complaints so far. Shipped on time & in good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not her best","review":"\\"Afterglow\\" while better than \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" is not in the same league as her earlier masterpiece \\"Surfacing\\". I believe this album will be well received by Mclaughlin fans, but those not familiar with her music, might want to try \\"Surfacing\\" or the live \\"Mirrorball\\" before purchasing \\"Afterglow\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharon's Review","review":"Was extremely satisfied with product and the manner in which delivery was handled. Always satisfied with Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"soothing music and relaxing","review":"Afterglow by Sarah Mclachlan is very unique in the sense is not dull but it is willing to take risks especially with the song \\"Answer\\" it is so haunting and beatiful I dare anyone not feel but sentimental and cry a little.If you are asking where did I hear that song it is in the movie \\"The Brave One\\" with Jodie Foster."},{"rating":"2","title":"not being given the credit it deserves","review":"Most of the reviewers seem to be disappointed with this cd. The more I listen to it, the more I like it. Standout tracks are fallen, world on fire, stupid, drifting, and answer. 5 out of 10 are really good songs. Honorable mention to dirty little secret. A lot of reviewers are dissing this cd because it is only 40 minutes long. Surfacing was only 40 minutes long and only had 10 songs...and it was released 4 years after Fumbling.I much rather have a 40 minute cd that I don't have to skip around on. All 10 songs have their own strong points. Overall, the cd IS a bit more mellow but that's what Sarah is known for. Give it another chance. It deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A snoozer....","review":"I have one word to describe this CD - BORING!!! Come on, Sarah, stretch a little. Use the full range of those gorgeous pipes of yours!!! I found this CD to lack the intricacies and angst of earlier works. Easy listening for those who want background music, but nothing you can get your teeth into. Similar rhythms, consistent vocal ranges, and lackluster lyrics make this one a snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Sarah Why?!","review":"I am a huge Sarah Mclachlan fan. Fumbling Towards Ex. was a pure work of art and I adored her other albums espically the B-sides and Rareities (sp?) cd. However, \\"Afterglow\\" which I waited FIVE years for left me completely unsatisfied. Her lyrics had no inspiration and maybe two of the songs actually sounded as if she had any input into their sound at all. If you are already a Sarah fan don't waste your money. This album shows nothing of her talent except her beautiful voice. If you're new to her work than go ahead and give it a try. If you enjoy bland uninspired pop than this is your kind of cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so glad she is back!","review":"Wow. It's so refreshing to hear Sarah's wonderful voice again. In a time full of TRL garbage, we were in need of somebody with real, raw, beautiful talent.Her voice and lyrics make me feel so good.\\"Would your eyes like midnight fireflies/ light up the trenches where my heart lies/ until i can see again/ to find my way back again\\" - Train WreckPush is a beautiful song.\\"And when I fall you offer me a safer place to land\\"Thank You Sarah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Sarah McLachlan's new work \\"afterglow,\\" seems to be her best work yet. This album is much calmer and more piano focused than the others, which offers a new sense of calm. I am a huge fan of this artist, and also had the pleasure to see her concert a few nights ago in Portland. If you are a Sarah fan, it is worth the ticket price to see... she was absolutely amazing. She offered two encores and made the atmosphere very personal. She cares about people and that definetly comes across. She is absolutly worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Sarah","review":"No, it is not as stunningly beautiful as Fumbling Towards Ecstasy which is Sarah's greatest crowning achievement, but it is still Sarah's voice and thus it is still beautiful. It took awhile for these songs to grow on me, but they have. Yes, some lyrics are trite as others have said--but maybe that's what motherhood has done to her, make her more, I don't know, \\"schmoopy\\"! It's still Sarah and still beautiful as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a voice","review":"Sarah is true to form with her gorgeous voice and heartfelt lyrics. It's my new favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed..","review":"Not being a Sarah McLachlan fan, except of her rare dance/DJ collaborations, I've been converted with this collection of beautiful, graceful, introspective and moving tracks.With a beautiful voice, interesting lyrics, and excellent composition, this is definitely one of the best albums I have heard this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have enjoyed Sarah McLachlan's other title's tremendously, playing them over and over even to this day. After hearing the first track on the radio (and liking it) I anxiously awaited to hear this new album and was completely disappointed. I thought the songs were too slow and boring. Usually, her music is more varied, but this was just all the same thing over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about some rousing Sousa tunes!","review":"A personal quirk of mine is to read album credits. In this latest offering the artist acknowledges her husband & daughter in glowing terms.SO WHY NOT SOME UPLIFTING TUNES?Jeez, if this CD had a few more of the typical SM fair of \\"I'm just a mixed up, confused, heart-broken, relationship-scarred woman trying not to screw up my life further\\" I would have tossed it out. It's been a while since I actually wished an album would end.

When I saw this CD was out, I could not wait to purchase it. When I listened to it the first time, I was so disappointed. All the songs sound the same; there is nothing distinctive about this CD.

I think Sarah has become pretnetious over the years and believes all words she sins are poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I considered myself a Sarah McLachlan fan from the days of \\"Solace.\\" I loved both that album and \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.\\" With the release of \\"Surfacing,\\" I was disheartened, and with \\"Afterglow\\" I just can't be a Sarah fan any longer. I only found 2 songs to be good (\\"Perfect Girl\\" and \\"Fallen\\"), another 3 to be so-so, and the rest of the album to be tripe. It's a sleepy version of \\"Surfacing\\" with nothing new to offer. Even Sarah sounds bored singing her songs, and she looks sleepy in each of the three photos where she's shutting her eyes.Could there be any less emotion as she sings \\"'Cause I'm a train wreck waiting to happen\\" in \\"Train Wreck\\"?Then: \\"you save meyou complete meyou're the one true thing i know i can believe in\\" in \\"Push:\\"Say it isn't so Sarah...this has got to be the absolute worst song you have ever written.

I wish I could rate it less than a star, because I think Sarah McLachlan should be paying me to listen to this CD. I have played it more than 6 times, and can't remember any of the songs on it! To call them blah is an understatement. I'm surprised I haven't fallen alseep at the wheel of my car while listening to it! My significant other remarked \\"A great voice wasted on boring songs...turn it off, it's sucking the life out of me!\\" I would try to sell it on half.com, but it just doesn't seem fair to put someone else through this agony.

He is very observant and skilled in describing his surroundings. This strength, however, is also his downfall. He paints a word picture of nearly every situation he encountered--often in excrutiating detail. Frankly, it begins to get tedious. In addition, while I generally enjoy tales this this one, I found it hard to connect with him. There's a detached, flat affect quality to his writing. He's not passionate, just obsessed.

He cut out all the nonessential things like a whole series of bells. Children only needed 3 reminders each day. When to come into the school in the morning. When to return from lunch and when to be off school premises.While children are badly dumbed down, teachers are often dumbed down and worse is their principals and directors who are so rutted in their thinking.A good read if you need to think about the direction of education; but no answer, sadly.

Most countries have some sort of compulsory education, however its what students learn that makes the difference.I don't have the time or energy to argue this point but i am absoluetly sure that most Publics Schools in America have curriculums design to produce students lacking critical thinking skills (COMMON SENSE)....how do i know i manage them everyday.JUST TO ADD MORE INSULT TO YOUR INJURY OR SALT TO YOUR WOUND....

Useless to others and useless to themselves.\\" (pp. 26-27). \\"Schools teach exactly what they are intended to teach and they do it well: how to be a good Egyptian and remain in your place in the pyramid.\\" (pp 15-16). \\"School sequences are crazy. There is no particular reason for any of them, nothing that bears close scrutiny. Few teachers would dare to teach the tools whereby dogmas of a school or a teacher could be criticized, since everything must be accepted.

He trashes the public school system, however fails to give clear, consise evidence and examples. He does nothing to offer solutions to this \\"horrible\\" system and even goes so far as to say that school is a jail for children. He may bring up important issues, however his arguments for them do not follow soundly. This was a horrible read and I hope that you do not waste your time reading this author's ill educated and thought out work.

Mixing in blacks, promoting useless schemes like 'look say', all forms of dumbing-down, writing junk textbooks, starving serious universities and colleges of funds, discouraging languages, encouraging truancy etc etc are the sorts of things to be expected from Jews.Someone (or some group) ought to write a well-researched book on this topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for every teacher, young and old!","review":"I am reading this book to find out how far down the rabbit hole, I, myself have inadvertantly gone, from the days of values clarification and all the other buzzwords we were taught.

The brain works in a finite way, IDing and then Associating what is identified. He does a marvelous job at revealing what is wrong and you will be surprised.

It is difficult, as a teacher, to speak with collaegues, since most would be unable to teach in a competitive market where quality of teaching would count. A change needs to occur before every child is reared speaking a blank rhetoric and bowing to the state. When is Mr. Gatto going to open a school so that I may apply?? Of course, I too am bound by the government systim in that I must teach in a public institution of little merit so that i may be deemed worthy of receiving the state issued certification.

Also, the steps are taught in one direction for both the men and women and then are briefly practiced in opposite directions and this was a real pain for us.Each dance opens with a total dance that shows all the moves, however, once each move is shown from several inconsistent directions, there is no review and you do not see how to put all the pieces together. We kept arguing with each other as to what direction we were to be going in because of how often it would change on the screen.

I hope that the radio stations will pick up on this new CD and give it the air time it really deserves. It was the best bang for my buck I have gotten on a new CD in years. How refreshing.

It's super comfortable even with a pretty heavy instrument for a good deal of time.One minor complaint is that the old strap is a better overall quality, having an extra layer of leather at the bridge end and slightly different composition. Overall, it's a very good and one wouldn't go wrong getting one. I still recommend it. I'd give 5 stars for sure if the new strap were equal to the old one.

However, I couldn't help thinking that most of the book was just the same message repeated over and over: \\"God wants you to both take responsibility for your finances, and that includes communicating about them regularly (and making a budget).\\" I guess if you really can't get your spouse to agree on some basic ground rules (like if there are still checks in the checkbook, that doesn't mean you still have money), then this would be a good reality check.

That's probably the only good song on it.

Like Its been a while, epiphany,Take it,For You, Outside and Fade. The songs mentioned arereally the only reason to get this album, whichmeaning if you buy this record your gonna have toskip through it, cause this album is by no meanslistenable at all. I still dont understand howthis album even got as big as it did, but none the lesstruly a Bad Hard Rock/Metal record... If you want goodmetal get albums by Tool,Alice and Chains,A PerfectCircle.... Also the only reason why i give this record2 stars is cause it has the hits that we're actuallygood/decent, tho they did milked the living daylights outof this record so thats probably why."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, this is terrible","review":"i have five words for aaron lewis: marlon brando in apocalypse now. i keep waiting to hear a song from staind that ends...the horror....the horror. well it is horrible"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have They Done It Again?","review":"First of all, Dysfunction rocked. Now the new cd. I have just picked it up today and it is amazing. Staind has shown me that they can go from heavy and blistering, to soft acustic and melo. Its very hard to say that \\"popular\\" hard rock bands are good because most of them and their look-alikes suck. Aaron Lewis' voice is superior to all in his genre(with the execption of Sevendust's Lajon). Wish I could be of more help but I cannot pick a favorite song. Staind has definitely broken the cycle of 2nd albums (....) I am at a loss for words. CHECK IT OUT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staind is NOT metal","review":"I was reading an issue of Revolver magazine recently and saw that the winner for best \\"Nu Metal\\" band was Staind. Calling Staind metal makes no sense to me. Their guitars are somewhat heavy in small places, but that is the only hint of metal I see in their music. I hate Staind's music. I hate every song they released off Break the Cycle. This is simply because I really dislike their kind of music. Im into bands like Megadeth, Fear Factory, Pantera, and Static-X, to name a few. Static-X is a 'nu metal' band. Now honestly tell me, what in the world does Staind have to do with those bands I listed above?NOTHING. So my anger is not at Staind, I respect them and just dont enjoy their kind of music, my anger is towards people who associate them as a nu metal band. It just makes no sense to me. If I had to choose a name, I would choose melodic alternative rock. Thats not great, but more fitting than \\"HEAVY METAL\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please.. Don't...","review":"Let me tell you.. This album is majorly AWFUL.. All their songs are monotonous.. If you like the song they have on the radio (which most people don't).. DON'T GET IT!! This album is a pure waste of a good group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alice In Lames","review":"It's bad enough that Layne Staley passed away and Jerry Cantrell is opening up for Nickelback. But is it really necessary for this fat, whiny bald gentleman and company to rip them off? They took a specific aspect of AIC and are shamelessly milking it. Every song sounds exactly the same; underwhelming mid-tempo ballads with Aaron Lewis crying out \\"I'm in Pain!\\" in so many words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotta be a costume","review":"Staind who? It sounds like someone dressed up Alice in Chains in costumes, tied Jerry Cantrell's hands up, and kicked Layne Stanley square in the crotch. That's how deep and how talented these guys are. If you want someone that \\"knows how you feel\\", why don't you go hear it from someone who is creative enough not to rip off the past decade for musical inspiration (like Steven Jenkins, for example), or someone who had REAL problems, like Cobain (or Freddie Mercury, for that matter!). If it weren't for the punch-in-the-face quality of feel-awful-for-me lyrics this could just as well be Creed. Or Lifehouse. Or Staind. Wait, which one are these guys again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been awhile....","review":"since Guns 'N' Roses last released a album, and during the lenghty hiatus it seems Axl Rose changed his name to Aaron Lewis and he formed a new band called Staind.

I was a fan of \\"Tormented\\" and \\"Dysfunction\\" but this CD is just a piece of pure garbage! From the contrived lyrics to the muddy and bland music Staind has proved that they were just waiting to get to the top of the music scene then conform to what MTV and all the other big corporations wanted to them be. And they did it, along with the guru at selling out, Fred Durst. This was a huge sellout record and it's just disgustingly pitiful. My friend burned me this CD and I'm glad because I got to hear it before I might've made the mistake of buying. I'm glad I didn't. So please, don't buy this huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"I never thought I'd live to see the day.BUT HERE IT IS:Finally, a band that writes more petulantly whining lyrics than marilyn manson.

The only thing they may have broken was the sound-mixers and studio producers that tried to realize an excessively fashioned, stereotypical album (I sure wouldn't be keen on hearing this posse live). Doesn't anyone get it? They're merely replicating Korn, Godsmack, Creed, Stabbing Westward, and a few other mediocre (at their best) bands that plague corporate rock. So, the reality is, if you copy the plague that infects corporate rock, chances are you'll end up with another plague..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Talent Clowns","review":"This band has to be the worst band in the world besides Limp Discuit. For all of you frat boys and Accokeek hoods, you need to spend your money on good bands like Weezer and R. Kelly. At least we know R. Kelly doesn't mess around with his lyrics. He gets right to the point when he talks about the girls \\"booty\\". I love you R...peace out."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice","review":"Staind has definitely found their niche with this CD. Deep lyrics, heavy guitar, melodic sound, and something so far away from the travesty that was dysfunction it will make your head spin. This is a very welcome change from their first album. Epiphany, open your eyes, and pressure are all awesome songs, great for when you've just lost hope in everything. Good stuff for a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeper than I thought","review":"I initially bought this album because of Staind's acoustic songs, and skipped the rest. After further review, though, it is the other songs that keep me coming back for more. The depth and emotion expressed in this album is awe-inspiring. Listen to the entire album. Rock on."},{"rating":"2","title":"untitled","review":"the only problem i have with \\"break the cycle\\" is that the tracks go from one extreme to the other, really well worked well written to total cack(s*!t). it's been awhile, open your eyes, suffer and outside are tracks that either make you think or get you emotional. I am glad i bought this album you lot should to, it's worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"This is one of the few cd's I have that has more than just a few songs I like. I can listen through the whole cd and enjoy every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"They tried to break the cycle","review":"Staind shot really high in this second born album. It is more serious than previous one and also more diverse. Sound is much stronger but they miss that edge they had in song like \\"home\\", and \\"mudshowel\\". Hardcore fans might enjoy all of it but me personaly could not take a big bite out of this cake. Few songs are \\"sticking out\\" of the pack while album overall is not listenable more than just few times. To put my final word this is a one must have album for a fan and if you just wanna check it out, i still say go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"With staind being one of(if not my favourite)bands,I was a little disapointed with my first listen of break the cycle.But, as i listened to it more and more,I began to love it.Sure their music may have changed a lot, but they are still staind.As much as staind writes music for people, we should also try to understand that, even more so, they probably do it for themselves.With that being said, this album is(for lack of a better term)outstanding.If you have an open mind, give this a listen.If you dont,i suggest you keep listening to dyfunction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staind Delivers with long awaited album!","review":"For people like me who have been waiting for Staind to come out with a new album since Dysfunction, the wait is finally over! This album is great from start to finsih. The band does not sell out with hard songs like \\"Cant Believe\\" and shows a great new side with songs like \\"Its Been Awhile\\" and \\"Epiphany\\". ITs still the same old Staind setteling into a form of music thats very rare these days. Instead of just coming out and screaming everything Arron Lewis displays his great voice on all tracks. Of course the album wouldnt be complete with a recording of \\"Outside\\". Overall this album is a must buy for Staind fans both old and new. And for music listeners that want to hear something good."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an emotional, acoustic, heavy Staind!!","review":"This album has it all! The lyrics are great! Aaron Lewis shows us that he can definately write lyrics like no other. They are all great songs from the acousic \\"Epiphany\\" to the heavy \\"Can't Believe.\\" If you have their first album and you haven't got a hold of \\"Break the Cycle.\\" GET IT!! THE ALBUM IS WORTH THE PURCHASE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Staind Life Forever","review":"Staind is the best thing to hit the rock scene in a while. With Dysfunction they made a name for themselves as an emotional hard rocking angst band. With Break the Cycle they have stepped out from the wing of Fred Durst and just broken through. This CD has the best lyrics i have heard in a while, each has a very poetic feel and a unique message. IF you like It's Been A While buy this, you'll love it if you didn't, buy it anyway... it has great vocals and lyrcis with the same crunching guitar riffs... If made into a video \\"Open Your Eyes\\" will go down as an instant classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Wow! what can I say about Staind's 3rd album Break The Cycle, this album just rules! Aaron Lewis proves why he is one of the best frontmen today and why Staind is our saviors of rock and to get us out of this boy band age. Staind rocks and I highly recomend Dysfunction. Staind f'n rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, what can I say about this CD...","review":"...well maybe that it is one of the best CDs of 2001, so far. I first got interested in Staind from hearing a song off of the SCREAM 3 soundtrack (I can't remember what that one was called), and the song \\"Outside\\" which was played on Star 98.7 and KROQ constantly. I mean don't get me wrong, that is a great song (a new studio version is on this CD) but jeez do we really have to hear a sonng so many times?!?! Overall this album actually deserves 4 1/4 stars because some of the songs are just too slow! The only slow songs are \\"It's Been A While\\" and \\"Outside\\"> BUY THIS CD NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Staind--Break The Cycle","review":"This album is so great because of the variation in sound which is hard to find from a hard rock band. They use a masssive combo of bass, and guitar which give it's heavy sound. It's got the soft not so agressive love songs with a sad mood set and it's got hard, heavy metal with an angry mood. Who else would dare to do this? I dont know of may bands with this quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome lyrics","review":"Man, Aaron needs some THERAPY!! In all seriousness, I relate to these songs. Not all of them, but a few. And the rest are all very good. The only problem I have is the no solos. I think that \\"It's Been Awhile\\" could use a solo, as well as \\"Outside.\\" \\"For You\\" is my 2nd favorite song on the CD, after \\"Outside.\\" I would reccommend this album for fans of heavy metal with a message. Meaningless [stuff] like Korn and Limp Bizkit should be avoided. But Staind is a great band in the making, and I will go out and buy \\"Dysfunction\\" ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it... you'll understand once you hear it.","review":"I think my title says enough, but let me be a little bit more specific. There are only a few rock bands out there that will turn out some good stuff on a consistent basis. Staind is one of those bands. Though the songs on the radio are very strong, I still can't enough of Epiphany... what a song!! I've had a difficult time trying to give the other CDs I've recently bought equal play time.I'll refer to my title once more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"I was very exited about the release of this one, until the radio played \\"It's Been Awhile\\" 300 times a day. Thank God none of the radio managers found the other version of \\"Outside\\" (the good one without you-know-who doing ad-libs), which means there is at least one song that I'm not completely sick of. While I'm at it, cheer up guys, you're rock stars now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the cycle -- just break the CD","review":"Could someone please give Aaron Lewis a hug? This is one of the most unoriginal albums ever written because it's about the 2 millionth of its genre -- you know, the one where every song is about being a suicidal, rebelling teenager, or being ignored or hated, or being beaten by daddy, etc.? Why don't groups like this just shut up?I was given the displeasure of letting a friend of mine let me listen to this. I can't get a grip on why Lewis devotes the entire album to his supposed pain and suffering. Will there be another album just like, or maybe will he write about -- gasp -- reconciliation with his parents?I have a better idea: The next time they write an album, at the very least, Lewis should come up with 10 whiny, boring songs and have the other three be about little bunnies and flowers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Staind, but Pile of Fred Durst","review":"This thing is terrible. How many times can you repeat the words Its Been Awhile? Someone's smoked one too many. Its Been Awhile bears an uncanny resemblance to Alice in Chain's Down in a Hole, a great song that Staind has obviously just mimicked, minus the Alice in Chains genious, but who will notice, right? The rest of this album really [bad] too. What happened man? Dysfunction was a killer record. The only explanation is that Fred Durst snuck in when they were finished and just trashed the sucker.I don't know who the people are rating this thing, but Im willing to bet [...]. Thats how he got popular, not by actually being a good musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"......because its deep, like me..........","review":"Wow, what a wonderful collection of deep relaxing, sooth the soul songs, all together here at once, all on one cd, what more can any... goth/punk child want? This is the music that we'll all be laughing at in 5 years, like we did with every other little fad. Its funny...that they actually like something like this, yeah, because its deep, right? To put it simple, this is the kind of music that kids that all make fun of... people one day, but the next day they... would listen to, and somehow they suddenly turned... because someone told the it was cool,... when they're really giving all the... people a horrible reputation...This music... goes no where, it just is a bunch of whining and complaining, and the lyrics are really hardly lyrics...get some better lyrics and a better sound, and then maybe an audience who is worth something might like you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Puddle of Mudd","review":"Aaron Lewis is fighting a losing battle with Staind. He should just drop them off at the gas station he picked them up at, and start belting out some phenomenal material from his real band, Puddle Of Mudd. Why do artists collaborate so much. They should focus on one band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave my copy to my mom.","review":"I was very disapointed when I got this album. The songs all have the same sound to them and are generally annoying. Plus, after you hear him on the radio so much, you never want to hear Staind again. I gave mine to my mom because I didn't want it anymore. Don't buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad but true review","review":"Look staind are an excellent band, with great riffs, and singing, though unfortunately staind has managed to fail like bands like limpbizkit, creed and more. You see staind use to be heavy and more agressive, and the lyrics where better to, though sadly fred durst made a record deal with them, and now they end up like this, with [bad] lyrics, and bad music. Oh well thanks for reading, go get dysfunction, their better album, which is what they use to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bunch of self-righteous pussies.","review":"Aaron Lewis needs to quit his bitching.

The first 3 songs show it right away. than, it just keeps going keeping the tempo up. The one soft song (not outside, but there is a studio version of outside)shows once again, aaron lewis can do any music. This is so much better than their first album. They also arent being sell-outs like their friends korn and limp bizkit which rocks. Go get this CD now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Could Ask For More?","review":"To me, Staind's albums keep getting better and better. All the songs on break The Cycle are masterpieces by themselves. Put them together and you have my favorite album. I bought it about 3 months ago and since then, I have burned 2 other copies for myself. 1 for my stereo, 1 for the car, and 1 for my portablt player. Lewis' voice can got from a hardcore metal sound in \\"Can't Believe\\" to a magnificant voice in songs like \\"Epiphany\\" and \\"Outside.\\" If I could only have one cd for the rest of my life, this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent follow-up","review":"The first thing that authentic Staind fans have to be extatic about is that \\"outside\\" is free of the bravado of the king of all mooks fred durst. As if that was not enough Aaron Lewis and company have managed to mix raw emotion and sleek studio production. Compared to Dysfunction, Break the Cycle includes more slow ballades, and more fast and anger-filled screamy vocals. Intensity is the key in every song. Unfortunately the reputation of Staind has been much too often stained by affiliations with above mentioned meathead durst. A more likely comparison should be made to Alice in Chains, as Aaron, espcially in the more angstful reminds me somewhat of Layne. If you liked Dysfunction you'll love Break the Cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I got this CD today and from what i have heard it is really good. Half is heavy half is soft. I reccomend this cd for fnas on the 1st."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"Paind\\"","review":"Initially, I liked the first single off this cd. Then MTV played it to death, as did my local radio station. Then came the next single (I don't even know what the songs are called), and it sounded like the same song.This guy takes himself too seriously and always looks \\"Paind\\". Get over it dude. You're a success now.Last time I heard them, I Staind my pants from boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous monotones","review":"Aaron Neville or whatever this lead guy's name is is simply horrible. The 2 - 3 songs that get played 150 times a day on the radio sound exactly the same.Granted the acoustic guitar along with the rock music sounds intriguing but in reality. Doesn't really work too well. Especially when the lead singer whines throughout the songs and sounds like he's got a congested nasal cavity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful followup","review":"I was looking forward to the new release by Staind. After the first listen all I can say is I am very disappointed with the album. Gone are the angry emotions and feelings that carried their first release and instead we end up with a second effort that is dull, dreary and down right boring. I gave my copy away after 2 listens. I would not recomend this to anyway unless you like your music slow and dead with no emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forcefed Whining","review":"To be honest I didn't think the first Staind album was too bad but this album is basically just capitalizing on crybaby suburban angst. Aaron Lewis's lyrics are uninteresting and extremely repetitive. When you are thirty-something with a wife it is time to grow up. I'd be depressed too if all I did was smoke pot, play video games, and stare at my shoes on stage(he has no stage prescense)all day. The music does not just ride, but beat the dead horse that is Alice in Chains/Tool. It's all the same midtempo/melancholy/ballad stuff. To call this album rock is an insult to music in general. I'm just glad I never spent money on this piece of garbage"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me, maybe for you if you're depressed","review":"What a depressing recording.It takes you down into the dumps and leaves you there.If you can relate to misery passed on from generation to generation, you're all set.Angst and more angst, that's what you get.Not a very pleasent or uplifting experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking The cycle of Poor CD's","review":"Stainds New Album Break The Cycle, is the hardest yet most melodic album to come out this year. From the eternally hard Fade to the amazing melodic lyrical style on epiphany, these guys get it right. Aaron's lyrics seem to connect with everyone young and old. Mike nmushok's guitar riffs are soothing yet hard at the same time. The whole album is like a therapy session to get out your anger. I have been following these guys since their independant release Tormented. I am very happy to finnally see Aaron Lewis, Mike Mushok, Johhny April and John Wysocki finally get the recognition they deserve. If you are contemplating buying this album, do it now you wont regret it. Also their first major release dysfunction is also as good though not as polished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaron Lewis whines too much.","review":"Wow, this cd came out and the whole world (particularly the one dominated by mtv) raved about it. I sincerely hope this is not \\"what rock has evolved into\\". The entire cd is a pile of over-mainstreamized, whiney, mass-appeal crap.Whoever Staind hired for marketing sure did a good job though; I've heard people deem this as \\"underground\\" or \\"metal\\". No, folks, this is pure trl-trash. The entire cd sounds pretty much the same way, same themed songs, same feel throughout.I recommend this cd only to those following the mtv-created rock-trend. This is merely trend-rock that every teen and teeny-bopper can relate to,(\\"ooh poor me\\"). If you watch the \\"It's Been Awhile\\" video on trl every day, and like what you hear... go ahead and buy this. Otherwise invest in a REAL metal cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Energy ???","review":"I've been a Staind fan for quite some time now, and when \\"Dysfunction\\" was released, I was like \\"this CD kicks major you know what.\\" \\"Spleen\\" and \\"Raw\\" and \\"Mudshovel\\" were just excellent, well-made pieces of art, expressed in the anger and emotion of 4 dudes from Mass. But the new CD, \\"break the Cycle\\" is just lacking some obvious things...like catchy guitar riffs and some awesome screaming. That whole side of Staind went down the tubes, as far as I'm concerned. Also, at least 7 of the songs on the new CD are off of \\"Dysfunction,\\" just tinkered with, making them slightly different. I'm sorry, but this could be the beginning of the downfall for Staind, unfortunetely. Hopefully i'm wrong, cuz I love the band, but for a sophmore album, this one falls well short of my expectations. That's my 2 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Another hyped up band with a lead singer that sure as hell is another wannabe poser who tries too too hard . I can't even take this guy seriously. It seems he just wishes he had it hard. Just watching the unplugged video said it all. I you want to hear depressing or just plain out Real music from a person who speaks the truth about his hard life than check out Mike Ness(Social Distortion) or Layne Staley(Alice In Chains). These are two songwriters who spoke nothing, but the truth about there Real Hard times unlike Aaron Lewis or whoever that poser is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get any better!","review":"I enjoy Staind's music becuase I can understand the feelings that are behind the lyrics. I think that everyone should enjoy this album because it shows a more matured Staind and a more expressive part of them all together. They are each talented and enjoy what they do and it shows in the music and in their performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This CD is a lot better than the first. Staind has really matured and took a big step ahead of Dysfunction. I'm not saying Dysfunction is bad, it's just that I think they put more effort into this one. Do yourself a favor, pick up this new release, it will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step in the right direction","review":"There was flashes of brilliance on Staind's first album. Their long awaited follow-up builds upon the style they were experimenting with on Dysfunction. The studio version of Outside is very nice and the live version of It's Been Awhile is great. Overall, this album establishes the identity of Staind. It is a step away from the screaming that was present on Dysfunction, and I believe their careers will flourish because of it. If this album hadn't have been delayed twice, I would have given it the full 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"absurd CD","review":"I just bought this CD, first day it came out, and it is amazing! It is not quite as heavy as their last CD, but lyrically it is much, much better. I would recomend this CD to any rock fan, no matter what genera of rock music you like. If you are a pop music fan and just like their new songs on the radio--outside and awhile, then I would not buy this CD. Overall, a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"STAIND=GOD!!!","review":"This album by Staind is excellent! To be exact, words cannot describe how good this album is. Aaron Lewis has really given his best stuff and it definitely shows. He put a lot of emotion into his singing. The melody of each song is different from each other. There are some that are close, but each have its variations. I just love the whole album, but if I had to choose, my fav songs would have to be Pressure, It's Been Awhile, Epiphany, For You, Outside, and Waste. They all have great melodies and some are very mellow such as Epiphany. I happen to enjoy mellow, but I do like some of the hard stuff, like in Waste. IF YOU HAVENT YET, GET THIS ALBUM BECAUSE ITS GONNA SELL VERY VERY FAST! GO GET, GET IT NOW, GO GET IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bunch of whiny ...","review":"Except for a few titles this cd is not worth your time or money. Outside is beautiful, I will admit, but the rest of this album dulls me with its incessant suburban angst. Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"wake up everyone!","review":"is it just me, or does \\"It's been awhile\\" sound waaaaaaaayyyyyy too much like \\"Home\\" from dysfuction? It seems like these guys had a big hit and decided to mimic that hit just to ensure commercial success. If you listen closely, the guitar riffs are almost identical in many songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of misinterpretation","review":"I felt I had to write another review to acknowledge the amount of people who accuse this CD of being overly negative and dark and promoting suicide. If you actually listen to the lyrics in these songs, you will realize that they are ANTI-suicide (Waste - \\"I've f---ed up, I've had plans, it doesn't mean I should take my life with my hands\\"). Aaron Lewis isn't a negative person. Listen to this CD and you will notice that he is singing about redemption and self-discovery. It's sort of like, there's nothing left to complain about, so it's time to come to terms with these issues. There is a lot of positivity flowing around in this CD that I think A LOT of people missed, just because you never see Aaron Lewis smile. The title \\"Break the Cycle\\" itself is a positive message. I know I can't change your mind about whether you like this CD or not, but just realize what it really is and what message is trying to be put across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gosh Darn!","review":"I was very disappointed with this CD. It had one song I really liked, but the rest of the songs sound like Stone Temple Pilots, only, you know, not good.

The music industry is completely ruining EVERYTHING, everything being creativity, difference, talent.

Just because they are repeating the same grunge ... that was heard in the early 90's makes these guys great and full of talent? Oh, they write (boring) mellow music and that's suppose to make them great too right? Please, Staind is just a bland, boring and simple band with no creativity whatsoever. Why listen to this poor rip off early 90's Seatle grunge band when you can listen to the original? There's much better mellow music out there. Don't waste your time with these corporate, money stealing chumps here. One more thing Amazon.com, this is what you call alternative METAL? Staind doesn't come close to being metal in the first place! No heavy riffs, insane drumming, or original metal lyrics is not presented here at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just depressing","review":"Not only are the lyrics depressing, it's also depressing that this band actually makes money. Every song is packed with complaints. It's really repetetive and annoying. Why this band is so popular is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Power of Advertisement","review":"Complete ignorance and incompetence! These dudes have nothing in common with music. The reason they topped the charts is the good advertisement and the fact that most radio stations favoured the band. Trivial tunes mixed with apathic singing of a drug-addict were played on every radio 15 times a day. How do you expect the album not to be a commercial success then? In fact it is a full mess. Everything else but not music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will it ever stop?","review":"I cannot believe this current whiny trend in music. Of all of the current pop music, Staind seems to be the worst. All of this album is excruciatingly awful. I recommend that the members of this band find another line of work or quit whining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad For A Second Album","review":"As in the case with most bands such as Rage Against the Machine, Tool, Limp Bizkit, most bands tend to experement with their sound on their follow up album. Dysfunction was a hard hitting album for Staind. Songs like \\"Raw\\" are just plain awesome. Break the Cycle offers a toned down version of Dysfunction. In this album, there are alot more acustic tracks such as \\"Its Been Awhile\\", \\"Outside\\" and \\"Epiphany.\\" But the record still has the heavy songs that made Staind famous such as \\"Open Your Eyes\\", \\"Pressure\\" and \\"Can't Believe.\\" If you liked Dysfunction, I think that you will also like Break the Cycle. But be prepared to open your mind to the acustic sound of Staind. I believe that we will be seeing several more great albums from these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good, yo.","review":"I love this CD. It is filled with pain. Quite simply, it is by far their best piece of work. This CD has helped several people I know to deal with their problems. Buy it.

The Cure is great at it. Tool has taken the somber mood (not to mention musical complexity) and elevated it to a higher level. But Staind's 'Break the Cycle' is not much more than some very mediocre music supported by a professional whiner. All this guy does is whine and complain about his problems without one ounce of any sort of redeeming value. It's like being a fly on the wall at one REALLY LONG AND BORING THERAPY SESSION! I say hold off on the next record until somebody gets this guy some serious Psycho-Therapy and excessive amounts of various medications. Maybe it's me, but I just can't relate to much of the lyrics. And it's not because they are brooding and dark that I can't get into them. It's more like just sitting and listening to someone complain about their problems for like an hour. And who needs that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will good rock ever return?","review":"This is one of the worst hard rock/heavy metal albums I have ever heard. The pluses of it is that it does have 3 good singles - Its Been Awhile, Outside, and Fade, and thats about all the songs on here that are worth listening to, unless your depressed. There is no energy behind album, and by about the fifth track I am sick of hearing Aaron Lewis whining, not to diss Staind, but I thought there first album was 100 times better, and was expecting something more."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Personal Favorites","review":"Wow!! I got this cd for Christmas and I have been listening to it ever since. The lyrics may be a little depressing, especilly in \\"Open Your Eyes\\" but they really are amazing.

But if there was only one song I could listen to for the rest of my life it would definitly be \\"It's Been Awhile\\".Well to all of those who appreciate great music I say to you, Go Buy This Album!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD disappointed me very much","review":"After becoming a huge Staind fan after their album, Dysfuction, I waited and immediately purchased this album. I listened to it... and it ...(stinks). This album is practically the same song performed over and again. The speed, anger, and emotion of dysfunction is all gone. The band seems to have taken the song outside and its popularity a little far and produced a cd of watered down rock song that really ....(stinks). This is more of a pop-rock album that a hard rock album like dysfunction. Overall, this album was a waste of my money and i'm trying to get rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa","review":"Uh oh, here come the tears and the anger. Oh gosh, I'm depressed again. It takes more than detuned guitars and depressing power ballads to make a good album. You gotta get yourself a set of \\"spooky\\" contact lenses and some clown makeup to really make an impression. Will anyone remember Staind in 10 years? Eventually this \\"Nu-metal\\", depressing music will go the way of the hair bands. I can't wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop whining","review":"Aaron Lewis should seriously see a psychiatrist or something, due to all the whining about his life [being bad] on this album. Oh wait, then he wouldn't make millions off 12-year-old girls who think he's \\"cute\\" and can \\"totally relate to his problems\\" buying his album. I know you are all going to vote this review \\"not helpful,\\" and go on not paying attention to me, but if you're into angst rock, why not get into bands like Glassjaw and Jets to Brazil who can sing about their lives without sounding stupid? Or better yet, forget listening to some guy with an acoustic guitar crying, and actually FEEL the depression via Radiohead and Sigur Ros?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuning it down","review":"Anyone who was a fan of \\"Dysfunction\\" will definitely like \\"Break the Cycle\\" but I have to admit I was disappointed a little with this cd.First of all, every song sounds very similar to each other. and Mike Mushok's unbelievable guiar work in \\"Dysfunction\\"(on songs like Me, Crawl, and Spleen) isn't duplicated in here. he lost that great \\"sludge-ish\\" tone which i enjoyed so much. And it seems Aaron is talking about the same thing in every song with the possible exception of \\"Open your eyes.\\" but this is still a great cd and if you're a Staind fan, buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this review-BREAK THE CYCLE","review":"Only a 1,000 to say what I want about such a great CD. I don't think I can do it in just 1,000. I'll give it my best. I've long been a fan of Staind, every since I recieved Tormented (their first CD)as a gift. Dysfuntion was an awesome hit, and the CD gets my blood going. Break the Cycle is no exception. However calm ballads like Epiphany bring you down from your musical high. If you are a true fan you will connect with these songs, putting yourself with the lyrics. Many people call this CD soft, but there are songs such as open your eyes, Can't believe, For You, and Waste that more than heavy enough. If you want a mix of music in your CD then may I suggest you buy this CD. But buy it at Target, because they sell it for 11.99, and that's way cheaper. I got the last one at my Target, so get out their fast. Anyway. My hat is off in respect for such a powerful CD. Get this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Been Awile since I've heard a CD as good as this.","review":"BUY THIS! It is the best CD I have ever listened to since I got the Foo Fighters. Good Price, every song is great, personnaly, I think It's been Awile is going to get a grammy award. So BUY THIS CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell Happened?","review":"When I first heard Staind, I was mesmorized. Dysfunction was an absolutely amazing album. Their first release, Tormented, was even more amazing. Then I listened to Break the Cycle. This album is nothing but a bunch of MTV crap. I don't know what the hell Fred Durst did to this band, but he should be punished. This album does not have an iota of the intensity that was shown on the previous two albums. Anyways, save your money. If you want to spend it on something worthwhile, go get Lateralus by TOOL, or Statement by Nonpoint. At least these band still have some intensity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent music and lyrics","review":"Break the cycle was so amazing at first twenty listens; that I went out and bought an acoustic guitar. Staind has influenced me to explore my musical talents even further. I think this cd is one of the best of the nu-metal artists. Outside is my favorite song. The use of psychological lyrics makes this cd an orignal one of kind classic.DIO is my other favorite band. I can't wait to see DIO in concert; for his U.S. 2002 summer tour. His new cd is called Killing the Dragon. I think all the proceeds from the cd are being donated to the september 11 foundation. All you Staind fans will probably dig DIO."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best metal albums of 2001","review":"staind has successfully turned themselves into one of rocks most expressive bands. theyre unbelievably heavy guitar, led by peacefully melodic vocals makes them up there with system and tool. the angst in this music is unlike any other - any metal fan or even ROCK fan must own this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft, lame, sissy..","review":"Who in the world called this ''Hard Rock''?!???????????!!?

Poor excuse for a band. I can't believe these buttwipes take themselves seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY BROKE THE CYCLE ALRIGHT, THEY SOLD OUT!","review":"Staind latest effort is true rock formula, losing their style from their previous efforts of \\"Dysfunction\\" and \\"Torment\\".I think Fred Durst influence has ruined this band. \\"Break the Cycle\\" which is the #1 album in the country 2 weeks in row, I am sure will get word of mouth quickly with true Staind fans.This group has sold out to utter nonsense, sounding like every other MTV video rock band out there.All the songs are your typical formula sounding rock song with no stand out of creativity or imagination.But since the album has already sold over 1 million copies in just 2 weeks their next album will sound more like Backstreet Boys or 98 Degrees or who knows maybe they will really sell out, buff up, remove the tattoos and get Debbie Gibson, and Diane Warren to collaborate for some pop/ballads.If you want true rock that will be a classic get Tools latest \\"Lateralus\\"....end of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you think they're sellouts, you should read...","review":"I'm so sick of hearing about bands becoming sellouts, and now it's really becoming disturbing to hear fans of Staind refer to them like that. So a band changes directions musically...does that automatically make them sellouts? Obviously not if you're a fan of Tool (which by the way, Lateralus will become album of the year in my opinion) Staind's music does seem softer than Tormented and Dysfunction. But here's the newsflash..a lot of these songs, including Outside, where just acoustic ramblings that Lewis has been playing for a while, and now finally puts them on an album. Finally breaking free of Limp Bizkit (a true sellout) and going out into a direction that Staind has been pursuing in all their years together, it's good to see a really fantastic album out there that shows that Aaron Lewis is one of the best songwriters of our generation. They're not sellouts, and this is a great testement to how Staind can really perform."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.9 STARS...Can You Dig It?...","review":"I love this CD and I don't even listen to this type of music that much. If you like Limp [Bizkit] and Korn ETC. You'll love this. It is definetly worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The best cd out from staind yet. It's even better than dysfuction which is saying a lot. Fade and it's been awhile are the best songs, but don't overlook suffer or can't believe. Finally a rock band that sings and plays amazing music. My credits to you guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"big letdown","review":"i really liked staind's first album. it was catchy, hard, and intimate. this one just .... maybe thier brush with radio-play popularity made them hungry for more, because the songs on this album sound like they were made specifically for the radio. they are uninspired, uninteresting, and don't make me want to jump around or freak out in any way (except maybe in disgust). however, i'm glad my 14 year old little brother is listening to this instead of christina aguliera."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flop","review":"Break The Cycle, Staind's third album, is a fair stab at attempting to express Aaron Lewis' anger, depression and regret and to give young, disaffected listeners a chance to relate to it. However, this task more often than not seems a chore, trying to listen to Lewis' groaning, drawn-out vocals and often boring musical accompliment. Singles It's Been A While and Outside display Staind's style in a newfound maturity, wrapped in almost pretty melodies, but unfortunately these songs struggle to stand the test of time, and are not very durable. Personally I can relate to the lyrics, but I think that doesn't make the listening to of this album any easier. Despite occasional moments of radiance on Break the Cycle, I regret to say that it is probably not a worthy buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"I put off buying this CD for so long, mostly because I was sooo sick of hearing It's Been Awhile and Outside. Then I happened to hear Can't Believe and decided to give it a chance. Ya know, I'm glad I did, because this is a damn good album. It's full of seriously heavy and melodic music. Every member of Staind shows some musical expansion in their playing. Mike Mushok's playing is especially good. Sure, I'm still sick of Outside and It's Been Awhile, but they're still decent songs. Every other song is way better though. Nice to hear Aaron screaming again too. It's time to move on in the lyric department though. Enough already about the family problems. A few songs do get away from that theme, so it's not too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staind Break the Cycle/ Issues","review":"Ok i'am a new Staind fan and i first heard of them when listening to the concert version of Outside with Fred Durst which was amazing...anyway!I think theres been bad reviews about this album, but i thought it was amazing! I can play it over and over without getting bored! My favorite song has to be Epiphany.Theres so many issues raised in the songs if you listen carefully enought. Its a very well written and produced album and Staind deserve a pat on the back!! BUY IT!I'am off to buy Dsyfunction now lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This album is a bit boreing and really has no emotion. All the songs seemed contrived and seem to be pandering to the teen masses. Im sick of hearing how great this band is because they are boreing , listining to this album is like spending time in a coffin. I'm also sick of seeing this joke of a lead singer with his eyes three fourths shut moaning out his songs with total contrived emotion. This bands nothing overall and all in all there be gone soon enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bore me till I cry","review":"This album is extremely boring. Dismal, slow lyrics put me too sleep. How many more bands can possibly write about suicide and other depressing issues? Is everybody depressed these days or what? If you want some upbeat music, go with POD's new Satellite album. \\"It's been a while since I heard good musiiiccc from Staind....(Singing)....LOL!

Icouldn't get into the album straightaway but the more i listened to it the more i liked it. My favourite tracks on the album are, Change, Suffer, Fade, Safeplace and Waste. I am glad that i borrowed this album but i am unsure if i would buy any more of their material unless anyone could give me any recommendations"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"This album blows.

When other kids my age watch MTV or VH1 and see people like Lewis, Durst, or the guys from Linkin' Park and countless other rap/ rock bands, is that really what they want to be? Do they really look up to those guys? Depressed, ignorant, boring, and foul mouthed slacks.This is a terrible album, not worth anyones attention. It's the same insipid junk all the way through the album. I don't know why people would invest 17 bucks on something so montotonous, something so musically vapid. Think twice before you get this, and then do some searching in the record stores or on amazon. There are quite a few albums that sound alive, and burning. Yeah I feel teenage angst but I'm not gonna sit around pissed off about it, I'm gonna make something with it.Give it up all you \\"Nu-metal\\" bands and all you disciples of \\"Nu-metal. Don't get this. Lighten up."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd","review":"This is a good cd.

Some of the stand outs on this cd are \\"open your eyes\\", \\"pressure\\", \\"for you\\"(my favorite on the cd), \\"outside\\", and \\"waste\\". All of the songs on this cd are good. There are some softer slower songs and some heavier songs. Dysfunction is a little bit heavier but that doesnt matter. Get this cd its good. Ok buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Break The Cycle","review":"Yeah \\"Its Been Awhile\\" was one of the most overplayed songs of its year, but you have to admit when you first heard it you liked it to. Break The Cycle is an excellent album. More melodic and mellow then the bands previous release disfunction, yet still with a few hard hitting images of its success. My favorite song would be the wonderful acoustic \\"Epiphany\\". The lead singer of staind is an extremely powerful vocalist, you can feel the emotion he is portraying while listening to each track. The topics seem to never change though. obviously you can tell he had a bad childhood, but that seems to be the only thing he writes about. Despite all this, it is still a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"staind is epic","review":"can aaron lewis make you shiver with his songs???, um yea at least in my case, plus put a band of equally talented men doin guitars, backround vocals, and drums, you get a rock band legend in full tilt, not many other bands can make you think \\"wow thats deep\\" or \\"ive been there or felt that way\\" this cd is a guarantee you'll become a staind fanatic if u arent already"},{"rating":"2","title":"Staind does it again!","review":"I love Staind's music.

Other than \\"Outside\\" and \\"It's Been Awhile\\" this is an album full of songs that somehow seem familiar to the ears. Probably because groups like, Creed, Godsmack, Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Deftones have been playing these songs for years. If you are into those bands and love to hear Aaron Lewis scream for a whole song and call it quality music, then this cd is for you. I honestly feel cheated. What upsets me most is that \\"Outside\\" and \\"It's Been Awhile\\" were a hoax to get all the millions to buy a copy, and it worked. But there is only one or two songs other than those that is even decent. I'm sure if you're a diehard then buy it, but if you are looking for music with lyrics that really have meaning go somewhere else. This album is definitely my choice as worst album of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"best album of 2001","review":"Before this album I never listened to staind, to tell you the truth I never listened to rock music outside of Rage Against the machines.

With 5 Million sold Staind reached the mainstream world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slower, Quieter, Better.","review":"Torment and Dysfunction were good albums from Aaron Lewis and his band, Staind. But Break the Cycle is quite possibly their best effort. Fans on Dysfunction probably won't like the softer tones of Break the Cycle, and that's understandable. However, soft or hard, I don't see how you can't like this album. Songs like \\"Fade\\", \\"It's Been A While\\", \\"For You\\", and the wonderful \\"Outside\\" highlight a very diverse album that hits where the heart is. I do have to admit though, if you're expecting a heavy metal album, turn away now, because BTC is not gonna get your adrenaline rushing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staind sucks","review":"Staind is nothing but another crappy, unoriginal nu-metal band, along with Linkin Park, Trapt, Drowning Pool, andmany others.

For good nu-metal, listen to KoRn, Slipknot, Godsmack, American Headcharge, Tonight The Stars Revolt-era Powerman 5000, HED (pe), and Sevendust, and for real metal in general listen to Death, Pantera, Damageplan, Down, lacuna Coil, Crowbar, Slayer, Down, Exhorder, Megadeth, Venom, Anthrax, Sepultura, Soulfly, Machine Head, chimaira, old Metallca, Hatebreed, and Soilwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype!","review":"This band has to be one of the most overrated bands out there today.

Dude,get over it!The vocals are annoying.And the just to clarify this band is alternative, not metal. I suggest skip this band for those who have taste.If you want to hear some real metal check out bands like Annihilator, Overkill,Cradle of Filth, Exodus, Arch Enemy, just to name a few.

Three albums of increasing drivel is more than enough. Though I definitely like the major hit, \\"Outside\\", I can't find much else on this CD that feels in any way imaginative. It's especially upsetting to hear as many people as I do praising this album's lyrics. While I am glad to see people relating, i just think there's so much better, deeper lyrics out there.

Other words are written beautifully with no beat or tune to back them up.

Some music touches you- it seeps into your mind, your heart and being and becomes a part of you. When it stops, you feel you've lost a bit of you balance. It is oxygen. I have only heard two of the songs on this cd, but I am simply awed- but there is nothing simple about it. \\"Outside\\" and \\"It's Been Awhile\\" leave me in a calm state- it's as if someone is singing my heart. The strength of the emotions is heard in the heart wrenching lyrics and the beautiful melodies. They are two of the best songs I have ever heard- will ever hear. Buy this cd and be amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This album, although different, is just as amazing as the two before. I can't say enough good things about Aaron Lewis, and everyone needs to own this album.

I definitely recommend this version if, like me, you want to avoid the cursing on this CD (and there is some).However, not all the tracks have cursing in them (like \\"Epiphany\\" and \\"Outside\\"), which are also some of the best tracks on the CD, along with \\"Fade\\" (my personal favorite), and \\"For You\\". I give this a 4 out of 5, because I don't like every track on the CD (track 1, \\"Open Your Eyes\\" and track 12, \\"Waste\\", which uses the \\"F-word\\" repeatedly are the ones I dislike the most)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, lame. oh and I feel your pain mr eyebrow.....","review":"What in the world makes this band so great??

I popped it in, and the first song blew me away. I liked the studio version of Outside.(without Fred Durst in the back being annoying) But as I got to listening to it, I noticed some of the lyrics types were just of the same genre. I mean let's add a little something new to the lyrics. I heard diffrent music to the same lyrics of Dysfunction. But since I only listen for the music not for the lyrics I liked the CD. I just wanted to put a warning out to those people who like pay attention to words should watch out. But for die hard Staind fans . . .

Before that, I didn't know what this band sung. It's basically an \\"I'll know it when I hear it\\" kind of thing. It sounded more like a Spiderman soundtrack to me. The first song that I heard, but thought was alright was \\"Crawl\\" on the Scream 3 soundtrack. Breaking The Cycle is a little bit better than that.

All Aaron Lewis does in the whole album is whine about how horrible his life supposedly is when he's filthy rich off of this [stuff]. The music is so simple, it's not even funny. But the worst thing is the whiny vocals. Don't get me wrong. Dysfunction was nothing great either. But at least he didn't whine as much and some of the guitar was heavy. This is just dumb. It isn't dark, it's dumb. \\"Open your Eyes\\" particularly bothers me because what are the chances that he even cares about what he is singing about. He probably thought it would make him seem like a more meaningful lyricist but it doesn't. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"wasn't expecting much...and was blown away","review":"I borrowed this CD from a friend because they owed me one and they didn't have much else in their collection. I have to admit, generally this music is not my cup of tea...that being 3rd and 4th generation Pearl Jam/Nirvana derived self help therapy metal. I feel like so many bands post Nirvana simply rode this genre to its extremes, especially pretentious over-wrought...[stuff] like Bush and Creed. Well, I had to eat my words soon enough, because after a few listens I was hooked. Now after 10 or so listens I'm thinking this might be one of the best CDs of the year. I began to notice how the two hit singles are the worst songs on the album, as well as how the intelligence and honesty of the singer's lyrics are paired so well with beautiful harmonies, well paced and thought out guitar arrangements, and a level of songwriting that is above and beyond what is coming out of most nu-metal bands today.

But Staind's \\"Break the Cycle\\" has grown on me and I now really enjoy this album. I would have to say that every song is good except for the verse of \\"can't believe\\" but the song recovers with the chorus. I absolutely love \\"Epiphany\\" with it's dark and depressing mood, but very moving. \\"It's Been Awhile\\" is hands down the classic song on this album and is one of most perfect songs I've heard in years, blending great meaningful lyrics with very good music playing. The only downfall is when Staind decides to try and be like Deftones and other bands by playing as hard and as fast as possible. After hearing \\"It's Been Awhile,\\" and \\"Fade\\" you realize that the fast stuff is not their strong suit. They pull it off good however with the first two tracks, \\"Open Your Eyes,\\" and \\"Pressure.\\" But overall a very good album, we've heard this music before but why complain when it is done so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is \\"Refurbished,\\" not \\"New\\"","review":"This alternator is \\"Remanufactured,\\" which I put in the category of Refurbished.

I sent them, got signature confirmation on the package and they were signed for by the company. I heard no word from them and contacted them 5 times total from October 09 until now... I was completely ignored. I finally had to file a BBB complaint today. Yeah the shoes are nice IF THEY DON'T FALL APART.

It was money down the drain, and I am never buying Deer Stags again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable - High Quality","review":"I've never bought a pair of shoes on line before and I have no regrets. My previous pair of casual/dress shoes were also Deer Stag and they lasted me well over 6 or 7 years. The top part was still in great shape but the soles only last so long. This pair is very comfortable right out of the box. They appear to be the same high quality product and I won't be surprised to get several years of good wear out of them. They are nice looking and are very hard to scuff. My only complaint was the shipping that took abnormally long. It took several weeks to get them from the time I ordered them even though they were listed as being in stock. I would have given them a 5 had it not been for the service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Shoes","review":"These are very nice shoes, they last a long time and this is the second time I have purchased a pair.- Correction: These were very nice shoes and they used to be very well made, but they got \\"wise\\" with the materials and now they are horribly made with very bad synthetic materials.

I hope they return their shoes after a year or so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off","review":"The shoe is fairly comfortable and inexpensive, and looks good at first. I couldn't figure out why it was such a value but after wearing the shoe, it does not appear to be leather but rather some kind of plastic.

Back then, they were the most comfortable, high-quality shoes I had ever come across and they lasted years. Fast-forward to 2010, my beloved Deer Stags had finally worn out so I was thrilled to find them online at Amazon. What a disappointment! The drop in quality was immediately obvious as I got them out of the box. They weren't nearly as comfortable and within just a few months of sedentary office use, the outer shell was cracking and peeling badly. The sole also cracked and within 2 years, it was time to replace the entire shoe. By going cheap, Deer Stags has ruined a great product and their reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch.","review":"I bought these shoes because I've had good experiences with Deer Stags in the past. These shoes are not only plastic, but very painful to wear because they don't seem to break-in. I've worn these for the past 2 days, and the rear of the shoe cuts into your achilles tendon. Wore these shoes to work today and it was simply too painful to wear anymore. Will be returning these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kills the back of your ankle!

It did.I ordered these shoes for one of the most important interviews in my life. I was pretty happy with it when it got here, so I didn't think there would be a problem wearing them to the interview. On the morning of the interview, I ran for a bit to catch the bus, and noticed the increasingly more painful sensation coming from the back of my feet. I look and I see myself bleeding as the shoes scratched the skin above my Achilles tendon.Note that the shoes was NOT too tight for me. It was, in fact, 0.5 size bigger. Also note that I was not wearing thin socks, but rather athletic ones, and still the shoes made me bleed.Essentially, I just bought pain for $50."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shoe, Great Price","review":"This shoe is wonderfully comfortable and stylish.

The \\"powder\\" is more like sand, and just settles to the bottom of the water bowl after stirring. This might work for a dog (since they tend to make such a mess when drinking!), but my cat rarely ever reaches the bottom of her water bowl. I also tried mixing with applesauce, and then again with yogurt. It made a weird paste, and she just wasn't having it. (She doesn't like canned food, but that might be a good option for some.) If any cat owners have found a better way to deliver it, I would still like to give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riker gets off the bridge and into character","review":"While others have pointed out the surprising nature of this episode's hypothesis, the thing that impresses me most about \\"Future Imperfect\\" is how its premise allows for normalcy. The drama here is propelled by very ordinary concerns: fatherly instincts, the grief of a wife's death, and simple disorientation. Marina Sirtis, divorced from her normal psychobabble, provides an unusually sympathetic performance. And Jonathan Frakes is allowed to step outside his posturing bridge presence to display rather more individual concerns. The result is an episode which contains not only satisfying plot twists but more subtle acting as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"sheer unlimited creativity","review":"Another Club of Explorers under the supervision of Trent Gardner, exploring once again the boundaries of progressive rock. You just gotta love the musical genius that is Trent Gardner. There is no limit to his creativity. That is the thing that I love most about this album, the unlimited creativity put into it. It takes a few listens to get used to it though, but I promise you, you never hear the same album twice.This album is a little mellower that its predecessor, a little less metal. But there is more than enough music and solos to enjoy. Especially the second part of the album, more than 20 minutes of instrumental acrobatics that never gets boring. One thing that deserves special mention is the vocal performance of Steve Walsh (Kansas). That man has one powerful voice!Why only four stars? Well, I'd give it four and a half if it were possible, but I just like Magellans (Trent Gardners band) new album (Hundred Year Flood) better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giant Mammoth lays Giant Turd","review":"The first Explorers Club CD had some good moments, but face it, Trent Gardner cannot write a melody. His awkward writing style is even more evident on Raising the Mammoth.The last time I hated a prog CD as violently as this one was when I blew 25 bucks on The Collected Works of Schicke, Fuhres and Froehling. This is just aimless garbage that goes nowhere. The singers are listed as Gardner, Steve Walsh and James Labrie. Walsh sounds nothing like his Kansas days and the way he bellows now it sounds like he needs to clear some phelgm from his throat! Labrie, from Dream Theatre, is barely evident as he doesn't sing much in his signature high-regiser style. The three sing together often and their voices just do not blend together well. Sounds like a real mess!Everything about this disc just sounds \\"ugly\\" - the singing, the playing, the stupid melodies....ughhhh, save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but missing something","review":"I had some high expectations from this album after hearing the last one.

This urban legend (also brought up by other authors, such as Philip Kitcher) has made its way into newspaper articles and even textbooks. Catalogs of Darwin's library in the early 1900's and later made no mention of Mendel's paper. Instead, a secondary source by Focke that mentioned Mendel was in Darwin's library, with the relevant pages uncut.

So there will be even less interaction between user created apps and system because now Microsoft tells us to do everything through interpreter. Just like crippled Java does! But difference between stuff written in Java and C is that you know what your C application does, but you can never be sure about your Java application because there is interpreter between you and system, another buggy layer that controls you and that you cannot control.

Although the book contains specific code fragments, it is not a coding book. Rather it is a chronicle of Greenspun's experiences in setting up more than 50 Web sites over the years. This chronicle contains many hard-won lessons that will help prevent the reader from making similar mistakes.Greenspun has an easy-to-read writing style and a wry sense of humor. (The book has no CD ROM attached to the inside back cover but a picture of a CD ROM with the international \\"No\\" symbol overprinted. All code an more is available from Greenspun's Web sites, as you would expect from a book about Web sites.)

The author is obviously not a Microsoft fan (a lot of NT bashing) and he doesn't have much good to say about the Unix camp, or for anything else for that matter.The excessive use of sarcasm makes the book fun to read but it's obvious that the author has spent way too much time in the academia.If you don't know anything about web database publishing, after you read this book, you still won't. But it's fun reading and there's some good web secrets here and there. I enjoyed it anyway.The author is certainly a knowledgeable person and does a good job telling you what's wrong with the current tools. Unfortunately, he doesn't tell you how to fix them.

Woody Allen movies are always entertaining.A. Veretto The clearness of this video is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woody Allen gem.","review":"Husbands and Wives traces the trials and tribulations of two couples as they come to grips with marriage, separation, dating and reconciliation. This film is similar to previous Woody Allen efforts, with its emphasis on witty dialogue, New York locales and character driven story.The film delves into the varied reasons for marriage as well as the reasons for separation. As the couples break up and reform, we see that they don't know very much about marriage and they (like us) just have to muddle through as best as they can.You may find that you don't like the characters very much; they are the sort of people that one finds on any city street -- torn with doubts, not very happy but not very sad, they are \\"the average human\\" trying to make his or her way in an often bewildering world.My quibble with the film was the amount of hand held camera; while appropriate to the story, I found myself reaching for Dramamine on more than one occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUT OF COURSE!","review":"But of course this is a great film. It's very rare that Woody Allen has a dud. When I went looking for it I was really surprised to find it in the DRAMA section and after watching it I was even more suprised. Of course like every movie it had it's dramatical elements, but for the most part I felt it took everything pretty light....(even funnier I always thought Woody Allen's MANHATTAN should of been considered a Drama).......Anyhow the film is about two couples, who now after years of being married, start considering separating from their mates. It's a must see. It gives a real honest look into the minds and emotions of aging couples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish adults don't work Woody!","review":"Husbands and Wives is a film written, directed, and starring Woody Allen. I like Allen's insane writing but I just hated this 1992 drama with a passion. The characters are annoying, bitter, and childish to say the least. Judy Davis and Mia Farrow (in her last Allen film) are extremely unlikable in this film, you never root for them to find happiness. Juliette Lewis is the only actor who makes a good impression, her direct awkwardness is simply adorable. If you want a great Woody Allen film, try Annie Hall or Manhattan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Woody Allen","review":"Classic Woody Allen.

Buy this book only if you are well read in the history of the Vietnam war from many different aspects, but do not take it solely as factual from Russell's perspective as he admits he was stoned or spaced out much of the time whether in the field or in the rear on R&R.;We all suffered some psychological after effects from that damn war, but the vast majority of us got on with our normal lives after we got back to the world. Russell is hopelessly caught in his own time warp from Vietnam.

Instead of giving actual useable advice, Akbari leans toward the spiritual side, saying we should pray about having healthy hair. Honestly, I need to spend my prayer time with things that are a little more substantial, like paying the rent -I want concrete advice on how to take care of my hair.Aside from a total lack of useful information, the layout of the book is boring. I don't remember seeing any graphics, with the exception of the cover and Akbari's photo. This book seemed to serve as an advertisement for Akbari and her salon.A MUCH better book, I've found, is A. Dickey's \\"HAIR RULES!\\" it addresses topics such as how to determine your hair type, answers readers questions, and is a generally fantastic book (and it has lots of pictures, products and generally helpful advice for those of us with \\"interesting\\" hair.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I just finished reading Ms. Akbari's book and I had to let everyone know just how disappointed I am. This book seems to be nothing more than just common sense and a lot of self congratulation. It was vague on almost every point on which I wish she would have expanded, the actual information that she gave was very limited and she did not bother to illustrate (literally) any of her points.

The language and details of the book were very reader friendly.The most impressive part of this book is that IT WORKS!!! I started the seven week program Mrs. Akbari suggested in the book. I have done all of things the books mentioned, everything from \\"using a large-tooth comb and combing my hair from ends to root to detangle\\" to the most important point she gave \\"keeping the HEAT OUT\\", and it WORKS! Before Lisa's book I had severe hair shedding.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find information on the model's hair type anywhere within.Contrary to the title of the book, the author does NOT provide tips for \\"Any Hair Type\\". The author appears to assume that all Black women have only variations of kinky hair, which simply isn't so. Also, the author doesn't seem to realize that some chronic scalp conditions really DO need to be under the care of a licensed medical professional (seborrheic dermatitis, for example, which can get quite severe and require medical care).A waste of money, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake Up Call","review":"I'm so glad I read this book. She explains basic easy to follow hair care regimes that are applicable to locks and relaxed. She also explores myths, bad habits,and their origins. She talked about product requirements but I don't recall any specific product recommendations. I especially liked her thoughts on dandruff, daily care and the need for both moisturizers and hair oil.

This book provides valuable pieces to the hair care puzzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read w/ Straightforward Unbiased Advice","review":"The book is an easy read, the author's style makes it a page turner. At first I felt the author was taking too long to get to the point, but I realized afterwards that I was just impatient for the information. Each chapter is suitably placed and filled with the pertinent info, and the advice is straightforward and easy to adhere to.

This book did not teach me anything as that \\"negative\\" cleansing for me was done when I decided to go natural and accepted my hair. This book is definitely for those really, really needing the positive support and reenforcement about their hair.

However, Fred leads her to interactions with her downstairs neighbor, Alex, who is ten years younger than she and also happens to be an ER doctor. Their romance is typical Crusie with Nina worried that she's too old for Alex and Alex worried that Nina just seems him as a brother.

I will definitely be seeking out more of her works.I read the book in lightening speed because I was so caught up in the story. The humour added to the pleasure, and I just kept picturing Fred jumping through the window which in itself to me was comical (for those of you who have read it you will definitely know why).All the characters were likeable especially Nina. I did keep picturing Alex as this young frat boy type, but he was so good to Nina that his age became a non-issue. It is good to see an older woman attracting a younger man for a change rather than vice versa.Very good reading!

There's not much to add with what everyone else said, but what I loved about this book was how lovable Nina, Alex, and Fred are. Nina, a recent divorcee, moves to a new place and decides she needs a companion, so she gets herself a 14 year-old dog, which she promptly named Fred. Fred amused me. He loves oreos and a certain bra, but more importantly, he's the one who brought Nina and Alex together. Alex, an ER doctor, tries to find a way to convince Nina that they are good together, but it's hard for him to do so when Nina thinks he's just a kid--though he is 30 to her 40.

Written in a straight-forward text that is ideal for the non-specialist general reader, perhaps the most telling point is that when John Clayton, a second-generation atheist, credentialed scientist, and experienced educator, set out to disprove the Bible from a scientific perspective, he ended his six-year study with a profound faith in the God of the Bible and the determination to share his findings and insights with others through the pages of The Source."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author does not know what he is doing when it comes to Science and Math","review":"Well I didn't read the whole book, just the first few chapters where he tries to come of with a number for Human inhabital planets in the Universe.

The Author clearly does not have enough of a Science or Math background to write a book like this where he tries to prove things using science and math.I have wrote this book off as a complete JOKE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DUDE 420 YO!!!","review":"Ok, I got this disc and the release show, they were the headliners.

After hearing their song \\"Bossman\\" I thought this was going to be a great new band entering the alternative world. But after listening to a variety of their songs I feel as if Lucky Boys Confusion is a boy band (ie. Backstreet, Nsync) trying to be alternative, or visa-versa. Try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"this albumn got so many of my friends hooked","review":"I dont even have to play this whole cd for my friends in order for them to fall in love with the band. The cd is awesome, there's lot of emotion and great lyrics, they know how to rock. The CD is very diverse, and every song is awesome, there isnt one track i dislike. This cd best shows what LBC is like, it has some of there older songs on it, but with a different sound quality. I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a regular in my player","review":"This CD deserves 10 out of 5 stars. It is probably my favorite CD in my whole collection, followed by the other LBC cd's. This CD has it all, everything from Punk, to Reggea, to Ska, to Hip-hop. This band is incredibly versatile, and deserves much more recognition than they get. Its not everyday that a CD comes out that I can listen to all the way through without skipping a track. I never skip tracks on this CD, they are all awesome! When I first got this CD, I dont think it left my CD player for at least a month, and it goes back in all the time.You really do need to check this CD, and the rest of the LBC discs out, they are well worth anything, you will be amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD...Must have for LBC fans.","review":"This CD is awesome.

They're from Naperville, i'm gonna be a senior next year at Naperville Central, where two of the band members graduated from. The references to the \\"gravel lot\\" and the \\"rent-a-cop\\" in one of their songs(i can't remember which one, sorry), are definate references to central, as the gravel lot is on west st., for those of us who either dont have senior parking or just dont want to wake up that early to get parking on hillside. the rent a cop is just that guy who goes around the school, just an average rent a cop. anyway, BUY THIS CD NO MATTER WHAT!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are awsome!","review":"I bought this cd after hearing them from a friend.

I liked this cooler in particular because (1) the price - much lower than other coolers I had seen in retail stores and (2) the size - I was just going on a roadtrip and I only needed to store some waters and beers. This cooler perfectly fit behind the front seat on the floor in my corolla. It also stores 22 oz beers standing up. There are two issues that I would note for this cooler - (1) you have to be careful when closing it to make sure the lid seals and (2) my ice melted in it after one day - this was fine for me because I only needed it for one day, but if you are going on a longer trip, then maybe a more expensive cooler would do the trick.

I give it at least an A for a variety of things. It also should be noted that this is an indie flick, and an indie flick done really well.Impulse has the ability to be nominated for an award; Willa and Angus both have an amazing acting ability and really do shine in this film. Overall, the plot is crafted well. The script is great and the movie really brings out suspense and emotion.Overall, a great film. However, the ending could have been longer and more specific. With that said, Impulse is one of the best thriller/suspense films to come along...in a long time!A film for everyone, but beware there is nudity, but don't buy it for that as the film all together is amazing.Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A glowing perspective","review":"In this discerning and somewhat humorous essay, Virginia Woolf remarks on humanity's experiences with illness, whether mental or physical, and on how it is rarely the subject of literature or art. She notes our contradictory nature toward sympathy and offers an opinion about what illness tells us about the natural world. Hermione Lee's fascinating introduction firmly places this remarkable work in the context of Woolf's life and writing.

His work radiates with tremendous compassion and tenderness, all the while, it is bursting with boundless bravery of spirit and a couragous journey of adventure.A craftsman such as Curiale is such a blessing in these difficult times.

It also contains soy, which is an ESTROGEN! I just bought these for the extra protein, but if I were a guy interested in building muscle, the last thing I'd drink is something with (essentially) estrogen in it (which, by the way, is also bad for women to consume, unless you like cancer). Even if you don't find the taste as foul as I do, do some research before you consider eating hormones (i.e., soy).

Entire sections will be printed with a blue background, for example, that look more like a special topics box then text. In several cases the text reuses its stock photos in several unrelated sections. The text illustrates points that clearly do not need illustration (Do you know what water looks like? There is a photo of it if you need it. ) and ignores others (the beta and alpha linkages of glucose) after dicussing them.

I had forgotten 'whodunit' so it was like watching it for the first time all over again.

The acting sucked, the huge fat landlord guy was a nasty guy in lots of ways (trying to get some from a kid, lets be serious here; thats a horror movie in itself...nasty). But overall the movie is too predictable...until the 'shocking' plot twist when you find out who the real killer is, then the natural reaction is pretty much \\"what the hell did I just miss?\\" In my opinion, don't do more than read the reviews on here. If you want a fairly good movie along the same lines...sorta...try to rent Session 9 first. I thought it was alot better, but that might just be my opinion, so RENT it dont buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An important topic, but a disappointing collection.","review":"There is a desperate need for more dialogue on queer religiosities. I wish I could endorse this book as an effort to connect queer identity with buddhist practice.Unfortunately, this book displays almost no consciousness of the class oppression, racism, and sexism that create the conditions that allow for homophobia to exist. This is a shame because the buddhist insight of interconnectness could speak so eloquently to these connections. But ultimately it seems this is a book written by and for privileged white males.For those desperately seeking validation of their sexual orientation, Queer Dharma may provide affirmation. But the true dharma is intended to challenge us beyond our own limited identity and privilege. This book deserves credit for taking the initial steps to establish dialogue, but it could have been much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"This is an excellent CD. Although, the label indicates the CD was scientifically designed for helping someone sleep. I can't see that.

It's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful Music!","review":"A relative of mine sent this music to me right after I lost my Mother to cancer.

Just wait until you listen to this music, you'll agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"Honestly I think I was expecting more than I got. BUT I do like it. The music is calm and relaxing, but it didn't exactly knock me out. That being said, I think my cd player is partly at fault. If you notice, people have different reviews as to the balance of the background vs piano, vs other things. That has to do with your player. I have a cheapy cd player in my room, and the background is really quiet, too quiet. On my pc, which is light years better though still cheap and cheesy, the sound is much better. I don't know if the sleep inducing part is affected by the cd player, but I suspect it is. I'm soon in the market for a new player though. Mine gave out a couple weeks ago, so when I get some extra cash, I'll try it again.

The fact that a good portion of Tools fans thought theleaked release was fake when it was infact the real album speaks volumes. However,it's not all bad, the first two tracks are quite good, but then a 30min snoarfest ofsome half-baked Floyd inspired barbituite of a song takes over.

But like all Tool, the only criticism is that there just isn't enough of it.I struggled with giving this CD 5 stars, b/c Tool is clearly one of the best metal bands out there, but this CD just had too many spots where I had to skip tracks while they took their time playing soft artsy stuff. Don't get me wrong, love the art, just like the more head banging kind and when you're trying to work and listen to fast music, the soft stuff is a bit of an annoyance. For that I give it 4.5 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex and more abstract than previous albums.","review":"10,000 days is the most abstract and least approachable Tool album. Though I am a die-hard fan, it took longer (few days vs. few hours) to absorb than past albums. It's an amazing journey of an album. My girlfriend, newly introduced to Tool, likes their older work better. To her, the latter albums, Lateralus and 10,000 days, sound 'more the same'. I know better and at the same time I know what she means, hence my comment of 'least approachable'. Not a condemnation - I've given the album 5 stars. I like that the band has chosen to evolve it's music. I think is is necessary for timeless bands to do so - Led Zepplin and the Beatles, for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"Yet another classic entry from Tool. Pretty much everything has already been said about the merits of this album. The harder songs like Jambi, Vicarious, the Pot, and Rosetta Stoned meld really well with \\"softer\\" and more ambient songs like intension, and the brilliant Wings For Marie part 1 and 2. Right In Two is also a great song. This album probably has a greater array of emotions represented than any of their previous works. Gets better with every listen, and I can not FRIGGEN wait to hear this material on tour with all the old Tool classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes more than one listening to adapt to","review":"This CD has been criticized for containing lots of filler and what not, but this so called \\"filler\\" is all part of the genious if you ask me. Some relatable songs from this album to other Tool songs on other albums could be 46 & 2, Hooker w/ a Pen15, Reflection, Parabol, Disposition, The Grudge, and a faster paced Schism for the song 'The Pot'... in a way. This entire CD is really unique on it's own level. Entirely original material makes for a VERY different listening experience, but still sticks to traditional Tool sounding drum beats, guitar riffs, and bass guitar riffs. Keenan goes to the limit on these lyrics, ranging from people's mentality towards violence (Vicarious), and a man who visits Area 51 (Lost Keys/Rosetta Stoned) which is pretty funny if you looks up the lyrics.Overall, I'd have to reconmend this CD to any Tool fan, or non-Tool fan, and this excellent addition to any CD collection gets a solid 5/5 from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"really Corny","review":"I can understand Tool Fans of the past getting excited about a New Album,but this Album feels like it was just thrown together&has no balance or reasoning at all. the songs just are kinda there&nothing seems fully fleshed out&just feel like a re-cycling of past Tool material that is way better than this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"666 reviews before me","review":"666 reviews so far...6/6/06 I'm having my knee surgery...and I'm not even superstitious!This album is still growing on me.

Here's my membership card and please throw it away. Theres no message and there isn't anything worth listening to either. Maynard is so self-N-\\"dull\\"-gent on this disk and it is a shame that the other 3 musicians are even a part of this band. Just write some music with character or at least put forth some effort.

This is by far the worst tool album ever. I have loved tool since there first album and I couldn't believe they made me wait 5 years for this garbage. Maynard is almost totally absent on the album and when he does sing it is weak and pathetic. I guess those years with a perfect circle just took every last bit of talent he had left. If this is the quality of music tool is going to make now they should just break up and save them selves the embarrestment. If I wanted a crappy perfect circle album I would have bought one.

Live with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"10,000 Tears","review":"I have loved Tool since there first album. It seems to me that since the birth of A Perfect Circle, the aggressive and dynamic sound of Tool as slowly dwindled away. Of course, this is my opinion, since I like heavier music. Lateralus, to me, was a huge let down. Very long and boring, except for Schism, Ticks and Leeches, The Grudge. I read online that this album was going to be heavier than Lateralus. I was very excited when I heard this and looked forward to the new album. Sad to say, this album is anything but heavy. Don't get me wrong, I do like Vicarious and Jambi, but that's it. 2 songs on the whole album. Half of the album is soundscapes and instrumental. The other songs are long, slow, and boring. I wanted to like this album as much as anyone else, but I just can't. I guess all the qualities I loved about Tool in their first 3 albums are no more. Sad but true. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CATCH 22","review":"RIGHT IN TWO IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE BEST TOOL SONGS EVER!WHO CARES THAT EVERYBODY IS BASHING THIS ALBUM...THERES ONE REASON FOR IT...THE WAIT.

THEN WHEN IT DOESN'T FIT YOUR IMAGINATION, YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED! THATS THE CATCH 22. IF THIS WAS RELEASED 3 YEARS AGO PEOPLE WOULD BE HOLLARING CLASSIC!

I had so many expectations that i figured i was gonna be disapointed. However, I havent stopped listening to it since i bought it. You really have to appreciate the smaller, finer, musical points of the album to really grasp the amazingness of it.On the song 10,000 days, the musical suspension builds up for about 5 minutes and then releases pure ecstasy for the ears. On Rosetta stoned, the drum rythym and beat are absolutely astounding and like they do best, tool puts you in a music trance until maynard screams you out of it. There slowest and softest album musically, 10,000 days is a must for any tool fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniquely Tool","review":"I've been listening to this CD quite a bit over the last week and I think it rocks. It is what you would expect from Tool and I am satisfied with new material, period. When you're starving for product and you like the band what's not to like? I wouldn't say it's the greatest CD ever or crap like that, but I like what I like and that's good enough for me. No need to get all analytical about it or post a Tool dissertation to showcase my scary intellect. To all the genius OGT hookers with penises out there who are \\"dissappointed\\" (sic) with this record I say, go find another band that you can brag about to your friends that you \\"discovered\\" and quit whining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unmistakably TOOL","review":"So far my favorite song is track 10. It delivers everything Tool stands for for me. Hypnotic layering ultimately reaching a plateau of some of the most hair raising rock. It's a technically sound cd (almost said album). The mix is incredible. It really does look like they were messing in Eddie Munster's basement as the trippy cover art indicates. They came out with something unparalleled by any other group in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepy Tool - Not Worth 4 Yr Hiatus","review":"This album is ok for Tool, it has like 3 good songs, but the rest is mostly the ambient/experimental stuff that they used as filler before. On 10,000 days, there are only 5 actual songs out of 11. Opiate was a good, raw start to Tool's music. Aenima was in my opinion their best, full of mysterious ambient rock songs. Lateralus was a very impressive album, very precise and uniquely stylish. 10,000 Days kind of sounds as if Tool just spent a couple of weeks in the studio rehashing the styles of Lateralus and Opiate together...not very impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"tool fans are like terrorists.","review":"\\"\\"\\" Tool's \\"filler\\" is better than 99% of every other bands so called hits. Unless anyone has figured out how to raise Bonzo from the dead and give Plant his voice back I don't think we are going to get anything better than the Tool for another 20 years! Soooo eager masses, bow down and gather all the crumbs that Tool allows you to have and be thankful. \\"\\"\\"\\"Maynard: \\"think for yourself, question authority. believe in nothing. bow down to nothing\\"and we have this clown doing just that. how ironic. tool preaches speculation. amidst all the discourses the fanatical rabid bent-over fans strengthen their already blind faith.how ironic.by the way. the album after repeated listens gets worse and worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"No hidden messages here...","review":"I'm not looking for another Opiate, Undertow, or Aenima. I thought they were only associated with each other because they were made by the band Tool. I listen to Tool albums because they are aggressive, creative, and kicked some as*. I buy Tool albums to enjoy that aggression and creativity. I groove to it. I like a beat with a little anger on the side and some creative lyrics to compliment it. 10,000 days just doesn't have it. Period. Keep trying to tell yourselves that it does. Bow down to your gods if you must. Maybe you fanboys should try giving your true opinions. You might actually be heard. Don't worry, you won't hurt their feelings...you already gave them your money.So shut up and buy my new record!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Tool Album Ever","review":"Guys,First off, I enjoy all of Tool's previous albums. Are you listening to the same album I am? If you guys actually listened to the music \\"deeply\\" you would realize that almost every song on this album is a recycled riff from one of their previous albums. And the lyrics are miserable too, save for 10,000 days/wings for marie combo. Ive also listened to the album over 15x to try to have something resonate here, and honestly I would not do that for any other band besides Tool because I know how their albums work.Therefore we have no artist progression, boring segues, and terrible lyrics. Listen to Maynard and think for yourself; this album stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Tool disappointment","review":"This album in no way lives up to any of their previous albums.

For some reason, each time they release something I'm in the mood for it. Each album is 'timely'. This is no exception. Just different enough from the last for me to be totally into it. I can literally listen to Vicarious, Jambi and The Pot ten times in a row. This is really an amazing band. I guess being 30 now, I appreciate them more now then I did when I was 17. It's been a great ride and I hope it continues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool does it again...","review":"It's everything I expected from Tool and more.No big surprises on this one, but that's not why we listen to them is it. There's plenty of energy, hard driving riffs and complex arrangements executed with precision the way only they can deliver. There are also plenty of what some call filler but are truely spiritual meditations. Try zoning out to them and see where the merkaba takes you. The real extra here is the packaging, stereoscopic images with it's own viewer built right in, amazing. I thank Tool for preserving the lost art of album design."},{"rating":"2","title":"another mind blowing tool cd !","review":"for those who have read all the bad reviews and are in a bit of confusion.. relax. those people dont know what thier talking about, they are way chained to the past. what tool did is bringing something new like always.loved all the tracks, creative and powerful, yet the cd only misses one extra track.. it felt real short ;(paving this fact.. this is one of the best cds this year so dont miss it !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad, depressing, and brilliant","review":"While not as powerful Aenima or as epic as Lateralus, this Tool album is still amazing, to say the least.

To my suprise, I was excited over nothing at all. I didn't think it was even possible for Tool to put out such a bad album. Words can't describe how terrible this album is. I wanted to like it, so I listened to the album at least 10 times around, it never grew on me. The people that give this album a good rating are blinded by what Tool has done in the past. Instramentals are extremely weak along with the vocals. Nothing flows, everything sounds forced. The first time I heard Vicarious I thought It sounded amazing, but each time after that it sounded worse and worse. It just is missing something (and this is by far the best song on the album). If an unknown band wrote this music, no one would ever sign them (local underground bands have better music). I havent' been this disappointed over an album since Metallica released Saint Anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five years for this???!!","review":"I love tool, but after aenima they ran out of steam. Lateralus has it's moments and so does 10,000 days, but they're both disappointing, even more so on 10,000 days. How can they take 5 years to release an album that only has 5 or 6 \\"actual\\" songs on it!! Vicarious is a rehash of Schism, does Tool really think we're idiots? When Tool release their next album in 5 years, I think I'll just hang on to my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very disapointed","review":"Pros: When the songs started rockin they were as good as Tool has ever been. Heavy and caotic. It's what you expect from Tool. Very musical.Cons: %25 hard rock. %75 intro/sound effects. You know how Tool has some long intros before the song gets going? Some of the songs were just intros that never built to the song. Just tracks where the instruments played the same thing over and over with voices in the background. There was a stupid song that was just tribal voices that never turned into anything. Followed by a track of sound effects. You'd think that they could've wrote more than 6 or 7 actual songs in 5 years. track 10 came and I was thinking, \\"Okay 2 more songs to change my epinion.\\" Track 10 was great. Track 11 was just dumb sound effects.Maybe someday they'll release a greatest hits cd with their best songs. Then you won't have to waste money on a cd that is half sound effects that they thought were cool. I want to hear music when I buy cds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing...","review":"this cd was ok. most of the songs are 8, 9, or even 10 minutes long and there aren't any discernable choruses or anything catchy about them. normally i like that kind of stuff but this went waaaay to far with the jams. i think that some of these songs could have been cut down. plus most of the guitars sound the same on everything song. they almost sound like something meshuggah would have wrote. maynards voice sounds weird too. like on \\"the pot\\" i didnt even realize that it was him singing on it. there were only four songs on here that i really liked. 10,000 days, the pot, vicarious, and right in two were the only ones i could get into after a few listens. i know that this probably going to just get a lot of hate from all the tool fans but o well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, this really isn't good at all.","review":"What happened to these guys?My opinion may be a little biased seeing as i am just not into them anymore. It's hard to follow up an album like AEnima. SO naturally i was very dissapointed in Lateralus. I had some high hopes for 10,000 days but no good. I like Lateralus better.. All the senseless filler they do now, every song has to be 10 minutes long and they have to throw in as many parts and tempos and time signatures into one song as they can.. The result is just a bland blend of prog rock. I haven't been able to stand Maynard since Perfect Circle, the music is just too much.. Hooker With a P+nis off of Aenima was great. Heavey hook, solid length and a great song. Now, they are just trying to pull off the AEnima production with lower quality hooks and songs... Tool's gone, forget about them.Oh and thanks guys! see you in another 7 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"First off I'm a huge fan of all their other albums but this one just sounds like no effort was put into it. I'd say a good 75% of the album is just weird droney ambient noise or repetative generic Toolish riffs. The whole album to me is a big F*** you to their fans. I was so excited when I heard this was coming out and eargerly waited just to be disappointed by this pile. After a 5 year break you'd think they'd have some good ideas or a desire to create something amazing like their other albums. This just sounds like a sub par band doing a Tool impression. Lame guys lame.TOOL is dead to me, I hope Maynard chokes on the millions of dollars they make off this miserable excuse of an album.I only gave it 1 star because you can't give it negative stars. If you must buy this, get it used off ebay so they don't get any more money off this turd."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"Tool are alleged to be one of the favorite band of Robert Fripp, founder of King Crimson, and I am a HUGE admirer of his. Unfortunately, after listening to this, all I can say is \\"Huh?\\" Some complicated time signatures, some odd chord progressions (and odd chords!) but BORING BEYOND BELIEF!I though I had to be missing something, ao I went back and listened to some of the rest of the catalog. ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS BORING. If the only thing about these guys that keeps you awake is the sound level, pick up a remaindered copy of Lou Reed's \\"Metal Machine Music\\".Not one of these songs could come close to Crimso, even at their most paisley."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad it made me mad","review":"First, I acknowledge that Tool is the best band in the world. That just makes this CD that much more disappointing.There are 2 half decent songs on this CD, the rest is annoying, nonsensical, repetitious, grating noise.

I'm all for artists stretching their range to try new things, to achieve new sounds... but Evanescence is already a band (and an extremely one dimensional, poorly made one at that). My point is Maynard sounds like the screaming banshee from the 12 year old's favorite fleecing of America's youth channel... MTV.Why Maynard?

What I hear on 10,000 Days, and Lateralus, is four musicians standing at the front of the stage, all doing solos at the same time and trying to one-up each other. The lyrics and Maynard's voice have become melodramatic. The only time they sound good on this latest album is in the song \\"The Pot.\\" In this song Maynard does sound good with his new style, and the instrumentation is not meandering individually, each looking for the limelight. Otherwise, they are trying to be too sophisticated, too deep. In my opinion their best was undertow and Aenima; Aenima being one of the best albums of all time.In short, they have sacrificed their edge for melodrama"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you buy this album you are a tool.","review":"First of all this review is not meant for the die-hard nonthinking Tool fan because I know that you picked up this album the day it dropped. I already know how Maynard changed your life and expanded your simple horizons, as I've heard this argument from every other \\"unique\\" Tool fan. Spare me your time. As for the album, the songs are one-dimensional, static, repetitive, and the lyrics are surprisingly sophomoric. Nothing on the album even seems to stand out. The only thing that keeps this album from getting generic radio airplay is the fact that most songs are too long for public broadcast. This album is everything that Tool musically stood out against.The worst part of all is that much like Lateralus, the only worthwhile part of this album is the packaging. Unfortunately, a pretty package,unlike a musical masterpiece, can only entertain you for about ten minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tool returns... to the exact same sound they left too...","review":"Well, this is a good album; however, this is a cookie cutter Tool CD. I like it that bands have a unique sound, and are affraid of venturing off in fear of being called a sellout (Everygreys new CD is a prime example of that, brilliant yet people call them sellouts.) This Album is nothing new, and didn't live up to what I expected from such brilliant musicains on a LONG hiatus. Very moderate Album all in all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why 1 star? because tool fans are rabid","review":"listening to tool doesnt make you an intellectual. infact it makes you a pseudo intellectual goon.furthermore i just love seeing snotty kids walking around the malls with this album stuck on their faces. they look so damn stupid peering through the magnifying glasses.thankyou for your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Phantom Menace of metal","review":"I owe this one a few more listens but I don't think it'll do any good. Overall it's lazy and rather boring, which is a huge disappointment, considering how much I loved Lateralus, especially its more progressive passages. I'm all for long expansive prog explorations (PINK FLOYD, PORCUPINE TREE, SUBARACHNOID SPACE, GYBE), but the long, samey passages and filler on this record really go nowhere. Even the crescendoes, which take an eternity to get to, lack any real catharsis. Aside from (sadly familiar) high points like Vicarious or The Pot, listening to this has been a real chore. Too bad. 2.25/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY THE BEST","review":"Interesting reading the various blogs on this group. The fact that there are close to 1000 opinions means something.

Vicarious is a great track followed by aimless rambling tracks that never seem to end soon enough. Time to stop experimenting with mellow and strange concepts and get back to rock!

You might even consider Lost keys/Rosetta Stoned to be the best on the album; none of the real songs are at all weak. The lyrics at some points aren't Maynard's best, but they are at some points thought provoking. Right In Two is the highlight of the album for me, but every song is high quality. The album is probably the least hardcore that the band have released, but in some ways this is a good thing, adding excellent variety to their catalogue. A worthy purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's got its good points","review":"I found this album to be incredibly weak to be a Tool album. I have to agree with the reviewer from Littleton, Co about it not being a very good Tool album.

The stereoscopic lenses provided an extra bonus that as far as I can remember it's the first time I have seen it in an album case; hence quite original. Overall, I rate the album 5 stars because it is still Tool, maybe not at its best but Tool nonetheless. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Your Mind","review":"I think the most important thing to keep in mind about this album is that it is NOT Lateralus, it is NOT Aenima, it is NOT Undertow, and it is NOT Opiate. 10,000 Days is it's own entitiy. Its 10,000 Days. Before listening to the album you need to remove your preconcieved notions of what you THINK it should be, based on the other albums. Many people try to compare it to Lateralus but you can't do that. When Lateralus came out everyone stated that there was nothing to compare it to and that still remains. 10,000 Days should not be compared to anything but itself. Whenever a new Tool album comes out I generally have to listen to it repeatedly for a period of time before the subtle complexities and sheer gravity of the album sink in. The same is with 10,000 Days. I think that after listening to it over a period of time everyone who doubts the amazement of this album and think Tool have feel off will come to realize what a phenomenal album it truelly is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Disappointment","review":"What happened? Perhaps the most disappointing album to come out by one of my favorite bands in a long time. Imagine Tool's 'Lateralus.' Now imagine all the passion, instensity and general awesomeness completely stripped away from the album and you basically have the depressingly inadequate '10,000 Days.' The first four tracks are absolute masterpieces, featuring some of the best musicianship and arrangements ever done by Tool, in particular 'Wings for Marie Pts. 1&2.' Beyond these songs, however, the content is almost non-existent. Whether it be the short soundscapes of 'Lipan Conjuring' and 'Lost Keys' or the ridiculously awful 'Roseta Stoned', the latter half of the album completely flounders. Maybe next time Maynard..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A release","review":"For the first listen, I went into a farmer's field, ate a handful of shrooms, turned on the headphones and sat back to watch the show.It's not a CD you can really enjoy but rather experience. It's about as pretty as 10 week roadkill and as inspiring as dieing.Vicarious, for example, is not a song to listen to... just put it on and hear it. That's because it's not even musically pleasing, it just builds anxiety, which makes the end of the song that much better as a release.A lot of the album is like that. Instead of using dynamics of quiet to loud within a song, Tool goes from dull songs to bright moments to highlight the bright blasting climaxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legacy Lives On","review":"After SIX years of \\"well worth it\\" wait, finally, good music!!! Tool has always been #1 on my list, because they actually put thought, melody and effort into thier music.

There are alot of tracks that aren't even songs, just indian chants or stupid stuff like that. The 3-4 songs that actually are songs on this album are good but the other 45 minutes is really poor. The 3D effects on the covers are really great though, maybe they thought they had to do something to sell this record, so well give it a fancy cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"For a Tool album, this is utterly unoriginal and bland. Completely self-indulgent, it comes off as a grandiose prog-jam session by a bunch of otherwise extremely talented musicians who figured they could showcase their technical abilities instead of playing good, hard, emotional music.I had originally considered \\"Lateralus\\" as the album that turned me off to Tool, but that album comes off as a classic compared to this one.Oh well, at least we can credit Tool with creating the whole mallcore genre. Thanks a lot guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jewel Case Has More Lasting Interest","review":"I really enjoyed the 3d jewel case. I really enjoyed the first track.

I like instrumentals, but this album really only has a handful of actual songs.... the rest of the album is pretentious, self-indulgent garbage. I cant believe all the positive reviews the tool slaves gave this album. Its been how many years since Tool released their last boring CD ? What is it; 6 years or so.And the packaging is a gimmick. Oooooh, its so trippy (sarcasm, DUH !). Give me a break. The CD \\"case\\" will no doubt show a lot of wear in a few years. Do they think about how the packaging will erode over time ? I guess not. They probably think the cool packaging will entice fans (sheep) to buy this; and they are probably right.Sorry folks, but the members of this band arent anywhere close to \\"gods\\" that you make them out to be. They are just simple men making music. To call them or any indiviual member a \\"god\\" is downright pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is just not that good","review":"This album starts off great with Vicarious and Jambi, then pretty much goes downhill from there, until Right In Two. The rest is mediocre at best (The Pot, Rosetta Stoned), or just plain garbage (Wings for Marie, Lipan Conjuring, Lost Keys, Viginti Tres).For me, Tool has always shown a progression, or evolution to their music. And it has always made some kind of emotional statement to me, a connection. I personally and not finding either in this album.It really pains me to be writing this, as I wanted to give this 5 stars, as I would every other Tool album. Unfortunatly, this album does not merit it.That having been said, the packaging of this album is friggin incredible. The artwork is amazing, and alone is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"<3","review":"I love tool. and this cd was great. Would deffently buy this again.

I was heavily anticipating this album for years, and I can still remember how moving I found this album to be on its first listen. If you buy this, do yourself a huge favor and read the lyrics. Wings for Marie, Rosetta Stoned, and Right in Two will blow your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jambi is worth the price alone.","review":"unbelievable cd. Tool are the masters. You really don't need much more than this and I thought Pink Floyd Rocked. Please make sure and pich up both of Puscifer's cd's also, v is for you know and Conditions of my Parole. I am lucky enough to live in Prescott AZ so I am close to where they record this gold. This is what your ears where made for along with your childs asking for food or love.....:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool is back!!!","review":"This is the sound that I loved from their earlier albums. They are back with the disgracefully powerful messages that got them into the spotlight. While in Best Buy, I saw this album and it was recommended by a passerby as \\"The best Tool album you will ever buy.\\" With such an astounding boast, I had to give this a try. I am not at all dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tidy by any means","review":"10,000 Days I think was surrounded by too high of expectations, and I'm very guilty of that myself. There was so much speculation going into it (decoy albums, fake song titles, a second release in late summer (?), hidden messages, etc.) and all of it was just so far fetched that people were without a doubt disappointed with the final product. But after you let go of what it \\"should\\" have been, and embrace it for what it is, you'll find this to be just as good as Aenima and Undertow. I don't think it surpasses Lateralus, or even Aenima, but its nestled right on the same line as Undertow and Opiate, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I listened to nothing else for 1 year...","review":"...after the release. I saw them play this in concert 8 times, including once at City Center in Manhattan, May '06 (first tour - they really only played 3 songs from 10K days#, and once in Jesolo, Italy #I happened to be on vacation in Venice!).Anyway - I have been a Tool fan since about 1996, and have listened hard core since then. This album is hands down their best work. It is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCKS SO HARD I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO","review":"I love Tool, every song on every album. They re-create their style every time and I am really into that. I was out of the country when the album first came out, and not able to listen to it. My sister emailed me and told me is sucked and that there were only 3 actual songs on it and the rest was chanting and bongo drums and clicking. I have been gripping for this album for 5 years so I was pretty p*ssed at her for laying that on me while i was out of town. I was worried until I was able to listen to it when I got back, but needlessly. TOOL ROCKS AND SO DOES THIS ALBUM! The only tracks that aren't songs are 6,7&11. And one of those is this cool American Indian chanting that reminds me of the Doors. Every Tool album has weird/cool speaking tracks that sort of set the tone/mood of the album. Anyway if your a Tool fan you won't be disappointed. Plus the album art is in 3-D and has googly glasses, HOW MUCH COOLER CAN YOU GET??!?!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"Ever since they made the metal/alternative classics \\"Opiate\\" and \\"Undertow\\" and seeing them on the sidestage at Lollapalooza III, I have bought each subsequent album hoping it would be another album with crunching quitars and heavy base riffs, but sadly Tool has slowly become just another progressive/tribal/psychadelic rock band. The anger and raw sound is gone,replaced by tribal druming and background noise. If you liked there last album, then you'll probably love this, but if your like me and are waiting for the next Undertow, don't bother, I don't think they have it in them anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOOL? or Perfect Circle?","review":"This is the weakest TOOL effort that turned me off of this band that I Use to adore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't call it music.","review":"Optiate was a great thrashing simple guitar drums, bass, vocals EP, \\"Undertow\\" was them progressing there sound to another dimension, \\"Aenima\\" is an incredible piece of captured mixed and dark emotions, then came \\"Lateralus\\", kind of dissapointing, certainly not bad, but quite dissapointing considering how far this band had progressed, but they seemed to be taking a step down.And after another long wait we have the unimaginativley titeld \\"10,000 days\\", I tell you something, you can always tell what the music will sound like on an album from the artwork and album title, and unfortunatly, the music on this album is just thats. \\"10,000 days\\" to make, and 5 seconds to name the record.Another band falls down in the dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This.Album.Is.....AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

No curse-words in that one, and it will take your mind to another dimension.all of the fans praising this CD are long time Tool fans, who have put themselves through mental gymnastics b/c they just can't believe that their favorite band could produce anything less than excellent. anyone who purchased this album, as much as I hate to say it, has bought into a brand name: Tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back To '97","review":"This album is not that great. I would have ranked it a bit higher but I am really disappointed by the songs on here. It was all very disheveled. They should go back to the earlier CD's and take a listen. That's what made them. This is all commercial and sellout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insert clever statement here","review":"This cd is bland, unimaginative, and possess portions that would only appeal to someone on so many drugs that they would occasionally forget how to breathe"},{"rating":"1","title":"USeless pop rock.","review":"Just more overrated useless, talentless pop rock from Tool.

For every song of yours that somenoe dowloads, you lose thousands of dollars.Doesn't pay to be a media whore, does it, stick man?Tool x Washed up (Maynard = Sellout) = Steaming Pile of Dhiarhea"},{"rating":"1","title":"CANT PUT ON IPOD< OR COMPUTER!","review":"This was the best tool cd i've ever listened to, so imangine my anger when I tried to put it on my new ipod, and could'nt.

They will never top Aenima. Never."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you","review":"I have had this album since it was released. When I first received it I listened to it about 10 times or so and was unimpressed. I filed it back into my CD collection and left untouched until about a month ago. Since then this album has steadily grown on me to the point that I thoroughly enjoy it now. Though not as good as Undertow or Aenima (the best tool album in my opinion) it is better than Lateralus.Like all Tool albums 10,000 Days will grow on you, for some of you it may take a while. But to the people who gave it 1-3 stars, you'll eventually be back on here upgrading your review. 10,000 Days is a good album, perhaps in another month I'll think it's a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one like them....","review":"Tool continue to do what they do-intricate and flawless ensemble playing, generally excellent compositional skills, with outstanding sonics. This is a band whose albums must be heard on a sound system, not just an ipod or mp3 player.If you've never seen them live, it is a must. Out of all of the shows I've seen over the last 30 years, this band is in the top 2 or 3. A concert experience like no other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm.....","review":"well like all the other tool fans out there, i love the album. but i also felt slightly slighted. i mean when you hear that there are only about 5 or 6 songs on it, its the truth. now don't get me wrong, i like the other songs, but when tool can rock like can why not use the space for more sonically booming songs. they other thing that was kinda frustrating is maynards voice. its awesome on some songs but alot of the time he is just kind of mumbling or talking. again, when you can sound as good as he does why not belt it out? but i gave it 4 stars because it really is a good album. maybe even great. even the few misgivings of the album cant take away its effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been good.","review":"I absolutely loved Lateralus and Aenema. What this album is missing that those ones had was DYNAMICS. Atmospheric, brooding sections would build into propelling grooves, and explode into these bombastic, \\"in your face\\" sections that would rock you sideways. You really got a sense of development in the songs.That's all here, but it's all been spoiled in the post-production. The entire thing is such a flat, boring sound. I'm listening to the first track, Vicarious, thinking, \\"Man, this section could rock my face off.\\" The guitar is was too loud, the vocals are too soft. Somebody asks \\"Where are Danny Carry's balls?\\" If you listen really hard, his playing is just as great, you can just barely HEAR it! It could have been SO GOOD! I don't know who produced and/or mixed the album, but in an effort to go for a more \\"mainstream\\" sound in the production, they've spoiled all the peaks and valleys that make Tool such a good band. Whoever it was, shame on them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Droning, Disappointing","review":"If you feel this is a great effort by Tool, I'm jealous. I so wanted to love this album, as I have their past 3...Please attempt to review this CD here, and not the band. Anyone who bothers to post here probably loves Tool, as I do, however 10,000 DAYS has little progression in the songs, and is made up mostly droning riffs that go nowhere. None of the epic sound of past releases.Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the production; maynard's voice is way back in the muddy sound of the guitars, and never wails above when it should. And where are the great searing guitars(?), mainly boring unimaginative riffing.A few high points, but way too many boring minutes - all the ambient filler further makes me suspect of the effort. The silver lining? Tool will tour and we can hear the rest of their catalog...Lateralus was Tool's peak, with Aenima only slightly less brilliant. Now, sadly the curve has started downward... sharply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful follow-up to Lateralus","review":"I sometimes wonder if Trent Reznor (Whom I have great respect for and really enjoy his work) feels like Salieri to Mozart when listening to Tool or Perfect Circle.I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I loved Lateralus, it still blows my mind at how refined, insightful, spiritual, and flat out enjoyable experience it was. 10,000 days seems to be in the continuation of this psuedo-spiritual era of Tool.If you are one of the Tool fan minority that did not like Lateralus, then 10,000 days will probably also no thrill you. However if you liked Lateralus I sincerely believe that you will enjoy 10,000 days.Though Lateralus is still a stronger experience in my opinion, 10,000 days is yet another example of Maynard James Keenan being one of the great living musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"10,000 Days = average song length on the album","review":"One great single, one or two relatively catchy songs that are still too long, and a whole lot of boring tracks that go nowhere. While it's not straight up bad or painful to listen to, it's definitely their worst album and sadly, it's pretty uninteresting. Frankly, in many spots it sounds more like A Perfect Circle than Tool. And all the recycled tricks, the pick scrapes, the echoey screams, the talk box... just tired. Still a great band, still great live, just not a fantastic album. Of course, most Tool fans are so diehard it will take them at least ten years to realize this but hey, whatever floats your toolboat."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happen to tool ?","review":"I remenber when tool had songs that made you think or were realy impressive but damn this new release is realy bad. At first when i started listining, i had that let down feeling all over me and coulnd belive this is the same band that release undertow , opiate , aenima . I bought this not even havent heard one track, like a movie not even watching a preview and wanted to be surprise. I thought i was going to impressed. What happen to tool ? Ever since lateralus they began sucking and now this ? Rock is dead so il stick to my old records. laters, do skip this junk"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened To Tool?","review":"First off, I've loved the music that tool has done in the past, but I find this CD a dissapointment. I've listed to it about 2 weeks to see if my opinion would change. But sadly it has not.This cd just seems to suffer from too much filler. Lyrics that are not very well thought out and dont flow well with the music. Lyrics that seem mumbled, slured, difficult or impossible to understand. Even the music seems to suffer a mumbleing and sluring of sorts. There dosnt seem to be one song that escapes this effect.The music and lyrics go though sections of good then bad and back agian. There are some very good sections of the CD. But overall its like there was just a lack of effort or that the CD was rushed. It could have been a very good CD, but it just misses the mark.I expected better. mabey thats the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Tool's Best Work....","review":"I waited a long time for Tool to release something new and I was quite dissapointed with this album. There are no songs on it that I found even mildly entertaining. I'm glad I didn't spend too much money on it. It wasn't even worth a second listen to. Despite being downright boring as far as the lyrics and the guitar riffs it seemed like every song on this album was a rehash of the first song on the album. Pass on this unless you just want to support the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Dissapointed","review":"Yeah, it really doesn't compare to their other albums. The song structures seem haphazard--they're trying too hard to combine all of their styles together. Also, I thought the electronics were really subpar, as the \\"tabla\\" was clearly just made of poorly processsed samples. I expected more, especially after Lateralus. Probably their worst album."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have doubts about this CD give me 1 minute of your time.","review":"If you have doubts about this CD give me 1 minute of your time.Tool's music is radically complex. When I first go this CD I thought it was a little subpar after the psychadelicly spiritual Lateralus. It has been 5 years and most us former fans have forgotten the patient ear their music requires. Every forum I saw the first day it was out was all complaints. Several days later that is all different. It is celebrated as a master piece. Buy this album (don't illegally download!) and listen to it 2 or 3 times. Then listen through while reading the lyrics online. From that point forth its inspiring tale and beautiful melodies and puzzles are there for your picking"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tool fans reviewing this on here are Idiots!!!","review":"Seriously, this is a great album. Quit bashing it, cause if you do so, you are not a true tool fan. Quit saying you hate this or hate that about the CD. The only reason why you are hating on the album is cause you don't GET IT!!!! This album is an apology or dismayal because of some of you idiots followed them so blindly, yet never truly understood anything. Though you thought you did. You thought you got the third eye, expand your mind stuff, but you were only being sheep and doing what they told you to do. Thus being a death of sort to the old tool, and opening a way to a new tool. A more personal more introspective tool. Just be true fans love the music and the art, and damn the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"10,000 Days - Don't you get it?","review":"I have to say I am really surprised at some of the reviews - makes me wonder if you guys actually \\"get\\" Tool? It is so disappointing that so many fans actually seem to miss the point totally.Yes, they are a great \\"Rock\\" band, but are also so much more than that; Tool ususally have spiritual, political or social (ALWAYS thought provoking) lyrics and the music is at times simply a way to compliment the enlightenment they are trying to share with us.Try listening to the whole album in correct order with the lights out after a long meditation; but if you don't get it, then you just don't get it...and probably never will - just enjoy the music and forget the fact they are trying to tell you something really BIG. Especially with 10,000 days :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Tool turning into Metallica?","review":"I am saying this cause Metallica's last album was an embarassment. I am a big Tool fan and I have to say this album is subpar,I love the lyrics and jamming power riffs from the past albums but it seems like alot of the tracks on this album are missing this. On alot of the tracks, it seems to me that the lyrics are drowned out by the instrumental.You might think that is good since we are talking about Tool, but the instrumental is weak. I swear some of the tracks would sound great in an elevator. The best song of this cd is Vicarious which sounds like a fill-in song on one of their past CD's. It is worth the price of a CD to get this but in the future it wont be a CD you will want to pull out and jam to like the previous masterpieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor effort","review":"From a musical standpoint, I guess you could say this is a highly technical album. However, I tend to think most musicians lean away from unusual time signatures and their constant changes because it sounds like crap.As always, Carey is spectacular on percussion (the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars). The rest of the bands work seems forced and unmotivated (yes, I know Maynard's mom died and all, my condolences, this cd is still terrible), as if their label simply pushed them to release another cash cow. I bought this cd expecting Tool - how disappointed I was. I've listened to it in it's entirity without interruption. I still don't like it. And I'm certainly not going to force myself to listen to this over and over again to appreciate it, my time is too important. I'll just write this off as a loss of $[...] and listen to Lateralus or earlier works when I'm feeling like Tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album.","review":"I don't understand why some people are giving this album so much criticism. 10,000 Days is a great album, from Vicarious to Right In Two I enjoyed every minute of it. I will agree that the last track, Viginti Tres, probably shouldn't be considered a \\"song\\" in the traditional sense, but instead of looking at it and saying \\"I don't like that. It's not even a song! why would they do that?\\" look at it as a song from a band who are doing their own thing and being creative. Creativity is something that is seriously lacking in today's music scene with all the cookie cutter generic bands that are cutting records left and right. 10,000 Days has some of Tool's best work in it, the guitar work is astonishing and the skull punching drums are something to be admired. 10,000 Days is easily one of my favorite albums to have ever been released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it time","review":"Like many people who have reviewed this album, I was anticipating its release and felt initial disappointment because it seemed bland and uninspired. After listening to 10,000 Days almost constantly for the past few weeks however, it has revealed itself as a beautiful and complex work that has an almost intoxicating effect. It does not have the driving passion of Aenemia (which is arguably the best album of the last decade) but everyone gets older and 10,000 days reflects a more mature and introspective sensibility. If you want an excellent Chardonney which is accessible the first time you try it, listen to A Perfect Circle. If you want a rich and subtle Cabernet Sauvignon, listen to 10,000 days. But try listening to it repeatedly and see if you dont have the same experience that I had, that it takes time for all the layers to unfold and bloom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put me to bed","review":"Disappointing. As a longtime Tool fan I never thought I would say it but this album is a sleeper. It is an example of what happens when you devote half of yourself to a project. The album has a complete lack of momentum and energy. It is more of a funeral procession (which may be their intent judging by the lyrics). Even when the band gets energetic it merely sounds busy not intense. There is a total lack of swing and movement to the riffs, which is something Tool's prior album have been exemplary at doing. I know the band makes music for themselves, not to please the critics or the fans. However, I believe putting the Tool name on this album is misleading to those looking for a Tool album."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEAR PERFECT","review":"the only reason i gave this 4 stars is the inclusion of \\"filler sounds\\". i dont need them, but hey, it's tool, so you know they will be there. the songs are powerful and moving. the lyrics - especially wings/10,000 days - are amazing, and really give you alot of insight into what maynard was thinking during his mother's long illness and ultimate death. he's an amazing song writer, and the rest of the band are extremely advanced musicians. can't wait to see them again on tour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is awesome","review":"10 000 days is an incredible experience. evry time i listen to this cd i like it more and more it is my faviorate cd. if you tool then you will love this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome disc!","review":"While this isn't ?nima (which I don't think can be topped by Tool), I think this has a very ?nima feel to it and has quickly made it up to my #2 Tool disc. Lateralus was good but too much ambience and while this one has it's share I am able to listen to it over and over much like I did ?nima when it was released and this will be getting a lot of listening time."},{"rating":"1","title":"i just can't get into it...","review":"i do apologize to tool fans everywhere, but this record is not very good. The problem i have is adam jones just belting out the same guitar progressions as he usually does on every record. i do appreciate his effort with the talk box solo on jambi, but it's nothing special. many of the songs i find sound too similar to \\"the patient\\" or \\"The Grudge\\". and wings for marie part 1 and 2 are dull and lengthy.It seems that tool is past their prime. all i recommend is to listen to their previous albums, which at least have some form of variety"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only four good Songs","review":"If this album was nothing but static noise I'm sure a lot of the Tool fans giving positive reviews for \`10,000 days' would still give it five stars. Just because it's a Tool album and all your cool friends like Tool, doesn't mean this is any good. There are only four real songs on \`10,000 day' and the rest is just unenergetic snaky guitar rifts and stupid filler. Where is all the solid fast passionate guitar work of the past? These guys have one of the greatest drummers in the world and it hardly seems he's doing any thing. I don't really understand why the band bothered to put half the songs on this CD let alone name them; they really should have named song 11 'static noise filler' because that's all it is. Maybe the band thought the cool album cover with the glasses and trippy pictures would cause fans to over look the rest of this steaming bowl of elephant piss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I bought this album the day it came out and was thuroughly disappointed. I wanted to write a bad review then, but decided to wait a few months and give the album a chance to redeam itself. Well, it's been a few months and I've listened to the album a few more times. If this was the first Tool album, then I think I would give it some praise because Tool's sound is just so unique. However, after listening to Lateralus (a masterpiece), Undertow, Aenima, and Opiate, this album simply doesn't measure up. It sounds like the Lateralus B-sides that never made the cut. Some of the songs have huge potential, but never turn into anything worth remembering. I would expect more from this great band. I don't understand how Tool fans can like this album. Is the \\"happy smoke\\" clouding your judgement? It is such a let down. Tool are still one of my favorite bands, and Lateralus is still one of the best albums in my collection. if you are still curious about this album, then buy it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD. Get it!","review":"I was trying to make it easy on myself and downloading Tool on iTunes, but they don't offer their music to purchase on there. I then looked at Best Buy, because it's close to my house and I wouldn't have to wait for it to ship... but they were sold out of all Tool CDs. My next choice? AMAZON! Amazon is truly the best site when looking for quality items at reasonable prices!"},{"rating":"2","title":"10,000th review","review":"I've known about the release of this album since summer of 2005 and couldn't wait to hear it. When I first heard of the album, the name in particular, I thought \\"Disturbed\\" and when I saw the art work I admit I was dissapointed but when I heard their first single \\"Vicarious\\" I got hooked. The album is great but still doesn't hold a candle to \\"Aenima\\". the album's best tracks are \\"10,000 Days(Wings Pt.2)\\" and \\"Rosetta Stoned\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"As usual, an absolutely great Tool album. I don't even know which of their albums is the best. Hypnotic, different, label-free sound. Not indicated for hip hop, pop and idiotic \\"music\\" fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool at their best","review":"This Album is more then creation. It shows the complex works of Adam Jonesat his best. This is by far the best Album ever produced by Tool. There is a dark secret that lies within the lyrics of each song. Adam Jones is the modern day Jimmy Hendrix with his complex and unique playing style. I highly recommend this agressive then subtle Album by Tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"If the soul had a voice, these are the songs it would sing","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a Tool \\"fan\\" and not a \\"fanatic\\". I only rediscovered them in between the release of Lateralus and 10000 days when the Tool \\"hype\\" was at its zenith (I always ignored them years earlier when they were the toast of the town). Now I regret not discovering them earlier. Like all Tool albums Maynard's lyrics on 10000 days touch me emotionally especially \\"Jambi\\" and \\"Wings\\" Part 1 and 2. I'm going to play devil's advocate and say that I prefer the newer, softer style they are evolving into. If I need my fix of heavier music I look elsewhere. All in all this is an excellent introspective album that will enlighten you if you give it half a chance. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"It's always a great anticipation when a new Tool album comes out and this one does not disappoint in the least. The first 2 songs start out on an energy filled adrenaline pace then you get the balance of the more mellow but equally powerfully epic 10,000 days. Tool albums to me are not just a bunch of songs it's an experience they are some of the only albums where you have to just sit and enjoy the entire album as a hole to appreciate it to the fullest. Right in two is an amazing song that is one of my instant favorites great lyrics and great song. I definitely recommend it although I imagine if you are a Tool fan you bought this album a week ago the day it came out as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Don't you talking monkeys realize you have a masterpiece on your hands? Yes a masterpiece. I don't think i've listened to an album quite like this since dark side of the moon. This is meant to be listened to in order, preferably with headphones and in darkness. Forget about throwing this in and hitting shuffle on your way to work, it won't do it justice. They also included some absolutely incredible packaging and artwork. How many other bands go to this extent for their fans, even while some of them take it all for granted. Buy and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"another step forward","review":"There has never been a band like Tool. The only hard rock band with the talent to pull off something as ambitious as Aenima or Lateralus was the Who in their masterpiece, Quadrophenia. The Who never attempted anything so ambitious again, but 10,000 Days is Tool's third consecutive masterwork.Stravinsky wrote the Rite of Spring in the early 1900's and brought rhythm to the fore in serious music. The Rite of Spring famously caused a riot at its premiere in Paris, but it successfully dragged the public down a new road paving the way for Prokofieff, Bartok and a wave of modern composers who used rhythm in ways unimagined in the 19th Century.Tool is the Stravinsky of modern music, and 10,000 days is driven by an onslaught of rhythmical expression as intense as in their prior albums. It is too soon to say where 10,000 days ranks in comparison to Lateralus and Aenima -- it is probably pointless to rank works of such extraordinary complexity."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEH!","review":"This is by far Tool's most dull and pretentious album yet. That's right, pretentious, coming from a band with a mediocre bassist and guitarist, with lyrics that may or may not be total bulls**t. I actually have listened to this album, and the concept is so cryptic, I don't think it's possible for it to be valid, yet you Tools who worship this band call it \\"deep\\". Want to hear deep? Pick up Dark Side of the Moon, not this overhyped pretentious wankfest.

Simply money-making. Fake-Tool, eyes on black ground are not enough.I guess Maynard wanted to go home to APC as soon as he could, \\"let\`s get over and done with it\\"I don\`t want to listen to music which is \\"produced\\" just for commercial reasons.

Tool is dead, they have nothing more to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Maynard FARTED, the 'TOOL-BOTS' would still rave!!!","review":"This latest release is WEAK and OVERRATED, period. The rehashed songs are way too long, boring, plodding, and go nowhere, like most of TOOL's anemic and masturbatory schlock rock that poses as aural grandeur. Maynard's vocals are way back in the mix, but this is probably a good thing. But still watch the brainwashed cult-following 'Toolies' rant and rave about anything this musically stunted group of misfits releases! It's also riotous to hear the 'Toolsheep' rave about the CD sleeve artwork, ostensibly just because it's on a 'TOOL' disc. If the same artwork was on any other artist's CD, they would dismiss it or give it a lukewarm review. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 years ?","review":"The following ... are not members of tool... roger waters , david gilmour , nick mason , richard wright .... nin , tool and radiohead are the greatest of modern dark bands , but for fans to push and label them with the king of dark bands only makes it hard on these great acts.... now why did this have to be adam's band ? tool please expand !!!! 5 years ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Departure from \\"Conventional\\"Tool","review":"The album sounds somewhat like Tool for the majority of songs, but they departed from the Indian sound that they successfully incorporated into 'Lateralus'. As pleasing as gutteral screaming is to my ears, I don't actually appreciate vocals that are actually screaming-- 'Intension' and 'Rosetta Stoned' are just gutteral screaming. Those two tracks are absolutely awful. Tool also explores a little more instrumental in this album than in the last.

Adam Jones is meticulous in the studio but can't come up with something better than this every 5 years. Maynard thinks he is so ultracool but really he's just an ugly blad guy with a god complex.

The group is incorporating more aural inputs and has mellowed its edge just a bit, but I consider that a very good thing. Even most of the so-called \\"filler\\" cuts are exceptionally fine.For those who complain about the cuts being too long, I have one term - short attention span. It is a literal disease of younger listeners (I am 55 so I know of what I speak). I have always compared Tool to King Crimson, the spaced-out, hard-edged prog rock group from the 60s/70s. Tool, however, rocks much harder and more consistently and the drumming is out of this world.PS - If you like your cuts short but still rock-solid, go listen to Fifty Reasons To Explode by Schatzi."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOOL is better each album","review":"Tool has to be the best hard band out there, and it seems each album has gotten progressively better.

I doubt your average Tool fan will be disappointed. I honestly would have been happy with something shorter and with more punch like \\"Undertow\\" again, but here we get what \\"Lateralus\\" basically was, in a good way. A lengthy disc where no song stands-out, but the entire album does as a whole. One thing I wanted to mention that few have, is how incredible the packaging is. Each Tool album has had consistently unique artwork, and \\"10,000 Days\\" takes the cake so far. It has numerous double images in a cd book, that when viewed through the special glasses (which are part of the case) make for excellent 3-D pictures. Under the right light they just jump out at you.

Then I had to listen to it a few more times before I started loving it, which I do now. 10,000 Days is not the type of album that will appeal to those on the first spin. You really have to give yourself time to absorb this album. Once you do though you will not be dissapointed as this is Tool's best album. My one complaint is that I wish there had been 2 or 3 more \\"real\\" songs instead of the weird instrumentals or filler tracks as some refer to them as (Wings for Marie Part 1 and Lost Keys), but most of the actual songs are great, especially Jambi, the Pot and Right in Two. Considering how bad the music scene is these days, 10,000 days is the right album at the right time.

To turn the mouse off you have to snap the USB receiver on to the bottom of the mouse (it's docking station). If you travel a lot with your Laptop, this Mouse may not be right for you. The USB could easily unsnap from the mouse while in your bag causing it to turn itself on accidently. To be on the safe side you can choose to remove the battery from the mouse before placing it in to your bag or you can do as I always do...use a thick rubber band to secure it in place.

The settings and the premise are interesting, but the characters never get beyond two dimensions. There are some crazy time shifts too, where decades pass withoiut warning.

The book is divided into three sections of Maris' life. We see her grow from child to old woman, however, I never had much empathy for her as a character.It was refreshing to see that loose ends do not get tied neatly up when it comes to relationships. Sensitivity to the ups-and-downs of love affairs in general was a strength of the book even if it was handled in a dry way.The book tries to deal with complex politics of the flyers versus the land-bound.

Once again enlisting the production services of Felix Tod, Heather has armed herself with a judicious cover (Chris Isaak's 'Wicked Game'), a catchy opening track ('Welcome' co-written with Dido Armstrong). The album also contains some strong originals, some of them tributes to her son, most notably the touching 'Sing you Through'. This album's quality is in the class of 'South' but not quite up to the standard of 'Oyster and 'Glow Stars.' Well worth a listen nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"one among many","review":"She's a fine artist; her creativity in composition is good; her voice is crisp, clear and a bit sultry.

I'm sorry to say I am very dissapointed. Many of the most funny parts of the full concert are not included on this album. For example, mother and the kids at mall, working at McDonalds, they are omitted. The CD is still funny, but if you are looking for the entire routine, you will be very disappointed in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves you wanting to listen to more!","review":"The only fault that I would lay gently on this album is that it has only four tracks.

It's been that long since I heard it (since I sold it after only three listens) so I warn you that I'm going on memory here...I remember actually being surprised at the lack of cohesiveness on this set. It seemed to me that the band struggled and never really gelled into a groove. At the risk of sounding harsh, I'd say that this set runs a close second to \\"Steal Your Face\\" as the \\"Least Greatest GD Live Release Ever\\" (although I admit, I've never heard the Dylan collaboration).No, WOAN is not \\"horrible\\" by any stretch; It's just missing too much of that ethereal something that makes the Dead special. Espeacially with all the great live material available these days, I'd advise fans to buy almost everything else before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite album","review":"While I'm a fan of the early GD, rarely listening to anything recorded after 1972, I gave this one a try and was fairly disappointed. Every band evolves with time as do the members, but there is something to be said for the early GD that can't be said for their later work. The sound of the late 70's to the early 90's is vastly different from the blues/folk beginnings of the band. There are more instruments, electronics, and members of the band that I think take away from what the GD were...... a simple band, making complex songs and jams with a certain \\"feel\\" to them. The feel is lost behind the synthesizers and electronic sound of this album. Needless to say I will be passing this album on to someone who appreciates this period of the GD sound and will go back to listening to Pigpen, Jerry, and the boys singing and playing about simpler times."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"It seems that black women have been allowed to dump on black men at will. If it isn't Oprah's condescending attitude, it's the \\"they're all dogs\\" routine from \\"Waiting to Exhale\\". This book puts a stop to the nonsense that black men are handed by black women all the time. However, the author is clever. Even with the outrageous title, the book is as profoundly negative as one may first imagine. I found it insightful, inspiring and pretty danged funny! Spike Lee ought to make this into a movie! What a great book. Too bad more people aren't reading this, and one mroe thing: it has a nessage for mroe than just black folk. EVERYONE needs to read this! Dynamite from beginning to end.

Flash forward four months and I've come to love the freshman effort of Eden's Crush. Not only is the first album good, it's simply fantastic. Almost all the songs, namely No Drama, Love this way, and I wanna be free, have hip urban beats that surpass any Britney Spears release. The ladies of Eden's Crush showcase a sense of maturity that is often missing in today's pop scene. I would encourage anyone to give a listen to the ladies of Eden's Crush. Surely, I'll be waring out my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eden's Crush","review":"If you like pop music this is a great cd to buy. I heard a little bit of their music from their concert on t.v.

A lot of people might say because they have been so called \\"manufactored\\". But this is NO DRAMA this is talent! 1000 WORDS cant even explain how good this CD is. Some people will refuse to listen to the CD b/c they already assume it will sound fake and corny. But my messege to them is to GET OVER YOURSELF and listen to the CD. It's totally GOOD FOR THE GOOSE and by 2002 they will be living the GLAMOROUS LIFE because of so much critics they proved wrong. LET ME KNOW how you cant like songs like TWO WAY, LOVE THIS WAY,YOU KNOW I CAN and I WANNA BE FREE. Now IT WASNT ME who just started to like them b/c of the show but their music proves they have telent. If you like some up-beat music to get you dancing and singing along then this is definetly a good CD for you!

While watching some of the shows and seeing how AMAZING these girls were, proved me wrong by far. The CD is absolutly awesome. They have a great viartey of music. Not to mention these girls can SING! The catchy lyrics of such songs as, 'Get Over Yourself ' , 'No Drama ' , 'You Know I Can' and more, make people want to dance. On the other hand, the cute love lyrics in my personal favorite song , ' Love This Way ' are amazing. The girls have proved to the world that they can make it. Look at them! They are opening up for 'N sync and they just have started. This cd is amazing and EVERYONE should pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MATURE SOUND!","review":"This CD is really good! Many people may not expect it to be so great because they're a group formed on a tv show. But their talent really shines on this CD. They have a unique sound, and they're not typical pop. They sing about issues they can actually relate to, unlike Dream (who are also a really good group). However, they're too young to sing about some of the stuff they do. Eden's Crush is not! I think the best songs are \\"What's Good 4 the Goose\\", \\"Get Over Yourself\\", and \\"Glamorous Life.\\" But really, all of these songs are great! Good job, girls!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love the whole CD","review":"I havent love an entire cd in so long. Usually I like a few songs on an album but Popstars is awesome.

The fact that theses girls were put together by TV show, shouldn't stop people from getting this album. All 5 girls are talented. \\"Love This Way\\" is the best of all of them IMO.But why is \\"What's Good 4 The Goose\\" the first track on the album.

Some Hip-hop and R&B, a few slow ballads, and even a beautifully sung Spanish tune.I think that as a viewer of the show and actually getting to see the stress and hardwork to get the glitz and glam you can appreciate these girls so much more.Great job on this album and I hope to see something as good if not better next time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average \\"popstars\\"","review":"Now i'm a very big popstars lover,I watched it everyday from the 1st episode to the last.

Unlike most pop acts today like (Innosense),(Sclub7),(Five) there label had faith in them and gave them some control in the studio and the finishing product is an album that lets you know \\"EDENS CRUSH IS AS REAL AS IT GETS\\".

All of the five girls were hand picked to form this group. Yes, they're manufactured but before you judge you need to listen to POPSTARS. It's actually a great, solid pop album. All of the girls have awesome voices and together they have great harmonies. Individually they all shine as well. POPSTARS is filled with synth pop, and some R&B undertones. Lyrically it deals mostly with \\"girl power anthems/he done me wrong senerios\\" layered with jittery pop beats. POPSTARS is a great, fun, upbeat pop album. It starts with the high energy \\"what's good 4 the goose\\" and ends with an awesome ballad, \\"promise me.\\" This is another album you can play all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important tale to learn young","review":"If not for William the Silent and the brave, heroic Dutch, the Reformation and the Enlightenment would have failed, the spark of Liberty would have been snuffed out, and darkness would have once again descended upon the West.

The first round came when \\"Into the Night\\" climbed to #11 on the US singles chart in the autumn of 1980. Nearly nine years later a second set of 15 minutes rolled his way when the same version became a hit all over again peaking at #20 in the summer of 1989. (An attempt by Mardones to cash in on this second chance be rerecording the song failed when that version did not chart).The song can be something of a guilty pleasure if you don't pay too much attention to it. It kind of sounds like either a third rate Springsteen knockoff, or an actually halfway decent Meat Loaf tune (not that such an animal exists, mind you). That almost surreal cross turns out to be the song's undoing though, as it causes you to pay closer attention at which point you realize it is about a grown man lusting, and rather openly I might add, over a 16 year old girl and you end up with major case of the creeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading version of this dvd movie.","review":"I looked forward to receiving this dvd and i have but it has chinese subtitles that can not be taken off!,this is some chinese version of the dvd movie.....WHAT'S GOING ON?,I AM NOT HAPPY WITH MY ITEM!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Night and the City","review":"Top notch service from amazon.Recieved movie in two days.Gteat movie.For Dinero fans, highly recommended.I never heard of this movie and my father said it was a must see.He was right.This is a must see movie for any movie watcher.One of the best casts ever for a quality movie.Not for children, adult content.Thank You for making it so easy to aquireand at a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for new and younger Christians","review":"Author Colin Smith takes a very high level overview of the Bible story in his book Unlock the Bible in 30 Days.

The book is divided into three parts with part 1 covering the Old Testament, part 2 covering the New Testament, and part 3 dealing with living in the Spirit.For most people who have been Christians for a long time this is too general a view of the Bible and will provide nothing they don't already know.

I thought, wow, this song is so great, I'm sure the rest of the album (or other songs by this group) must be fabulous. The other reviews on here seemed to indicate that. I was positively salivating when the CD arrived. I immediately popped it into my computer for a listen, and I am sorry to report, was VERY disappointed. Every song sounds exactly like the others -- seems like same key, same type of instrumentals, same type of vocals. Perhaps taken separately, the songs are OK but together, to me anyway, they became unlistenably boring very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It......Color Wears Easily","review":"This hard plastic cover is very easy to install and gives a bit of protection to the phone without being too thick and heavy. Though I agree with the other reviewers here that the pinwheel design and clip is very poor, I feel the fact that the color chips away over a very short period of time is more of a reason to look else wear. The black color on the shell comes off and scratches very easily, and over a period of just a couple of months looks cheap and ugly. Underneath the black coating is a silver metallic cover that makes the scratches very obvious. And it doesn't take a while for the scratches to appear. No matter how careful you are this cover will look like hell in just a couple of months. Pass these up...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clip gear break!","review":"The clip gears for the swivel break easy, make of plastic probably in China! Why not use some metal people!

I'm sure this guage is accurate, but it is a real pain in the rear to use. Hit the button to turn it on and it takes about 3 seconds before you can place it on the stem to check the pressure. The reading appears and stays on for way more than long enough to see it. If you have to let some air out of the tire, you will have to shut the thing off and restart it and go through the whole startup process. I guess it is comparable to starting up your computer and waiting for all the startup programs to do their thing before you can get on the net. Mine will be on eBay soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too awkward to be usable for Presta valves but some good points","review":"This gizmo could make you nuts. There is a mechanism that retracts for presta valves, the only problem is it doesn't retract smoothly so you end up letting out a lot of air before it is in the correct position. I have a gauge that cost half the price that I like much better for low pressure. A real disappointment for high pressure (80 to 125) psi pressure checking, however, the accuracy is very very good once you handle it correctly. If you want one gauge for all applications, I guess this one could be for you but it is tricky. Another draw back is that the on-off button is placed in exactly the spot you grip the gauge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally oversold","review":"Although it may be fine with schrader valves, this gauge is almost impossible to use with presta valves.

I tried it out last night and it is unbelievable horrible. Getting it on an off a presta valve is a challenge and results in lots of air loss. (On a schraeder, it works much easier.) When checking multiple tires, you need to turn off the device and restart it. There is no simple \\"reset\\" button. The placement of the buttons makes it very easy to accidentally turn it off when you're trying to take a reading. This thing is being immediately returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"The first problem with this gauge is that the one I received would only register 0.0 lbs on schrader valves, I didn't try it on presta valves. The second problem is that the ON button would constantly be ON if you tossed it in a bag or pack. It's not protected by a bezel and switches on with the slightest pressure. And finally, it comes in the type of tough plastic packaging - with rivets no less - that you need sharp implements and brute force to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"I'm surprised at the negative reviews.

Wallace's attempt to establish a continuity is restricted to Galileo's early notebooks, which were related to his teaching. Therefore, at best, this establishes a continuity between medieval science and Galileo's *teaching,* not Galileo's *actual science.* This form of the \\"continuity thesis\\" (the only form defended here) is the most banal truism imaginable. What else was he supposed to teach? Of course he did not have his own theory at this early stage. So of course he had to rely on various authorities. Nowhere is there any argument that this has the slightest relevance for understanding Galileo's mature science. Instead Wallace spends all his time on various baroque linguistic analyses intended to show that in the notebooks Galileo was plagiarising one mediocre and irrelevant author rather than another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendo libro para entender el flamenco.","review":"Tengo este libro desede hace tiempo y ha sido una gran herramienta para la guitarra flamenca.

So we returned for another. 3 months later this one has the same problem. Very dissapointing and cheap product as the images looked terrible from up to about 3 feet away when it did work.

Ours lasted for five months, which seems to be longer than most, before it died. The LED has burned out and the pictures are no longer visible. When I called the company, the rep told me that the frame should not be left on for longer than eight hours at a time in order for the unit to cool down and prolong the life of the LED. When I noted that this information was not available in the packaging, he readily agreed. He also agreed to take the item back and send a new one.

It was a very cool idea, and we enjoyed it for 3 months. Loading pictures is easy, and only a little common sense is needed to figure out the aspect ratios.

The LCD backlight should last longer than 4 months but mine just burned out.The quality of the pictures are okay if viewed from a distance but the low res. is not good if viewing up close.There is no external power controls or a remote so turning this unit on and off is a drag. Regular LCD backlights should last a few years even if it stays on all day and night. This one just lasted 4 months. So the image is almost non-existant now. In the glare, you can barely make out the image so it's still there but with no backlight so good as dead.I would recommend a more expensive Philips ones. My friend has had it for about two years and it's still going. plus it's higher res and and has more controls such as a timer function and also can play video clips, which this one can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Frame","review":"I bought this frame in Jan.

Some have the aspect ratio option (16x9 or 4x3) and some don't. My first one (which failed after an hour) had the option, the replacement does not. Everyone and everything in the photos are a bit fat. By careful measurement, I determined that the pictures were about 33% too wide. I used MS Paint to shrink the width by 25% (stretch to 75%) and, lo and behold, the images look normal. I found a batch JPEG resizer (FastStone Photo Resizer) that does a batch real quick. In it, I resize the images to 1000x1000 with stretch. This makes the images look way skinny, but the PhotoShare stretches them to look normal.Further, the images are poor quality, the unit is slow. Seems to me that those recommending this product have simply found a challenging game that they have enjoyed beating.

It seems that there is no way around the distortion problem. It just can't get the picture right. Never mind the resolution, colors, user interface, etc.I bought this product yesterday, for my parents who need a portable picture viewer to show off their grandkids to their friends. I thought this product might be good for them, considering its large screen and battery-based operation. But, what's the use of the large screen when it can't display pictures right? Also, realized that getting an SD memory car(zero internal memory) and 'optional' battery will cost me additional 60-70 bucks, and it suddenly makes products like Zune price-comparable.

I was drawn to the nice leather frame (and it is nice). The picture quality, however, reminded me of an old videogame.

While the Photoco customer service rep had heard of the problem several times before, he had no workaround and told me to exchange the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed product with no technical assistance","review":"The Photoshare digital frame is a classic example of poor engineering. The \\"Plug and Play\\" ability is aggravating, at best, freezing two of my computers, requiring endless reboots to transfer images. Photoshare provides ZERO customer support or technical assistance when you have problems interpreting the very poor operations manual. The expensive battery is almost impossible to install.

When I called the company, I was told--too bad, you must have an early model and there is no way you can fix it. When I inquired about the wisdom of designing a product that does not use an aspect ratio consistent with the image produced by cameras, I was told---it wasn't my decision.Even if I could change the aspect ratio (which leaves part of the screen as wasted), you cannot turn on and start the slide show while the device is in the frame.

The story is well-written, characters fully developed and the subject is something EVERYONE can relate to on some level. Finally a book which transcends all ethnicities and speaks to the human spirit. Highly recommend this for book club discussions. This is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun 'must have in your library', page turning escape novel","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. I could not put it down. I wanted to know more about all the characters. It is refreshing to read a book by an African- American writer that crosses color lines. Frankly, I am tired of the stereotypes. This novel would make a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read for the summer","review":"I thought this was a very good first novel for Lori Bryant Woolridge. The characters were very interesting. Stephanie was so evil, that I almost put the book down, but I was so intrigued that I had to keep reading. The author took a difficult subject as illiterary and made it into an outstanding novel. As you will see it this book, lies do have a way of catching up with you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PRETTY GOOD BOOK","review":"THIS STORY STARTS OF PRETTY SLOW - BUT ONCE IT GETS GOING U WILL BECOME SO WRAPPED UP IN IT.

Just found out that Lori is next-door neighbors with my cousin and he has heard her speaking about getting this book publsihed for 5 years!!

It took me longer with this book because it started out slow to me. I kept putting this book down and picking it up- However! Once I got to the middle-more towards the end I couldn't put it down. it turned out to be really good. I had recommend this book and letting people know it started out slow to me- but at the end, it really is a cliff hanger. I had to exhale in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly great! 1","review":"This book was awesome! It's a \\"can't put it down book\\"!

It told a great story and the characters were real and very likeable, except for that nasty Stephanie, but she was still kind of funny. I learned alot about a subject I never even thought about before--illiteracy. Its not often that you get such good writing and interesting plots in a first novel. This is a smart, well conceived and executed book. Perfect for all these rainy weekends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!!","review":"The characters were shallow and not very well developed. The storyline was all too predictable. An illiterate super model, a vindictive receptionist/writer and adulterous BAP were a horrible mix and a waste of my time. I stopped reading at the point Lexis and Felicia decided to consummate their business relationship. The author's attempt to make colorblind characters was a failure because it prevented the reader from making a connection to any one in particular. Beatrice had potential but I'll never know how it all ends up and don't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Did Not Enjoy!","review":"I just did not enjoy this novel. I really think she took too much time focusing on so many problems. I don't know how others feel but I would like to know who is black and who is white. Our book club meet today and over all we think she needs to focus on one person at a time. It was very hard to read for me. Why did all the black people have to be so negative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plaster Master","review":"I just finished building my strawbale home -- and am very grateful for this book. I have nothing but great things to say about it. This book picks up where others leave off. An absolute must if you plan on using natural materials on your home. One must understand that working with natural materials is hardly a science-- and a fair amount of experementing must be done to get satisfactory results. But the effort will be worth it! Get this book-- you won't be sorry. FYI-- I used an earthen plaster (clay,manure,sand) on the interior and exterior, and finished the interior with an alis and the exterior with a lime plaster and lime wash-- beautiful results!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly organized light on details","review":"This book sounds great but is short on delivery. Many of the plastering and finishing techniques are short of important details. For example the section on milk paint gives no actual recipe.

I'm not buying anymore episodes. They want to use a quality program such as this and ruin it by trying to turn it into some kind of brain washing propaganga crap. I'm no homophobic, but I still can do without this kind of business. I'm done with Amazon instant video, and Rizzoli and Isles. This doesn't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"always better in books","review":"While television is good for an hour, books give more than hours of joy, horror, excitement, and fright. This latest book \\"Last to Die\\" is exactly a real page turner. As for details: We are happy to read about Rizzoli's relationship with her daughter is growing and teaching her a different perspective with the younger victims in her murder cases. It inspires a more sensitive and motherly Rizzoli willing to open herself to protect her charges at the expense of the time with her daughter and husband.While everyone is myopic to other possibilities, Rizzoli goes with more than her intelligence and explores other avenue's to resolving the murders while dealing an extra-ordinary plot that will kick you in the gut at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"As time goes by - disappointing","review":"I loved the first season of Rizzoli and Isles. As time goes on the show has lost its edge, the two leads are becoming characitures of what they were in year one - in short, the show has become kitzch - in a bad way. Won't buy any more episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"cord cutters - try this","review":"I enjoy this show and pay for it a la carte, rather than through a cable subscription. It is sort of silly and not at all like the books, but fun anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun show if you liked the Tess Gerritsen books","review":"As a lover of the characters in Tess Gerritsen's books, I was excited to see this show. The characters have evolved differently and some of the parts that I liked about them in the book is different but it's still a fun show to watch. I'm a huge Angie Harmon fan, so any vehicle with her in it I'm bound to watch. I recently cut back on my monthly cable services so I no longer got the show but since I enjoy it as much as I do it's worth paying $1.99 an episode for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't get into it","review":"Just couldn't get into it. There are much better police shows out there. Rizzoli says Cop 101 phrases constantly - \\"serial killers are mostly men\\" Oh really? Gee I didn't know that. And the blonde girls' mom just happens to work at the coffee shop IN the police station?! How stupid and contrived is that?

With the \\"legs\\" hanging over the center divider, the tub stays stable and at a great highth. When my daughter was a newborn, we used rolled up hand towels to keep her from leaning toward one side or the other, and a hand towel under her to help keep her from slipping as well as keep her warm. By bathing her in the sink, we were able to keep the water pressure low, and use the sprayer to rinse her off. It also made it easier to reach her, and saved our backs! It's much easier that trying to lean over a bath tub while the baby is so small and has little motor ability. It also keeps your face close to the newborn if they get scared at bathtime. We later moved the tub into the bathtub, and it worked very well there too. By then, my daughter was more allert than she was as a newborn and bathtime was also playtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Early Work","review":"I am a longtime fan and this CD still garners a permanent slot in my CD changer. \\"Royal Station 4/16\\" alone is worth the price of this CD.

It is an excellent guide to all of the features of the language in a direct, no fluff way.

Please note, this book is geared toward the \\"Professional Edition\\", you will need to have a strong understanding of the features of \\"Enterprise Edition\\" in order to pass the certification exams. Subjects such as the Visual Component Manager, Visual SourceSafe, MTS/COM+ are not covered or bearly covered. You will need other books in order to get a more thorough knowledge of these subjects.

Yes, it DOES have an index. Yes, it has some errors. And yes, coupled with the Reference Library, it's the most useful set of books a VB programmer can own.I've been developing with VB for a year and a half, and I still come back to the Programmer's Guide, because it never hurts to review the fundamentals. Plus, if you think it's only for beginners, try explaining how to implement polymorphism through multiple ActiveX interfaces in a class module.

It is nice to be able to carry around for tutorial reading. The main complain about the printed version is the lack of the copyedit process.

Then 40 miles later, he hears this thumping. It was her, being dragged along the side of the car. he said, I guess her coat got stuck when he closed the door. HAH AHAH! How can you get your coat caught in the door, and not open the door or tell the driver, who by the way, is the one who opened the door to throw her out, to say, hey, don't go, I am caught.The hunter saying, I tried to protect this guy, then at the next frame you see the flashback of him shooting the guy, HAHA HAHA!!

But when I recieved the book it was missing the dust cover, and they were lacking in telling me they were going to tape on the order directly to the book with packing tape. Doing this directly ruined one side of the book because in order to remove the tape some of the cover came off with it. NOT very professional to do this. I am not too happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best superhero ever!","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. The main reason for that is because it is about Superman. I am a die-hard Superman fan, and I felt like I was atually living this book when I read it. When Superman died, I felt that there was a huge void in the world. What would a world be like without a Superman? I had read all of the comics as they came out. We've still got them in a box somewhere. It was very interesting to read the same story as a novel. It really draws the reader in. Even people who have never read the comics, and don't really care about Superman that much love this book. The idea of Superman appeals to everyone, and his death and the effects of his death are moving. Please read this book! You will not regret it. It is well written and sends you through the whole gamut of emotions. I can't say enough about this book and about Superman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, but not without flaws.","review":"This is the first comic book novel I have read, and I was not disappointed. Roger Stern does a great job of bringing certain aspects of the epic story to life. His descriptions of the epic battle between Superman and Doomsday are even more vivid than the comics themselves.On the downside, there are times when the dialog comes across as awkward and stilted, to the point that it becomes a distraction. His portrayal of Luthor and his girlfriend Supergirl is almost painful; thankfully it a minor part of the overall story. That part reads more like a daytime soap.All in all, this is a fun read that is highly recommended to any fan of Superman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget watching the film, just listen to the music","review":"I never get tired of listening to this album, although I am considerably less enthralled about actually watching the documentary. \\"Rattle and Hum\\" offers a perfect mix of new songs, inspired live versions of old songs and a couple of nice covers. Of the new songs the four best are clearly \\"Desire,\\" \\"Hawkmoon 269\\" (with Bob Dylan on Hammond Organ), \\"Angel of Harlem\\" and the fabulous duet with B. B. King \\"When Love Comes to Town.\\" \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" is enhanced by the presence of the New Voices of Freedom choir and soloists George Pendergrass and Dorothy Terrell, while \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\" has the crowd helping out with the chorus. Finally, U2 covers the Beatles' \\"Helter Skelter\\" and Bob Dylan's \\"All Along the Watchtower,\\" the latter being the better of the pair. \\"Rattle and Hum\\" does not have the polish of most of the other U2 albums, but I can make an argument for it being their best effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This was the second U2 album I ever bought... Achtung Baby was the first. I was about 13 at the time...am 19 now, so it was a while ago. I didn't know until years after I fell in love with Rattle and Hum that it wasn't well received by fans or critics when it was released, which I thought--and still do think--was an abomination. Nothing could be a more perfect link between The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby than this CD. These songs have a passion that I rarely find in music, even U2 music recently. I can't listen to Rattle and Hum without getting a warm feeling in my chest.... Along with Achtung Baby and The Joshua Tree, I personally think this is one of the best U2 albums ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"helter skelter.....","review":"U2 don't deserve to be allowed to cover that awesome song.

Any hard core U2 fan should buy all of their albums as they all have something unique to offer. This album, however, is one of the weaker works. It is worth it mostly for the live versions of previous U2 songs. The album is compleatly disjointed and contains some songs that I just cant help but skip. If you are new to U2 go buy Auchtung Baby, War, The Joshua Tree and the rest of their albums first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"It would have been better to release an EP with the B-sides, and then release a live album.

The Beatles and the Stones did it with their music and U2 does the exact same thing.To those who say it's pompous and overblown, they just didn't get it. So for all those people, here's the message: Rhythm and Blues remains one of rock and roll's most fertile resources to take inspiration from and to plunder for material.The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was because the live \\"Exit\\", \\"In God's Country\\", \\"Bad\\" , \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\", \\"MLK\\", \\"With Or Without You\\" and \\"Running to Stand Still\\" all should have also been on the CD since they appeared in the film.

Coupled with the documentary of their \`discovery\` of America, this is a long underrated album which warrants a few plays before the full effect can be appreciated. Incorporating a myriad of styles, from the passion of #1 single \`Desire\` to the sometime melancholy of \`Van Diemen\`s Land\`, through to the power of \`Pride (In The Name Of Love), Rattle and Hum constitutes a showcase for the band\`s flexibility and range. Not so much a coherent whole, as The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby represent; more a pick and mix of American music styles, as always impeccably interpreted by U2, who have since proven themselves (with the celebrated Popmart tour) to be one of the most versatile and exciting acts of contemporary music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some great stuff, some not so great","review":"This is their most uneven work.

Because it is supposed to be a kitchen island, this cheap side is always visible.In our case, the back side plywood did not fill the space leaving an opening. A replacement is being shipped to us.

The most frightening part is his lack of disclosure about similarly built systems of government that have failed miserably in the past. That's right, Stern's ideas are a prespcription for building socialist -- some may even say communist -- regimes. Trade unions at the forefront of progressive social and economic change? Hey, Eastern Europeans, how'd that work out for you? Should we give it a try here?

Track 6 Valerie is one of the reasons I snagged this disc. I don't remember any other version. I'm not a big fan of remixing but sometimes things can turn out better the 2nd or 3rd time.

When I say a compilation is disappointing, that means it's pretty bad, because I'm quite lenient and always try to find the good in compilations, but there is very little good to say about this one. SO many key songs are missing and it just seems inexcusable. There are too many songs missing to even list. Sure, there are a few of his good songs here, but many are second-rate, filler songs. The best song on here is \\"Higher Love\\", a few others aren't bad, but not that great and then some are just not his best at all.

Nonetheless Raymond Williams provides an interesting study of Cobbett's life and work. Cobbett according to Williams is not a systematic thinker who developed a series of ideas important to posterity. He is in the words of the book- jacket, \\" an extraordinary character, - soldier, journalist, farmer, political activist, man of the people\\"- whose principal concern was the material poverty of his time, the emergence of a rentier class , and how to radically transform society into being more fair and humane.This is an excellent sketch of a figure more important to local British history than to world culture as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Understandable, Even for Civil War Novices","review":"Stephen W. Sears, in Controveries and Commanders (Dispatches from the Army of the Potomac), has written a very readable account of the Army of the Potomac through ten specific examinations of controveries surrounding different leaders that cover the entire time span of the Civil War. He gives enough detail to bring the novice properly into the debate without bogging the narrative down. The author keeps the stories, combining to form a single tapestry, humming along. The theme that seems to connect all the various narratives is the idea of jeolousy, betryal, back-biting, and gossip that infected the top ranks of the Army and brought many commanders, whether rightly or wrongly. The human dimension of the leaders at war could not have been brought into clearer focus. It was often a little frightening but also made for very interesting reading.

The TSC-330 has a fairly natural sound but not quite as nice as the real fan sound of the Marpac 980 (the 980 uses a real fan to make the noise).Bottom line: If you don't need this for travel I would go with the Marpac 980 for it's more natural sound and lower price.

The only problem is that the adjustments are not real easy to make, but once you have found a setting you like you don't have to do it again - unless someone fiddles with it.It is smaller and lighter weight than our previous sounder, so we can more easily travel with it.My only complaint is that the on/off switch is a tiny button you push one way and that switch is hard to access. It is on the side, but I find I have to pick up the machine to work it.

I did better with ear plugs so I returned this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked until it shorted out","review":"This machine is small enough to travel well. It only makes one type of sound (kind of like rain) so all you can adjust is the intensity and volume. It shorted out and would stop and start which wakes you up defeating the purpose. It is too expensive for having no sound selections and being cheaply made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs as advertised","review":"Had high expectations for this product after reading other reviews and have been very pleased with the results. I travel a lot and like background noise to drown out the normal hotel noises and this product works great. Nothing fancy, but did not take nuch if any getting used to. Also use it to drown out my wifes snoring when we go on trips together. Works better and is smaller than hauling a fan around just for the sound.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was led to believe that this was a powerful machine. Yeah right! I even called every company selling this product and they all told me how great it was and how powerful it was. I need something strong because of the noise in my apartment building. The reviews on here were also great, so I took my chances. When I received it, I was terribly disappointed. It was no more powerful that the Marpac 980, which I also think is not nearly powerful enough for my situation. I hear people say that these machines are too loud. I can't understand how they come up with that. I returned the Marsona 330, and then I tried the Ecotones Duet---I am finally happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best White Noise Machine Ever","review":"Don't let the 1980's packaging fool you, this is an amazing little machine.

Attention parents!! One recent study in baby rats have shown a delay in auditory development of rats exposed to white noise.

Shut the cell phone off completely and the static will go away.

Overall it works pretty well, although I have to say that the many glowing reviews here led me to have high expectations that were not completely met. It does allow you to adjust the frequency (high = \\"rain,\\" low = \\"flood\\"), and whether you want it to be continuous, or \\"wave,\\" although with the latter you can't, as far as I could tell, change the speed of the waves. I think it sounds a little more artificial and grainy than I'd hoped, but it still seems to result in a pretty good sleep, so overall I would say it still works pretty well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted less than 5 months","review":"We ordered this in January 2012 and by the end of May 2012, it was making an intermitent loud static sound, which would wake you up.

I don't hear any difference between noise from this machine and white noise from a radio even though it claims whatever sound (waves? winds?) it is. I am pushing my husband to return the thing.

This new one is not satisfactory because it isn't loud enough. It only has three sounds--surf, waterfall, and rainfall. The sound on the \\"surf\\" setting almost disappears as the surf ebbs. The loudest setting is for the rainfall. But at the loudest, the rainfall sound is too highly pitched, and almost hurts your ears. I would recommend you try something else if you really need a loud white noise to cover sounds at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"The emphasis should be on \\"white noise\\"","review":"Although this product claims to have rain and wave sounds, the only sound it makes (in different volumes and pitches) is static. It's about as pleasant as falling asleep with the tv untuned, which used to be possible back in the days before cable. That's not to say that this is a bad product, and certainly it's possible people enjoy listening to static before they fall asleep, but I do not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product Marpac TSC 330","review":"My son had a Marpac product that does white noise only. It worked just great and blocked out a lot of background noise. I thought it would work to block out snoring. It worked just fine and made it possible to stand the noise. I ordered the 330 because it offered some other things beside just white noise. The surf sound is the one my wife and I like the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"sound machine","review":"The machine works. It makes a masking sound that shuts out ambient noise.

Wallace has taken Hegel scholarship another step forward by providing his keen insights in the aptly named book Hegel's Philosophy of Reality, Freedom and God. The first few chapters provide a good introduction to the subject that even a novice can appreciate, while the more difficult chapters will repay rereading and comparison with Hegel's own texts. Wallace shows the continuities with Kant, the Aristotelian elements, and explains the nature of Hegel's criticism of Kant in a most illuminating way. Wallace takes a view of Hegel that allows us to understand Hegel independently of the philosophical committments that other commentators often impose on him. There are so many books on Hegel, it is difficult to know what is of real value, but it is certain that Wallace stands at the very pinnacle of current Hegel studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"Please cancel this order!

Well i haven't had any experience with the one from sony or mad catz or whatever else there is so i can't be certain it's monster's quality materials that make this such a good investment. however the sony and mad catz look cheap, no monster product ever does. maybe that's why they charge so dam much.i'm happy with it, i'd be even happier if i coulda got it for less"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you a sucker with too much money?","review":"Then this product is for you! Otherwise, there is NO justifiable reason to pay even Amazon.com's marked-down price for this product. There is NO appreciable difference in video quality when using Monster component video cables; in fact, I've experienced the opposite.

Save your money; buy a cheaper cable that will actually WORK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible cables","review":"Normally in a review about a cable I would mention something about picture quality and sound. However, these cables never even got me that far. The cable fit nice and smooth into the back of my ps2. The problem was trying to get the inputs the back of the tv. Simply stated, they were not the right size. I tried shoving the first 2 into the component inputs and with great force they somewhat wiggled in. I started on my 3rd and then decided to stop because it wasn't worth the risk of breaking my tv. How a company like Monster can make a set of cables that do not correctly fit into a standard sized input is ridiculous. Do not buy these cables. Obviously some people have gotten them to work, but I read about two other people having this problem, and some people having a problem on the other end of the cord where the plug goes into the ps2. It is just not worth it.

They have no mechanism for them to hold onto and the slightest nudge pushes them out of place.Possibly because of that, they don't even transmit a signal. No video, no audio. This is inexcusable especially after you drop 50 bones on a pair of cables that don't even fit securely. My PS2 is rather old, considering I've had it since launch, although this should be no reason for cables not to work. Either I have a bum copy, or Monster cable needs to make sure their cables fit properly. One other problem, the cables make almost no sense in their color coding, it took me the better part of an hour to figure out which goes into which. Is it not possible to just have the cables a different color band, such as the Xbox 360 standard cables?These minor things and the fact that I get no signal make me furious for even wasting my time with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS!!! it didnt work right out of the packaging.

I thought this looked like just what I needed and the quality looked great. I hooked up the cable and as the other reviews state, the the plugs are extremely tight and very hard to get on the the tv jacks. Once I did get everything hooked up, the cable did not work properly. The signal for the sound worked fine but the video signal did not work at all. I tried reconnecting several times to no avail. Ended up returning the product. I wish I had read what others had said before ordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money.","review":"As many others have pointed out, the connectors on these cables are WAY TOO TIGHT. They are so tight in fact, that they will actually BREAK YOUR TV'S COMPONENT INPUTS. This is not a joke, not an exaggeration, not some crazy conspiracy, but is actual fact. I can not believe Monster let their \\"turbine connector\\" design out of R&D and into the real world, when it is so blatantly impossibly overly compressive. I had to use needle nose pliers to spread the connectors wide enough to fit. And finally, when I did get the darn things on the TV, the component video \\"quality\\" provided by these cables wasn't even better than the original s-video picture! This whole situation was a nightmare from beginning to end. Just please, don't waste your money or your time, or risk damaging your TV.

Needless to say, the country music establishment was even less receptive to new ideas in the late 60's than it is now.Now, taking a moment to split hairs regarding the song lineup here: in a perfect world, you would have the Byrds version of \\"Lazy Day\\", the Burritos' \\"Further Along\\" and either \\"Break My Mind\\" or \\"Six Days on the Road\\", and maybe \\"Cash on the Barrelhead\\" from Grievous Angel...

If you aren't familiar with Gram Parsons, you are advised to check him out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking","review":"Every now and then a musician comes onto the scene and changes everything. Gram Parsons was one of those musicians. He was critically acclaimed from 1966 to his untimely death in 1973, the but impact of his music is still being felt today. If you enjoy the music of Neil Young, the country-tinged tunes of the Rolling Stones, Uncle Tupelo, Wilco, Sun Volt, the Jayhawks and Whiskeytown, then you should own this anthology. Rhino does a great job of capturing a representative view of Parsons' music throughout his career with the International Submarine Band, the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Bros., and his solo career. The accompanying liner notes (a small book really) does a great job of introducing one of the 20th Century's greatest musicians to those who may be hearing his music for the first time. And as usual, the sound quality of the Rhino discs is outstanding.

From out of nowhere she hit the music scene with this album and stayed there ever since, much to my pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and Emotional","review":"I remember the first time I heard Melissa on the radio here in L.A., J.J. Jackson on the for EDGE saiud that he was about to play an artist that was going to be big. The song was Brin Me Some Water. I was hooked to say the least. The album is a very promising debut by a great live performer and a person who sings from the heart. What Melissa has going for her is that she knows how to connect with the lister on songs like Like the Way I do and Occasionally. If you are going to buy a Melissa album for the first time, I would not start here. It may be a little raw for an introduction. I would first reccommend Yes I Am or Brave and Crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Angst","review":"I think this is some of Mellisa Etheridge's best work, and yes, I have them all. Her angst filled songs and musical abilities team up for a rare look at how some women really feel at some point in their life. Anyone who has at one point or another been down about a relationship will appreciate all of the qualities that are contained in this collection of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not at her best, but that's hard to beat.","review":"Here is what one ignorant listener had to say about 1,000 Oceans: \\"Is it just me or wasn't this like a really popular country song like 10 years ago? And, yes, I'm half serious. . .1000 oceans has been done about 1000 times...\\" Where does this come from. Tori is a true artist, and she is to say the least original. I would say unique. Its a great song so give it a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"make me a day...","review":"As much as I love 1,000 Oceans, I think the real gem of this single is the b-side, Baker Baker (live).

Lasers are flimsy and have a very limited range of motion for aiming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Fast Egineering","review":"It shouldn't have been much of a challenge to engineer enough spread of the two LED's to fuction with two cars side by side in the garage. Maybe if I had a 20' ceiling it would work, assuming the LED's were bright enough. I haven't tried turning the unit 90 degrees yet, but that seems like a probable solution. If I had read the reivews I probably wouldn't have bought it. Besides, my wife doesn't pay any attention to it anyway. I think I can attach a taser to it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"ordered 2 units and both are defective","review":"The title almost says it all. I ordered quantity 2 of the \\"dual garage laser parking system\\". They arrived within a few days which was great. I plugged them in to test and they seemed to work fine. I proceeded to attach them to my ceiling and the 2nd beam on both units quit working within the first hour of usage. Simply put - this product is a great idea and represents shoddy workmanship at its worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious design flaw....be ready to \\"rig\\" this","review":"Something so simple really screws this item. Unless you have an abnormally high ceilings in your garage which most people do not, you will not be able to point (aim) the 2 lasers at your cars because they will not spread wide enough. A ridiculous flaw. I had to use a sharp blade to cut the plastic \\"rim\\" that restricts the motion of each arm. Tricky b/c of you are cutting plastic in a small awkward area. Yes, I cut my finger. You\\"ll know what I mean when you see it. Good luck.Other than this, once you can use it, it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"parking light","review":"I purchased this item to keep me from hitting the front end of the car, but it does not work well at all in any type of light. At night, it works good still not great but at least you can get parked. The beam needs to be stronger and larger. One side turns off prior to the other side.I would not reccommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money- junk!","review":"Out of the package, the unit appeared very cheap. Very little adjustment for the laser arms, particularly for my 2-car garage. The wires connecting the lasers to the circuit board fell off and one laser didn't work. Not worth the cost of shipping it back to Amazon. From the package to the trash can - what a deal!!! I could have spent the purchase price on a tennis ball and a string and it would have been more substantial!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Item is JUNK!!","review":"The laser stopped working a few minutes after it was installed. The first laser became very dim right away and the other did the same after several minutes. Don't waste your money or time. I requested an RMA the same day I received it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality...Horrible Product","review":"This was a defective product from the first day. When I first turned it on, everything worked great. Less than ten minutes later, it was useless. One of the laser wouldn't turn on and then it began to turn on intermittently. The other laser was really bright at first and then was so dim I couldn't see it on my car anymore. I tried using both the battery and I tried plugging it in. Both power options produced the same result. It seems like a great concept, but this is a horrible, cheaply built product. Spend a little more money and get a product that works for more than ten minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not flexible enough","review":"This unit is a two-car unit but, when placed above and in front of the dashboard area of the cars, the laser lights don't pivot far enough to reach the center dashboard area of both cars. This comprises the ability to see the laser beam easily. Otherwise, it works as stated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well once setup","review":"After reading most of the reviews for this and similar devices, I was concerned that the two lasers would not be able to reach both of my cars, despite my tall ceiling. I have a single-door, 2-car garage with 11-foot ceilings. At that height, I had no trouble positioning the lasers wide enough; however, I can see how lower ceilings may be problematic.Another note: the plastic housing is flimsy and can break easily -- I snapped one of the plastic arms while initially positioning the lasers. I was able to fix it with superglue, but be very gentle while moving the lasers.Now that it's all setup, it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"One side of the lazer pointer failed in the first use/setup.I took it down and threw it away!Maybe I got a unit that was bad -- well that's why I threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 car laser parking system review","review":"Dont waste your money on this.

The cord was to short and the laser wasn't bright enough to see in the car. I was very suprised being that I purchased a similar product from a different company and it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dim to be usefull","review":"Before installing I plugged it in to test and noticed that 1 laser was dimmer than the other. To see how effective it would be I temporarily installed it using tape. Even the brighter beam was barely visible on the dash and it was a cloudy day.BTW, the review web page thinks this is a toy and asks the following:How much fun is this toy?How would you rate this toy's educational value?How durable is this toy?How do you rate this toy overall?I think they have it right. The product is a toy with no useful purpose. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"This is my second time buying this item.It worked for the first five minutes then it turned off.I would not wast my money.Look for a different brand.I do not even know if I can return it or even how to return it and get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted $10.......","review":"Products 'works' but poorly. Lasers are very dim even with garage lights completely off.The method behind this device seemed well enough, but practical use was inefficient at best.Maybe its because the laser is so dim, but I found myself moving and moving and adjusting the car to get the laser where I set it on the car. I thought I might follow the laser up the hood and to the spot I set it, but not so much. You simply cannot see it and once I did, I had to adjust and readjust to get it on target.Just a waste and I'll now go to using the wheel stops on the floor as I dont want balls hanging from the ceiling.And to comment on what others have said about adjustability. The lasers do have limited adjustability. I barely got them adjusted to most inward sides of the cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit failed within 2 weeks","review":"Out of the box one laser was about 4x brighter then the other, bright enough to actually use. Since I was only using half my garage for parking at the time I ignored the useless side and continued to use the product. Within 10 days later that one bright one went as dim as the other, which made it impossible in anything other then a pitch black garage, to see (pointer hits the car about 6ft away from base).Disappointed, couldn't expect much I guess out of a 5$ unit, but I was hoping to be one of the lucky ones it seems to work for.. There is no manufacturer warranty on it, and I'm 3 days outside of my Amazon guarantee.If you want to gamble with this when it's on sale give it a shot. Otherwise for 15-20$ you can have a more reliable (per reviews) one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Great product, easy install. I have 2 of these in our 3 card garage and it has kept my wife from hitting any of the walls. Motion sensor works every time and it's just a good product. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled me twice...","review":"I first bought the Maxsa version of this device (virtually identical to the Sierra, clearly the same manufacturer). All was well at first, both lights nice and bright. But after only two weeks, one of the laser lights went dim. It still comes on, but not nearly bright enough to be of use. Since we liked the system during the short time it worked, we decided to roll the dice again, hoping for a better outcome with the Sierra version. Guess what, the EXACT same thing happened (one light on, but too dim to be of use), but this time time it happened DURING THE INITIAL AIMING PROCESS! So, I now have two of these things installed in my garage, each of them with only half of it working.This version has an additional problem, BTW-- it doesn't come on until too late, and doesn't stay on long enough. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"limitations","review":"Be careful if you have a wide garage. I mounted the unit in the center of my garage. I wasn't able to spread the laser wide enough apart to accomodate two cars. I ended up breaking off one of the lasers in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cars need to be parked too close for laser beams to hit both","review":"Limited pivot range on lasers is a major drawback. Even when mounting the unit mid-point between both cars it was unable to reach both dashboards. And my vehicles are parked at a normal distance (if you fully open door of either vechicle there's about 6-12\\" space to the other).I had to return the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre product","review":"This product is in the lower price range of laser parking assist systems. You get what you pay for. It has an easy mount using three screws and a plate that the unit mounts onto. All three screws stripped when screwing them into a wood stud in my garage. Had to use my own wood screws. The two lasers have a very limited range of motion. I was unable to point either of them exactly where I wanted. I had to mount the unit so that one of the lasers would aim exacty where I wanted, and then for my other car I had to make the best of where it would point. Sideways motion is very limited. The sensor turns off to quickly when the cars are close to the unit. If I was to purchase again I would consider one of the other laser systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Long Strange Trip Continues...","review":"This 2-disc set is a great sampling of Furthur Fest '98. I was fortunate enough to have attended several shows on that tour, including quite a few from the songs on this album. Very highly recommended. Hornsby sounds incredible as always. Phil drops the bombs and brings me right back into the old Phil Zone. And as for Bobby... well, lets just say he's back to his usual tricks, short shorts and snake shirts. A must for any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was always about the music","review":"the beauty of the grateful dead was that first and foremost is was always about the music. They suffered a huge loss in 1995 with the death of Jerry Garcia, their emotional leader, but they have reformed to produce an excellent album with some of their friends (Hornsby, Molo, and Ellis to name a few).

Mr. Bowden wants to make the best man a stand-up comic, which few people can successfully pull off. Moreover, the suggested jabs at the groom and sexual innuendo are entirely inappropriate at most weddings where older relatives are present. The three model speeches at the back of the book will make you cringe. Probably not a bad book if you have that famous English wit and will be giving the speech in the UK.

If graphics are important to you too, then don't even think about playing this game without first downloading the demo.

The standard response was the video driver was not correct even though it is the one they recommend. As of now I am still not able to get the program to run well.

Didn't think so, but they are right by my house and I can flight out of them! Hwo cool is that? some graphics are a bit sketchy but the focus of the game isn't that. Plus you can create ground objects. Now you can fly into your house. Mars, you can fly there to. The game alows you to create airplanes of your design, you want a liquid rocket fuel jet engine on you 747, now you can! You create it and the game tells you how it would fly.

There's no better Arabella in the last 10 or 15 years than Kiri Te Kanawa.You can see it on video with a superb cast in a super production.

My only disappointment is that some parts of the play have been left out, and new parts added. This was due, likely, to an attempt to \\"open up\\" the play by showing locations outside of the Youngers' apartment where the entire stage play is set. However, there is one change that bothered me--the part about Benetha's hair, which is often cited by scholars as a major symbol in the play, is completely left out of this production. Despite this change, though, this is well done and worth a look, as the actors really bring the characters to life.

I don't want to put people in boxes, but in this case Puffy should stick to rapping and leave acting for the professionals. It's a movie about segregation, prejudice, love, unity, and squandering money. I noticed a Nigerian actor. It made me glad because the character he was teaching his language (yoruba) connected to us.

I thought this version might better hold my students attention since it is in color and stars Sean Combs. While the three women do a great job, Sean Combs seems sedated in his role as Walter. He just doesn't have that powder keg ready to explode energy that Sidney Poitier brought to the role. Also for teaching purposes, I would highly recommend showing the Sidney Poitier version.

Mary McCarthy writes a piece of sudsy melodrama--far more reminiscent of a Jaqueline Susaan novel than an elegant comedy of manners.It's a slightly elevated pot boiler, pure and simple. One step up from \\"Peyton Place\\" and \\"The Best of Everything\\"---and that's largely because it revolves around Vassar grads and has a few $10 words tossed in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"While some of the reviews for this book create a tremendous level of intrigue, the book itself falls flat. McCarthy's writing style is just not enough to sustain any interest for the characters or plots surrounding their lives. There was no desire to learn what happened to these women; the only reason I kept reading was for a book club.I would say that the only interesting thing about this novel (and the reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1) is that it gives the reader great insight into life as it was of the '30s to '50s. Not having been born during those periods, that was very interesting to experience. However, the social analysis is not enough to keep the book alive.I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow...","review":"This book did not hold my interest.

But when hostile alien monsters attack, only the children survive. Now, they must rebuild their homes without adult guidance, survive harsh conditions - and years later, fight for their right to remain on the planet they now consider home. While this was a short book, it was a quick, exciting read. I could see how much these kids cared for their home and how they thought of each other as one big family and helped each other out. Kudos to the author for a story that is both exciting and heartwarming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas quiet time CD","review":"One of my favorite things to do around Christmas is to pop in a quiet Christmas Cd and drive around after dark looking at Christmas lights on lawns.

Such a sweet, tone, but also she can swing out when the need arises. Usually when a country singer sings \\"Oh, Holy Night\\" you hear a bit of strain when the high notes come into play. They either belt them out loud, or use a falsetto. Not Suzi. Her timbre in the same throughout the song. Expression is there when needed. Be it traditional Christmas carols, bluegrass, Texas swing, jazz standards, country, this gal has got the \\"X\\" on it. They just ain't that many voices around that can cover all those musical genres and do them justice. The last person I heard who could do that was the late, great, Patsy Cline.

After I managed to download the driver from the website, it would not recognize my calculator. I complained to Texas Instruments and got no response for help. After checking Google and using at least 10 different troubleshooting techniques, I finally discovered that most NEED A PATCH TO RUN FROM WINDOWS VISTA. After installing the patch, you need to reboot.

Contrary to what it says on Amazon, this unit is included with a brand new TI-89 Titanium calculator. The Graphlink has performed completely as advertised by TI and is of very high quality (it looks to me like it is quite durable and will last a long time if treated with care).

Unfortunately, TI's overt reluctance to include the TI-86 in their initial release of the TI Connect software extends well into this product.This cable arrived new in the package and was little more than a $20.00 hassle. 86 owners beware, YMMV with this one. The TI Connect software and TiLP softwares have a really big compatibility issue with the SilverLink and TI-86. The best solution to this dilemma is to buy a TI-89. I think its low of Texas Instruments to leave no other viable option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I'm a physics student and have been using my TI-83 a lot lately.

U2 has made better music, and October is definitely NOT even near their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lost love","review":"Like many others of my age, this was the album that made me a U2 fan. I was a highschool student when this album first came out and I remember thinking that this was some of the most emotionally charged, meaningful, and beautiful music I had heard in years. The album is unpretentious yet adacious, beautiful yet blaring, spiritual yet grounded. At this point in their careers the boys of U2 seemingly were unaware of their genius, and this is an element that helps this work to be so appealing. While I'm a huge fan of Brian Eno, and feel he was a perfect producer to help U2 soar to their highest heights, the production here helps to make the album feel \\"human,\\" with the soaring, shining elements coming directly from the instruments and vocals themselves, as apposed to knob-tweeking at the control panel.I've unfortunately lost interest in this once great band. The last album I bought was Achtung Baby (a nice album), but nothing since then has felt like the band I fell in love with in 1981."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overlooked If Not Forgotten Album","review":"Why this album doesn't get more air play is beyond me. True, there are some songs on this album that are kinda flat (e.g., \\"I Threw a Brick\\" and \\"Rejoice\\") but the rest of the material on this album is dynamic, haunting and timeless. \\"Gloria\\" is a great AOR song that sounds just as good today as it did when this album was released in '81. \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" \\"I Fall Down\\" and \\"Tomorrow\\" are haunting pieces that never leave you. Although I like the studio version of \\"October\\" on this album, I think the band's version of this song on the \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\" video is even better. Despite a few weak spots here and there, I'd still have to say that this is a great album that is worthy of your time and attention. Buy it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated album...","review":"This CD is raw, in-your-face U2. Also Bono's voice is at its peak. I love it. If you enjoyed the unforgettable fire and war you'll love this album for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stirring","review":"I can recall my first listen of this \\"album\\" and being stilled by Bono's emotion and outpouring of youthful anguish. What helped make this album more awesome was the fact that the lyrics for the October album were stolen while touring America in support of Boy. Though not as forceful as Boy, the standout songs- Gloria, Tomorrow, Brick, October (the lead into News Years Day live is just heart stopping). This is an incredibly personal album, and for that reason alone it is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Forgotten Album","review":"A lot has been written about this album, some good, some bad. This album (by U2 standards)is mediocre. Bono says himself that if they were starting out today and they released this as a second album, they would be dropped by the record label. A few highlights here like 'Fire','Gloria' and maybe at a push 'October', but other than that, nothing to write home about. Steve Lillywhite's production is raw and uneventful and the recording was 'rushed'. It is true that Bono's lyrics were stolen prior to recording which put added pressure on the limited resources that they had at the time. One to complete the collection but will probably not hit the CD-player too often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Religious anthems dominate \\"October\\".","review":"First let me say that I am an atheist. And I love this album.Usually religious songs get on my nerves. I immediately think, \\"Propagandists!\\" or something to that extent. But not on this album. Maybe it's just because I'm a huge U2 fan and I can see past the religious themes for their sake. But I have a feeling that's not it. This CD is truly a great work.Gloria is the opening track and one of my favourites on the CD and from U2 over all. I just love hearing The Edge on this track, as well as Larry Mullen's drums towards the end. I always sing along. Plus, there's Latin in it. :)skipping skip skip.Tomorrow, the 6th track, is my favourite on this CD. The melody is haunting, the lyrics are haunting (mentions of Bono's deceased mother are prominant) and the over all feel makes you want to run under the covers.October, the title track, is an 8-line, two-minute-or-so song which is among my favourites on this CD as well. The piano adds a beautiful touch as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of U2's best!","review":"I just bought this CD today!

With U2, you kind of need to listen to their catalog in chronological order so that you get the chance to grow and experience their music through the years. \\"October\\" is no exception. Once you've bought and listened to \\"Boy\\", go get this. There are some hidden gems here. \\"Gloria\\" is the obvious and well-known cut here, but lesser-known songs like \\"I Fall Down\\", \\"I Threw a Brick\\", \\"Fire\\", \\"Tomorrow\\", and \\"October\\" are equally as gripping in their own way. This is a strong second showing by a great band and one that should not be skipped over. After this, go get \\"War\\" and \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"The band originally had the intention to name this album \\"Scarlet\\", however the release date was in october of 1981, so the boys decided for a new name.A couple of weeks before the begining of the recording sessions, after a gig, the band knew a few girls and after some kind of party this girls stole Bono's briefcase, in this Bono kept 300 dollars and all the lyrics for a new album. Bono only had two weeks to try to remember the lyrics that he wrote before.I think that some lyrics are pretty simple or maybe abstracts (Fire, October, Scarlet, I threw a brick), but Bono did a good job in Gloria and With a shout, two greit songs with a catholic message.Excellent music in all tracks anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"The awakening of innocence","review":"I first heard this LP (as they were then!) as a 17 year old in 1981. I've lived the same length of a lifetime since then, but despite being older and a good deal more cynical, I can still never fail to be moved by \\"October\\". I think I was looking for the same things they were looking for, or so I thought at 17. I can still hear both anguish and innocence in songs like \\"Tomorrow\\", \\"I fall down\\", \\"October\\" and \\"Stranger in a strange land\\", and i gently laugh at myself, as the songs bring back memories of how callow and inexperienced with life I was. The 90's U2 is a splendid artistic machine, now that they've left the Joshua Tree pomposity behind. \\"October\\" is a picture of how the early 80's U2 were looking for clues in directions that no other bands were going in at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album from early U2","review":"U2 / October: Apparently making up the lyrics in the studio (or so the legend says) it is not the lyrics that seem underdeveloped but the performances themselves.

Most of the stories were too abstract for me; stories not having a clear story line and some seeming to ramble on without much intent nor a conclusion.The editor must have found stories like these of interest to place so many together in one book.Other very short story book selections I've enjoyed are:1) \\"The World's Shortest Stories of Love and Death: Passion, Betrayal, Suspicion, Revenge, All This and More in a New Collection of Amazing Short Stories-Each One Just 55 Words Long\\" edited by Steve Moss;2) a second 55-word story book edited by Steve Moss;3)\\"Flash Fiction: Very Short Stories\\" longer than the Micro Fictions selections, but less abstract4) Many of the Barnes and Noble short story book selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fine text for the intro creative writing classroom","review":"Since I'm required to teach both poetry and fiction in my university intro class, this book provided a very logical bridge between the two genres and gave students excellent examples of how to sharpen their perception and language to fit a very small space. We've also enjoyed the variety of voices in this dynamite little text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good stories, Not a great Collection","review":"There are some good things as well as some bad things about Micro Fiction. The good thing about this book is that it has variation in the texture and tone of the stories. My favorite would have to be Morning News which was written by the author himself. Also the author has managed to touch on many different subject matters. However the bad news is that many of the stories in the book are not very well written, some of it is formula fiction and I had trouble understanding the meaning behind a couple of them. The upside is that the book costs less than $20"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many stories that didn't make sense...","review":"I am a fan of micro-fiction, which, when it's written well, allows the reader to think about what he or she has read due to the cleverness and possibly the twist at the end. With that said, short stories (be they short films or literary short stories) are tough to write. Many stories that were chosen for this particular compilation don't make sense, or are very abstract, don't have a definitive beginning, middle, end, or characters a reader should care about. I was personally asking, \\"And...?\\" or \\"What was the point?\\"Stories shouldn't do that.A few that did catch my attention, and felt \\"done\\" were:*Chickens by Elaine Magarrel(Chickens attempt to turn the hands of fate)*A Gentleman's C by Padget Powell(A college instructor who finds his aged father a student in his class gets revenge, but regrets it)The story by Powell doesn't have a beginning, middle, and end (or at least a begining and end, sans middle)...but it does comes off as an interesting \\"anecdote.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Really Short Stories\\" makes for a really quick read","review":"This anthology has a lot of really useful pieces of micro fiction/flash fiction/short short stories that really help understand the diverse dynamics to writing in this genre. It's a small book which makes it a nice addition an already heavy backpack, a quick and easy read which is great to balance out the other requirements for a degree in English, and a lot of the stories are really fun to read.

The Lawheads were trying too hard to make Hunter into a hard-nosed agent and were explaining too much. Like when someone mentioned a terrorist organization they belonged too, they made it a point that Hunter filed that away in his mind so he'd remember it. Well, no duh he would! Also, there is really only one plot line - the one described above. There are no subplots at all! So, basically, it's like a comic book, but with no pictures.And the names were sometimes groaners - instead of John the Baptist, it's \\"Washer John\\"; \\"Pilate\\" is the last name of the governor of New York; instead of Mary Magdalene it's \\"Maggie\\"; and Nicodemus is shortened to Nick.

This book is not alternate history, it is made up history.

Of course it fails miserably, I was first introduced to this holy acid trip when my lady's mother decided \\"hey Josh is a comic book fan, and an agnostic, this book will make him LOOOOOVE JASUS!\\"Wrong this book its graphic novels and all other writing by this moron belong on a bonfire, preferably soon and with himself and his co-writer as fuel."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars at all for this tripe","review":"This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever tried to read. The writing is pedantic at best. Frankly, I couldn't finish this piece of crap. The cover blurbs made it sound interesting, so I decided to try it. Wrong move on my part. There are too many well-written books around to waste your time with this thing.I didn't know it was supposed to be a \\"christian\\" book until I read the reviews here. I couldn't force myself to read enough of it to find any christian propaganda. I can't believe any reviewer here can honestly think this is good writing.

I really loved that album so I bought this one. I realized when I bought it that it used a different vocalist, but I wasn't prepared for the annoying high pitch of his voice. I realize also that this person is, from what I have read, their original and most beloved voice. I experienced quite a bit of ear-shock at first, but it kind of grows on you after a while. Plus, I just can't ignore the awesome music which is what I tried to focus on during my initial listen. Overall, I am glad I gave it a chance. I have become accustomed to his voice now. I don't think that I didn't like his voice at first, so much as that it was just so far removed from what I was used to hearing from this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells Great","review":"Hard to find in stores, this colonge smells really good, not too over-powering but not girly either. The price is real good and my step-father loved it as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderous read.","review":"What a beautiful, wonderful read. I won't repeat the basic plot as other reviewers have done so. The writing style is most enjoyable and lyrical. The book is highly engaging. It is definitely not for children; perhaps older teenagers could handle it. It brings tears to your eyes not necessarily when David loses his mother early in the story but rather later when he recalls their time together, when he makes (and loses some) new friends, and when his own grown-up life happens and endures sad events along with the good ones.I have just a few minor complaints about the book. The WW2 angle is interesting but to me it didn't contribute much to the story other than restate the horror of that war. There are a few social viewpoints (homosexuality and communism) that to me stood out a bit as unnecessary. They may be of interest to other readers though.Overall, a wonderful book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot and ideas, awkward execution","review":"I give the author points for some good (moralistic) ideas.As another reviewer noted, once the action moves in the fantastic world the writing becomes awkward and forced. Characters are so one-dimensional that I could not see much difference between the woodsman and the horseman-knight.Contemporary readers may enjoy this book, but I doubt it will be remembered in years to come.Check \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\" by Stephen King instead. It may look similar but is a higher quality book of a different class altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting and imaginative read","review":"Somewhat along the same idea as Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next series; Connolly writes about the inside of the book/fairy tale world. With chapters about Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and more it was an interesting way to relive the stories that I grew up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't remember,,...","review":"the last time a novel made me weep at the end, but this one did. A wonderous, heartbreaking, funny, terrifying novel which creates a remarkable world where fairy tales are rewritten and nightmares lived out. The characters are compelling( The Woodsman, The Crooked Man, Roland, the heroic knight on a quest to rescue his soulmate, the Loup's created by the mating of the wolf and Red Riding Hood, who desperatly want to be control the world, the fat, drunken Snow White....), and the final pages so moving and so heartfelt that you truly feel changed at the journey's end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary, derivative, choppy","review":"It's C.S.

I did not however find the ongoing splatter and gore added anything special or extra to the story. I like Stephen King's books and they can be gorey, but this was a bit too far for me. The images of child mutilation just about made me yak and toss the book in the trash. If I hadn't wanted to finish the book for a book club meeting, I would have. Too grossly extensive violent imagry against children."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible!!!","review":"I love books with a little \\"darkness\\" and mystery, and I'm even drawn to gothic novels. This book started out great, but it just got too sick for me to handle. I have never thrown away a book...until now. When he started talking about little children being tortured and slaughtered I drew the line....someone had to! Not to mention the whole \\"women laying with wolves\\" thing! Sick! It is sad that he had to go too far, because it really had potential to be a great fantasy story! I would suggest NEVER reading this book or wasting money on it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sick nightmare","review":"I thought this would be another version of Inkheart- but it is far, far darker. You wonder what sort of sick mind the author must have. Child molestation, child murder, dismemberment, cannibalism, bestiality- this book has them all. Reading this is like having a prolonged drug-induced nightmare. Maybe some readers enjoy that- I don't. Definitely NOT a book to give to a kid- unless you really hate the kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing book - but why is the Kindle version $3 more than the paperback?","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I took it out when I went sunbathing and came back with the deepest burn I've ever had because I just had to finish the book! It is an amazing adventure into the imagination.But it's getting a 1 star because the paperback, something that takes up vital resources, employs more people for the production, maintenance and selling of the book, costs more than the Kindle version, something that cuts out a lot more people in the process. Most publishers these days want manuscripts and books emailed or in some digital media when it comes to the editor - it wouldn't take much more effort to reprogram it (something they already do for placing it on a physical media) to an e-book layout.This is ridiculous! Amazon, the publishers, who ever is raising the prices on e-books, this needs to stop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TRITE, TRIVIAL....BORING!","review":"This book is a rehash of what has been done many times before, and been done far better. The use of reworked fairly tales to explain growth and a child's travels to adulthood is an old concept, and sadly this book does not do it well. There is virtualy NO character development, and there are many characters we can't and don't care about. THE BOOK OF LOST THINGS should stay lost... it is TRITE, TRIVIAL, BORING and poorly written. Even the attempts at humor (those communistic dwarfs, for example) fall flat. Try something better, and don't waste your money on this one. I got it from our local library, and they can keep it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would get better, but it didn't","review":"The synopsis sounded interesting so I thought I'd give it a try. Immediately there was something about the book that put me off. I don't know if it was the writing style or what. It seemed too simplistic, almost dumbed down. I felt like I was reading a book written by a high schooler. But I'll read anything, so I gave it a chance. The story was somewhat decent but the execution was just too horrible to make it an enjoyable read. I didn't feel connected to the story or characters. Whenever a character died, I felt nothing. And beware: the author is preachy and homophobic. All I can say, I guess, is that if you still want to read it don't waste your money, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go back to Charlie Parker...please","review":"What is a \\"young adult\\" anyway? Either you're an adult or you're not.Oh, well---I, like many other readers, love John Connolly. I think it must be inconvenient that there's another writer with the same last name who is also very popular. But Michael C. can't hold a candle to John C. Charlie Parker is a fascinating, troubled, flawed and deeply intelligent guy. I even started listening to Ryan Adams and Pinetop Seven because of these books.But, like another talented writer, China Mieville, who left his New Corbuzon novels for the insipid Un Lun Dun (even the title is stupid), John Connolly couldn't resist writing a \\"young adult\\" novel. I don't know if it's the Harry Potter in these writers, but they need to get a clue. I found The Book of Lost Things to be a rip-off of The Lion, the Witch and Wardrobe and Harry Potter. This book is derivative and silly. Who cares? I didn't even like the kid. What a whiner!!!11 More Charlie Parker, Mr. Connolly. Please"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first John Connolly novel.","review":"This novel was recommended to me and I had never read any of John Connolly's books. I found it to be very intriguing look at fairy tales and their more grim side. This is definitely not the Disney version of the fairy tales. It was fun to think through all the characters in the book and how I've seen them portrayed before. It was difficult to put down and kept me interested throughout the entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lose yourself in this tale....","review":"John Connolly is a truly great writer. His novels--which include the Charlie Parker series--are all fascinating, gripping stories. He's a master story teller, and his thrillers pick up speed immediately and never let up.THE BOOK OF LOST THINGS is a little different from the Charlie Parker books, although just as good. LOST THINGS has a more classical structure: a young boy, grieving his late mother, finds himself pulled into a fantastic, fairy-tale world that is as menacing as it is exciting.Connolly employs many archetypal characters, but he makes them his own. Young David's ordeal makes a compelling read.If this is your first experience with Connolly, treat yourself to his other novels. If you like his Parker books but don't think this sounds appealing, give it a chance anyway. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only thing that saved it was the ending","review":"This was one of my friend's favorite books, loaned to me to read. So I had to finish it...otherwise I never would have. I normally have a hard time putting books down, but instead I had to push myself along. Very slow beginning, no great characters, not a particularly vivid world. Picks up a bit towards the end, but nothing grand. It wasn't until the last few pages of the book, that I was thoroughly impressed, and thought, ah...so that was the whole point of the book. A truly great ending, but wish it was more enjoyable getting there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive","review":"Will not purchase for Kindle at this price.

It started out okay, then kept getting worse and worse and worse, and then I kept reading to see if it would get better, and it didn't. Worst book I've ever read. An employee at Border's recommended it to me because I liked The Thirteenth Tale. I still can't look at that man the same when I go in Border's. What was he thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repugnant & Odious!","review":"Don't even THINK about allowing a child to read this - or even a teen lost in his own \\"goth\\" moment. Connolly has reached far into the earth and pulled up homosexuality, erotic thoughts, murder, gore - any evil thing possible to put a poll of black around the reader and then has the nerve to charge $16.00 for his own perversion. It's been said that if an irishman was a boomerang he wouldn't come home, he would just cry and whine and write stories about why he wanted to come home. This is what this melancholy, dark soul has done in this book. My advice to you is \\"don't read\\" and my advice to Connolly is \\"seek help immediately\\" --- what a distasteful, loathsome tome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Review","review":"I'm 28 years old, and I really enjoyed this story. It's a fairy tale loaded with action and gore. It's a nice change from the books I'm use to reading. I will definitely look for another book like this by John Connolly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I found this book to be a great read. It is fast paced, with unexpected twists. I do think it is for adults more than children, and has a powerful ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"I liked this story a lot. It was a bit predictable in that you could guess the very end, but that was OK with me because the middle was very good. A bit dark, but that's to be expected with the subject. More than that though, I enjoyed how the author broke it down in the back - stating why he chose the fairy tales that he did and why and how he changed them from the originals. Really interesting. There were a few stories that I had never heard of, and it was cool to read them there after seeing how they were used in the text. I had wondered about certain elements and it was nice not to have to go look them up separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird and Charming","review":"Yes, all right, this type of thing has been done before, but I still enjoyed it. Connolly puts an innovative spin on some of the old fairy tales, sometimes funny but mostly sinister in a new direction. What makes this book interesting is how thoroughly Connolly has captured the ambiance of classic fairy tales. Gruesome, awful, beautiful and affectionate details are related with a bleak distance that I recognize from the stories I read as a child. After becoming accustommed to the modern practice of viscerally engaging the reader from page one, it took some getting used to, and didn't leave me feeling as exhilirated or as devastated as I might have. Still, I cried at the end, and Connolly saved the maximum emotional impact for when everyone (including the reader) was safe at last. The ease with which he did it makes you realize how much he was holding back all the way. As with any good fairy tale, a lot of meaningful life lessons through a surreal filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun yet disappointing","review":"Connolly's book is fine if you consider it merely as a precursor to what would probably make a very watchable movie. However, when I picked it up, I was expecting more--good writing. His prose was often stiff, very predictable and trite. I almost laughed aloud when I read sentences along the lines of: 'And that was when David truly transitioned from boyhood to manhood.' HELLO?! What happened to the old-fashioned show, don't tell rule of writing?Overall, the book is just interesting enough to keep you reading, if only because not many people write books in this sub-sub genre I guess you could call Adult Revisionist Fairy Tale Stories. But overall I found the tone to be inconsistently presented, fluctuating between childish and incredibly sharp, found the plot to be a poor reworking of fairy tales that many have done better than Connolly, and found the whole book to be rather disappointing. Unmotivating character development.I'd wait for the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time John Connolly reader","review":"This is the first time I've read anything by John Connolly. I was searching around amazon and stumbled upon this book. I saw how great the reviews were and I couldn't agree more. Great story and great writing. I really enjoyed this book and would suggest it to anyone whos into the whole fairy tale genre. I admit that not only did I shed a tear or two but I was also scared at some points. Leave the light on and beware the CROOKED MAN haha. I'll definitely be reading more of Mr. Connolly's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dark for my taste","review":"I hadn't gathered from the reviews that this was going to be dark and slightly twisted. Not what I was in the market for at all. And though I won't spoil it there was an obvious element to the ending that was missing which left me confused. Anyone else who has read it probably knows what I'm talking about but the main point is that the story left me with a heavy feeling that took a couple weeks to shake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan's Labyrinth Meets Shrek","review":"I generally liked this book, but after reading the loads of \\"supplementary\\" material someone decided to shove in at the end, I have to say that I lost a great deal of respect for the author and his story. It was a bit like a magician who shows you all his tricks at the end; the magic dries up quick. But even before reading all the bad bits I think I liked Angela Carter better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intense dislike does not describe it","review":"Hated this book.

Often times this is what we all need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute trash","review":"I bought this book because it was recommended summer high school reading. If you like a combination of old fairy tales, comic book hero shenanigan- type activities, and gore this might appeal to you. I can't believe some high school English teachers thought this was a good read. I wish I hadn't spent the money. It's awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing find!","review":"I picked this up randomly - I remembered hearing about this book somewhere, sometime... And I was pleasantly surprised. From the moment I started the book, I was hooked. It reminded me a bit of the movie \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" - a fairy tale for adults. And don't expect the sugary sweet, happily-ever-after fairy tales. No, these are more like the original Grimm/Anderson fairy tales. Surprisingly, the author also tackles religion and homosexuality too in the book. The ending was so good too - very bittersweet. Highly highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick and mix wonder","review":"The writing here, as I've come to expect from Connolly is marvellous, magical even, as we follow a twelve year old boy's wondrous adventure through another world entirely.The only problem I found with it was I wasn't sure what audience it was aimed at. Quite simply, the writing and plotting is too deep and involved for a twelve or thirteen year old, though it works marvelously as an adult fairy tale. That's the only reason I didn't give it five stars.It's a bit like imagining 'The Never Ending story' combined with Grimm - but more the Grimm of today's TV adventure. In the end it's too dark for most young teens and they'd get lost with it, but a great adventure for those looking for all the darkness and plot-twists we've come to expect from Connolly with his Charlie Parker series, yet with a liberal sprinkling of goblins and fairies thrown in."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fairy tales your mamma didn't tell you!","review":"Book of Lost Things presents itself like the old fairy tales, where everything isn't always sunshine and roses.This book isn't really for children, even though it may look cute and cuddly on the outside. It actually has sharp fangs. And it bites. So beware. Don't think this is a Cinderalla story, because there a wolves and giant worms, and some very unlovely things in BOOK OF LOST THINGS.My first Connoly and I enjoyed LOST THINGS even as an adult. Think adults were the intended audience though. I went along with young David on a journey and had my heart stomped on a couple of times. It starts with death and heartbreak. And it does it get any better? I won't tell you.I would recommend you read this, but not to make yourself happy.You are free to go find this book and whimper and cry yourself to sleep now. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Loved the book. This is the first John Connolly book that I've picked up. I was not let down.Definitely was slow to start - but once I got wrapped up in the fantasy world that David winds up in, I couldn't put the book down. Very, very dark story but extraordinarily well done through and through.Would recommend to fans of Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams and the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read.","review":"A bit predictable towards the end, but nonetheless a fun read. I really enjoyed the book. Not sure if it's approrpiate for children though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of Lost Things","review":"I was delighted to come across The Book of Lost Things while browsing through the local bookstore. It is a character driven novel that revolves around a sad young boy and his magical and often terrifying quest for the Book of Lost Things. The Book of Lost Things outwardly appears to be a novel directed towards youngsters but it becomes clear early on that it is in fact a book that will appeal primarily to adults. Though the novel is based on fantasy, adults will sympathize with the struggles and hardships that the characters in the novel endure. I will definately be on the lookout for this wonderfully creative author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale about stories and the role they play in our lives...","review":"Once upon a time, there was a book called The Book of Lost Things. It was about a young boy named David and his journey through a world populated by creatures from the best and worst of human imagination. Sometimes wonderful things happened. Sometimes horrible things happened. But really, it was a story about stories and the role they play in our lives.After a few years of reading nothing but young adult and middle grade fiction (and not being too impressed), it was almost a relief to come across this \\"adult\\" book. I really enjoyed the journey the author took us on. Yes, some of the themes are mature. Yes, some of the descriptions are gory. But sometimes life is like that. I've actually read far worse in books intended for younger readers. And The Book of Lost Things was far better than most of those. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy stories or to those who appreciate the power of stories in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fairytale from the dark side","review":"An interesting concept of a boy who is confused and sad after his mothers death. When his father remarries and produces a new sibling for him he becomes overcome with jealousy and resentment which leads him to a hidden world of gruesome fairytales.I thought the beginning chapters were really good, a very realistic insight into a child's mind. However once we leave reality the book failed to grab me and it took me longer than normal to read purely because I wasn't compelled to keep picking it up. I didn't particularly like the book but did like the concept of David having to use his wits and his memory of childhood tales to overcome some pretty gruesome dangers and adult themes. And, like all traditional stories...it has a moral.If you like your fantasy tinged with horror then you should enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"of Fairy Tales and Fables","review":"This was my first book from Connolly. I was intrigued by the title and then a brief read of the plot made the sale. Connolly does a great job reaching back to stories from the past (think the brothers Grimm) and tying them together in a fresh, and slightly twisted, way that adults will enjoy. You will find yourself remembering stories you grew up reading and sometimes watching (disney films). The way he takes these stories and turns them more 'personal' for our lead character gives the feel that any of us could have had a similar journey.If you are looking for a laid back read that keeps things moving with adventure and a bit of humor, this is worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read!","review":"This was my first Connolly book, and I was very impressed. I LOVED getting \\"lost\\" in the world with David while he struggled with his fears and selfishness.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories that whisk them away to other lands, but also has a clear message in the end. Those who enjoyed any of the Narnia books or any fairy tales (like the Brothers Grimm stories) will like reading The Book of Lost Things as it pulls from many of those.Plus, it has a wonderful bonus section in the end explaining why he chose certain stories and you can read those fairy tales, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I kind of stumbled on John Connolly by accident. I was looking for books to read that were new to me and I had finished everything my friends had suggested. Amazon recommended this book and I am so glad they did. It was a great adventure story! It went smoothly from funny to scary to suspensful and never slowed the pace. I found myself reading lines and passages to my boyfriend because the language was stunning. I would recommend this book to anyone to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy it! It's a great escape!","review":"LOVE this book! Kind of in the same vein as Pan's Labyrinth (but better IMO). If you are a Brother's Grimm fan (or remember having those stories read to you as a child), this book will bring you back. Wonderful fantasy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the time.","review":"I was mesmerized by the rhythm of Mr. Connolly's prose instantaneously. The book is well constructed and masterfully done. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh..","review":"I was really interested by the story from the book descripton on the back, but now thay I have read it... it draged on quite a bit and it was too fantasy-ish. Almost like a wanna be Alice In Wonderland, but not good. I expected more from Connolly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen King wannabe","review":"I love fantasy books, remade fairy tales, and alternate universe stories. Many reviewers here comment on the fact that the alternate reality has been done before, and better, and I agree. I was most put off, though, by the similarities to Stephen King themes and characters, especially the Dark Tower series. Roland the knight, David (v.Jack) the boy, the dark tower, the wolves- all these seem copied from King, although not as entertaining or compelling. I gave up half-way through- I'd rather reread the Dark Tower (again). Also, the intro was way too long and tedious before the alternate world was entered."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Five Past Midnight...","review":"check out Thayer's 'The Stettin Secret'. I thought it was every bit as good as 'Midnight' and nearly as good as spy classics like the Key to Rebecca and The Eagle Has Landed. Thayer needs to write more WW2-era thrillers, I love his characters and the excellent attention to detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TERRIFIC READ! ONE OF THE BEST WAR THRILLERS!","review":"mr thayer simply is one of the best thriller writers you could ever find. the most talented also. never bored himself and us with stereotyped, formatted stories. the research before every novel was obviously painstakingly deep and wide and i really respect that. almost all of his novels are very difficult to put down once you started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thayer should not ruin himself like Jack Higgins","review":"Please compare this book to Thayer's THE PURSUIT, then you would find out that this new book was just a reverse of The Pursuit, only 1)the hero was changed from a German prinsor/assasin to a GI prisoner/assasin; 2)the background was changed from 40s' America to 40s Germany; 3)American widow was changed to a German window. WHAT'S GOING ON, Mr.Thayer? Your should not have drained your Muse so fast like Jack Higgins or Jeffrey Archer by using their central kitchen mass production menu to produce new books only by shuffling those characters with different names and nationality! Don't do this please"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Moving and Different","review":"A good change to the standard WWII thrillers. Great for reading on a plane, beach, or anything lesure related."},{"rating":"1","title":"These people are liars","review":"All Kinds Of Books are liars. They said this book was \\"well-stored, never-opened brand new FIRST EDITION, FIRST PRINTING in absoluet mint condition.\\" This book was worn out and clearly used. There was water damage on every page. DON'T BUY FROM THESE LIARS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most politically correct novel of WWII","review":"If there was a prize for the most politically correct novel of WWII, this book would win it hands down. Through out the book the main character wipes out all the bad guys (SS and Gestapo) while leaving the good guys (wehrmacht personnel, honest German policemen and German civilians) without a scratch. The farce reaches it's height when he gives a signed certificate to a German soldier attesting that he had been made to act under duress. Stick to Jack Higgins or AListair MacLean if you want fast paced WWII action"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is pretty weak","review":"Unfortunately I am rather disappointed with Beck's book. Her \\"secrets\\" seem rather elementary and vague. The actual \\"how-to\\" doesn't even start until page 152 and even then the only non-obvious piece of advice is to practice holding your pee! This book should be entitled \\"How to have sex from a woman with a huge ego.\\" While I think that some of her tecniques may prove to be useful and her ideas for a romantic evening are nice, the title of the book is simply an eye catcher and a gimic. The reader is forced to live vicariously through the author's sex life while taking quizzes that can also be found in Seventeen magazine. On a positive note, this book did get me thinking about how to be more romantic and intense, but I didn't expect reading a zillion pages on how to masturbate and how to get over fears of telling your partner to slow down or speed up. I say keep your $5.99 and put it towards something more useful...like condoms!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is a joke","review":"I don't understand this book at all. The auther is really nice and stuff, but she doens't help me have multiple organs. I only have one. I don't know why I bought this book. Musicians like me need better books than this to help them learn about the organ. I'm not sure why she wrote this. I hope she doesn't write any more books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Seemed like a great idea, combine it all in one. I needed a small portable trackball mouse with 3 buttons, the optical would have been a bonus, especially in the track ball.Sorry, if you need to use the middle mouse button (the ball doubles as middle button) a lot, especially by holding it down, then forget this mouse. In addition if you're using it in trackball mode the scroll functions are tranfered to the optics in the bottom and the slightest movement will shift your cursor off target. This problem is compounded by the stiff button action which means you have to grip the mouse firmly while pressing the buttons.Also the tiny trackball doesn't have much range, something that might have been solved by the drivers but I really needed something that could be moved to different computers without installing drivers all the time.End result, an essentially unusable mouse. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for younger kids","review":"We bought this for our 1 yr old and he loves it. It is very easy for him to control and it moves easily over carpet. My 3 1/2 yr old loves to play with it too. The great benefit for me is it is that the siren is not too loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for two hours","review":"This toy was great for my 3-year-old. The problem is that being a 3-year-old, he also wanted to push the firetruck. This wrecked the gears within two hours, and it no longer turns.

We were really excited about them having their first remote control toys. The toy looked awesome. They were durable, colorful,and easy to operate. We were happy until I remembered that the description stated that the toys were to make noise.They didn't make choo choo or siren sounds. The kids knew no better, but I was not happy with the quality of the toys. They ran a little rigid, but that could have been attributed to the fact that it was a train. They were BOTH huge disappointment. We have returned both toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame toy","review":"This has been a big disappointment. Only 1 wheel turns and it goes so slowly.

The 3- AAs were fine. The siren works. I've mutilated 2 9V batteries so far and tried a rubber mallet to get the thing in with no luck. I guess you can say it's well made, but the battery compartment is a shade too small lengthwise-it's bent the \\"-\\" side of 2 batteries. The metal was making contact, but the truck isn't moving. I guess I won't call it a total failure until I can figure out a way to get this battery in the controller in. I'm calling Kid Galaxy today, so I guess I can comment on customer service later. I got this from an Amazon 3rd party, so I'm thinking they won't be any help- given past experiences with some of them.Edit: Battery was old!

Tulsa and his buddies hope to make enogh money to open a small nightclub upon their return...G.I. Blues marks the debut of the new Elvis Presley. Fresh out of the army, gone were the sideburns the press had found so offensive, and gone was the flashy, hip attire. The look was more convervative.The changes in terms of image and film genre do not mean that G.I. Blues was an inferior film, which many Presley biographers have implied. It remains a well-crafted musical comedy with a number of solid songs and a strong female co-star. The only negative result is that Elvis would be discouraged from making other types of movies. This film is considered the prototype for future Presley films, which, unfortunately, declined in quality as the decade progressed.Produced for Paramount Pictures by Hal B. Wallis. Released November 23, 1960. Color."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELVIS","review":"If you are an Elvis fan you most likely have seen all the movies and that's why you're considering to buy this collection. The quality is good. No extras, just the movies. There are 2 movies per sleeve and they are all packed together nicely in the blue velvet outer box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis DVD","review":"The item shipment took a little longer than expected, but I'm sure the timing with the Christmas holiday was the reason. The Package cover,( where the titles of the movies are) is torn off under the plastic wrap. Made us wonder if it had been opened and then re-wrapped. Since this was a gift, I was a little dissappointed that the wrapper was damaged like that. Truthfully, my husband has not opened this gift yet, but I am sure (hopeful) that everything is fine with the DVDs.

I thought it would be as terrifying as the book. I was wrong. I do not think this would have been a bad movie had I not read the book, but since I did, I was very disappointed. A number of story lines and characters were left out. While the main plot was the same, none of the other details were. Skip the movie and read the book on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"Eventhough others have liked this movie, I have found it to be quite boring. The acting was okay, but the film itself was just displeasing to me.I thought it at least deserved two stars, because the movie kept me wondering what was going to happen next. It was a good thing I got this video at the library for free, other than paying $2.29 at my local video store.Max Von Sydow's role as Lucifer was weird. That's another reason I gave this movie two stars. I never thought that a man more powerful than the President would have listened to the people and leave their town. You would've at least figured he'd turn out to be some horrifying creature. But I guess when Stephen King wrote the book he wanted to add some realism to it.If you're going to rent this movie, it should be on a two-for-one night. Just so you know you haven't wasted your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needful Things.... edited","review":"I was really disapointed with this edited version of Needful Things.

First of all, many of the book's main characters are completely missing. Where's Ace Merrill? Replaced by a one minute extra character (the Treasure Island book guy.) The book is also much more suspensful and has a lot more dark humor buried in it. I didn't expect the film to be as elaborate as the book but this film just simply is a poor cinematic work all around in addition. Cheap. Incomplete. Bad effort. Read the book and watch something more worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"In the small town of Castle Rock,Maine a mysterious stranger opens a curio shop that seems to have something for everyone.Just one problem:The owner is actually the devil,and he only trades in souls.He turns the locals against each other,setting off a chain reaction of murder and mayhem that culminates in an explosive final between evil and the law.Viciously tongue in cheek.Rated R for strong violence and adult language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Best Steven King film brought to life.","review":"In my opinion, this is perhaps the second best adaptation of a Stephen King novel. The unfortunate tragdey of this DVD lies in the fact that it is Pan and scan format versus Widescreen. I returned me DVD when I discovered it was hacked up. Polygram, get a clue about this format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book, skip the movie.","review":"The movie was quit different from the book, but with that aside the movie still wasn't that good. The movie had a certain childish quality towards it. I also found it a bit slow especially the first half. The way people acted and thought were sometime unrealistic. Although this movie was made in 1990 or so, maybe it might have been more popular back then. I was dissapointed in it. Unfotuantely a lot of King's movies are far different from the book and a lot of the good stuff is missed. The only one that goes against this that I know of so far is the Green Mile. But if you're bored one day you might as well rent it if you can't find anything else, it is entertaining to an extent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yikes.","review":"A terrific movie. Max Von Sydow never fails to put on a top notch job and this is no exception. His portrayal of ... the devil? Is fun and creepy. Ed Harris is at his very best. The story quickly turns into a 'what next!' as you do not want to miss a second.It shows our own fears, our mistrust of even that which is not really different in our every day lives. Our secret desires and wants. Our greed.And all with a wink and a Boo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!!","review":"Stephen King once again delights with this movie. I loved it.

Also, there is no widescreen version that is produced. This is probably the best adaptation of a Stephen King book ever brought to film, but it has not yet been deemed profitable enough to put any effort into the produciton of the DVD. The movie itself is superb (for its genre), 3 and 1/2 stars easy. However, this is one of the most shoddily made DVDs that I have ever seen. It is simply not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've Been Better","review":"I admit I haven't read the book Needful Things, but this movie just seems like its missing something. It starts out well, with a look at small town life.The scene where Ed Harris, as the sheriff, and Max von Sydow as Leland Gaunt, the antique shop owner/Satan, meet and share some pie is almost sublime. But then the movie gets silly, with Ole Scratch turning the townspeople violently against each other by providing all the things they've ever wanted most. The acting is good, though Sydow really chews the scenery by the end. Overall, fair time killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needful Things","review":"A very intertaining movie about how the devil manipulates people and makes them go crazy for there own wants and needs.Very funny and truthful about people.About the time you think it couldn't get any worse your wrong.If you need a laugh and like some dry humor and funny humor this is it.One of my favorite movies and could be real life in alot of places of peoples lives.You watch movies to be intertained and this one will do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"need extened one","review":"i have to agreee we need to get the extended version. alot of key scenes have been cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely floral.","review":"This is my all time favorite perfume!

He may have made a lot of money but he does not say anything that has not been treated in the literature for the past 35 years. He shares with many others a poor understanding of what the notion of equilibrium is for or what it means. It is not a permanent quantitative solution to eternal simultaneous equations. In my view it is useful mainly for organizing thoughts and for answering comparative static questions...such as what happens to a stock price when George Soros plugs it...or what happens to prices when crops fail. The thought behind the book has litle to add we do not know from hog cycle models of the 50's. Financial markets are not the whole world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, but not for traders","review":"Soros always refers himself as a philosopher instead of a trader or a fund manager. His reference is fully reflected in this book, which presents mostly his view of the world (before and right after the 97 Asian Crisis) far beyond and away the market he earns his money and reputation from. Trading tips or philosophies are rare, but not good passages with bright ideas in socio-economics and politics. If one expects something like Alchemy of Finance or Soros on Soros (already a deviaton), he/she will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay no attention to the Freepers","review":"In case you don't know, \\"Freepers\\" are fans of a certain far-out-right-wing-nut website and they go on sites likes this and \\"freep\\" it by giving books one-star reviews.

I've learned a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"incredible trader, lousy economist","review":"George Soros is the best example that you do not have to know anything about economics to make a lot of money. Of course markets never achieve equilibrium! That is the nature of markets. But implying that \\"regulation\\" from bureaucrats will solve this \\"problem\\" is a long shot. Market \\"imperfections\\" are not the problem. Government intervention is the problem. Seems to me that Soros would rather deal with government officials instead of dealing with the market forces. Sure is a lot easier to make money controling the former instead of trying to control the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book, self-serving & convicted for insider trading","review":"This book is self-serving. One must look at some of the people Soros funds with his money including the Democratic Party and people involved in gun control/confiscation in the United States. If you think gun control is a good idea, check out what has happened to the crime rate after guns were banned in the UK.Anyway, Soros was convicted of insider trading in France in late 2002.

The story had no creativity, just ghetto events that anyone could write if they swung in the ghetto. If you are down for that then this book is for you!

Notice that the \\"recommended age\\" is 4. Perhaps a 4 y/o would have no problem with dangerous pieces, but s/he would also have no interest in such a simple toy. The realistic age of a kid's interest is 2.5 to 3.5 y/o. For that age, the toy is simply dangerous. Also, \\"educational\\" part is silly.

Wonderful gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toy purchase all year!","review":"I bought this for my son's 7th birthday and the whole family has had a blast building tons of creations.We started with the simple ones and have moved on to some of the harder ones. He was so excited when he built a radio by himself that really worked. The pieces fit easily back into their tray so no pieces get lost and they are all in sight when building. Diagrams and directions are very easy to follow. The only thing I would have added is a little more scientific reasoning behind why it all works the way it does. I would highly recommend this as an educational yet fun toy for kids. It does say ages 8 and up but certainly younger kids (5-7) could do it with support. The pieces go together very easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandietlick","review":"This was a great Christmas gift for my 9 year old son!!! I would buy this again.

This Christmas she wanted stuffed animals, Build-A-Bear, Webkinz and so on. We got her that stuff (and a giant pile of books) but I couldn't resist getting this for her, in hopes of encouraging her interest in science and technology. When it arrived I was a little concerned, the back cover has a big picture of a BOY playing with the set... No girls in sight. I was prepared for disappointment when she opened the set but she just said NEAT! And, I have to tell you, she has spent more time with the projects in this kit than ANY of her other Christmas gifts. I worked with her on the first two projects and then away she went, working her way excitedly thorough the experiments. Lights flash, wheels whiz, flying widgets soar... and my daughter is thrilled.As I write this, she's having a play date with another little girl and the two of them are building, building, building...Long story short -- GO FOR IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"kid fun and quite educational","review":"We purchased the Snap Circuit kit based on reviews and product description. It has absolutely met my expectations. Our 7 year old is able to follow the schematics with little difficulty, and thus far has loved building the mechanisms from the manual. Though his interest in the \\"how does it do that\\" reasoning isn't yet completely formed, it seems evident that in time he will enjoy learning how each component of a given device works and why. This is an excellent primer on electrical circuitry and a marvelous evolution of the Heathkit radio of yesterday. A perfect way to insidiously introduce a child to engineering and logic. If more superactive kids had this fewer of them would be on Ritalin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandma made a poor choice","review":"This product looks wonderful, came highly recommended, and looked very durable. I bought two of the Snap Circuits SC300 and 2 Snapticity My 8 and 9 1/2-year-old grandsons were not at all interested in the Snap Circuits. I spent $180 when all was totaled (including 2 Hyper Dash toys) and the boys have not used any of the items. It was very disappointing.

Was really worried it would be a flop as she had not specifically asked for it. We are always trying to encourage math, science and engineering and this toy seemed to be a good fit. Could not believe how much she enjoyed putting together circuits. A couple of the pieces were broken and the customer service from the company was outstanding. They replaced for free the broken pieces. As an engineer, these circuits are similar to bread boards I used in college, but much easier to use. The engineering concepts are the same. If nothing else, the toy teaches my daughter to follow instructions closely and check her work when a circuit doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to basic electrical theory","review":"I bought this item for my daughter for christmas. She had just turned 9 fifteen days earlier. Out of everything she got for christmas, this was by far her favorite gift. There are over 300 activities. This kit teaches them on so many levels. Even assembling the example projects teaches them basic assembly sequencing in a specific order (following directions). I was impressed at some of the concepts introduced even within the first 75 projects. Concepts like AND, NOT, OR, NAND logic are introduced in a fun educational way. It is really fun to have her setup each project and make it work, then we discuss the important take-away lessons from the project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Toy","review":"This is an excellent toy, very well built and offers great depth of electronic experiments.

I add my 5-star review to the others, because this \\"toy\\" is deserving of every accolade it receives. My son absolutely loves it, and it is far above the quality of other, flimsier science kits on electricity. Last year, we spent a fair bit of time learning how to create closed circuits using batteries, tape, rubber bands, wires, and foil. This is so much easier and more rewarding to use, and the multitude of circuit projects you can create will reinforce this very useful lesson.

My son is into things the typical 8-year-old is: trampoline, skateboarding, scooter riding, playing outside, Star Wars, Legos, etc., so we were unsure of doing the more educational scientific type of gift. He actually was and is very excited about it and LOVES to make things that work. It also gives he and his daddy some quality one-on-one time to sit down and build things together, so he enjoys that too. Even my older boys who are now grown men and were here for the birthday party seemed really intrigued by the gift. They lingered near the table, wanting to try some things for themselves, so it was a great gift all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"My son got this for Christmas and I think it is his favorite thing that he got.

The child (over 6 years old), with parent's guidance, can immediately follow a starter project to do a simple hookup and get immediate results (lighting, sound, etc). I can see the big smiles from my kids, and that brings a great deal of satisfaction as a parent.My kids would try more than 15 projects in the next few days, before their interests move on to something else. The AM radio is the absolute favorite. The tuner, however, can't really get few stations.But it's a great introduction to basic electronic components nonetheless. They learned the wiring, flow of current, switches, resisters, capacitors, speakers, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fun product","review":"I got this for my seven year old who wants to be an engineer. He was so excited and the product has not disappointed him. The instructions are easy to follow and it was a pleasure to watch his face light up with glee every time he completed a project successfully. After a few times helping him put projects together, he got the gist enough to complete some by himself. Anyone who has a child interested in construction, electricity or engineering should invest in this great, educational product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a snap!","review":"Bought this for a Christmas gift for an 8 year old Nephew. I had something like this many years ago, but the components were not packaged into these snap modules, and consequently the component leads broke off.This product deserves kudos for improving on that by encasing the parts inside a module that snaps together. Much more robust, and great for young hands. The nephew loved it, and after a year the product is still a viable learning experience.After showing a great interest in this, maybe a micro-controller -robotic project is a possible gift in a year or two.Good quality and ability to repeatedly build many projects over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 8 Year Old Said They're Fun","review":"We had Amazon send these directly to a very smart 8 year old boy for Christmas.

Money well spent!","review":"I bought this for my 10 year old son for Christmas last year (2009), and it remains his favorite toy. He takes it out and plays with it and his sister (8) loves to watch, and wants one of her own. It's durable, fun, safe and I would have paid double had I known that he would enjoy it to this extent. There is a book of circuit set-ups which are color coded and easy to follow. There is also the ability to have free play where the kids can set up their own experimental circuits and figure out why they do or do not work. Really a great product.

I've tried out other circuit kits for my curious pair, but the instructions were too technical and the connections too prone to error. These instructions are easy to follow and include brief explanations as each new concept is introduced. Each piece has the correct technical symbol printed on it, so they will be able to relate this knowledge to schematics later on and, with adult supervision, these snaps work right every time.It's colorful too, so even my 'artistic' child is excited to join the fun! This is GREAT for homeschoolers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"for the lego-mided","review":"I looked around for similar products before deciding on this one and I think it's definately worth the investment. The structure is simple: a platform and the snapable parts. This makes visualizing the path of the current modular and easy, and the light, sound and fan effects are, of course, for 8-year-old boys, stimulating. My son understood how the resistor could be replaced with others with higher or lower values, or none at all, and had loads of fun making his sister jump when she triggered the sound by walking by.The packaging has its intentions - to keep things neat and tidy - but the whole box takes up too much space. I'm going to have to find another way of storing the parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Xmas toy still being played with!","review":"I bought this for my 11 year old son who just has to know how everything works. He plays with this thing all day everyday. There are so many different projects to make and they are educational as well. For example one he did today he needed two different kinds of water for, plain and salt and had to figure out the difference between the two. We finally found something to make him put down the video games. We homeschool and I could not ask for a better science unit at such a fantastic price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good toys but can't sustain long term attention from kids","review":"This is a very good educational toy. My 8 years old son played it for full 2 days. Then, for some reason, he lost his interest on this toy. He moved back to play lego.I think, it might be the limited variation of the toy that cause him lose the interest. I would suggest the manufacturer to consider to link this toy to computer in some way, it may increase the interest from the kids.But overall, this is a good concept to having kids to learn about circuit on a toy, just need to extend it a little further though.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent toy for teen boy!","review":"My 13 year old grandson said this was the best present he ever received!

The projects vary in complexity but she is able to complete them on her own. That said, I still like to watch her build the projects because it's so much fun. She's also been able to make modifications to the projects to build her own ideas.Make sure you read the safety instructions. I didn't notice when my 4 year old shorted out the battery terminals but my daughter did and realized the problem immediately because we'd read the safety guide together. The guide also tells you how to avoid burning out some of the more delicate components.The pieces are well made and feel like they'll last a long time. The only piece that doesn't feel durable is the fan, which is understandable.For $30-$40, this toy is an amazing value.

Unfortunately we have one component that has since stopped working properly, but I am confident that we will have no problem replacing it. Very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put down the joy stick and do something!","review":"I purchased this toy for my 8 year old grandson. On Christmas eve I showed him how to put together some of the more basic circuts, He never played with any of his other toys all night.

We had one small snag -- one of the jumper wires broke off of the snap on Christmas morning (make sure the kids know not to pull on the wire to disconnected, but instead to grip the snap to disconnect.) Anyway, my son was insistent that I call the 800-number on Christmas morning. I did and left a message. The Tuesday following Christmas Monday, I received a call from Elanco to confirm the issue and get an address. By Friday, we received a replacement in the mail, just as promised.I'd highly recommend Elanco's products."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it and he wants to order upgrade kit !","review":"My review title says it all!

We just opened it tonight, and built a sound device which responds to audible signals ie it turns on and off in response to a clap. The ease with which I taught her a fundamental lesson on the principle of resistance... my 4th grade daughter... was simply amazing. Not only did she pick up the concept with ease, she actually enjoyed the process of learning it!

Honestly, when I play with this toy with my 6 year old niece, I have more fun then her. I think she's probably too young for it. Probably this is the best educational toy I've ever seen, in my entire life! It's so cool! It seriously has all of the functionality of the sold school soldering boards, with no mess! And you can play with it FAST! You can take it out, play with it, and put it away in 10 or fifteen minutes! It's so EASY to have fun with this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"I purchased this set for my son for his 9th birthday. He loves to put things together and figure out how they work. Most toys like that are only put together one time, and then the challenge is over. My son has not stopped playing with this set since he got it. He would rather play with the snap circuits than watch TV. It keeps him busy for several hours at a time, quite a feat for a kid with ADHD. If you have a child who is interested in science, and loves to figure out how things work, this is a great purchase!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kit!!!","review":"We bought this for my daughter as part of HomeSchooling's projects.

Not only did he go through all the projects that were on there, but he enlisted the help of my brother-in-law, parents, and other siblings to work on the projects. He really enjoyed it, and I feel like he learned a lot.

I know a lot about electricity so these simple circuits where easy for me but the way the kit was designed it made it easy for my daughter also. She would build the circuits and I would inspect them for accuracy. There are a few components that will be damaged if you reverse polarization but for the most part you cannot harm anything. I think everyone should know a little about electricity since it runs around our lives and we take it for granted. This was money well spent for a girl or a boy. My wife was thinking this was a present for me at first but then she saw how my daughter embraced it and she was a believer and starting learning from this kit as well.

It's fine to have that that opinion, but the book is also overly dry, academic, and is much like a sleeping pill. It seems to be written more to impress academics (and for the author to hear his own, at times, overly pompous tones)than to inform the reader. The book doesn't explain, it tells. I also get the feeling that in each case the author was looking for the most mundane answer to every riddle.

The book is powerful enough to show that, as in Ingrid's case,one does not have to be a saint to be religious,and, as in her lover, Jack's, case one does not have to be a sinner because one's life has been tragic. Ingris sins for Jack, and Jack,like a saint, gives up the easy life he led, to save Ingrid. This book is a moving and strong picture of a woman who is fighting between good and evil, without knowing which is which. If you are looking for a book to renew your faith, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for first-rate historical fiction, then look no further. MacCoun writes some of the best historical fiction I have had the pleasure of reading. This is a definite read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Picked this up by chance on holiday in Greece.

I am not a big Rambo fan. While I always enjoyed the original, First Blood, and the newest movie, Rambo, non of the in-between movies are entertaining for me. I have always ran into a three-pack at the stores, which only include the first three, so why pay for two movies I have no interest in?After reading a short review from blu-ray dot com, I'd agree that the picture is never very bright, but it is part of the film style since much takes place at night and in the woods. There's no overly done artificial noise reduction BS taking place to smooth out the film grain, so the images has plenty of detail for an older film. The surround sound I don't remember jumping out at me as a phenomenal experience, just average.

The second time, when I backed up with it, it ate the flap on the back that blocks grass from coming out at you. It shattered the flap, dinged up the mower blade, and bent the shaft that holds the mower blade straight. When I restarted the mower, the blade would hit the frame, and black smoke came out of the muffler. I called in for the warranty, took it to an authorized shop, and all the warranty would fix was the grass flap. The mower mechanic told me that he will \\"See you next year to replace that muffler\\". I asked him what he meant, and he said \\"Those mufflers have to be replaced once a year for $50.00\\" He also proceeded to tell me that I paid too much for such a basic mower. Spend a little extra and get something with a little better quality. I mean who makes a lawn mower that you cannot go backwards with? This thing self destructs if you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mower for the price","review":"Great deal. $[...] less than any store, plus I got the free super saver shipping. Have mowed 4 times with it, does well. The other review touting this as cheap junk is a laugh. Well go find a less expensive mower, you wont. Plenty of power for longer grass. Its not a Honda, its not a LawnBoy, but its not $[...] either. And don't believe that line about the muffler wearing out and costing $[...] dollars. Its the exact same muffler on my 8 year old mower that I'm ditching. (The 8 year old muffler is fine.) I have pulled it backwards to have the flap go under the back a hundred times and it does not chew it up. Clearly the man giving him advice was selling a competitors mower.

Stand out tracks are \\"Psychopharmacology\\", \\"Bad, Bad World\\", \\"The Man With The Blurry Face\\" & \\"Fell Off The Face Of The Earth\\". EVERY track on this disc is a winner!

I have never been disappointed by any of her DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough and effective :-()","review":"This is about my 7th workout of Cathes and it's great. It's tough but it's going to give you amazing results if you do it consistantly. On the DVD there are three different types of workouts. There is classic floor work, abdominal workout using a stability ball and also a workout with a stability ball and medicine ball. It's fun and gets easier over time.All of these ab workouts are going to tone you up and flatten you out (if you do a lot of cardio too).

It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY works the core","review":"I watched CATHE doing her routine on TV and thought it'd be nice not to have to deal with commercials. I really like her workouts and this CD series is set up nicely in three separate segments....on mat only, with stability ball & with stability ball and a medicine ball. All three segments provide a serious core challenge. The CD provides an intro so that you know what each segment will be like. You can then chose the type of workout you want. All definitely provide a serious core workout! I thought the workout on the mat was going to be the easiest... wrong! She makes you use those core muscles to their optimum. I personally like using the stability ball with the medicine ball segment on the days I do my weight workout...gives me a sense of doing a well rounded routine. It's tough, but well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fave ab workouts!","review":"I've had this DVD for about two years, and, out of over 125 workout DVD's that I own, this is my absolute favorite ab workout. I never get sick of doing the workouts on here because of Cathe's wonderful personality and encouraging attitude.When I do the workouts on here on a regular basis, I also notice fewer lower back aches and pains. Cathe really works not just your abs, but your entire core -- the entire abdominal region, as well as the lower back.The three workouts are definitely advanced, but you can modify, and they require the use of a stability ball and a medicine ball.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cornell Instructor's Opinion","review":"Despite its age and somewhat outdated nomenclatures, this book is still the best comprehensive introductory hydrology book in existence.

It is pretty much the 'Wheels on the Bus' song in a book. It has a Seasame Street tilt, with one of the lines being 'Coo-ooo-kie, coo-ooo-kie'. There are wipers going 'swish swish swish', babies going 'wah wah wah', parents going 'shh shh shh'. There are some other ones like the band playing 'Umm paa paa' and the grouches going 'bam bam bam' with trash can lids. My kids seem to enjoy it and have asked for it a lot.

Less than 1.5 million soldiers actually served in combat/combat support roles during the VN war. If the bottom line of this book is that the violent nature of war becomes a defining experience in a young man's life, then I agree. The problem with studies like this is the lack of confirmation of actual combat service by the participants.

Finally, it helped me to understand things about my own father (also a Viet Nam veteran) that he himself simply had no way of explaining, even to himself, let alone his family. Rarely have I come across a scholarly work so powerfully written and relevant to the issues of today. Dr. Shay has authored a remarkable book! Thank you, Dr. Shay."},{"rating":"2","title":"BULL'S EYE","review":"Shay's 'Achilles in Vietnam' is the best, most realistic book I've read about combat PTSD; it plumbs the depths of anguish and the consequences of torture (combat) on soldiers.

Want to know the possible result of war on young men that you inadvertantly finance through your tax dollars? Read this book. Those young men may now be living on the same block as you, ready to launch into deadly combat at the slightest twig snap, if not treated.

Once again, there are a couple of big hits here (and a couple that should have been hits) but they have yet to make their best albums. This album is very enjoyable and certainly worth owning but it is still a Four-star effort. However, I would recommend that anyone interested in the group would be infinitely better off buying the original albums of Traffic instead of going for a \`hits' CD because (as of 2011) the \`hits' CDs for traffic have been very poorly organized and poorly produced.This CD is very good and it has the bonus tracks, which are nice to have, but they add little to the album itself.Several years ago there was a Gold disk released of this album (with no bonus tracks) by Mobile Fidelity and for those who Love this album, that CD might be worth seeking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine album by an often overlooked band","review":"Side 1 of the original album (through \\"Feelin' Alright?\\") is one of the stronger sides from 1968 rock. The impressive versatility of both Steve Winwood and Dave Mason are on display, and four of the five songs are as good as late-'60s rock gets. Side 2 is not quite as strong, but is anchored by \\"40,000 Headmen\\", one of the band's best tunes ever.I'll increase the rating to four and a half stars for the 2000 reissue on Island Remasters featuring songs from singles preceding and following the album. The songs from earlier are superfluous --- they're also available on \\"Heaven Is In Your Mind\\" --- but the other three (which were also on the otherwise unworthy \\"Last Exit\\" album) are essential: \\"Withering Tree\\", the fun, jumping \\"Medicated Goo\\", and the seldom-heard gem \\"Shanghai Noodle Factory\\", which clearly is Winwood's account of the band's breakup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Most Focused Release","review":"A very steady recording indeed by Traffic. On this release, both Steve Windwood and David Mason contribute some excellent songs. Pearly Queen, Don't Be Sad, Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring, Feelin' Allright, Cryin' To Be Heard, and You Can Join In are all catchy focused numbers with some captivating solos which are not overly extended. In addition, the vocals stylings are very expressive in the case of both Windwood and Mason. They both bring out every possible tone in their voices.Overall, the effort is consistent if not quite spectacular as John Barleycorn or Low Spark Of Hi Heeled Boys. Vagabound Virgin does drag after a while and the last two songs(not including the extra tracks) are not as good as the others.

Although this is a stylistically bumpy album, it is still intelligent and fun. And despite their differences, the Crying to be Heard // No Time to Live suite show that Mason and Winwood really could work together. IMO that is among the best ten minutes of music ever written and precedes Morrissey, Stipe, and Cobain angst by decades.

The screws are barely long enough to fit together when there ISNT a gap, and some of the screws were defective and would slip out when tightening.

He gets into the heads of the battle commanders and the common soldier. This book is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"General Meade finally get respect....","review":"This latest book by Stephen Sears proves to be highly readable and interesting account of the Battle of Gettysburg. Sears reaccount the battle very clearly and his perception proves to be fair and on target. Its a thick book and gear toward the hard core readers of the American Civil War. Sears does something that very few Gettysburg books ever tried to do, that is to give credit to George Meade. While many books tries to explained how Lee lost the battle and why, the man who won the battle often get the short end of the stick when it come to this battle. Sears can be credited in correcting that and giving Meade good credit for out-generaling Robert E. Lee. Meade in this book, proves equal to the task and it was nice to read for once, how Meade won the battle. In my view, I thought that this approach was way over due and make the book more interesting - especially for those who have read many books on this battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great look at Gettysburg!","review":"Being a fan of Stephen Sears I was anxious to get my hands on this book as I have read many others of his. Sears style is clear, concise and interesting. Covering the great battle, Sears tackles a lot of ground from Lee's desires to take the war north of Virginia, Stuart's Cavalry operations, Union leadership, Confederate and Union positions, early marches and finally the battle itself. Sears always brings his words to life and this book is a great example of that. I liked reading about Lee's intentions as to why to press into Pennsylvania, Union leadership and Longstreet's approach to handling Lee's orders. These were just a few of the many great chapters inside this informative and entertaining book about the Battle of Gettysburg. 5 STARS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So What ????","review":"Not badly written, but given the vast body of works on Gettysburg it would seem that a general history should offer something new: new insight, opinions, whatever. This volume offers nothing new at all. It adds nothing to Gettysburg scholarship, and in many ways merely repeats hackneyed old themes and prejudices. One cannot but wonder if this title was added to the Sears catalog simply to sell more books. Certainly anything with \\"Gettysburg\\" in the title will sell, even if it is rubbish. I would not quite ascribe that word to Sears' book, in that it is a decently-constructed narrative, but it is not a serious historical analysis at all. It is, in the end, just another mediocre (at best) general work on the battle, and I doubt whether that is really needed on anyone's shelf.On a positive note, my copy was free. If you can obtain it for that price, it is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here, except Sears flaws","review":"Writing a book on Gettysburg should, by now, be more than the excercise of putting the facts together in the correct order and sprinkling on commentary. That has been done more times than I can count. Unfortunately that is what Sears gives us. So in the face of superior books, especially Coddington's book, it is difficult to recommend this one. Once again, Sears puts forth a lopsided argument against those generals he's decided to dislike and for those whom he admires. This was the case in his books on the Seven Days and Antietam that are almost shrill in their attacks on McClellan and his book on Chancellorsville which excused Hooker because he may have had a concussion. What keeps Civil War books fresh is the commentary by their authors, but Sears style has always been too unilateral for my taste.

I love English history and Church history, so of course, it's only natural that I would be interested in the history of the Church in England. You'll also find great info on the ancient kings of England, political and spiritual battles, and how the Church took a foothold in the British Isles."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"Just finished this book. While it gives the reader the sense of the conversion of England from pagan to Christian and the major players of the time it does so in a circular story telling manner that repeats certain aspects of peoples and events that was not necessary. If better organized it could have been shortened by about 100 pages.....If only Bede had Microsoft Word! The book reminds me quite a bit of Eusubius's History of the Church. That book was written 300 yrs prior but in a similar manner of inserting miraculous events and saintly people into a historical tome. It was interesting and revealing as to how England was convereted and how the new religion dealt with many advesaries (plagues, herasies, wars, etc.) that arose over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost his very best","review":"It's too bad that whenever you mention Webb Widler's great sounds to people you also have to mention in the same breath phrases like \\"under-appreciated\\" and \\"undiscovered\\".

It is not my favorite, but it is absolutely good and a must have for anyone into Webb or anyone wanting to check him out for the first time. My favorite track on here is \\"On The Safeside\\" - I wear that song out. His version of \\"Ain't That A Lot of Love\\" is smokin' too. The only other worthy version is Taj Mahal pulling it off on \\"The Rolling Stones Rock & Roll Circus\\". Webb stamps his seal on it for the ages and raises the bar for the pretenders. \\"Hittin' Where It Hurts\\" and \\"Wild Honey\\" are damn snappy too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but no Whistle","review":"The design is elegant and certainly fine to heat water.PROBLEMS:1.

I really liked Esti & that she had spoken to Ronit's father -- that's all I can say without spoiling the book. It validates/reinforces the importance of our choices, and the impact of same in our lives, as well as in the lives of others. There was, at least for me, something missing. There is potential here & I would consider reading more of this author's work.

It takes courage to speak out and I give Naomi much credit for stepping out of the norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"I'm in the minority here, but I was disappointed by \\"Disobedience\\". Whilst I applaud the author for tackling a difficult subject (lesbianism within the confines of Orthodox Judaism), I did not feel that the novel explored it well enough. The downfall of the novel was the poorly drawn main characters. I did not find the lesbian love story of Ronit and Esti believable at all. I found it hard to believe that someone like Ronit, who had escaped the suffocating confines of Hendon for the glamour life in New York, would be interested in rekindling a relationship with the childlike, inarticulate Esti. Their relationship did not ring true. Dovid, Esti's Rabbi husband, was also poorly drawn. No reason was ever given for him agreeing to marry a woman who he knew was a lesbian. Ms Alderman writes well about a fascinating topic, but in my opinion, the book was badly let down by poor characterisation."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaking like a sive","review":"upon receiving the cartridges, i opened the envelope and it was full of colored ink. when i opened the box all this ink had leaked out and onto my hands I am still getting ink off my hands. i had to go and buy one at the computer store, next time ill just do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"runs out way to fast","review":"I opribnt maybe 40 pictures and it runs out.

(An example of one of Bender's verbal gems: \\"His skin felt like skin.\\" I'd have to go back to grade school to find tautologies this perfect.)There's a line in one of these highly forgettable, wafer-thin stories that perfectly describes the author's effect: \\"Bland is a state of mind.\\" It's a state of mind that, apparently, many readers have confused for depth. There's so little real matter or true originality here that the effect is like watching a pet perform tricks for its bored master. Bender doesn't create characters but floating shells of people, whose outward deformities are their sole defining characteristic. The author doesn't appear to have spent one minute in the real world. Why do people like this junk?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love experimental literature, literature that takes risks, but Bender's stories read more like writing exercises than stories. The comparisons I've seen between her and Calvino (or Kafka) are frighteningly off the mark. Bender seems to heap random images on top of each other for the sake of absurdity, but nothing is enlightened. A comparison to David Foster Wallace might be more justified, as far as content goes, but Bender lacks the mastery of prose and voice that makes Wallace more than a mere cartoonist. Someone mentioned earlier that she needs to fire her publicist. _I_ want her publicist; this book is all hype (it was reviewed in Entertainment Weekly! I think it got a C-). Bender may eventually mature into a good writer, but the odds are against it. Her early success will probably jade her and keep her from truly learning her craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"There were two stories worth reading in this collection.

As a graduating senior, I was appalled at the writing,(too simplistic), and the subject matter was assuredly pushing the envelope. She makes the reader's reach for the meanings and the subjects. In today's society, art is testing the limits, but this so called work of art by Bender is not only pushing the envelope, it is burning it. She seems to have incestuous as well as homo erotic writings mixed in with ideas and stories that do not flow together. There is no rhyme or reason and the concept that a girl could think her \\"passions\\" had flamed when she was being burned to a crisp by the flames from vanilla scented candles is ridiculous.

Bender explores the bizarre, the extraordinary, the erotic nature of human desires.My favorite story in the book was \\"The Healer,\\" which dealt with the intertwined lives of a girl who had a hand made out of fire and her opposite, who had a hand of ice.

Reading fiction always requires some suspension of disbelief, but ... Bender seems merely to have manufactured an artificially dangerous situation for her heroine just to make her point, and it's so jarringly blatant that it throws you out of the story.

I found myself waiting for the next oddity rather than the next revelation. And, sadly, towards the end, I was just waiting for it to all be over.

I have read several true crime historical accounts of it and very much enjoyed the recent book Thunderstruck the Crippen and Marconi stories. The author here attempts to fictionalise the story and I have no quarrel with that but he has failed. The female characters, especially, Mrs. Smythson, the Drakes, and Cora Crippen are cardboard stereotypes.It's a period story with precious little period detail.

I'd hoped to learn about the case.What I have learned so far, is that far from being a page turner, the book is a tiresome read. The fictionalization is more worthy of a poorly written romance novel than what one would assume would be a thriller. The characters are such unbelievable cliches (the Captain Bligh loving ship's captain especially) that it's difficult to relate to any of them.I cannot recommend this book to anyone with more than half a brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"If you're going to write a historical novel that deals with snobbery and class relations in England, you really need to have some idea of how upper-class people talked and behaved.

Celina Jaitley is a nurse who has recently received a job with the Red Cross and is scheduled to go on a visa interview soon. She celebrates her success by partying hard with her friends one night. On the way back she accidentally hits a pedestrian played by Farrooque Sheikh. Instead of reporting to the police, the panicked Celina drives the victim, now lodged in her windshield back to her house. The rest of the movie deals with her predicament and the victims anguish.Plenty of raw stock has been wasted as the movie is as cheesy as it sounds. Faroque Sheikh, used to be a certain actor of merit but I give forgive him for doing this movie as I would like to believe that he was doing this as a favor for a friend.

However, I was told these predate the Volume series and everything's been done ramshackle, because not everyone is willing to pay the retail $900 for all episodes.I'll give the content 5 stars, and if you want just a few episodes this the way to go. But, for collectors of the entire series it's sad they didn't stuff in those 3 episodes, with 2 being on \\"More Treasues of The Twilight Zone\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DVD is clear and worth the cost.","review":"The interview done by Mike Wallace with Rod Sterling in 1959 is worth the value of the DVD.

But I do highly recommend Kurowski's other books that I have mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I buy this book?","review":"First of all let me state why I handed over my hard-earned money... I wanted a book written from a German perspective regarding the closing days of the war. I was hoping for first-hand personal accounts of the hell and desperation that those days brought. What I got was a very poor translation of a book that offered little, if any, \\"soldier's stories\\" and skipped wholesale details of what it was like living in the \\"fortresses.\\" No mention is even made of the efforts at places such as Memel. Overall, it was a very disappointing purchase"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent account . . .","review":"Excellent book. Easy to read account of the final months of the Third Reich and the desperate battles fought to stave off defeat.The unfolding events described are interspersed with personal accounts by the combatants and civilians, which adds additional and welcome detail to the book.The book also recounts, in very readable fashion, the efforts by the German military to assist civilian populations in escaping the onrushing Soviet onslaught. These accounts alone made the book a worthwhile addition to my library.The book details troop activities at various organizational levels, from Corps and Division level down to Battalion level and smaller. It would have been very helpful for there to have been more detailed maps to assist the reader in following the described actions. Other than that slight shortcoming, the book will find a welcome place in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitler's Last Bastion","review":"It is a good book, which gives us a global vision of the operations without going into too many details.

In the photo sections highlighting these battles, the author shows a photo of the center of old Koenigsberg after the 3 day fire bombing raid in August 1944 -- and juxtaposes this with the ruins of the University saying this was after Russian bombing. This raid on the historic center was by the British, and in similar form to Dresden. Get it right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Erasmus of Islam","review":"This selection of Soroush's writings reveals a genuinely liberal intellect rooted in his Iranian and Islamic culture but at home with Western thought, toward which he is neither aggressive nor apologetically defensive.Soroush, who has gained a following among Iranian students and even a few of the mullahs, cites the likes of Jalal al-Din Rumi, Muhammad Iqbal, J?rgen Habermas, and Alexis de Tocqueville as often as the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad(SAW). That might seem a recipe for a rambling, rootless philosophy, but his statements are thoughtful, penetrating and coherent. Although some observers have dubbed him the Luther of Islam, he is perhaps better seen as Islam's Erasmus, since he is carefully working within the system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was expecting a synopsis of Mr. Soroush's thoughts but this instead is a collection of his speeches apparently to an audience of university students majoring in Philosophy of Islam.

The characters and their dialogue are the weaker points of this fiction, but working your mind trying to figure who the killer is overshawdows the shortcomings.

I did not find the characters believable and I certainly didn't learn to care about them and what happened to them.

This couple did not fall in love -- they fell in love with falling in love. Sadly, many many people don't know the difference, and this couple never figured it out, either. Read chapter 3 of THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES by Gary Chapman (taken from M.

A bored wife having an affair was perhaps a really big deal in 1945, and her accompanying guilt is played and replayed much longer than necessary. Additionally, there didn't seem to be very much physical or emotional chemistry between the two co-stars. In fact, the bantering and humor of the tertiary characters in the train station's coffee shop was much more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite love story","review":"First time I saw this film was in the 60's, I was twelve and home sick from school. I cried for the last 30 minutes of the movie then and I still do now. I fell in love with the actors, the characters they played, the music, and England. And every time I pass a quaint railroad station, I still look for my \\"Trevor Howard\\". What a story, what a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable film but expensive DVD","review":"With all the detailed and erudite reviews of this famous film, let me merely comment that since it was released in 2000, there have been many DVDs released of many classics at a much lower price. Many of them offer much more than Criterion do here. Sure, you do get a very good but not perfect restored print and a useful and interesting commentary but on even the most assembly line Hollywood product, that is almost standard now.\\"Brief Encounter\\" is an exquisite film with an overwhelming performance of heart-rending poignancy from Celia Johnson and delicate sensitivity from Trevor Howard but the Criterion package is still too expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"One of the best film romances I've ever seen. I cannot praise this movie enough! The music, the acting, the plotline... all brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"If you loved Lost in Translation, you'll love this.If you love Sleepless in Seattle and similar modern romance classics, see the movie that inspired those filmmakers.If you like nonlinear movies, like Citizen Kane or Go, you'll love this.You can gauge how special this movie is by imagining how you would feel if the tape ran out unexpectedly in the middle, and you were not able to go on watching. I realised while i was watching that i would have been devastated! Beautiful, compelling film based on the play Still Life by Noel Coward (though it doesn't feel like a filmed stage play)and shot by David Lean (before he decided to make epics - there is a scene in this where he makes a joke about the epic genre which will be of interest to his fans). The best thing about it (and this is saying a lot) is the two lead performances, Trevor Howard and (particularly) Celia Johnson in her crowning role, the only role she is remembered for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brief Encounter","review":"This subtle, heartfelt British gem will still drench most anyones Kleenex sixty years after its release. Performances by Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson are impeccable. Direction and script are suitably understated, and the use of Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto throughout the film heightens the sentiment. Even with the British reserve much in evidence, overall effect is intensely moving. Dont miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I adore this movie.","review":"This is one of my favorite films; I never get tired of seeing it.

Great movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This movie was great. Both my husband and I enjoyed it so very much. I might watch it tonight. thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"All-time great","review":"I always forget what a masterpiece of cinema David Lean's Brief Encounter is, but am instantly reminded when I sit down again to be mesmerized by its spell.This may be a screen adaptation of stage material, but creaky and theatrical this is certainly not. On the contrary, Noel Coward's drama is transformed into something uniquely cinematic. The story concerns the bittersweet affair of central character Laura Jesson (Johnson) with Dr Alec Harvey (Howard), and it is a story that is told intriguingly through Robert Krasker's inspired lighting and camerawork, Jack Harris's editing and Sergei Rachmaninov's music, taken from the Second Piano Concerto, but which nevertheless could have been written for the film. The main performances wrench our emotions with utter conviction, and Coward's own experience of forbidden love is tragically and poignantly expressed (see critic Richard Dyer's homage to Brief Encounter in the BFI Film Series)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An obscure treasure","review":"A beautiful movie in all respects.

Deeply tender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly assembled pastiche","review":"This is a weak effort. Interesting and sometimes compelling editorial for each decade (generally essays by agency principals), which has absolutely no relationship to the samples of work shown. The work itself is never glossed, explained, or explored in the larger context of its time frame. The selection of work included is spotty. Reproduction quality is poor, especially on the broadcast material, with many spots featuring only a couple of keyframes and omitting large amounts of dialogue (to the point where the spot makes no sense).

Most shots have corner blocked, as if the images were shot from a hole (maybe to cut out wind sound?). I was watching this in a 17\\" monitor (brand new LCD that can play widescreen format), and already could tell the poor quality. If you watch this in any bigger and better monitor, your frustration will only magnify.This DVD seemed like a mere transfer from a VHS tape, and should be treated as \\"VHS quality video in DVD format.\\"Anyone who only knows the latest, prettiest Hollywood DVD titles, stay away with this one. You will be amazed with the poor quality. Those who never experienced real DVD, this may be a relaxing one to watch on a poor quality 10-year old TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done video","review":"I bought this DVD along with another as part of an anniversary day. I received and reviewed the DVD with pleasure. The folks that made the DVD did a great job of picking unoccupied beaches and nice locations. Both video quality and sound were excellent.

Worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you would expect","review":"I was very unsatisfied with this DVD.

Simply Incredible! You can now see the grains of sand and the tiny ripples in the lapping waves. The improved resolution and contrast make it incredibly realistic. It's like the difference between a Beatle's record and the remasted CD. It's worth buying all over again. It looks and sounds like you're really sitting there on the beach, listening to the waves, watching the sunset, and feeling completly at ease... Best of all, it can loop continuously so I can let it run for hours... dreaming... I'm vacationing in a beautiful 5 star hotel.

I really wanted what this DVD said it would deliver - a mixture of interesting waves in spectacular settings with natural sound.The waves are small and uninteresting; the settings are only average by Hawiian standards. This could have been so much better.The only value of this video is if you use it in meditation to occupy your visual attention - \\"to zone out\\"And this purpose is mostly defeated by the irritating logo and audio that appears between each segment to remind you of the Name of the DVD and company that made it.The production values are mediocre; you could produce this yourself. It is not even a good reminder of what it's like to sit on a beach, because the view rarely shifts and chances to capture sunrise/sunset are missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I really can't review this product because it was never sent to me.

How do you think they would like to see the carribean instead. I'm thinking NOT !! I really have no use for this Carribean DVD but I seem to be stuck with a purchase that I absolutely don't want.

I was really disappointed and wish I hand't purchased it at all, maybe I am a victim of hype. If you are looking for basically STILL pictures and sounds of the ocean by all means buy it. But don't expect this in any way to indentify specific places on the islands or teach you anything about the islands. Also the cinematography left something to be desired as well, fuzzy pictures (not DVD quality by ANY means). I have an audiophile grade sound system and the sound is not 5.1, or even pro-logic for that matter.

Each of the 5 women in the film talk about how climbing has changed their outlook on life and how it has helped them deal with all kinds of challenges.

Do make sure that your computer is equipped with USB 2.0 though, or else you won't be able to get the 16X speed. For laptop users, I recommend a PCMCIA USB 2.0 Card. The software enclosed with the burner will do the basic stuff, however it doesn't have any bells and whistles with it.

However, after installing XP Pro, the drive no longer worked with my USB 2.0 card, and worked only very sluggishly on my USB 1.1 port.Iomega's chat support, while friendly, is of little help with the techs very slow to respond and recommending the same fixes every time. Email support is slow and mind-numbingly ineffecient, and don't try to call phone support unless you plan on spending 30-45 mins in queue (on their non-800# line).All this to say, if you have XP, Iomega isn't ready for it yet. Perhaps in a while after they released more patches/upgrade they will be - but as of now, I'm returning this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad piece of hardware","review":"I thought this was going to be a good product but it does nothing but eat cds and spit them out.

Tech support kept telling me to turn off things in the background that typically are running in any windows operating system etc. I got an old fart who kept explaining to me that he had been ding this for 30 years instead of getting the product to work.

But with the help of this toy, he will tolerate playing on his tummy. He LOVES to look at himself. He coo's at the mirror; like he is talking to another baby. He even likes to play with this while he is sitting up.This is a wonderful toy at a wonderful price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes tummy time more fun!","review":"My 3 1/2 month old has had this turtle for about a month. I wanted to get her a mirror so she could see herself and a lot of baby mirrors I found were very distorted looking. When far away this mirror doesnt look clear but when you are up close it is.I also really liked the turtle as well. It has a cute face and a lot of interesting things to touch and explore. The back is a satin \\"bean bag\\" type of cusion and it has paded arms to either pick up or dangle other linkadoos from.This has made tummy time more enjoyable, now instead of crying every time she is observing herself and the turtle and can be on her tummy for a longer period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you for your review!","review":"I just wanted to say thanks for everyone who left a review previously, because based off those reviews I bought this toy and my baby loves it!

You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too interesting...","review":"I thought this turtle was absolutely adorable and thought it would be perfect to help my daughter spend some extra time on her tummy. She has yet to take any interest in playing with it. The mirror is nice--she does look at herself in that but I would imagine you could find other toys that have mirrors that are more fun and cost less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"This toy is very entertaining for my little girl at a great price! She is 5 1/2 months old now and has been playing with this toy for a few months now. Even when she hated tummy time she would stand it for a few minutes and try to look at herself in the mirror. Now that she can roll over onto her belly on her own, she loves tummy time and this is one of her favorite toys for it. She will try to scoot around the floor and follow it if it starts to move away from her and is very amused with the baby in the mirror. For some reason, even when she was tiny and I would just show it to her when she was laying down, her favorite part has always been the turtles smiling face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference for \\"Real World\\" Programming","review":"My first impression after I purchased this book was that it would have limited usefulness. However, after about two weeks on my first GTK+ project it became clear that it was actually the most useful of three books I had purchased. After having this book for more than a year, it is what I turn to about 85% of the time when I have a GTK+ question. If this book has a weakness it would be that it doesn't mention much about the GNOME desktop. However, for \\"real world\\" programming on a GTK+ based project that will last more than a couple of weeks or go beyond the basics, this book is a timesaver. I also have the book by Peter Wright that covers GNOME and is a fairly useful supplement to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lyrics, music average","review":"This is not David's best album.

Ric Hordinski does a fairly good job with the cool/innovative guitar sounds and arranging, but as on past recordings the sound production is thin and lacking.

Sure, the psychopath theme is getting a bit worn, but this time the idea has been used in a rather original fashion. The murderer is playing chess with corpses instead of pieces and is framing Christopher Lambert for it. I am not a fan of Lambert, but here he did a good job as the somewhat introvert chess-master, whose lack of openness makes him an ideal target for the frame. The supporting cast, led by Tom Selleck and Diane Lane has well worked out characters and the story moves along at a surprising pace. While not quite on the same level as Silence of the Lambs, Knight Moves will keep its audience thrilled right to the climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you want nightmares?","review":"If you do, get this movie as nightmares are almost guaranteed. I saw it with some college friends about eight years ago. It took about five years until the nightmares stopped. I cannot think back on this movie with any sort of fondness. The murders are quite gruesome.The only thing that I feel was well done was how the writer seemed to get into the mind of a serial killer, but that also concerns me. My mind just does not think in that sort of mode.While I am not a great player, I like the game of chess. I feel this movie did the game and those who play a really bad stereotype.Avoid this movie. It is not worth the time or stress."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst PHP book on the market","review":"I have bought a number of the PHP books around. This one was about the third or fourth that I bought, but it is by far the worst.The few chapters of actual content are quite good, but as people have noted, they have a lot of errors and are often badly edited or presented.The bulk of the book is a function reference. I did not mind the function reference in Core PHP. At least Leon wrote his own examples for functions and added something beyond just stealing from the online manual.In this book, the function reference is just a rip off to bulk up the page count."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing PHP book","review":"I agree with other reviewers. This is a disappointing PHP book. For syntax-reference book, you rather go for Core PHP."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"This book isn't what I thought it would be. I expected a tutorial that would spend more time on using PHP with a database. In reality it only has eight simple and not very useful examples. The remainder of the book is a reference section which consumes 445 of the 597 pages.And to top it off, the reference section has so many errors that you end up spending more time troubleshooting the book's errors than you do writing good code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"This book includes an overly brief intro to basic programmingconcepts which has no appeal to anyone who knows anything aboutprogramming.

My question is - Do not the authors of this book feel any obligation to address these criticisms in this forum?"},{"rating":"1","title":"PHP3 Reference Misses the Mark","review":"This book, which opened up with a lot of promise, ended up disappointing me. The title is misleading in that there is very little about what actually has to be done to build a database application. If you are looking to find a book that will take you through the basics of working with server side databases and show you how to construct web pages that will interact with those databases, look elsewhere.More than anything this book is a compendium of the PHP3 command set. The author's website did not work as promised and there was no response to email feedack. In the sparse and rudimentary application section what sample code existed had typos. In the reference section, some examples still had boilerplate filler.In summary, as a reference text this book is more than adequate; as a guide or teaching aid it completely misses the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would return it","review":"If I am not in Hong Kong, I would return the book. I agree with other reviewers that if you want to learn how to develop real database application using PHP, go somewhere else. The application examples in the book are so piecemeal. I am also disappointed that 2/3 of the book (pp.153-559) is language and function reference. I did not know this when I brough the book from Amazon! You can learn PHP and database programming much better by reading Professional PHP Programming (Jesus Castagnetto et al.) eventhough the book is not specifically written for database development. Their application examples are more realistic and full scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess of a book...","review":"I'll keep this short - this book is a mess. The authors claim that the book is for the novice and the \\"almost-expert\\" alike, but novices will be completely befuddled by it, and experienced programmers will be confused and frustrated. The reader will find dozens of editorial mistakes. It almost became a game for me - \\"find the errors in the code\\". My aggrevation with the book increased with every chapter. I am sorry I bought this book before reading the reviews on this site. I will never make that mistake again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, but failed miserably","review":"The book had a good start, starting off with a quick beginner-style intro into databases, but focused mostly on PostgreSQL. It was all downhill from there. There were COUNTLESS typos and syntax problems in the example applications. This book does NOT tell you how to create a good web application. If you already know how to do that in ASP, it tells you how to do it in PHP. If you're not experienced with ASP or any other server-side DB language (cold fusion), and you're looking to get into DB apps on the web w/PHP3 - do NOT buy this book - it will be a waste of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book you expect it to be","review":"I was very disappointed with this purchase, wish I could return it.

But the maker of this album must not have paid much attention, because a female duet doesn't make Tiamat a female-fronted band.And they missed quite a few other bands. Where's the track by Otep? Kittie? Tristania, who one of the three vocalists is a woman? How about Evanesence? Within Temptation? Why were these bands overlooked?Methinks that the person who came up with this album was more eager to jump on the bandwagon than to pay attention to the scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Deeper Dive Than the White Horse Inn Has Afforded","review":"Excellent.

This version of Bad is probably the most popular live version of the song. The two B-Sides are very good as well, and could have definitely made it onto The Unforgettable Fire album. As a CD it's probably not worth $8 or more just for a 4-song EP. But as a digital download this whole album is worth the $3.61!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great But Pricey Performance","review":"Although I paid full price for this CD when I bought it 11 years ago, I still think it was worth the money. Mainly because the live version of \\"Bad\\" is nothing less than great! This EP shows U2 at its best both in the studio and in concert.\\"Love Comes Tumbling\\" and \\"Three Sunrises\\" are polished pieces that should've been included in \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" CD. Given the overall weakness of UF, these two cuts alone would've helped raise the caliber of that album.\\"Sort of Homecoming\\" is an outstanding live perfomance that makes the studio version of this song seem pathetic. Without a doubt, the live version of \\"Bad\\" is among rock's gold standard of concert recordings. The rhythm section of Mullen and Clayton are solid and very much in harmony here and Edge's chiming guitar is vintage U2!I agree this disc ain't cheap but what's on here is worth the price of admission.

Maybe there really is an Eternity, and it's doing all it can to suppress the truth, even in fictional form!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you want and more","review":"This is one of the most innovative, mind-bending, and overall incredible novels that I've ever read. To be honest, it took a while for me to get into. Asimov introduces the reader into a society that requires a great deal of explanation. As simple as he tries to make it, it is easy to get lost in unknown terms and seemingly meaningless details. As much as I say this though, I read the entire last 50% of the book over the past few hours. Asimov's mastery of foreshadowing, suspense, and plot twists kept me fully interested and constantly wanting to read more. The concepts dealt with in the novel are all the crazy ideas that make me want to read science fiction. The novel makes political, philosophical, and moral statements that truly grip me. It's fantastic and I encourage everyone who sees this review to read it. Just do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asimov is science fiction royalty.","review":"A good paperback with larger print-easy on the eyes.

A great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating story about time traveling","review":"This story begins a little slow, but when it finally kicks off, you really want to know what happens next. One of the really good points of this sci-fi story is the way the details of the world fit into each other. The world and the characters are interesting because they are believable. It all makes sense, because of the amount of detail that goes into everything.Besides that, this book gives you another interesting view at time travel than most stories about this subject. I truly recommend this to every sci-fi fan that likes an intelligent story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best time travel book ever","review":"I have read a good deal of time travel fiction and philosophical science fiction (Philip K. Dick) and this book is pure genius that works on so many levels. So few time travel books really work with the complexities of its implications, but this one does to the fullest. Moreover the story is very human. It isn't the sci-fi of robots and descriptions of non-existent technologies. Finally, its got a twist you wouldn't believe. Why hasn't Hollywood caught wind of this? The Matrix crowd would love this even though this isn't remotely like the matrix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asimov's under rated & by far the best novel he has written.","review":"I've always been intrigged with Science Fiction, and have read many SciFi books.

A must read for time travel/SciFi fanatics."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is why they call Asimov \\"the master\\"","review":"The End of Eternity is a brisk and totally satisfying thought experiment that poses the question most other time travel books don't even ask: why would you even want to alter events in time? Asimov concludes, correctly, that the life of a species should unfold the same way an individual life unfolds; without the beneft of hindsight. A decision made in hindsight, it turns out, is not superior to the original - it's just wrong for different reasons.The Foundation series was just OK, Pebble in the Sky and The Currents of Space were downright boring, but this is the type of story that earned Asimov the title of master. Read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Overpriced for a Fifty Year Old Book!,,,","review":"Again, Macmillan and Tor appear to be selling their back catalogue at ridiculous prices as ebooks in my opinion. This book is 50 years old and the author has been dead for 18 years, yet they expect people to be gullible to pay $11.99 for an ebook that costs about $2.50 to make. What a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah! Asimov!","review":"Isaac Asimov is one of my cyclic reads, so I come to this review with five stars. His scientific-like grasp of human politics inspires me with each reread. Why do men of vision feel compelled to secretly or forcefully impose their vision on others, and why do some people become willing slaves to those visions? \\"The End of Eternity\\" weaves a tale of a man of the Second Foundation (for those of you familiar with that series) who seeks his own free will in a world where time is a two-way street, and men of vision keep tinkering with the map.Asimov's fiction is not as elegantly written as his nonfiction, but this plot is tight and twisty, and the characters are believably human. It's as good as science fiction gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This is one of the shortest novels Asimov has written (at least, the shortest I've read, and I've read plenty), but it packs a hell of a punch. Asimov's presentation of Eternity, an organization which exists out of time for the continual betternment of mankind, is very thought-provoking. This novel is unique among Asimov's in at least two respects: it explores (and questions) the morality of the \\"future\\" he presents (although Asimov deals a lot with morality in one form or other in most of his novels - this is one of the things I like most about reading him); and his characters are unusually human. Actually, for much of the book they are almost too human: they are often irrational and, well, dumb - as are some aspects of the world he creates. But persevere. As always, there is a reason for everything. It all comes together in an ending which will bend your mind. In short, a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brown Houndstooth Dog Coat","review":"This little coat has class. It is stylish, and smart looking, plus it is made extremely well.

The lug wrench fits the other lug nuts that are on the vehicle, just not these. So, I'd question that this is really an OEM part for a 2004 Liberty. In addition, they were not a perfect match as far as appearance, but I was going to use them any way, wouldn't have been that noticeable until I ran into the lug wrench issue.

Though there are many characters, this is hardly an ensemble cast, with Burt and Kirk prominent in virtually every foot of film. Rhonda Fleming provides a bit of window dressing in a wonderful but brief role as Wyatt's love interest.More of a classic western than \`My Darling Clementine', an earlier movie about Wyatt and Doc at the OK Corral, but this version is more episodic in nature, though equally fictional. Don't look for nuance in the characters. The bad guys are bad, the good guys good but not flawless.Gunfights, gambling, galloping horses, bar room ladies...

Although it was \\"glammed up\\" in costuming, sets, and charisma of the of the personalities (Burt as Wyatt and Kirk as Doc) for Fifties audiences, it was the epitome of Westerns for the time.

Not very realistic, perhaps, but great entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WESTERN THAT GETS BETTER EVERY MINUTE.","review":"The best thing in the Western \\"Gunfight At The O.K.

As the movie moves along, it gets more interesting, the story gets better, the situations are more exciting and the thrills grow.\\"Gunfight At The O.K. Corral\\" is not one of the best Westerns in overall quality, but it is one of the best Westerns in the fun and entertainment categories. It's only weak point is the title song, which sounds old and silly compared with the music of other Westerns like \\"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\\" or \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\".

The instrumental soundtrack was similarly intrusive and annoying.The producers literally stole a scene from the film's predecessor, \\"My Darling Clementine.\\" In both films, during a fight someone shoots down the candalabra in the saloon and thus sets the place on fire while the piano play shifts to eight-to-the-bar happy music.

I managed to go to my local used cd store and i found this \\"Island Life\\" cd. I picked it up, brought it home, and popped it in my cd player. The first 3 songs are from her first 3 disco albums Portfolio, Fame, and Muse. The last two are long out of print. My favorite song out of those 3 is I Need A Man. But then we get onto the better early 80's material such as Love Is The Drug, Pull Up To The Bumper, and My Jamaican Guy. The cd ends with Slave To The Rhythm which is a pretty cool song. My only complaint about this cd is that I wish they included more songs such as Demolition Man and She's Lost Control but i'm still pretty satisfied. I hope she makes a comeback in 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!","review":"My favorite song on this entire album is \\"I've seen that face before.\\" Musically and lyrically it's a wonderful trip to a dark, mysterious place that I'm sure you have in your own mind.Another notable favorite is \\"Slave To The Rhythym.\\" Overall, wonderful music and lyrically captivating throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"good album","review":"grace jones is a very interesting person and performer, and this album showcases some of her best stuff. i love the song \\"la vie en rose\\"-i didn't even think it was grace when i first heard it. the piano part is beautiful as is the percussion. \\"i need a man\\" is another very good one, a song that would go great on the dance floor. \\"do or die\\" is actually maybe my favorite on the whole album-but buy the \\"fame\\" album and listen to the full version instead of the edited. there are also a couple of duds on this, too. \\"my jamaican guy\\" is too damn repetitous to be that much fun, and the editing on \\"slave to the rhythm\\" is sort of poor, wherease if they left it alone it would be the classic it is. other than the editing, this is worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"girls just want to have fun","review":"I don't understand all the negativity surrounding Grace Jones's Island Life.

Her singing career has been an unintentional joke. The first three songs on this album represent the very worst disco had to offer. Not much better on \\"Private Life\\", a failed attempt to enter 1980's new wave craze. Only on \\"Libertango I've Seen That Face Before\\" do things get interesting.

Well, sorry, there is no cassette included; This makes it impossible to use this book to learn to speak or understand Tagalog. In addition, the introduction that gives a guide to pronunciation must be based upon a variation of English I am not familiar with (one of the authors lives in England): the book indicates the vowel 'o' is pronounced 'aw' in Tagalog.

Those being Persistence of Time and Sound of White noise. It\`s probably better that P.O.T. but I\`m not sure about the other one. Nonetheless this is an excellent album which showcases the talent of Anthrax and which helped solidify their status in the big 4 (Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer). Highlights include, many of the songs actually but my favorites are I am the law, Skeleton in the closet, and Indians. An overall very good album, no worries here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Thrash MADNESS!!!","review":"Everything thrash metal should be dark, fast, heavy, brutal!!!

Not like modern-day bands who CALL themselves thrash, this is true thrash, from the time when metal was cool. Just everthing about this album rocks hard. They add elements of hardcore punk and humor in their music, which makes it quite enjoyable. And of course, no metal album would be complete without a track about the plight of the American Indian. On 'Among The Living' Anthrax titles their song 'Indians'. The only thing I don't like about this album is the sound quality. It sounds pretty tacky. But sound quality can't really take anything away from such a good album. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of, if not the best thrash metal album ever!","review":"Anthrax's 1987 album \\"Among the Living\\" is nothing short of incredible. It seems Anthrax was just warming their hands and their sound on \\"Spreading the Diease\\". If you can get past the super fast drums and the crushing guitar riffs you will get to the harshness and realism of Scott Ian's lyrics. From writing about Native Americans or their comic book hero Judge Dredd, they are great. With Anthrax classics including \\"Indians\\", \\"Imitation of Life\\", and the title track. Ths album also holds Anthrax's greatest live song very appropriatly titled \\"Caught in a Mosh\\". This album is up there w/ Pantera's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" and Metallcia's \\"Master of Puppets\\" as the best thrash metal album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"most thrash bores me but....","review":"Most thrash is the worst metal ever imo, it's half what melodic metal is in songwriting and playing. However anthrax has enough knowledge of real guitar playing to actually be very good. And even non thrash fans like me can really enjoy their 1980's output. There's only a few thrash bands that I think were talented enough to even do melodic metal and this is one of them. Metalica, megadeath and a few others also come to mind. But with this one anthrax started a run of great thrash metal cd's. This is a powerful and fun cd. THe fun lasted until the early 90's with this band. By then they went totally hard and forgot the humor but here it's intact. These guys loved melodic metal so that influence keeps them from becoming what most thrash is today: limited one string boredom.So this band and this cd joins my metal collection as one of the few thrash bands that I would ever have in my collection. It's great at what it does. rock on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mosh, Baby","review":"\\"Among the Living\\" is often considered as greatest Anthrax album ever. There's of course the songs \\"N.F.L.\\", \\"Caught in a Mosh\\", \\"I Am the Law\\", Indians\\", and \\"Among the Living\\" which all are still very popular choices for set list. However, there's three songs that aren't so great classics. \\"One World\\", \\"A.D.I./Horror of It All\\", and \\"Imitation of Life\\". They are alright songs but comparing to the album \\"Spreading the Disease\\", this album is left as second. Anthrax was a good thrash metal band but they lost their touch after this album apart from couple of good songs.

I bought these shoes to be my flats when I was pregnant and could not wear high heels. They look nice, and professional, and have held up well despite the long hours on my feet and the swelling of my ankles. They held their shape through my entire pregnancy. Sometimes shoes in this price range tend to peel, but I have not had that issue with these shoes. Now I am no longer pregnant and like to wear higher heels, but I keep these at my desk in case I need relief from less comfortable shoes. They even look nice with skirts and dresses, which can not be said of all flats. I loved these shoes so much I bought them in several colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sweet","review":"This is a very sweet book, with simple illustrations and short, easy rhymes. (For example, \\"books to read\\" \\"stringing beads.\\") It's a great book for the end of the day because it's got a nice, quiet feel to it.

I would have to pass this one down, and I will not purchase one of these for my next home console."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing!","review":"Very confusing book starting with a short presentation of Corgi. Then comes many pages listing short notes about models, these are listed partially by vehicles number but not always chronological, totally confusing and frustrating. No listing of variants, so you would not be helped if you need information about this. (Which is a popular subject among collectors.) Then comes a picture section, that does not match the listing, and also very short description under the pictures. I have used hours to work my way through this booklet just because of this weird non matching listing. In the end, it starts listing up cars again, this section should have been together with the first one and not been split up by the picture section. The pictures was too small and did not show good enough details of details, decals and stickers, as I would expect from a book specializing on Corgi. I cannot recommend this book to anyone, and I regret I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for puppy 0 for netwerk","review":"on the first version they cut off the first 10 min. now they mess up the sound big time. the sound just constantly shifts into one speaker.

There are also several little glitches in the video.I just got this today, and have only spent ten frustrating minutes with this disc. They were bad enough to prompt me to write this review.Now, the show itself is classic puppy, and the songs are great. Ogre's performance is just plain scary. This would be the perfect video to play at your next church function or children's birthday party.But just take into consideration. Nettwerk is ripping you off, and the band off with this inferior and quite defective disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catalog Title, Catalog Treatment","review":"This is a great title, but it's marred once again by \\"catalog title\\" treatment. You know the type: Mastering booth puts in an original tape master into the machine, goes to get some coffee, and returns when it's done. It's the same lackluster treatment that classic material gets all the time when someone doesn't see the value in what they're mastering outside of fleecing the faithful. Left channel dropouts, video errors... this title has 'em. Outside of some glaring issues, this title smokes and has never looked better. The video quality is great when it's not glitching. Buyer beware: this is a flawed title, but from the prior release it appears this is as good as it's going to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video","review":"This is a great video for anyone who loves performance horror! Ain't it dead yet portrays Skinny Puppy in the earlier years before the ultimate masterpiece concert: Last Rites. I wish there was a professionally shot video from that tour.

Worth it if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely, purely, 100% skippable","review":"I wonder why I am editing this review after 2 years because the sales records of this book must have already spoken volumes by now, but I guess I dont want others to spend money on such absolutely disappointing 'material'. Which is what it is, it is certainly not a book. If you are looking for light-years worth of textual reading fodder on the exalted subject of Java Beans and Servlets technology (which are both presumably well established by now), this may be good bed-side reading. If on the other hand you want hands-on code samples with explanations of J2EE oriented concepts, forget this and get yourself a decent book like \\"Mastering Java Beans\\" or any of the Wrox titles on the subject. This was one of those useless quick-to-market type books that usually come out in a flurry to cash in on a new technology's hype. Hope this helps you spend your penny wisely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Rousseau has an amazing capacity for rapid thought, and digresses quite often into interesting subjects while revealing the education of Emile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emilie","review":"A remarkable book by a remarkable philosopher. Amazon was ready willing and able to provide it to me.

The premise is simple: Let nature be the educator. Imagine a kid dropped in the middle of Yosemite National Park, revisit him at age 20, and the kid will know everything he needs to know. Now, you know the substance of the book. If you think nature alone without a preceptor or teacher other than nature alone is sufficient, you'll be bored with the redudancies and polemics against \\"this\\" and \\"that\\" institution that has developed over the centuries. The core of the book is a vain effort to show that these institutions have corrupted the student, and ergo, society. If only nature could be allowed to \\"speak,\\" so to speak, then men everywhere would be better off.

She had Umberto D (about a man and his dog for goodness sake) down as her favourite movie of all time. And you've got to remember that she had sat through about 35,000 films in her lifetime. As you might imagine I was fairly intrigued at this prospect. The reality is that this film genuinely delivers like no other, if you like your heart shaken and stirred with something authentic. Now I cry fairly easily at movies when the going gets tough, but this one is truly in a class of its own. In fact the final scenes are so painful and poignant that even 20 years later I cannot recall them without emotion. But ironically this film leaves you feeling better than when you went in about the human spirit, and that's why I think it's ultimately so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Melodramatic","review":"I thought this was going to be a gritty, realistic, existentialist movie, artfully done. Instead, its full of melodramtic fifties music, slooow moving, and ends with you saying to yourself \\"is that it?\\". This movie is just boring. If it weren't so melodramatic, it may be possible to sympathize with the old man, which is the crux of the film to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Umberto D.","review":"Portraying the plight of the elderly dispossessed in an acknowledged masterpiece of the neorealist style, De Sica's \\"Umberto D.\\" may surpass his own \\"Bicycle Thief\\" for heartbreaking poignancy. What in less skillful hands could have been treacly melodrama becomes instead a wrenchingly honest tale about a forgotten human being searching in vain for some shred of human kindness. Half a century later, \\"Umberto D.\\" remains a monumental achievement of simple, eloquent storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The touching side of Neo-realism!","review":"Vittorio De Sica is easily distinguished from other neo-realists like Visconti, Rossellini, and early Fellini. You can immediateley feel something human in his films and down to earth (rather populist). Though I prefer the style of Visconti (whose 'La Terra Trema' ranks as one of my favorites) - 'Umberto D' has a simplicity and beauty to it that will put you in mind of Bergman's 'Wild Strawberries'. Like Issac Borg in 'Wild Strawberries' - Umberto is a man approaching death with rather shabby relationships to hold on to in the world. He clings to his dog who he cannot bear to part with - this develops into a tear-jearking ending that will have even the most stoic serious men balling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Middlegame Problem Book","review":"The core of this book is 30 tests in a series of increasing complexity where the reader is asked to choose from 3 reasonable alternative plans for each test. In one test, you may be given the following alternatives: a) Should you try to close the center and attack on the kingside? b)Double the enemy's pawns and pile up on the open file? c)Or take the initiative and prepare a central pawn advance? You're not thrown into the tests without preparation as the authors first discuss (with 7 detailed games) ways to analyze, asess, and implement a plan. I would say that this book is a positional brother to all those chess tactics books. If you can find it, well worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book!","review":"An excellent book which confronts the reader with a choice of three main plans for a number of positions which arose in tournament games. The reader is awarded points based on the choice of plan, and the variations which were forseen. These points can be added up and the readers strength can be assessed! It is a uniquely challenging and addictive book as well as being highly instructional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough support","review":"Looking at the picture, it seemed to me this would be a good wrist support and would allow me to use my hand while wearing it.

While Carpal Mate isn't quite as effective and you may feel slightly more discomfort than with the more popular full size braces, it provides more range of motion and is a lot easily to get in and out of. These are also much much better for gaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars!

This product was a huge improvement over what I used to use. The wrist wrap itself is wide and stable. It is a bit hard to take off because the velcro is so secure but the piece goes all the way to your palm for stability. Nonetheless it is very comfortable and keeps my wrist from going at an akward angle. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carpal wrist support","review":"I use this carpal wrist support on a daily basis. I do transcription and type on the computer 8+ hours a day.

This product is perfect since it helps prevent additional stress caused by improper keyboard use, but it also just looks like a black sweat band from the top down.

I'll have to switch to a brace that goes all the way around the wrist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangles more than helps","review":"At first it, the supports helped. But after a while, I felt my blood vessels becoming more and more restricted. I gradually had to loosen the supports to the point where they were so loose, I might as well have not worn them. So I stopped. I've decided to instead purchase an ergonomic keyboard and mouse (I'm still waiting on the keyboard, but so far, just using an ergonomic mouse has made a WORLD of a difference). And yes, I brought the mouse (and will be bringing in the keyboard) to work. As far as home computer use goes, I've just cut down drastically. (Try to relax all muscles when typing, don't type too hard, stretch/shake out your hands/wrists often, keep your elbows close to your sides if you're using a regular keyboard, etc.) The scream-out-loud pain hasn't returned since. Though there's still a little discomfort and/or pain every now and then, but hopefully that'll change once I receive my keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable.","review":"I was wearing this to work at the hospital because it's small enough to wear under my gloves.

Has good support yet is small and unobtrusive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little to no use","review":"This item provides little to no support. The band that goes around your wrist must be secured tightly in order to keep the single brace in place and even then it hardly provides any support. Being so tight caused additional pain in my wrist and I found myself constantly squeezing the wrist band to allow circulation. I think if I used this product for an extended period it would make my wrist pain much worse rather than better. Also, the single support under the hand does not keep your hand in a neutral position; you can bend your wrist backward as much as you like which is a problem for most people. After finally visiting a doctor about my wrist pain I was given a full wrist support that had braces behind and above the hand. The doctor's brace has 3 velcro straps to ensure proper fit and secure bracing of the wrist w/o causing circulation problems.My advise is to see a doctor; if you cannot do that find a brace that has multiple adjustments and braces above and behind the wrist."},{"rating":"1","title":"No support, No return/refund","review":"I purchased this product based on positive reviews. I tried it out and was so unhappy with it.My wrist had very little support. I could bend it up because there was nothing to keep it from doing that.When I called to return it I was told that State hygiene laws prevented returns for this product. So I am stuck with something I find useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allows for too much movement","review":"Based on some favorable reviews I ordered this wrist support. It sounded like it would be the ideal solution for my wrist pain which is caused by long hours of computer work.However, this did not work for me at all. While it works great supporting the hand/wrist from falling \\"downward\\", it did not keep my wrist from bending upward (or as another reviewer here says \\"backward\\"), which is something that I seem to be doing when typing. So if your pain is caused by bending your wrist downward too much, this is the brace for you. If, on the other hand, you are like me and tend to bend your hand slightly upward, you should look for something else. Regrettably I had to return this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't help my carpal tunnel - better products are out there","review":"This product did me no good as it provides little support and only keeps your wrist from bending forward, not back.

I like all kinds of music from techno to hip hop , alternative to metal and rock, so I know what sounds good and what doesn't. I'm also a music producer so I'm fairly experienced with sounds and production techniques. When I heard this album it sounded as if a child who just learnt about music production produced this album. It is by far and truly one of the worst albums this year. I've seen many people have given this album a five stars rating but if you like music that's not totally basic and boring, then this ALBUM IS NOT FOR YOU so don't waste your money. You have probably noticed that this website 'Amazon' has a lot of 'Used' copies of this album available. Guess why!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always New Depths","review":"I thought Silent Alarm was a great cd when it first came out, and this Remixes album adds a whole new dimension on those favorite songs.

Their album was one of my favorites of the past year. Many thought it was the album of the year. They are an exciting and energetic band. They are constantly being played at clubs. This comes out about the same time as Death From Above 1979. Vice seems to like to come out with these remixes, that you only ever hear at clubs, or they are included as B-sides, but rarely as a whole album, so soon. Some of the hits are here such as \\"Like Eating Glass\\" and \\"Helicopter\\" and of course \\"Banquet.\\" The choice of remix artists is odd too. You have Ladytron, DFA 1979, and M83. But you also have ones by Four Tet, Mogwai, and Nick Zinner (Yeah Yeah Yeahs). Pretty Girls Makes Graves is on here too. The DFA 1979 version of \\"Luno\\" is not so much a remix as a recreation.

I had the opportunity to see them perform on their last U.S. tour. I was impressed by their wonderful vocals and innovative instrumentals. I especially liked their use of Balkan beats. The instrumentation (flute, guitar, drum and fiddle) is pleasing to hear and their lead singer has a wonderful voice.I've been a fan of Celtic music for many years. I remember the excitement I felt the first time I heard Planxty. I couldn't believe Irish music could sound that good (I thought it all sounded like the Clancy's and Dubliner's singing at a pub). I had the same thrill when I heard Grada. They are not a Planxty clone. Much of the music is original and their arrangements are unique (and their lead singer is female).But once again I feel like a door has opened into a new sound and new direction. This group deserves support.

For the reviews saying they are junk I'm pretty sure they just don't know how to wire audio equipment.

Ione Skye's (Frankie)character is frankly unlikeable, she is a self involved bore who seems to be living on another planet from the rest of her friends. Mackenzie Austin (David) is likeable enough, and for a while displays some strength of character by sticking with his girlfriend, but of course by the end of the movie he falls for Frankie, though god knows why, as she does not show a single redeeming character trait in the whole movie. You could just picture them 5 years later, and her heading for the door because \\"the passion is gone\\".The only really likeable character was played by Jennifer Aniston, but it was a waste of her time too, and you have to wonder why David didn't notice her, as she is twice the gal Frankie is."},{"rating":"1","title":"The horror....The horror","review":"What a terrible, terrible, terrible movie.

I disagree with the editorial review that says that Frankie is \\"utterly spoiled and obnoxious.\\" Do these people watch the movies they review at all?? She is an aspiring actress, and as such, she is perhaps overly dramatic and prone to overly contrived speeches. But, aren't all aspiring actresses (professional or merely by lifestyle) that way? And don't our friends love us anyway? Are we not entitled to love?I am sprawled across my red, velvet chaise, wrapped in a marabou stole utterly distraught over that review. I cannot go on....."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best independent movies I have ever seen","review":"The way they used black and white, then when she meets the man she is to be with it turns to color.

I just picked in up at the movie store on a whim and I am glad that I did. Ione Skye did a great job in this movie.

The author obviously had a great depth of knowledge on the subject. Wish there had been more behind the scenes type stories on the \\"classic\\" quartet but it was very good none the less.The book is a great looking- glass into what must have been a magical time for small group Jazz/American music and into one of the most progressive quartets of the age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hobby knife","review":"This an extremely well made knife, but the description is misleading.

The contributions of other artists are done in taste. This is good listening for either children or adults. I am thinking this is similar to the work of Woody Guthrie's when he was writing and performing songs for his and other children.

It looked like a fun cd, so I checked it out of the library and put it on for my 2 year old. I'm not one for most of what passes for \\"children's music\\", but Zanes' music is definitely not in the same category. This is music that adults can easily tolerate, and if you like funky, funny folk music you'll probably enjoy it quite a bit. I know I do, and by the way, my kid likes it too.

This is a great version of the story and Pierce Brosnon as well as the rest of the star-studded cast perform wonderfully. However, I had to give this DVD a 1 star rating because of the terrible video quality. It looks like it was recorded from a bad VHS copy by an amateur home video enthusiast. The coloring is dark and blurred, the audio is terrible and there are even the occasional \\"wrinkled-tape\\" lines that pass through the picture.

My advice is stay away from any used copy of this dvd, there are just no good used sources for this dvd. I will buy the real macoy from a reputable vendor, after throwing away nearly $14 bucks to these unscrupulous vendors. If the rating system allowed me I would have rated it zero stars. Stay away from a used copy of this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This video series is a classic version of Jules Verne's story. Years ago we had taped the TV mini-series onto VHS, but over the years the tapes have worn down. We were excited to see that it has been dubbed onto DVD.

Every now and then we watch it, but our tape was so bad I decided to see if it was available on DVD. I found two versions and decided to get the least expensive. This version was ok, but the quality of the recording was not as good as most. The picture seemed fuzzy and dark. We still love the movie, but were a little disappointed in the quality of the DVD.

First, the color ispoor, orange skin, etc. More importantly, the producers haveincluded the endless repeats of logos/credits/overview scenes,used in the original telecast, adding up to almost an hour of \\"noise\\". Almost impossible to edit while watching,for your viewing pleasure I recommend that lovers of this series, of which I am one, tape the excellent 5 hour version frequently shown on cable TV without interruptions, and make your own video disc. The most delightful version of this work, featuring great erformances by Eric Idle and Pierce Brosnan, it deserves a better fate. Avoid this DVD version like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful adventure you'll love to see over and over...","review":"This version with Pierce Brosnan is even better than with David Niven and that one was excellent. The movie follows Jules Verne's adventure of a proper Englishman who on the basis of a wager travels around the world in 80 days. The scenery is outstanding, the places you visit make you wish you lived in the 1800's. The actors do a superb job. And before you know it... it's over. You will wish it would last twice as long. I give it 5 stars. A definate addition to your collection of classics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Todd-AO version","review":"Not only a more detailed plot than the earlier version with David Niven, but doesn't suffer from scenes filmed only for the purpose of making the audience motion-sick from the wide curved-screen effects of Todd-AO. I was very pleasantly surprised that something intended mainly for TV distribution had such high production values."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good remake","review":"Pierce Brosnan does a great job in this remake of Around the world in 80 days I really enjoyed watching it. I have the original as well but this was good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this movie","review":"It's everything I remember from when it first Aired. A fun family flick. If you've not seen this then I recommend it. The newer Jackie Chan one was good but this one stays truer to the book. As to some of these \\"Quality of product Reviews\\" They should figure out that the Made for TV movies of 1989 Can not be remastered like the Movies of that period. Because they used less sophisticated equipment, etc. Like any play you must be able to suspend reality and just enjoy the show. It really is 266 min so it might be wise to split up your viewing time."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS on DVD - Why do they bother?","review":"I loved this series when I first saw it. How wonderful for it to be on DVD at last! But wait, what's this? Dark... grainy... tracking glitches... The DVD looks like it was transfered from a much rented VHS tape.

I have no idea if this current version has a better quality video transfer. But the one I bought is possibly the worst transfer to DVD that I have ever seen. Worse than watching your average VHS tape. Murky. Dull. Undetailed. Fuzzy. Dim. Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful. Too bad, too, because this is a decent rendition of the Verne story. And the cast of supporting actors is to die for: Christopher Lee, Peter Ustinov, Eric Idle, Robt. Morley, Roddy McDowell, Darren McGavin, Jack Klugman, John Hillerman, Patrick McNee, Simon Ward, etc. Hope somebody fixes this show for DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silver Lies Rings True","review":"This was an easy read.

She was signing her new book and since I live in Colorado and love Colorado stories, thought I'd start from the beginning.

The plot and story are great but the writing is poor and often not engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Parker has written a wonderful first book. Her descriptions of 1870's Leadville are vivid and integral to the story. Her characters are diverse, real, interesting and fully developed. Inez is a smart, independent woman, capable of holding her own yet will doubts and insecurities of her own. Her dialogue is appropriate to the period. The plot is interesting and compelling; it caused me to read way too late into the night in order to finish it in one read. There is a romance, but it doesn't overwhelm the story or the character and very good suspense. I highly recommend this excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"It was a good diversion. I've been to that region, and I enjoyed reading a story about its past.

I even read the ending to see if that would keep me going but still didn't get any further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"Excellent story. The characters were very well done and it was obvious the author did her research on silver mining during the time period. Although I learned way more about assayers than I really wanted to know, LOL the information was necessary in the telling of the story.I found Inez to be a strong, independent minded businesswoman who was making the best of a bad situation. When something had to be done, she did it without complaint and without looking back.The roles that Rev. Sands and Gallagher played were a surprise but that's all I can say without revealing too much. I didn't realize this was one in a series but I'm anxious to read them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"I finished this book because I did want to find out who the culprits were, but it seemed to take forever!I have a friend who lives in Leadville so that attracted my attention. I like mysteries and I like strong smart women protagonists but this book only had one of those two things.I never could warm up to Inez. She just seemed too stubborn, proud, stupid and easily influenced by any man who paid attention to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like...","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I was in Leadville this summer & I thought it would be a fun read. Got about 15% into the book and had to put it down. Hopefully, when the weather is freezing and there is nothing left to read I can try and get back into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This scale appeared online to be just what I wanted. The size and basic design turned out to be just fine. The disappointment lies in the quality of the measuring device itself. The component that determines weight is cheaply constructed so that you're never quite sure exactly what your food weighs. Each time you rest the top container on the scale to set the weight to zero you get a different response from the scale! This is not the scale for someone who must get exact results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool toy","review":"I bought this toy for my son who has enjoyed playing with it.

Got it and everything looked ok until I tried to put my mixer in the case. Please be aware that the well width for the mixer is only 9.25 inches. I wish this listing had specified that, because I wouldn't have bought it. Also, it shows additional foam in the turntable recess, and there was none in my case. It really looked like I got the case of the CBM10, and the inside of the CBM10E. I am returning the case and am really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertisement!!","review":"I ordered the CBM10 and received a CBM10e which is not what was advertised. The CBM10 has steel recessed hardware and nice foam wrap for your turntables while the CBM10e has cheap surface mounted hardware,very thin foam and not to mention a RUBBER handle! Who would trust that handle with their precious tables inside? NOT ME!UPDATE!!It seems the item is listed wrong but the seller did refund me $30 which put the case at $65. I used the $30 to replace the hardware with deavy duty handles with through bolts with lock nuts and washers on the inside, as well as add quite a bit of foam on the inside to keep everything snug.

I was aware of his new Celldweller project, and watched how he did on his self-promotion (great job).His initial releases that later made it to this album were great. He's since updated them.This album has all the trappings of a great industrial and even techno album (the influences are very apparent in some songs). His use of breakbeats also is various nice.Although the songs aren't as crunchy and angry as Ministry, the sheer originality of them makes them worth listening to.He had a long road before getting this released, but if this is any indication of how much he's grown, then we have a lot to look forward to.

Then it twists into an acoustic, and more ambient, darker industrial songs. This cd's range of sound goes from heavy, to trancy, to acoustic, to orchestrated, to remixed, to mellow. It is utterly amazing.Not only is the music amazing, but Klayton's voice still amazes me to this day. He is such a talented musician. I've played this cd for tons of friends (mostly whom hate industrial) and they ALL loved it. They couldn't find a downfall anywhere on this cd.Also, if you get a chance....see this band live.

The use of piano is more limited, and the use of percussion and the less traditional instruments. The album is full of Waits, strange and witty lyrics.The change on this CD compared to Heartattack and Vine is monumental. Let me say it right away even if you loved Heartattack and Vine or Blue Valentines it is NO guarantee that you will even remotely like Swordfishtrombones. I think the change apparant on this release are welcome, to me it sounded like Waits was getting tired of his old style, and he wanted to try something new.

From day one it was noisy and scratchy, I take a pervese pleasure in the idea that Tom would almost prefer it that way. After being a companion on countless roadtrips the tape had become so worn that I had to replace it. The CD was like hearing it for the first time, there are sonic nuances I've missed for years.

Thankfully (mercifully) many of the cuts have long long instrumental introductions such as 'Dave The Butcher'. The opening cut, 'Underground', will be enough to frighten most listeners away to begin with. To call this 'music' cutting edge progressive alternative experimental is like dropping a can of paint on the sidewalk and calling it modern art. The 'music' (noise) on this disk is different.

In the post-Woolfson era, Parsons has shown that he can still manage the big ideas, the big songs, and, of course, the big production that makes his projects so wonderful. I think of the anguish in \\"Oh Life (There Must be More)\\" from \\"Try Anything Once\\" or the beautifully executed album \\"On Air.\\" This latest disc, however, does not spin so well for me. I am willing to say that perhaps Alan (or Ian, as the case may be) is going for subtlety here, but this whole album strikes me as music to fall asleep to. When I want Enya, I'll get Enya. I want Alan Parsons music! That said, the production is, of course, impeccable, and there are moments when one can glimpse the former glories of Alan's musical output.

Time Machine is not a typical AP album, and Alan Parsons' absence in composing music is evident. Being an Alan Parsons Project fan, I was disappointed with Woolfson's departure as his contribution was instrumental to that APP sound; with Time Machine Alan Parsons apparently has taken the cue by composing only a minute piece, allowing the vacuum to be filled by fellow AP band members. Competent music? Yeah. Polished production values? Sure. The Alan Parsons Project it ian't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Parsons Is Trying Too Hard!","review":"I've purchased Alan Parsons from the time I heard \\"I Robot\\" and had to go back and buy Tales of Mystery. Always a progressive sound, always something different you hear each time you listen. This latest album has 2 worthwhile songs on it I think: \\"Out of the Blue\\" and \\"Press Rewind\\". The album starts out great, with all the mystery and lavish arrangement that has made Alan Parsons one of all-time favorites over the years, then even this turns into disco-drivel, with a beat that has absolutely no place in the song! Then it's on to a song that is a backdrop for some monologue (ala Pink Ployd), which itself doesn't make much sense. \\"Out of the Blue\\" is the third song and is great, but then it's FF to \\"Press Rewind\\", then on to another AP CD. In my opinion the greatest album he made was 1993's \\"Try Anything Once\\", where every song is good. I don't expect to hear \\"filler\\" from AP, and if Eric Woolfson is to blame, he'd better come home!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of his best...","review":"ever since Alan Parsons parted with Eric Woolfson, the chemistry has gone.

The Turn of a Friendly Card, Ammonia Avenue, Tales, and Vulture Culture were incredible. My biggest disappointments to date were Eve and I Robot, which are still listenable.And then came the Time Machine. Worst album they've put out so far. The best word for it is 'flat.' The opening track is the only one with any energy at all; the rest simply meander from note to note without any feeling of development or progress, let alone excitement or other feeling.Even the lyrics are flat. The concept behind \\"Press Rewind\\" had a lot of potential, but the music didn't live up to it. And the lyrics of the others were mostly bland platitudes. It's a sad day when the most insightful words are the voice-over narration by Professor Frank Close in Temporalia.I'd come to expect much more out of Alan Parsons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Adagio: A Windham Hill Collection appears to be a collection of pieces just barely off key with a back ground beat that has little to do with the music itself.

The other one said I was on fertile days...but not marked any peak until day 28, when it detected the ovulation day (I had irregular cicles during the last 3 months and the OvaCue always said my fertile days were from 12 to 17). Finally I got pregnant that very long cycle on day 28 or 29 (which I confirmed on day 30 with a raise in my basal temperature). Obviously, had I kept using the OvaCue I had never gotten pregnant.

One of them stated that Korn was the first band to fuse metal and rap and I just started laughing at him and then handed him this CD and told him to check the copyright date.This album also exposed me to Sabbath. I knew of Black Sabbath before I heard this album but I didn't get interested in them until I heard Anthrax's cover of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.If you like Anthrax or this genre of music you might also want to check out S.O.D.

They updated it somewhat on their \\"Attack Of The Killer B's\\" CD, and it certainly sounds more polished, but the original is still the best, and always brings a smile to my face whenever I listen to it.

Ferreri has quite an imagination, especially his use of juxtaposition: a rotting carcass of King Kong, a wax museum where James Coco reenacts parts of history, and an underground society where rats prevail. Depardieu, who's lines are badly dubbed, manages to get through this yarn uncomfortably gripping a chimp where he found beside the dead Kong. Mastroianni is always at his best, altho this time presenting a more cartoonish characterization. However, despite the exotic idiosyncrasies, this film can be rather dull at moments. Nevertheless, I enjoyed a large percentage of this movie, ad hominem the ambiguous finale which may help clarifies the film's bizarre symbolism.

Then I remembered that the TV remote had an Input Select button. I changed the Input Select button to Video 1 and got a beautiful picture. I have the input button set to Video 1, because I am using the Line In 1 RCA jacks. I am not the one in my house who normally handles the technology, so I was very happy to prove I could do it!

If you have a simple installation, with no motors or multiple walls between the transmitter and receiver, this may work for you, but don't bother if it's more complex. Whatever product you use, it is important to choose a 5.8 Ghz system since the 2.4 Ghz system picks up interference from remote phones and wireless routers.

The unit mostly works, though unless I had the two in each others open line of sight, there was interference when someone walked around the room. What killed it for me was the poor quality of sound. The manufacturer claims hi-fi sound, but it is anything but. Placing the units right in front of each other did not help. It was just painful to listen to I did not bother with the video as even the sound was unacceptable. It may be ok for just watching tv on an old 32\\" TV or a low end sound system, but that's about it. I returned the unit and ate shipping both ways.

Flat, leaden, dull prose. Cardboard characters with no depth. Silly little trivial asides. No sense whatever of plotting, timing or narrative. The author uses a true story from the pages of the Wall Street Journal as the basis for this book, but does not realize that he still has an obligation to write well and make the characters come alive -- you can't hang your words on an extoskeleton; the book has to have internal structure. The ending is farcial, and the subplot conflict between father and son is a genuine embarassment to read. Avoid at all costs. I want my money back!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Like the Title Says...Good for Beginners","review":"This is a good book for people starting to learn Arabic. It has useful phrases and explains the language well. A good trick the book uses is to write names like \\"Jane\\" in Arabic. It's much easier to learn to read Arabic if you work with words you know.On the downside the flashcards that come with the book aren't very good. They are too small and printed on paper that is too thin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun introduction to a difficult language!","review":"This book is a valuable resource as an introduction to Arabic for someone who wants an introduction to the alphabet and some basic volabulary, grammar and phrases. It is well-designed to make learning easy and fun. It is also a great value because it comes with a CD and flashcards to help with pronunciation and script recognition.I think a weakness of the book is the superficial treatment of script in the middle of the text. However, it is an adequate introduction, but to me learning the script would be easier with a book likeThe Arabic Alphabet: How to Read & Write It. This is a much more comprehensive, accessible and less intimidating exposure to learning Arabic script and it is still less than 100 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for Beginners","review":"I have arabic for dummies and it is better, incl CD for audio.

It was slow and uninteresting.- The interface was awkward - motion and characters were user UNfriendly - it was not addictive nor captured my attention in the slightest - this seemed like low budget, small plot type of gamePlease don't wate your money. <Like I unfortunately did> There are so many better games at the same price.Lates, jules."},{"rating":"1","title":"The game CHEATS!!!","review":"If there is one thing I hate it is when games cheat. This game gives each unit two range statistics, sight range and weapon range. Playing this game even on its easiest setting, I continually got wiped out by units that supposedly had short ranges. Even my snipers(which supposedly have long vision ranges and weapon ranges) couldn't barely see other units before getting killed. Snipers behind trees were no match for SMG units standing in the open. It was particularly lovely to see artillery out ranged by riflemen! With the cheat code to turn off the fog of war, this game became playable, but you shouldn't need to do that. Also I am tired of games that don't have mission editors. Yes this game is cool because you supposedly have lots of units at your disposal, but that hype means nothing when you don't have the ability to choose. There are much better combat games out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Game for real generals","review":"Good game for most people love war game especially in WWII. Only one thing can be improved is the Panzer/Tank seens to be too weak at tall. Anti-tank Pak becomes the main role in this game. But for any people who like Air-force, sorry, there is no space to explain, Heers only. On strategy level, this game demands you alot, always think before act. Otherwise, you'll have a BBQ of your troops. In addition, it's a real situation for General like you, cos no production cost or worries on resources. All u need to know is how to use your troops to win. I left only 3 soldiers but still completed the mission. See how cool is it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but no brains.","review":"The Amazon review of this game is accurate. You may get a cast of hundreds in this game, but the gameplay is simple and routine. If you're looking for a game with large numbers of combatants, try Shogun: Total War. For WW II, the Close Combat series (especially CC III) remains the best tactical game out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Mice and Men","review":"If you are used to getting all the units you want in order to win your missions rushing through enemy ines, stay away from this game. if you are used to self-moving, out-of-scale war machines, stay away. if you are used to not think about tactics, stay away from this game. if you are used to win easily and without effort, you are either very good, or just stay away from this game.if none of the above refers to you, buy the game, get trained in singleplayer, and play this game online. no other game i have ever played beats this game in multiplayer. giant maps, with up to 12 players, hundreds of units you can manage individually or in groups, sophisticated tactical possibilities, and real-time-battle. my alltime favourite, really. and the best of all: rushers and campers never win against good tactics. but thats probably why most of us-americans do not like this game. it's maybe a little bit too complex for fast-food-minds.see you all on th battlefield.

Machine are weak against tanks and unlike the c&c games the tanks can actually kill troops!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"Some people sing this game's praises, but the fact is that poor pathfinding, an utter lack of realism (infantry squads can destroy entire tank columns, B-17s fly close air support,...), and brain-dead AI make this game an exercise in frustration for most game players. Players new to gaming might enjoy the game's graphics and large number of available units, but the game's weaknesses will soon wear on them as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disapointment","review":"I have my own rule when it comes to buying new games. Never buy the game without playing the demo first. I violated that rule on this one and boy, do I regret it.If you have never played a strategy game before, or perhaps if you have not played anything since the first SimCity came out, this will seem like it's great. But. . . after Starcraft, Age of Empires, and Empire Earth, this is downright pedantic. The graphics are adequate, the AI is terrible, the gameplay is awkward, words are misspelled, navigating the menus is a pain, and the instruction manual is barely enough to get started.If you want to play a good strategy game, get Empire Earth and set it to WWII if that is what you are desperate to play. If you want to play a realistic wargame, get Operational Art of War. If you want to find out how many half-truths can be written on the side of a software box, get this one.I recommend you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun game -","review":"this is a great game for beginners.

I like it a lot! I'm a big fan of games like Commandos, Warcraft, Roller Coaster Tycoon, etc. And I definitely think Sudden Strike fits with those. You really have to think about strategy when attacking enemies. You can't just send all your men and steam roll 'em! You have to use some flanking tactics and sneaking up to win. And RECON, RECON, RECON! Also, taking the time to train your men really pays off. The only thing I found odd was that a tank couldn't run over a soldier. They have to shoot them to kill them. Also, I would like to be able to zoom in to see my troops and tanks better. Other than that, I think anyone who likes an addictive \\"high-clicking\\" game will love this.

Fits like a glove. All buttons and functions are easily accessible. My favorite thing about it is that it just lets you be a bit more care-free with the camera. Without it, I find myself placing the camera down on the table in slow motion so as not to bump or scratch it and treating the camera like its a newborn. Now you can worry less about your camera and just take great photos. Being more comfortable with bringing your camera with you - without fear of your precious big $ camera dinged up - will allow you to have your camera more readily available. Having a camera 'always-ready' is one of the keys to great photography.[Another reviewer said that it was TOO tight. Mine was not. It was just right. I thought I'd be struggling to stretch it on. It slid on easily and is remaining on securely.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"camera armor for sony alpha A-100K","review":"This product is a great addition to my camera. I feel more secure knowing that it is on there, that in case it gets bumped or knocked down it is protected. It also helps keep dirt and dust out.

While trying to use her left hand to pull the cover down into her mouth, the right hand was caught and pinched between the lid and the keyboard. The plastic is shaped in a way which hurts - even when I closed the toy on my own thumb to test it.I recommend parents do not let their child play with this toy unless you can literally sit there and stare at them the entire time. VTech would be wise to put some sort of safety on the lid of this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great learning toy for baby","review":"We bought this for our son when he was 6 months old because he is always wanting to play with our computer. All the other toy laptops I've seen are for older babies/toddlers so we got this one. He is having a lot of fun with it and it's a great toy. He really likes pressing the buttons and hearing the songs, and opening and closing it. There are three modes, and right now he likes the music best. There are two volume levels which is nice. It's very durable. The only issue I have is that he keeps closing the laptop on his fingers. It doesnt really hurt him, but does pinch his fingers a bit. He's learning now to get his fingers out of the way!

We've had it for 3 months and it's still in perfect working condition, even after all the abuse! It's one of his favorite toys. The music never seems to get old to him. The one negative though is that one time, on closing, the lid did pinch his fingers. Didn't stop him from loving his laptop though.. he's even playing with it right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Toy for Toddler Son","review":"This was a decent buy for the price. It's a little geared more towards babies (age is 6 mos & up), but the next laptop from Vtech starts at ages 3 & up. So, for an 18 month old, this doesn't do the best at entertaining him. It is sturdy (my son has stepped on it a couple times).

He really enjoyed the lights and sounds and would play with it exclusively for long periods of time. Then, about a 3 months after we got it, the mouse stopped working. We didn't think much of it since the other buttons were still working and my son didn't seem to notice. Then, one by one, each of the \\"keyboard\\" buttons stopped working. Eventually, even *I*, as an adult - pushing as hard as I could - couldn't get any lights or sounds to work. My son tried to play with a few more times, but quickly grew bored as it was nothing more than a fancy paperweight. It now sits in the bottom of the toybox in the land of forgotten toys. For the record, my son never spilled anything other than drool on the laptop. We did try changing out the batteries, but alas, nothing worked.If it can't hold up to 4 months of use and a little baby drool, it doesn't seem to be worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out little fingers","review":"I just took this toy away from my 9 month old after he slammed the lid shut on his fingers.

There are three settings you can put it on, and she loves to see the lights light up.

After about 3 instances of this happening, I took the toy away because it seemed like it was hurting my child. I don't think a hand got slammed in it because the screen has always been fully open when I've noticed the crying.

It really bothers me that when my son has lost interest in it and moved on to another toy, it continues to nag him for several minutes. And he'll have three or four V-tech toys sitting around him at tummy time, and they're all yelling \\"play with me! play with me!\\" He really enjoys them, so I can't complain there, but I usually turn the volume to the lowest setting, or turn it off immediately when he's done."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR MY KIDS","review":"I BUY THIS FOR MY DAYCARE AND MY KIDS LOVE IT,I ALWAYS BUY V-TECH BECAUSE ITS A GOOD PRODUCT.ITS EDUCATIONAL FOR MY KIDS AND HELP THEM TO LEARN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this toy","review":"My son is 9 months old he loves the flashing colors and the music that this toy has.

Another Vtech toy purchased for my son has the exact same issue.I would have pursued warranty coverage or something of that nature but I would rather just throw it away. I don't see any educational value to it because the button effects are too random (in my opinion). Too much talking for a toy meant for a baby. The playschool tree that you stick a ball inside gets more attention from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has potential, but stops working","review":"My one year old loved this at first.

The flashing lights on the screen attract him, but they don't strike me as very educational. I don't mind, though. One thing I would change is that my son loves to open and shut the computer. He can shut it easily (and has never hurt his little fingers, as another reviewer said), but he cannot get it open easily.

Within a month of opening each of them, and sometimes within hours, they start to freeze, stutter, often reboot, or get stuck in loops.

Every time my daughter looks away from the toy for a few seconds, I hear this. It gets very old, very fast.Besides that, I see absolutely no educational value in this device or any of Vtech's toys.

It wastes most of its pages repeating what is in the Civ II user's manual and the game's Civilopedia.The book \\"Sid Meier's Civilization II Strategy Guide\\" is the one you'd really want.This book does not give new strategy, and it's discussions of units, advances, etc. are quite disorganized and hard (for a logical mind) to follow.I have personally read every single known Civ II book, and most of the hundreds of Internet guides and posts... so unless you'd just like to waste your money on some fire-starting paper (or make Mr. Rich RICHER ;-), don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different Junior?","review":"Okay....I love Junior. He is a true talent. But this CD does not engage me at all. At Twilo I am always amazed by the sophistication of his rythyms & vocals, and his ability to tease you but also deliver the goods. This CD just sounds to me like a bunch of \\"hyper\\" songs mixed without the Junior flare and punch (is someone going to shoot me for this?). Of course, maybe after another month of listening to it I'll appreciate it.Still love the Future Sound of NY. Thats a CD I can pick years after the release and say \\"Wow, there is genius in this!\\" And did I hear a Junior mix of Thriller at a club recently? If that was your mix Junior -- incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, I regret anticipating it's release","review":"If you have his previous mix cds, you will be disappointed with this release. I have been to all the venues Junior has ever played, and can say that this cd does not compare to his 'live' mixing abilitites. Sure there are great songs, but the mix is far from seamless. A previous reviewer stated that this is the closest to hearing him live, they are wrong. I expected a lot more from this release. If you like great and semi-current house music, this is for you. But if you want a true depiction of his mixing skills, pick up Junior Vasquez Live Vol. 1 & 2. Better yet, I was impressed with 'Scott Henry presents Buzz,' this sounds more like Junior, even though it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"Just as Twilo is like no other place on earth, Junior Vasquez is like no other DJ on earth. I have been on many of his many musical journeys at the legendary Twilo, and this CD has captured a piece of his magic. This two CD set combines a variety of dance styles that are seamlessly blended together with transistions that are smoother than a baby's bottom. Combine this CD with an amazing sound system, lights, and a Cryogenefex cold air blaster, and you will almost feel like you are on the Twilo dance floor. Is that Junior I see in the DJ booth, dancing around under his own disco mirror ball? See Junior Spin. Spin Junior spin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junior Misses Boat--Without Club/Drugs, He Ain't All That","review":"Being at a great NYC nightclub can be a blast, but listening to Junior's CD at home isn't.

If you want to compare this cd as actually being at twilo and hearing junior spin...DON'T. I expected a little more of a twilo experience to be on this cd. If you're looking for a cd with all vocals and weak beats..then this is your choice. But if your looking for deep house and trance.. look elsewhere. The first two song on the first cd make it seem that this is a good cd, but unofortunately, it goes all downhill from there. And the second cd.....ugh.

I had never heard Junior Vasquez before, but I had heard from others that he was a talented DJ of progressive trance. I don't care what anyone says, you are only as good as the music you select, even if you mix like a ninja. Almost every song I have listened to defines cheese.

I was disappointed that it wasn't set in Minnesota (I'm from Minnesota...ya sure you betcha!) and missed all the interesting facts about St.Paul, Minneapolis, and other Minnesota cities. However, I really liked the plot, which has Watson doing some detecting work (or trying to) in the absence of Holmes. I liked that there was a tangled web of deceit and that the reader was kept guessing who the true mastermind behind the crime was and why they had it in for Holmes. I hope that Millett keeps writing Holmes mysteries because I'd love to read one involving Professor Moriarty. Millett has done for me what I think he hoped his books would do, he has made me want to read the original series by Arthur Conan Doyle.

Chapters of this book were serialized in magazines, and they read more like the cliffhangers of old Saturday matinee serials than they do an actual story. Chapter after chapter spills out in a directionless mess and one is left to wonder when the next moment of action will occur. When it does, it's a contrived letdown of sci-fi cliches. Carr may have constructed intricate settings and fully realized characters in earlier works, but that's nowhere to be found in \\"Killing Time\\". Here, he uses a high-concept approach but has nothing but empty ideas to back it up. A waste of everyone's \\"time\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly Named","review":"Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg of you, please don't read this book. It reminds me of a sophomore Writing Studio project.

There is a nugget of a concept for an essay on our dependence on information and the importance of peer review, but the book went on and on. The ending, oh my, how frustrating! I have to agree with my fellow reviewers here, it's probably better to stop the chapter before the last, at least it would leave you thinking as opposed to needing a cranial jump start.Okay, that was emotional, but here's the facts: Character development, in particular protagonist was very weak and shallow. Plot was very strange, disjointed, and ragged. Writing style was at times confusing and, well, poor.If it's supposed to be sci-fi- it's lacking. Alt history- shallow on cause/effect. Drama- slow.

I have come to expect much more from Carr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, the idea was interesting","review":"Well, I'll start by saying that I do think that Caleb Carr is a very talented writer, HOWEVER, this book is an amateur effort, at best. Every chapter ends with heavy handed foreshadowing, and a cliff hanger which seems to be thrown in to keep you from putting the book down in disgust. The characters are very one-dimensional, especially the main character, and the book almost feels like a Luddite rant. Up until the end, technology is described as a purely destructive force, but then it is used to solve all the worlds ills in a Deus ex machina-like resolution, which to me felt like Star Trek's universal translator. To sum things up, while I do think that Caleb Carr writes very good historical thrillers, science fiction fables are not his forte. I would suggest picking up any James Morrow book instead of reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you sure Caleb Carr wrote this?!","review":"Ever since I read The Alienist, I have touted the brilliance of Mr. Carr.

The plot is contrived and illogical, and the characters are shallow to the point of cartoonish. Even the science, what there is of it in the book, is bad. The hand held \\"rail gun\\" that purportedly delivered enough energy to disintegrate a human body into small pieces would have enough recoil to kill the user. In the chase of the fanatic terrorist the group had ample opportunities to eliminate him but the author contrived illogical reasons why they could not do so in order to keep the chase going. I just wish the rating system allowed for zero stars. This book earned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!","review":"If you've read Carr's earlier books, and had filed him away among those reasonably competent authors with some promise of future improvement, now is the time to strike him off your list. Killing Time isn't just a bad book, it displays levels of incompetence that would have been laughed out of a junior college freshman writing seminar. It also puts his other work in a new context. The only conclusion is that Carr's numerous editors made the cynical decision to milk this cash cow down to the last drop. Don't waste your money, this bucket is empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carr Crash","review":"I expected Alienist II but got Plan Nine From Outer Space....

It simply is impossible that it was written by the author of The Alienest, one of the most engrossing pieces of historical fiction ever written. In this \\"book\\", the writing, the \\"message\\" and the premise are just absurd. Miss this book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic and Plodding","review":"I couldn't put \\"The Alienist\\" down; I liked \\"Angel of Darkness,\\" though it moved slower--we knew who the killer was all along. But this?\\"Killing Time\\" is aptly titled. I felt I was killing time every attempt I made to read it. Half way through, I returned it to the library. Although I appreciated, even endorsed, Carr's concept of knowledge versus facts, I felt I was swallowing a pedantic sermonette from a bloated short story. The writing rarely moved me with the evocative narrative of his first books; in fact, I found certain details--or lack thereof--distracting.Carr is a gifted writer, particularly when he allows his characters to drive the story. In his previous books, I walked away with strong ideas that he had communicated through a genuine story. Here, his characters are props for a concept. An interesting concept, yes. The framework for cardboard characters, no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I Ever Finished!","review":"From the unexplained suspension in the protagonist's common sense to the world-renowned scientists performance of feats of strength and agility to the predictable bedding of the \\"beautiful sister of the mastermind\\" by the hero (or visa versa), this book is full of things that make you say - \\"this book is missing some pages.\\"For some reason, I kept reading...maybe it's the vague resemblance of the insane yet brilliant brother-sister combo to the villains of the old TV show Wiseguy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Wait","review":"A few months ago I was excited to read that Caleb Carr was coming out with a new book. I loved both the Alienist and Angel of Darkness and couldn't wait to read his newest.It was such a disappointment. While the concept was interesting, the characters and plotlines were unable to hold my attention. I am hopeful that Carr will read some of these reviews and start a new book of the genre that gave him a legion of fans. If you loved the Alienist and Angel of Darkness don't get this book expecting it to be the same because you will probably be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was a book that I really wanted to like, which made it all the more upsetting when I didn't. Caleb Carr is an extremely talented writer, and he makes great use of every word. His prose is compact, but not overly brief.That said, great writing can't salvage a poorly plotted story. \\"Killing Time\\", although set in a believable future, requires the reader to make constant leaps of faith about technology and the ability of private citizens to obtain it. Also, Carr finds no redeeming value in any of the wonderful inventions he creates, which, aside from being depressing, is completely unrealistic. This view of technology, which has no broad basis in historical fact, tends to drag the book down.Furthermore, the plot is rushed in many places, while dragging in others. One is never drawn into the flow of this book, which is a shame considering the strong writing and premise this book has as it's foundation."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Embarrassment","review":"Worst book I've read in years. The plot is rank-amateur science fiction, introducing tired concepts like time-travel breathlessly. Except for the quirky scientist who befriends the protaganist, there is virtually no character development nor motivation. We are to believe a beautiful female scientist falls in love with our hero \\"after seeing your picture...\\". An hour after finishing the book, I was left with no lasting images of anyone.The prose is laughably clunky. If only I had a dollar for everytime someone was \\"stunned\\" or \\"amazed\\", often on the same page. Chapters end in single-sentence cliffhangers reminiscent of the Hardy Boys.Simply put, it is a lazy effort. With so much worthy writing hungering to be published, that's almost criminal. If you're eager for an excellent historical novel, try \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" by Iain Pears. I just finished it, and loved it. Sadly, it also demonstrated clearly how bad \\"Killing Time\\" really was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killing Time","review":"Didn't even come close to his other two books.

Unfortunately, that's about all it offers. It shouldn't have been like that. The premise of this novel, that information is not knowledge and the Internet is a lousy place to go if you are looking for the truth, is marvelously rich with possibility. But that premise is sacrificed almost immediately to the trite, predictible workings of a sci-fi pot boiler. I've seen Flash Gordon episodes with better drawn characters, and Marvel comics (from which genre Carr seems to have borrowed profusely) with more believable story lines. Having read The Alienist, I know that Carr can do much better. I hope that next time he takes more care for the quality of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could dung beetles find redemption in this?","review":"I loved his first two books and had hope for this one; the premise was intriguing.But this book is really more Dan Brown than Dan Brown, melded with an incomprehensible plot seemingly ripped from 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea melded with a collapsing modern society.I particularly enjoyed how a man is able to buy plutonium from a jungle warlord and somehow cast and machine that -- in the air -- while trying to evade several air forces.But the best incongruity comes when a civilian parachutes out, gets a broken leg, and ultimately blasts away veteran guerrillas surrounding him with a stun gun. Two pages later, because it fit the author's needs, we find out that he actually shot them not with the stun gun but fatally, and with his portable rail gun, which is made from no metallic parts, but another set of guerrillas who were watching him didn't realize what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending and Unoriginal","review":"I feel very fortunate to have borrowed this book from the library vice buying a copy. Reading this book wasted my time. The central idea, that an information society has special vulnerability to propaganda and manipulation by elites, strikes me as counter-factual and condescending. As sermon, this book failed to convince me.As an adventure story, it failed to convince me. The idea of a secret elite with a high-technology airship manipulating the fate of the world's population lacks originality. (See Verne's Robur the Conqueror at Project Gutenberg.)The book's ending relies on deus ex machina, and one that lies off-stage. It failed to convince me. In fact, the author relies on the very same mechanism for the ending that he condemns throughout the rest of the book: manipulation by an elite.I can say only one positive thing about this book.

You got to be kidding, man. Who in their right mind would 'assign' somebody a novel? I blame the publishers for fumbling the ball on this one. The idea was great, but the follow-through was horrific.The publishers, if they had any guts, should have fired the writer and hired someone with real talent and imagination and story-telling ability.

I cannot imagine it being of interest to anyone other than ten (okay, eight) year old boys. It has the characters and plotline of a shuffled deck of Pokemon(r) cards and clunky prose to boot. It is a serious, fatal mistake to make your narrator a pompous professorial type and then keep illustrating his pomposity ad nauseam. I literally could not finish it and really would like my money back. Carr's previous books were of an uneven quality but this is a surprisingly bad development.

I was wrong. The book is enticing enough with promise to keep one paging forward but it really never delivers. Nothing in it is new though it struggles to remain game and enticing with a real plethora of fake foreshadowing and come ons. I am only 3/4 of the way through and, though I intend to gut it on out, I will be extremely surprised if the end is any different from what I have already guessed it will be. If anything, this demeans the genre and I would respectfully ask Caleb to return to what he does best and leave the hallowed halls of Heinlein, Asimov, Pohl, Cherryh and the immortal Phillip K Dick undisturbed in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read.","review":"Only one book in each person's life can be the worst book one has ever read.

I couldn't help but think as I read the story that perhaps this would have made a better short story in an anthology collection.While I thought the 'Twilight Zone' premise of the story was kind of intriguing, I am kind of disappointed.I'm not saying not to read it, it is not entirely bad, but it is not what Ive come to expect from Caleb Carr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carr hits brick wall--head-on","review":"Stopped at page 153 couldn't bare any more embarrasement for the author...read his first two books and thought I was on to another great writer...what a total disappointment, wouldnt send this crap to an enemy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly...","review":"...the worst book of all-time.

It's not quite campy enough to be fun, not smart enough to be satirical (see Matt Ruff's \\"Sewer, Gas and Electric\\" for a true satire on the information age), and lacking the logic and detail to be a genuinely thoughtful book.Examples of poor plotting and even worse character development abound. However, I found one bit of bad writing that may be the most telling: In historian/author Caleb Carr's novel, who does the knockout babe fall madly in love with? The main character, who just happens to be a...historian/author!I had a lot of trouble finishing this book (though it's apparent that Carr had a lot of trouble finishing it as well).

It came as a big shock then to be so totally disappointed by the shallowness of Killing Time. I found the plot to be incredible superficial with little in the story to pull the reader along. Rather than turning the pages to discover what was going to happen next, I found myself turning the page hoping against hope that there was some great twist that would leave me shaking my head impressed once again by the author's originality. The characters were not as well developed as the Alienist, there was nothing there to make me think. In particular I was put off by the pseudo intellectual posturing that was woven throughout the book. I still havent figured out why the main character was even in the story.

Definitely not to my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not stomach it","review":"Yes, I kept an open mind DESPITE the fact that Carr's old New York setting was half the reason I loved his other novels so much. Killing Time sounded intriguing, and the first chapter swept me in, but soon into the book I felt like I was being lectured, scolded, tortured, and labotomized. I cannot get over how preachy this book is. Preachy, over the top in the sci-fi area, and in more than one place so violent that I had trouble getting terrible images out of my head.I certainly hope that this truly is a novel, and Caleb Carr has an ounce of hope for the human race -- enough for him to think we're worth reading another of his GOOD books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Like other recent reviewers, I'd read Carr's other books and enjoyed them, but this one was simply too off-the-wall and unbelievable to be enjoyable.

I have since told my friend not to bother and promised to buy another book as a gift right away!I could go on and on with specifics. But feel most of my complaints were well captured by the reviews already written above. I will just add one comment regarding the characters: none of the characters were developed, other than emulating the good/evil of classic cartoon-like characters. I often found myself bursting out loud with laughter at the hokey-ness of the story.I listened to an audiobook version (as I am trapped in the car 2 hours per day in my commute).

This book was just plain bad. It was a Jules Verne/H.G. Wells wanna-be and it was a gigantic disappointment after The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness. The characters were one dimensional and the dialogue was forced and silly. It felt like it wanted to be a Michael Crichton style techie-book but Carr just didn't seem to have the talent to get to the meat of the story. I plowed my way through it because I liked his other books and I suffer from that guilty feeling when I don't give an author a chance...but I should've quit reading when I started to realize it was lame...after two chapters.

It had a very predictable and shallow progression. And if I read the words \\"like so much\\" again in that book, I was going to scream! (You know what I mean if you read this book!). To me, Caleb was trying too hard to illustrate that this book took place in the future. Too many cheesy references to events of the last twenty years.

I can sum up my review very quickly-this is a poorly written Sci-Fi novel with shallow characters I cared nothing about. The premise that \\"Information is not Knowledge\\" (the first chapter was the best writing in the novel) is proven true by Carr himself.

In fact, he appears to support the histrionic viewpoints of the hate-America crowd lead by Professor Chomsky. He doesn't take long to tell us of the polution of the oceans, the evil of the America-Chinese economic ties. A key tale deals with the sacrifice of American servicemen in a \\"war\\" to gain Chinese hegemony over Taiwan.When one considers all of the failings of this book, we must wonder if Mr. Carr intended to write a political fable for our times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killing Time...Waste of Time","review":"\\"Killing Time\\" lacks all of the things that one has come to expect of Caleb Carr...a good story with incredible attention to detail, characterization and motivation.

Was he included in the program simply because he was attractive to the genetically altered and physically perfect female on the team?

At one point I had to ask myself what the heck was happening, because it had seemed so long since anything actually HAD happened. While the message the book it trying to convey is important, the message gets lost amid the confusing story, bland characters, and questionable science.For a similar style of book, but much better written, check out NATURE'S END, by Whitley Strieber and James Kunetka, if you can find it.

BIG MISTAKE. I am a science fiction fan as well as a mystery fan, and Killing Time is a waste of time in either genre. The characters are so shallow that even cartoons do better. Carr's idea of character differentiation is to make one character call everything (machines, food, ideas) 'sexy' while another is constantly putting the make on every male she meets.

Instead of this story, I found myself wishing I was reading the physological history of the USA referred to in the novel instead! The worst flaw, though, was the ending.

It also is a good at helping the reader question what they view in the media and how easy it could be to pass on non factual data to be accepted in the mass population as fact.The protagonist was too informed, too all knowing as a psychologist who has to question morality as well as choices of the other characters.The ending was disappointing as so many are with the 'fell swoop' to tie up all loose ends, and not satisfying in that way when you are told it is all just a dream, an alternate reality.Still this book does linger and I hope the author continues to improve on this alternative future genre. A tighter editing could have helped the ending perhaps or encouraged more questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Caleb Carr?","review":"Killing Time, by Caleb Carr is mind-numbingly bad. (Doc Savage rides again?) Zero stars would be more appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad Max written with crayons","review":"As a fan of the Alienist and Mr. Carr's intelligent though often-dark perceptions and literary style, I was eager to read this latest book. I'd rate my enjoyment of it just below getting a root canal with gardening tools. The premise was plausible and the introduction intriguing. But it was stretched to cartoonish proportions. The characters and their development were paper thin and amateurish. Reading it was like watching a Buck Rodgers movie in black and white with the props assembled from odds and ends found in the attic with a soundtrack of dramatic piano music borrowed from an early silent film. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I don't usually disklike a book so much that I can't finish it, but with Killing Time I had to put it down after just a few sittings. I have read the Alienst and Angel of Darkness and thoroughly enjoyed them both - so I was very excited to see this new book by Carr. It was awful. The story was so outlandish and the characters so completely unbelievable; it reminded me of a serious Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy. Also, the way his characters spoke and thought gave me more of a sense of the past than the future, yet the environment and events in the book were so far-fetched I could not believe that they were only 20 years ahead of us. Caleb Carr should stick to what he does best, and this is most certainly not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried, I really tried....","review":"A group of people are thrown together under extraordinary circumstances to accomplish a common goal. OK, familiar so far. This reader felt lost after that point. This group is sick of big business and government controlling information and the media - conspiring to manipulate the thoughts and actions of the populace by any means necessary. In retaliation; the good guys start to control information, the media, and pull stunts to manipulate the thoughts and actions of the populace. Can't we all just please get along? Heavy on Trekkian political rhetoric, this novel never really went anywhere. I really enjoyed the \\"Alienist\\" and hope that Dr. Kreizler has some shoe leather left."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could this be?","review":"While reading this insipid, uneventful, and (thank goodness for somethings), brief exercise in comic book-like drivel, I kept checking the jacket of the book cover to truly discover who might have authored this waste-of-time book. Certainly it couldn't have been the Caleb Carr who so deftly brought 19th Century New York and the dark themes it embraced to life in his previous two novels. I'm still shocked at the insignificance of his words in this one. Caleb, how could you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carr is a GREAT writer, but this book doesn't measure up","review":"I agree with the assessment of many others in this review space -- this book is unrelentingly \\"O.K.\\" I write primarily to those of you who've not read Carr's other books. It's a mistake to give up on him. The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness are everything that Killing Time is not. Don't make the mistake of thinking that this book is representative of his work. You WILL miss out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Having read two of Mr Carrs' previous books and enjoyed them tremendously, I am so disappointed in this new novel. The plot was so thin as to be non-existent and the characters were two dimensional at best. I listened to the book on audio and found myself having to constantly rewind because my attention had wandered and I had missed part of the story. I wish I had missed the whole story. Please tell Mr Carr that he does not have the voice to tell his stories. His voice is monotonous. The real problem was the story and I will be reluctant to buy another Caleb Carr novel in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor read from a distinguished writer. Who really wrote this book?","review":"Having enjoyed The Alienist and Angel of Darkness, I looked forward to this Caleb Carr novel. I cannot believe that he wrote it. Based on other books, I expected well developed characters, well researched basis for the plot elements, and even some message. I was disappointed to find very flat characters poorly described and with little explanation for their motivations, a proposterous plot largely drawn from Jules Verne, and a preachy, unconvincing message. I dragged myself all the way through hoping to find SOMETHING worth the effort. I should have checked the Amazon reader reviews before buying this book. Killing Time is what I did and I want that time back along with the purchase price. I can't believe this is a Caleb Carr book. It contains nothing like his other works in tone or quality. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Fiction Disguised as Fiction","review":"Call it intellectual, philosophical, prophetic, whatever. I call it boring and opaque. I felt like I was reading someone's undergraduate assignment.I chose to read this book because I heard Carr was a great writer. I assume this is true for his other books, but this book is just beyond boring. It is less of a story and more of a string of worst case scenarios for Carr's predictions for the future.Sure, it may be a commentary on today's problems and what will go wrong if we do not straighten up, but I really did not care as I was reading it. He just did not connect with me as a reader. Frankly, I'd rather read a non-fiction social commentary than an essay pretending to be fiction.Skip it. Read his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be","review":"How disappointing! I've been watching for another book by Carr, but not one like this. It's hard to believe he's the same author who wrote Alienist and Angel. I read half the book (only because I was stuck in an airport) and found both the characters and writing style to be extremely superficial. No way I could get interested. (I hardly put either of his first two books down.) Decided to skip to the end for the surprise--which was as disappointing as the rest of the book. Please tell me this wasn't really Caleb Carr's doing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Just a terrible novel. I got about halfway through and just gave up. Poor writing style.
