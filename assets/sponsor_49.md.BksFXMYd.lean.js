I have a green one, but they are available in red, blue, and multicolors as well. It's a well made American product---which makes this disc an easy choice over the competition---that flies straight and does not hurt to catch (at least with the hand).After a few missed catches, a few collisions with trees, and landing in the road, the Flashfligh never blinked. It seems sturdy, unlike some other light-up discs that didn't last through a weekend.The LED makes it easy to spot without being distracting, so catching the disc is easy and finding it, not a matter to be taken lightly during a late evening endeavor, is effortless (as long as the light is turned on)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"The good reviews are for the old twist-switch design. The new push-button switch is terrible. This new switch doesn't work. The disc wont stay on, and after a few weeks of use, the disc will crack around the new button.

One word of caution though, before you start flinging these to each other in the dark, make sure you clear the area of shin bone level obstructions because hitting something like a laid down bicycle in the dark at a full run is no fun.Its surprisingly bright at night and you'll have no trouble tracking it in flight.As far as durability goes, ours probably has over 30 hours of use and has seen impacts with asphalt, concrete, the side of the house, cars, and trees... its been left out in the weather, and has even been a victim of our german shepherd and it still works great.

This key Confederate not only was a brilliant strategist, but, after fleeing the Confederate States of America, left for England, where he wrote \\"Benjamin on Contracts\\"...the CURRENT text on Contract Law taught in every law school today ! The importance of this book is that Mr. Benjamin was extremely thorough to destroy every Confederate document which bore his name and position as Secretary of State of the Confederacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good biography, but....","review":"Evans certainly deserves an A+ for the biography. Benjamin was a fascinating person, and the biography is well written. It also tells the little known story of the diplomatic history of Confederacy; usually, history books focus only on the military campaigns and theaters of action.However, of the first six chapters of the book, only two are about Benjamin; the other four are about the early life of Jefferson Davis, later President of the Confederacy. It's very strange; no information about Benjamin is given in those chapters besides for a few paragraphs here and there comparing the background and upbringing of the two statesmen. It really is quite odd; there is no apparent reason for it. Is Evans just trying to fill up space?Otherwise, it is a very good biography. Indeed, Benjamin's career, or perhaps I should say many careers, is a fascination. If you're looking for a good book, a not-so-well known person and an outstanding career, you've found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobble mania!","review":"These mics sounds great, but they're unusable with the supplied rim mount.

And the tag lines on the front. Which all were the most amusing and interesting reads of this book. Probably because they weren't written by the author. I should have left well enough alone and left the book on the bookshelf where it certainly belongs. If this still doesn't convince you, go to the end of the book and read the author's bio, which he wrote himself. If you find it funny and hilarious, then this book's for you.

It describes rabbit habits and habitats, and is full of entertaining hunt stories. My main complaint about the book is the amount of space it gives to discussing hunting with beagles. 6 of the 22 chapters are exclusively about beagles: selecting, training, breeding and caring for beagles. Those who do not hunt with dogs will not find much use for all this information. Also, it would have been very helpful if the author had included in the book a listing of cottontail hunting availability state-by-state [...] But in general, this is a great book and I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alot of hunting stories and Guidance of training Beagles","review":"The title is very misleading.

The songs \\"Keith\\" and \\"Sandy Denny\\" appear to be musical biographies of people with problems. While I like this acoustic folk genre, neither Olson's voice nor his songwriting connect with me in much the same way that I've shelved all the Jayhawks CDs after a couple of listenings. \\"My Salvation Blues\\" sounds like nervous music for nervous people.

However, if you are not a Southern Baptist, you probably will not enjoy this book. I was hoping this book would be an aid for leaders across a broad spectrum of evangelical churches to assess their health and take practical steps in this area. Instead, about a third of the book is merely a defense of Southern Baptist theology. If your theology is not firmly rooted in Calvinism, then, according to this author, your church will not be very healthy. Some of the other chapters were pretty good on issues such as church membership, but because a third of the book centers on Southern Baptist theology as crucial for a healthy church, it makes the other chapters seem less credible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended to all Christians","review":"Nine Marks of a Healthy Church by Mark Dever, is an excellent book about the church today.

It is a great read for those who don't just want to complain about the state of the church today, but who actually want some biblical, positive direction.The first chapter on expositional preaching is especially helpful because he provides a biblical foundation to the idea that the preaching the Word is the most fundamental duty of the church pastor. His chapters on membership and leadership are also great because he marshals a biblical argument for having high expectations of members and for elders as a biblical office, respectively.More than anything, after reading Nine Marks of a Healthy Church, I walked away understanding that God has given a lot more direction regarding the day to day operations of His church than I thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nine Marks of a Healthy Church","review":"The writing style of the author is simple and straight forward making this book an easy read. In a day when many people are searching for strong churches based solely on the Word of God, this book provides guidelines to help in that search. This book also provides a basis of examining where the church is that you are serving in presently in comparison to the Word of God. The purpose of the church is explained through the use of the Scriptures. When one sees the purpose of the church then you can clearly recognize churches that are on track in fulfilling their role in the lives of believers. In addition, we then see what we are to be focussing on as individual believers.I would encourage every believer in the Lord Jesus Christ to read this book as it will challenge you in your walk with the Lord in light of His Word."},{"rating":"1","title":"You may want to borrow it before you buy...","review":"This is a prescriptive work aimed at helping church leaders focus on the right things. As with any prescriptive work, how helpful the book is depends on where YOU are coming from. If you are coming from the same place as the author (white suburban/rural America) then I think this is a helpful book with important insights!If you come from an Urban area or a very multiethnic/multicultural city, then you should probably read critically, and with extra care. The author's use of the word \\"culture\\" is broad and, in some senses, a bit uninformed.The chapters are a series of topical sermons (even the chapter on the importance of expositional sermons!). This is a format I don't particularly care for (unless the author is someone like D.M. Lloyd-Jones).Toward the end of the book it becomes clear that what the author is advocating is not so much the antithesis to church growth theology, but more of a wholistic model for church growth (ala Orlando Costas)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again","review":"These were the only wipes within reachable distance when changing the baby today. Immediately upon opening, my eyes filled with tears and I started uncontrollably sneezing. After quickly changing him and putting him on his play mat, I raided the house for an antihistamine. If you have allergies, this will 100% trigger them.I will give the product one star because it served it's function of wiping a child but I would rather use my own shirt then have to force any baby to smell that, let alone smell LIKE that. It's not at all natural, unless you consider smelling like you've walked into a discounted fragrance market, \\"natural.\\" They are soft and strong but I can not possibly feel comfortable using them as long as they are scented this way.There did not seem to be any adverse reaction on his part but I am sure that a child with allergies or more sensitive skin would not respond well to these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wipes","review":"These wipes are very soft and my son loves the smell (so do we)No other brand comes close to the softness or the thoughness.

These wipes are the softest and softer than the Kirkland wipes. My husband couldn't use the pamper wipes since they would cause sever redness on my 1st born's butt area. It was raw.

This book offers some very nice pictures of Buddy and his fellow musicians and is a very readable biography. It also includes a very emotional section on his close friend, the late Stevie Ray Vaughan. One interesting aspect is that in some video interviews I've seen, some of the anecdotes change somewhat, but the stories are fascinating, nonetheless. A great musician and classy man, who has kept his class through some very rough times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes great in iced drinks","review":"I bought the NuNaturals White Stevia with Maltodextrin several months ago as I'm trying to cut back on sugar and artificial sweeteners. The first morning I tried it in my coffee and hated it. It tastes just as bitter as Equal or Sweet n Low. I decided to give it another try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious. I've also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea. So, I think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia. All in all I'm glad I bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go. I have tried many different brands of stevia but, so far this is the only one I have not thrown out. I also tried Truvia. Not a fan. It makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Healthy Live Better and Longer","review":"Cutting sugar out of our diet,we went to splenda. Then finding that it was also unhealthy and baking with it made foods flat and dry. We went to stevia no calorie powder, after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects. The trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste. I also found that using a stevia that has an 80% ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that I have found. Because of using VERY SMALL amounts this jar lasts for months. This is also the best price ANYWHERE! Swanson is a trusted vendor as is Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stuff- So much I ordered again","review":"This stevia is perfect.

Not Nustevia! Nustevia has absolutely NO bitterness, and tastes EXACTLY like real sugar! It's amazing! Add it to plain yogurt, you have an amazing guilt-free dessert, breakfast, side dish, snack. Add it to tea, coffee, recipes, anything! It is a truly magical product, and it is cheaper in the 12 oz container on Amazon than anywhere else! They also sell it at GNC, but it is $10 for 4 oz. Also, for drinks, I highly recommend the extremely potent liquid stevia, as sometimes the powdered version takes a while to dissolve in iced beverages (it eventually does dissolve, though)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy","review":"Looks great with other stainless steel appliances against our black granite counter tops.

This was the only one that didn't. And now I know why. This breadbox is WONDERFUL.It's very well-constructed, and feels solid. The roll-top mechanism is smooth and lovely. It's also roomy enough to hold two loaves of bread, a package of flatbread, a medium bag of pretzels and a medium bag of chips, but it's counter profile is small. Best of all, it actually keeps the bread fresh!!!! I leave everything in its original packaging (read other reviews where people expect bread to stay fresh outside the bag), so your mileage may vary.In short, I love this breadbox. Worth every penny, especially since unlike roughly 30% of people who bought other brands, I have zero complaints and didn't need to send it back for a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Spacious but Does it really keep bread fresh longer?","review":"The bread box (it is made by Brabantia) is as spacious and elegant as other reviews describe it. It matches perfectly our kitchen appliances (the color is subdued silver, not glossy). We bought it because of high reviews. I expected it to have special qualities and keep bread frech longer. it cost around $50. The price did not matter to me, i just wanted to do without plastic bags when handling bread at home. Alas, my french baquettes got almost as stale in the bread box as without it in a day or two. In other words, i still have to use plastic bags to keep bread from getting stale in the bread box. From this perspective, the bread box is a disappointment.I give it four stars because it is an elegant and nice looking disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avg breadbox","review":"Metal was flimsy, was broken when I received it in the mail.

When this dialect is used in the spanish version the names of the giants are difficult to pronounce. I began reading it to my bilingual third graders aloud in english and then switched to spanish thinking that it would be easier for them to understand and relate to. This wasn't the case. The spanish version is probably a better read for children 10 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pennmanship","review":"Like Jimmy Webb, Dan Penn will never get the credit he deserves. But unlike Webb, Penn's are the best interpretations of his own songs. This is in part because he sings like David Hidalgo. But unfortunately R&B; writers of his era were confined to Tin Pan Alley songsmithing--even after rock went through its singer-songwriter era, when writing and performing merged. If not for this, Penn might have been the soul version of Dylan. Rather than feel bad for him, think how tough it must have been for the singer listening to his demos with an ear toward re-recording them. Final versions are canned and dispassionate compared to Penn's.This live album is played on two instruments, so it's mellow. For more fleshed-out versions, buy \\"Do Right Man.\\" Both are great--especially for dinner parties and good-vibe evenings at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gifted","review":"I found the author of this book gifted and talented.Her words certainly \\"hit home\\".

I think it's important for people to realize this book's intended audience--IT managers, DBAs, business people. It's not for people who want to learn XML. The book covers how XML can work in a corporate environment. For example, it talks about different XML tools in the software market and how XML is approached from different programming languages. Very topical.I recommend this book if you *aren't* interested in learning XML outright but instead want to figure out what it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting outdated, but offered what it promised","review":"I bought this book based on reading this summary: \\"Going with XML in an enterprise is an important decision that requires IT professionals to carefully weigh the pros and cons.

The book includes a quick primer to XML, as well as coverage of all of the popular parsers, authoring tools, and programming interfaces available. The book also offers several glimpses into how XML can be implemented in the real world and leaves it up to the readers to decipher whether the techniques are appropriate for their needs.\\" I felt it delivered on this promise 100%.

The author does not clearly explain XML. I was looking for a book that I could pass off to my staff to help bring them up to speed, and unfortunately this is not it. The author boldly states that the majority of his XML experience is through using Microsoft's XML parser, and the bulk of his examples are Microsoft centric, with a lot of example code in VBScript. His book touches on numerous ways in which other vendors have utilized XML, but does not focus on solid examples of how XML can be used in enterprise applications.

Didn't want to be stressed out after paying 2000$ for a laptop. Would prefer a high end viao instead for 65% of the price.

In their particular take on \\"third wave\\" ska, Mustard Plug fused the up-tempo ska beat and horns with a full throttle, high energy, punk sensibility. This is very infectious, feel good music that is likely to bring a smile to your face and make you want to get up and dance--or at least bounce up and down in your chair and tap your foot. Don't look for a lot of meaning in the lyrics on this CD, however, as the songs generally are very silly and superficial, which underscores their purpose, which is to provide some good natured fun in a high octane, ska influenced package. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really quite bad","review":"I bought this cd after listening to \\"Pray for Mojo,\\" one of the better ska cd's I own. I remember reading in the lyric sheet of \\"Pray for Mojo\\" one of the members thanking the fans who have stuck by them even when they played 'real bad ska.' Well, apparently this was still at a point in their career when they played real bad ska. Unlike \\"Pray for Mojo\\" which is filled with awesome hooks and harmonies, this album is full of mediocre songs with real bad singing. The singer definitely hadn't found his voice yet, and really sounds like he is joking around, which to a certain extent, he is. This is definitely before Mustard Plug became a good ska band. I would not recommend this cd to anybody except for truly die hard \\"terrible ska\\" fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"there are better books","review":"Except for the discussion of sensory details, this book is too vague to be useful for beginning writers.

Coltrane, I thinnk, sometimes erred on the side of too much improvisation to the loss of respect for a song's melody. Not the case here.

The quality IS top notch and it does NOT need remastering. If it sounds a little \\"stodgy\\" it's only because of the recording practices of the day, which happened in very dry studios. This is pre-Star Wars. It also helps to be familiar with the movie and the story. The dry sound actually enhances the reality of the plot.I WOULD like to see Bernstein do a new recording, with a top notch symphony orchestra playing in a large hall, like he recently did with \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", but as far as this original sound track is concerned, this is the same as the original Lp, perhaps even cleaner.

Bernstein's score with help from Shorty Rodgers hits the mid-50's with a rocket, and is an accurate representation of the music of that time (jazz that is). Some of the music even borrows from rock 'n roll in places (or is it the other way around!!).The transfer to CD is o.k., could have been better in my opinion, but I must assume it was not recorded/mastered all that well in the beginning. I have the record from a mid-1980's reissue, and the quality is about the same, only louder.

Indeed, the last page in the book contains two concluding allusions to a poem by Ezra Pound. I suppose Ms. Smart either hoped nobody would notice them; or, if they did, to consider her ever so clever for conjoining her work with Mr. Pound's. -Either way, one doesn't get the feel that one is reading anything moving or original here.In lieu of this derivative and misguided work, I would recommend the masterwork of a novella that Ms. Smart is obviously trying to emulate-Nightwood by Djuna Barnes.

Well it is now two years later and it still bores me to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DUMBEST book, I have ever read! :(","review":"This book was an impulse buy- 1 of 4 that day.I was in Borders book store on the hunt for my favorite genre: Vampires.I grabbed it because of it's unique title & have been regretting the purchase ever since.As a person who reads about 45 books a year- mostly Sci-Fi, I have never met a book that I couldn't get through but this book makes me want to set it ablaze! The pointlessness of it all!!! :(No more impulse buys for me!Save yourself. Do not buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not much one for musicals","review":"I'm not much one for musicals, I'm a burly thick-headed working class man's man, but this CD sounds fantastic. Bought this one a whim a few months ago and now I have every Jerry Herman CD I can find, as well as most every musical Ms. Lansbury has recorded. Now I'm totally into musicals and have gotten SO into them, I think I've bought nearly 100 in the last 4 months! Thank you, Jerry Herman, for all the beautiful music. It's a refreshing change from the techo and indie music I've listened to for many years. You're my Broadway favorite! Also bought the Mame DVD and my whole household loved it. Jerry, you've given me a new way to connect with my elderly mother, as well as a new hobby. This here CD is a pivotal one in my life. I love it. Check out Herman's \\"The Grand Tour\\" too, it's awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Translate Garbage","review":"The entire line of Lingo translators are difficult to use, full of errors, and the company's support is non-existent.

Please save you money and potential frustration in learning a language or traveling abroad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an outdated pamphlet","review":"Although the basic message is clear and sound, in reality, it's a brief pamphlet that was written in the late 1990's. I regret the purchase and think the writer should update the content before selling anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mother of All Power Twisters","review":"I've been using the Sunny Power Twister for months now, and can knock out 2 sets of 75 reps no problem. Got this thing outta the box? 2 reps. TWO! That's the resistance difference here! This thing is definitely gonna be part of the heavy cycle in my routine for awhile, as pushups and benches don't do anything for me (barrel chested, so most of the stress goes onto my delts and tricpes anyways)! I've gotten excellent results from the MUCH lighter resistance Sunny brand, so I can't wait to use this one for a few months. Although one reviewer's came with foam handles, mine were hard plastic. Not sure why there's a discrepancy in that area?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for building strength in arms and shoulders","review":"I love this product. It provides a good workout for the arms and shoulders. You can use the twister by bending it for reps or as an isometric exercise. I prefer the isometric exercises, holding the twister bent while exhaling. This has provided me with gains in strength and should provide you a decent pump in your arm and chest muscles after each use.The 75cm is the toughest Power Twister I have come across. Be careful with the 65cm twister. The 65cm is considered to be medium duty and I found the 65cm twister to be too easy.I use this device along with a chest expander and kettlebell. For legs, there is an elliptical and indoor rower. I prefer using these strength training tools over the traditional free weight training regimen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spring Bar","review":"This product works very well to help build up your arms,I use it twice a day,and my arms have gottena lot stronger.Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak item","review":"I have a power twist from another company which i purchased for $10 it was stronger and cheaper.I made a complaint with this company got no response.If you want a better product go to big 5 or a Target/walmart type stores, you will get a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is gonna get you killed","review":"i have actually been thinking about this that this bar broke and hit my face, and i sued the company after,and today,just after the first couple of exercise with this new product,the handle bar fell off and because i was twisting it, the bar hit my jaw, really badmy jaw is bleeding now and two of my teeth are kinda smashedi don't know what to do now, sue them or just put it in the trashDON'T BUY IT, TOO RISKY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Started to leak after about 1/2 way through the bottle","review":"I originally had a great review in here as I was happy with the product, however about 1/2 way through the bottle the top began to leak any time I spay it.

She loves it and I do, too. She still gets compliments. I'm still buying it for her, it's one of the things that never changes for us. Funny how something so simple can end up being a kind of theme.The service and price here on Amazon were both great. No complaints. Go test it at a department store and see if it's for you.Update, Sept. 2010I guess CK decided they weren't selling enough of this, because apparently it's been discontinued. When I tried to reorder, I ended up getting the Men's version from the vendor, which I didn't want! Amazon made it good, but I ended up having to find a bottle of it elsewhere.

I thought I'd get rid of it using it as an air freshner but I really don't like it enough for that either. I would say never buy Perfume as a present unless you know for a fact that the person you're buying for likes it. Big disappointment :( I've been reading that it's been discontinued in USA. Pity it's still apparently available in UK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Escape Impostor - Fragrance Doesn't Last","review":"I've been wearing Escape for about 17 years. I live in a small city and only Elder Beerman sold it. However, they no longer carry the product but said I could get it online for half the cost. They were right. It looks like the same Escape I bought at the store (except the box color seemed a bit off on the shade) but the fragrance doesn't last at all. I used to be able to smell it all day long and even into the evening. With this stuff, I can't smell it an hour later. Consequently, I don't think this Escape is the real thing. I will be heading out of town to buy it in a store now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Fake Fake...BEWARE","review":"Ladies watch out. This is a very bad imitation of the real Escape. They are trying to pass it off as the original. I put it on as soon as I got it and I knew immediately. I don't know how this company gets away with selling this stuff and saying it is Calvin Kleins Escape, but it is wrong. I hope authorities catch on and prosecute. One year my son bought me another fragrance that I love for x-mas. He said he bought it on E-Bay. I put it on and it diddn't smell right. I ended up keeping it, but it is still sitting on my dresser and never use it, I didn't want to hurt his feelings. Now I came across this problem again. I guess I should have realized as the price was good, but this imitation is not worth it. I have an excellent sense of smell and am 100% positive I am right. I am sending this nasty fowl water right back as soon as I can. I have been fooled, but never again. I will do my research before I purchase it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Floral, not fruity","review":"I wanted to try this because it's described as a perfume with a lot of fruit notes. I tested it at the store and all I smelled was an overpowering flowery scent which just makes me nauseous. Nothing fruity about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is fake Calvin Klein!! Do not buy!","review":"This perfume only mildly smells like Calvin Klein Escape. The fragrance completely disappears after a few minutes. I've been wearing Escape (the real stuff) for years.

Once you hang them, they seem to do okay. But if you want to hang them, take them down and store them, then use again - forget it. Instead, just take them down and throw them in the trash. We used to have a set for the holidays and another set for all other seasons (6-8 each).They are made so poorly though that every time we store them (even though carefully repacked in the original boxes with all styro-foam inserts), we lose up to 75%. For instance, we just pulled out the Christmas orbs and only 1 out of 7 works. Even though they all worked when they were packed away.) These used to be pretty cheap ($7 -> $10 each) so I didn't mind taking a bit of a hit on them, but at $25 plus - someone must be smoking crack. They are so cute when they're working well, but not worth a single season at this price. Save your cash. Plenty of other ways to decorate at a fraction of the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simplistic Look at a Valuable Tool","review":"Joel Koppelman and Quentin Fleming have provided project managers with a practical and readable review of the history, purpose and use of an invaluable tool - earned value.There is nothing difficult about the concept. Its focus is the accurate measurement of physical performance against a detailed plan to accurately predict finished costs and schedule. It requires a project's scope be defined and integrated with all of the available resources. If used properly, the calculation provides an early indicator of project slippage or the scope of project cost overruns.The book would rate, in my mind, a five-star rating if the authors included practical examples or a few case studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much narrative .. needs examples","review":"This is a book that talks a lot about Earned Value in terms of history and usefulness; how it advanced since 1967 C/SCSC to today's EVM standard.To my amazement, unfortunately, this book does NOT show you how to calculate EARNED VALUE. It keeps talking about how to use it to assess progress and predict future progress but it does not show how to get it.This is a MAJOR flaw in my opinion.I finished reading the book and I am disappointed. It needs more examples. There are better books in the market on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUT DATED","review":"Why would anyone buy this edition - it's outdated.

It could have actually been a pamphlet instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needs to slow down!!","review":"This incarnation of Batgirl is bad but I'm afraid this book is. Cassandra Cain has an interesting back story but has no personality or reason to read about her other than watching her mindlessly fight. She has the slightest of supporting cast and they both serve the same purpose. Puckett is rushing Batgirl along and readers have no time to get to know her or why we should care. The art is serviceable but too cartoony for me. Overall, a book worth skipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but warm and sensitive, a classic Banks catagory","review":"In the catagory genre this is definitely a 5 star keeper. Enjoyed the playing out of this romance as much as the finale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money.","review":"I bought this game because I thought it might be like Day of the Tentacle or Sam and Max Hit the Road, which I played when I was younger. Instead, it's very unpleasant and not at all funny. The voice acting is intentionally terrible; the protagonist voice is nasal and he's very unlikable. He's supposed to be a pitiful detective that's mocked by his peers, but as I played I wanted to not only mock him but to murder him as well.The game itself is boring, but easy to play. There are no surprising twists, no creativeness, and no excitement. It's a generic game trying to be funny and failing with every attempt. Also, the music is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh..","review":"This game was a disappointment. I was told that the game had an awesome musical score (which it didn't), that the gameplay was fun(it was tedious) and that the jokes were funny (they weren't).Perhaps I expected to much after having played similar games with this type of style (ie, Day of the Tentacle, Sam and Max, etc). But this game really didn't hit the mark. I only finished it hoping it would get better, but it really didn't. The ending might possibly be the worst part.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice for the price","review":"This works well.

It is manufactured by Revel, but it is NOT a \\"1486.8\\". It is a \\"medium\\" sink protector. It is 16.25 inches long by 12.5 inches wide. Sometimes a quarter of an inch makes something not work, which was the case for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's white, not stainless steel","review":"The size of this item is perfect. Unfortunately, it's white. I guess it's plastic-coated stainless steel. Definitely not the look I was going for.

The commentaries on life and relationships that tie the three stories together are nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection!","review":"These 3 \\"mini-books\\" were great for a weekend reading session.

In biking, it cannot be read without taking your hand off the handbar and turning the inside of your wrist to face you (actually a dangerous move compared to just looking down at your wrist). In running, the face frequently brushes/rubs against your side, especially if wearing a jacket or vest with pockets or tightening tabs. In swimming, you need to drastically orient your left-hand stroke to see the face at all. This watch was designed by people who themselves don't appear to be engaged in any phase of triathalon, even casually. I'd rate it no stars if that was an option. Stay away from OVA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CHARADE Henry Mancini","review":"I did not give it any stars as I returned this article. It was written in Chinese/Japanese and I did not appreciate that.

It is a reminder that our musical worship is not limited to only an organ, nor do we have to depend on the same old hymnbook in order to praise the Lord. Cappella Romana's beautiful sound displays the richness and beauty of an ancient and hallowed tradition in language that is accessible to everyone today. I simply cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I thought the product had beautiful music, however it lacked the melodies I happen to be used to.

An inspiring pleasure to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to appreciate","review":"This album is my first venture into the Ancient Liturgical Music Ministry of the Orthodox churches. I wanted something that was representative of early Christian Music and also in English so I could understand the lyrics and hopefully join in. Although there wasn't much scope to join in however, it is refreshing to hear this type of music sung clearly by people who believe what they are singing, which is really important to me. If you have never heard Liturgical music before I would recommend that this would be the album for you as it is well done.

Since Amazon does not allow for half ratings, I put in 2, but consider this item a 2.5 star rating of average. Needless to say I purchased a bottle of HP Sauce and promptly tried it with a meal. It is sweeter and more one-note in flavor than I was expecting. It's neither catsup (sweet), nor Worchestershire (complex) nor A-1 (a bit of sweet and complex). It is somewhat sweet and vinegary, but the \\"complex\\" I was hoping for did not come through for me. For example when using Worchestershire or A1 the tongue picks up numerous levels of spice, sweet and savory that I did not get here. To be clear, HP Sauce is pretty good, but for me at least, it will not replace the aforementioned sauces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Blessed Beyond Belief is a fast paced testimony that will have you ready to get to the next page to find out how this young lady overcame.

It was an inspiration!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the type of book you never want to put down.","review":"I would reccomend this book to anyone from the ages of 12-16 because you have to be old enough to understand it. This book was very exciting especially when Jennifer suspects Meeghan is a witch. Some parts, like the discription of the plants in a witch's garden, did drag. This was a very realistic book. Everything seemed so real. Everyone who can should read this book. If you get a chance go to the library and check it out. Read this book if you like a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tween Book","review":"This is a \\"be careful what you wish for\\" story. While many of the superficial details are dated (published in 1976), the storyline is still sound and entertaining. The characters are believable for the time period in which they are written. To echo another reviewer, this is *not* a book that accurately portrays modern Wiccan or Pagan beliefs - again, it was written in the 70's when public knowledge of these beliefs was still in its infancy. It does deal well with discrimination and bigotry, however, and is still entertaining in the meantime. Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"We ordered a couple of these devices and they don't work. Let me put it another way.

I found the collar helped reduce his stress, which then enabled learning to occur through training.D.A.P is not a \\"magic bullet\\" that will instantly resolve complex behavioral problems like severe separation anxiety with no effort on the part of the owner. In my experience, D.A.P. can help the dog calm sufficiently over time to begin learning new responses or behaviors.Initially, I used one of the DAP cartridges near the dog's regular sleeping place. I then added the collar while traveling and at weekly training classes where stress was an issue - not 24x7. The collar was left quite loose so close skin contact was avoided. My particular dog did not have any reaction to the collar.The combination worked well for us when paired with active training and behavioral modification."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adaptil collar","review":"Did not notice much of a difference even after two weeks.

Some reviewers have speculated this product's ineffectiveness stems from getting it from sources other than your veterinarian. I am writing to dispute that. We tried this collar in combination with 1mg of xanax for our two-year-old Vizsla mix with separation anxiety. Neither worked. We tried two collars over two months and saw no change in our dog's behavior. He still chewed up random items in the house when we left. For $80 for the two collars, we feel cheated. For $36, we ordered a Thundershirt, which will last much much longer than a collar. Look it up on Amazon, it may be worth trying that before the DAP collar or diffuser. We haven't got it in the mail yet, but are more hopeful for that product in combination with continued behavior modification."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective","review":"I got this (and the spray) for my son's 1-year-old rescue Boxer who has severe separation anxiety. Neither product was effective with THIS dog. I know other people who got much better results and that's why I wanted to try it out. The collar is difficult to fit properly and if it doesn't have continuous, direct contact with the body, the pheromone can't be absorbed into the skin. Then try to adjust the collar ... no way! It was worth a try but certainly didn't help the situation at all. My son continues behavior modification strategies - slow, but sure - and he's making progress.

Nurturecalms pheromone percentage is 9% and the other 2 brands I reviewed were 2.5% and 6%,So for those of you that got a little change but not enough for what you were hoping, maybe try Nurture brand with the higher percentage of pheromones.Bella just got hers today so we will see what happens.

I have since removed the collar and over the course of a few days she has gone back to her \\"normal\\" anxiety level. We're still working on it. I tried the thundershirt - did not work. Tried rescue remedy - did not work. Tried calming treats, stuffed frozen kongs, and more - nothing worked. Two days ago I began to take her cycling - she trots alongside me. This seems to be tiring her out a little bit - in turn, taking some of the edge off. I have also been working to desensitize her - picking up car keys, putting shoes on, doing things to act as if I'm leaving - but then, I sit down or do some chores - I don't leave.

Just a few hours after putting it on her she calmed down. She recently broke a toe and is supposed to stay down, even on the heaviest dose of sedatives we could give her she still wouldn't stay down for very long until she started wearing this collar. She is so much more relaxed and is much easier to keep down so her toe can heal.

She would shake and pant and would want to crawl inside me if she could, now it's just a raise of the head. She's more confident on walks...it's worth a try people, it may not work for everyone, but I'm extremely thankful it worked for me and her!

Traffic cones seem to set him off too. He has a huge smile the whole time; he's not anxious, he's having a blast. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because I think this is a treatment for a problem my dog doesn't have.I'm also trying a DAP spray and a calming dog chew called Composure (both also available on Amazon) and they have had no noticeable effect either.

Read both books and be ENTERTAINED!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed with this book.","review":"I believe the story the author intended to tell was interesting; however, he did a very poor job delivering the message.First of all, the book was poorly written grammatically. The reading level for this book can not be higher than fifth or sixth grade. Unless this age group was the intended audience, I think a book written about college experiences should AT LEAST be written on a college level.Second, I believe the author should have focused more on the racial struggles that the African-American students were going through.Lastly, the book did leave quite a few unanswered questions, such as to suggest a sequel. I do hope there isn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought","review":"Mr. Green had some good ideas going on in the book, but it was just too much. None of the characters seemed to have a resolution to their problems. And he never gave any insight on one of the characters who was kind of a narrator throughout the book. The book also seemed to just end abruptly. I was expecting the loose ends to be tied up somehow but next thing I know, it's the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word...........Bad","review":"Have you ever kept trying in vain at something even though you know it is a forgone conclusion that it will not get any better?That is the feeling produced with Pseudo Cool.

I actually found this book quite shallow and illogical. I don't know of any BSU presidents who would be dating a prostitute. And no one seems to think there is anything strange about Ashley being a call girl, Kevin being a drug addicted pimp, Jason bleaching his skin and wearing contacts. Garrison's death was not fully explained, I couldn't even get a sense of his character. This book just careened wildly from one subject to another, never making much sense at all. It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, thought provoking and the reason I attended a HBCU!","review":"This book brought out many of the issues that students face within the college experience. These students were all capable but the challenges they faced had nothing to do with the academics. The author has a great story going here, and somehow just ends it with graduation day! He did a great job of introducing each of the student's background which gave understanding to how they got to where they were in life. There is little development of the ties that bind all the \\"friends\\" at the end and it left me wanting for more.

Find a used LP of it and if you can't play LPs, have someone transfer the LP you just bought to cassette or CDR.The sound quality of the CD is criminal. Everything was maximized. That's where the quietest sounds are brought up to the same volume as the loudest sounds. The end result is no subtlety remains, no contrast remains, no music remains, no artistic vision remains.Not only that, but as others have mentioned, when remastered many portions are obviously and painfully DISTORTED. I don't know if they had a deaf chimpanzee running the controls or what. If so, he must have taken frequent banana breaks and left the mastering desk entirely for extended periods."},{"rating":"2","title":"applications for Nanophotonics","review":"Excellent reference book for the contemporary research and development work.

Team members really enjoyed them and they were doubly impressed to know they were scratch n sniff. I guess we never get too old for things like this.I will use the rest of the children's stickers to put into Birthday Cards, and to give out at parties.

It's a relatively short fable/essay discussing... well... the nature and meaning of it all and, since it happens to be free, it begs to be read. Mark Twain is such a literary genius, he makes us feel smarter than we probably are when reading him.And, talking about 'free', I was quite impressed by the quality of this download. Yes, there is no 'active' table of contents but, like I said, it's a short text and you can still search for 'chapter 9' if you have to. On the positive side, the paragraphs are well formatted and I couldn't detect too many typos."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Got Me Hooked on Mark Twain","review":"This book is definitely the work of a great writer.I never really read much of Mark Twain outside of school many years ago. I read this book because the title intrigued me. I found it to be one of the most interesting books I have ever read.

I could not wait to finish it. I rushed through it and finished it i two days! Mark Twain must have written this at a very bad time! It sucked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysterious Stranger","review":"I would only recommend this book, if you're willing to a long, short story, but other than that it's not too bad. After all, it does have some really intriguing themes. A few boys are living happy sheltered lives in a remote Austrian village named Eseldorf, and one day, a handsome young man named Satan appears, and does several magical feats. Satan begins to share his ability to foresee the future to inform the group of unfortunate events that will soon befall those they care about. Satan proceeds to inform them of each new tragedy that will befall their friends. The boys beg Satan to intercede, which he does but always from a cynical, technical definition of mercy.The point of view might be slightly skewed, because it is narrated by one of the boys in a first-person narrative. The story isn't too bad but, its extremely long."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Mysterious Stranger\\": sick, bitter, and twisted","review":"Twain's bitter edge kept getting sharper and sharper as he grew older, till finally only the bitterness was left. \\"The Mysterious Stranger\\" was his last work, and Twain is full-bore in his hatred of man, God, and everything in between. He was so intent on spilling his bile that he didn't even bother to come up with an ending, which is one of the most sophomoric I've ever seen; Heinlein would say it's equivalent to ending a book by writing \\"and the little boy fell out of bed and woke up.\\" It's a shame that Twain's writing should be forever tarnished by this final piece of literary drudge, a book so bad only English majors and prison inmates are consigned to reading it. Read some of his earlier work instead (e.g., \\"Innocents Abroad\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Great Story","review":"This is a side of Twain unread by those who think Huckleberry Finn and Mark Sawyer are children's books. The satire is far from humorous; the condemnation of Man is damning and totally accurate. The picture of ignorant, brutal, and short lives captures the religiosity of the Middle Ages (and of much of the present). If only for its treatment of the \\"moral sense,\\" this story is worth re-reading. Obviously, the human idiocy Twain describes still exists.Obviously, we still operate in the darkness Twain portrays. Obviously, if angels existed, they would be more like the character in this story than in our common picture of them.Should be required reading for every student of religion or good writing, especially for those who ponder the question of why bad things happen to good people.Note that in my version, there are two other short stories that follow this one. They are somewhat inconsequential and neither add or detract from the value of this edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twain's best","review":"I, having read Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, picked up \\"No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger\\" expecting yet another light-hearted romp.I got a masterpiece instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Best","review":"Good manners never go out of date and neither will this book.

The text is a rambling of the author's thoughts on how he's caught bluegill over the years with a lot of encouragement toward bringing kids into fishing. Mostly geared to the very beginning fisherman and would be quite suitable for kids. I enjoyed reading it in the beginning, but about halfway through, lost patience with the rambling style, misspellings and poor grammer. The book would have benefited greatly from a competent editor.

So, my word of warning is: DO NOT READ THIS BOOK TIL YOU'VE READ THE OTHERS IN THE SERIES FIRST. There are some parts of the book where assumptions are made that you know/understand what's been covered already that were a bit confusing, and I think that's why I couldn't get into it at first (at least, that's what I'm hoping.)

Buy a Logitech windstopper instead","review":"I purchased this based on some of the reviews I read. These reviewers got it all wrong. I will give the device a few good points. It is lightweight and works well in quiet surroundings. There are many problems with this device. The biggest is the need to keep entering the password when turning the device or the phone on. My Motorola E815 has this device on the list but for some reason keeps asking for the password. This is the only device out of 3 paired on my phone that does this. Because the mike is so close to the earpiece, feedback can be heard sometimes. This device is good when using it at home in QUIET surroundings. When I used it in a upscale restaurant, it picked up everything and the other person had trouble hearing me. Do yourself a favor and get a Logitech windstopper bluetooth for $40. It works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for...","review":"Set up and synching to my Sony Ericson was very easy (hint: hold the button down for longer than the manual says- till you see both red and blue lights). Either my or the headset keeps losing synch but it's straighforward to re-establish. The speaker quality is excellent as well as the volume control. The microphone only works if you use the additional over-the-ear attachment and the foam speaker cover. Both move the mic away from your head so it can pick up sound. With that done, folks say I sound ok but not as good as without the headset. Without doing that, folks say it sounds like I'm talking through my chest.

This headset works a lot better than the Bluetrek and fits nicely in the ear. You don't even need the headstrap thing making it quicker to put in. Around the ear piece their is a rubber ring and when you put it on, it sticks to the ear making the strap not needed. The headset is very lightweight, you don't even notice it. Comes with a lot of accessories for it also. There are two chargers, a USB and a regular house charger. Extra ear pads, a necklace thingy to use if you are really crazy, and instructions. The voice quality is very clear on the headset and I have had no problems yet. From reading the other reviews I was kind of sketchy to purchase it but now I'm glad that I did. As far as having \\"big ears\\" to use this I'm not sure what they meant, I personally have little ears and it works just fine.

Battery life is very good and I like that I can charge it from my notebook with the include USB charging cable (as well as normal AC charger that is 110-240, important when I travel). I also find it very light and small. It is comfortable and easy to put on.

It doesn't hold the ear securely at all. I didn't even get to charge the headset before I noted that the holder was so flimsy that if I moved my head barely, the thing would fall off. The earpiece is on a swivel attached to the speaker, which does not position the headset in a consistant manor. If I can't keep the thing on, there's no use going any further.

When I was in my dorm sharing a room with a nerd and pretty much having no friends I thought these guys were the coolest guys in the world. It's the funniest sports book, maybe any book I've ever read. If you love golf you will love the history of the sport from a master sports writer.

Third, when I noted that the cost to repair closely approaches the cost of a new machine, their customer service representative told me I should have purchased the extended warranty.My suggestion is, buy a more reliable product, not a Sony. Check out what the warranty, when you purchase. Select a product with 1 year parts and labor.

Its too small the remote eye isexternalinstead of internal, thats why you have to almost point the stupid thing right at the panel.Why this design I have no ideal.And why should you have to pause the movie just to get the slow motion feature.

I would advise one to require the salesperson to demonstrate that the VCR can actually play a tape before making a purchase.

There is a delayed response between the remote and the unit that took me a few minutes to figure out. I thought the remote was broken at first. The buttons seem too delicate.Overall, the unit does have a good quality picture when playing DVD or VHS but the noises coming from the machine are ridiculous given today's technology.Truely a lemon among combo machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Like other reviewers, I find that the unit is extremely finicky when playing DVDS, to the point of being unwatchable.

Upon reading it, I was thoroughly disappointed and stopped halfway through. Essentially, the problem stems from the fact that the narrative is full of verbiage that gives almost no facts about Chopin, but engages in endless verbal diarrhea; it seems that Liszt did not actually write the bulk of the book, but some bimbo who had the reputation of loving to talk at length without actually saying anything.Next time I will buy a real biography of Chopin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life of Chopin or not the life of Chopin.","review":"Life of ChopinThis book was a huge disappointment due to Liszt's lack of objectivity and over-emotional language.

We enjoy exploring the worlds and figuring out the puzzles.We did have quite a bit of trouble getting the first two games to work in Windows XP; however, there's a lot of information on the web regarding how to trick it out. Basically, you have to downgrade to a very early version on DirectX (which will break any newer games for awhile) and run the game in a special mode in Windows that isolates it and makes it think it's running in an earlier version of Windows. If you know your way around a computer, it will be no problem. If you aren't comfortable with the technical side, you will probably not be able to run the first two games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for longtime fans!","review":"I was interested in this from when I first heard about it on the Genesis music forums, and was not disappointed when I got it. Quite the opposite!The packaging design is great (although a little cheap), and shares the same style as The Platinum Collection CD set, but this DVD is a real treat even for long-term fans who may not have seen this collection of Genesis' videos before. I personally have been a fan for over 10 years now and had never seen two-thirds of the material on this DVD.Simply the sheer number of music videos on this DVD make it worthwhile, despite the lack of extra features or commentary. The biggest treats on this DVD are \\"Robbery, Assault & Battery\\", \\"The Carpet Crawlers 1999\\", and \\"A Trick of the Tail,\\" since they are so rare.If you are a new fan, I recommend The Platinum Collection over The Video Show, as it covers the breadth of all of Genesis' work. But if you're like me, and consider yourself a serious Genesis fan, this DVD is a must-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong region","review":"The DVD is absolutely great, but my DVD player would not play it because it is the wrong region - NOT REGION 1.

To my knowledge this is the only DVD that features these from the under-appreciated Calling All Stations release. Most of the other videos on the DVD have been released in previous collections.I am a devoted Genesis fan, and think that other devotees will appreciate this omnibus collection. There is, as another reviewer has pointed out, a problem with the sound levels on the DVD. I don't know the ins and outs of it, but it seems as if the volume fades in and out to avoid peaking-out.Still, it is a nice collection, and I am glad that I bought it. It should, of course, be supplemented by one of the band's live performances (e.g.Genesis - The Way We Walk (Live in Concert),Live at Wembley Stadium) andGenesis - The Genesis Songbook. Fans will be glad to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD, but kinda flawed!","review":"I really think that Genesis has to be one of the Greatest bands of all time. Now im only 18, So I dont recall any of there old videos. So this is why I picked it up. It has every song that I love and others that I never thought were videos. I never thought Illegal Alien had a music video. But the only thing about this dvd. theres no extra content on it. I also have to agree with ArmyVet, there is no sound effects in the Land of Confusion video. Now thats kind of a ripoff knowing that you've seen that video many of times in the 80's. And there were other videos that did pretty much the same thing. Why did Nick Davis do that?. Anyway, its a must buy for Genesis fans who want to remember the videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Job","review":"This book is almost a picture book, but it is done by experts.

Aziz is an up and comer and in his debut DVD he hits the mark.Aziz found fame from appearing in Adam Sandlers film Funny People and appearing on TV shows Scrubs and Parks and Recreation but stand up is were he really shines. He is a new gen stand up comedian, he talks about stuff like Facebook and burning CD's. But he is really in his element talking about his night out with Kanye West and going to a R Kelly concert. Aziz delivers his lines with energy and charisma in such a likable way. And for all you RAAAAAAANDY fans don't worry he makes an appearance too.If you love a good laugh and are into the comedians I mentioned earlier then don't hesistate in buying this. The main stand up goes for about 60 mins but there is also an additional 30 mins in the special features.

It's also incredibly offensive... I repeat, INCREDIBLY offensive! Therefore, if you are at all squeamish, or sensitive about particular subjects, this one is best left untouched. It also bears mentioning that you should never, EVER attempt to watch Aziz go to work while in the company of your children, or you will be thoroughly, permanently, irredeemably embarrassed. There are moments in here that simply can't be undone, once digested.However, if you enjoy Aziz's antics and hard-R comedy, this is the gig for you. There is nobody quite like Aziz in the world of stand up. Everything about him is unique- his appearance, his material, and his delivery.

There were a few laughs but generally the jokes are about bjs and sex. The Randy bit at the end is highly obnoxious and not at all funny. I agree with another commenter that said Aziz comes off as nervous and not very confident. Some of the jokes go on for too long. Aziz substitutes profanity in places where he could have delivered an intelligent, well thought out joke.

I'm already looking at other cameras. Update: I got a letter from Olympus informing me that the problem is not under warranty and it will cost $100.70 to fix what is probably a $0.10 plastic latch.

Another way of putting this is \\"faith without works is dead.\\" I believe the writer planned on selling this book as a panacea for people who just want to sit on their butts and recite a prayer and wait for the miracles to start pooring in. I hardly believe there is anythig special about this particular prayer. I think the best solution for anyone is to pray for the strength to do what is right and to let your conscience be your guide.

What about denying yourself first, taking up your cross, and then finding life?There is a lot of religious materialism going on with Jabez. That's what offends me the most. I am sick of seeing jabez stuff everywhere I go. Everything from calendars, devotionals, versions for kids, teens, women. I think that one book is enough.Wouldn't God bless you in life if that was in His will for you?

I couldn't believe this author wrote what he did. Is he truly a Christian? He turned a simple prayer into a list of selfish requests for wealth and other material things. Yes, God will bless us, we just have to ask but it is according to His will, not ours. Not only that, but blessings may not come in the form of material things but in spiritual things. And the Bible clearly says to leave this world behind and want only the treasures of Heaven. Wealth, land, popularity, all those things will mean nothing in the end and to write a book about praying for such things, goes against everything I know as a Christian. God will provide for our needs.

This is a prayer that should be prayed for everyone in the world. This prayer is very humbling - not egotistical. This prayer asks God to work through you, which is very humbling, to the one surrendering to God's will and/or the desire to be blessed.

Like a few other reviewers, the author's demand for numbers of people is a bit extreme and possibly vain. But I think that at least he is asking and hoping.

Wilkerson made it very clear that we can only receive these blessings when we are in unity with God's desire for us. In other words, only when God's will is in action, will we perceive the blessings that that unity reflects.

But it does not address the underlying problem of the need for forgiveness of our sins and our obligation to help & pray for others and to honor & pay homage to the God who makes all possible (that is his will). If you want to know how to pray, the best place to start is Matthew 6:9-13 and Luke 11:2-4. The disciples asked Jesus how to pray and he taught them what most call the Lord's Prayer, but I like to call The Prayer of Jesus.

If you are looking for Christian books to read find ones that stick with scripture and do not give you the authors ideas. You cannot write one book about 4 verses because you miss out on what the WHOLE Bible teaches on a subject.

It strikes me as a prayer of magic. The author advises you to prayer this prayer and see your life change. It takes more than a one line prayer to change a life. It reminds me of those who advocate the gospel of prosperity. Readers are cautioned to read with your minds engaged!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cult of Jabez","review":"All pseudo-Christian cults have one thing in common. They all claim to have \\"uncovered\\" some \\"hidden\\" or \\"secret\\" teaching or verse buried in the Bible.The Prayer of Jabez, by Bruce H. Wilkinson is no different. The author of the popular Jabez books would have us to believe that he has uncovered a powerful prayer, that when recited \\"word for word for thirty days\\" or more \\"releases God's power, favor, and protection\\"? This is so far from Biblical Christian teaching that one would wonder how any professing believer could fall for it. But you know Jesus warned us that in the last days many false teachers would arise and \\"seduce, if it were possible, the very elect (believers)\\". On February 1st, 2002 a book will be released worldwide that exposes the dark teachings of the Wilkinson's \\"Jabez Revolution\\", as he calls it. \\"The Cult of Jabez\\" will be available to Amazon customers soon. Check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Prayer of Jabez","review":"The book is a book of mixed messages. In one message the author tries to draw a person \\"to let go and let God though prayer\\"; but, then the author offers a game plan -- \\"If you say this, God will do that\\". This game turns God into a vending machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"This book included some principles which are very true and powerful but in my opinion, mixes with them enough error to be more of a stumbling block, than a tool for motivation and growth. By all means, pursue the topic of prayer! It will change your life! But try reading Olan Hallesby or E.M. Bounds instead. These books are thoroughly good and trustworthy and have stood the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Words...","review":"If you believe, it serves its purpose.

I kept my promise, almost. I read 75% of it but never really got the prayer deal other than bless me and bless me some more. Sorry folks but I dont see what the hoopla is about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jabez's prayer","review":"This is a very rewarding and challening book for this time of any Christian life. It is challenging me to trust the Lord for the impossible. My prayer life is more direct and the way God wants His children to pray. I have given several books to dear friends, knowing that when read, their prayer life will be encouraged to be more fruitful."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Will Be Done","review":"I was horrified by this book. The premise--that if you just repeat this prayer often enough, God will give you exactly what you want--is so not Christian. It's on a par with amulets, charms, and spells, which the New Testament strongly condemns. The idea that you can manipulate God by uttering the magic words is superstitious and selfish, not to mention the complete antithesis of everything Jesus taught. Remember, \\"thy will be done\\"? \\"Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will\\"? And what about that famous Evangelical phrase, \\"Let go and let God\\"? The prayer of Jabez is a step backward, not forward!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Trash, Will Point You in the Wrong Direction. Stay Away.","review":"ALERT -- this book is a modern day \\"medicine man\\" type rag sheet that promises to \\"cure all your ills\\" with one simple little formula.Not only is this book poorly written, poorly documented and completely inaccurate in its representation of the Bible, it misleads readers into thinking that God's plan for you is to \\"enlarge your territory\\" and make you more prosperous, etc. This \\"health and wealth\\" type attitude has hurt many people and completely misses the point of God's desire for us.My copy of this book is full of scribbles and notes on just about every page of how the author is so completely lost and wrong about basic stuff. It boggles my mind that so many Christian leaders have gotten sucked in to this approach.Please do not waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wants God to be a Genie in a BOTTLE!!!!!","review":"I would suggest to Wilkinson that all the money that he is making from writing this book should be well spent trying to make amends with THE IMUTABLE GOD in heaven. Try looking at the second commandment: Though shalt not make a graven image! God is made into a NEW image here. Do not be fooled. This life is but a breath. This book isn't going to help any person get into the kingdom of God, it will destroy you! God OWES YOU NOTHING! He bought those who serve him with a price. WE owe HIM everything! Try to write a book now explaining why God really isn't a Genie to pull out when you selfishly want something. GOD made us for HIS GLORY not OUR pocketbook. We are here to get ready to Marry our glorious God in Heaven. I do not know of many husbandmen who looked for someone selfish to marry. GET your oil lamps ready!!!

The emphasis of the book is too man-centered, focusing on the \\"bless ME\\" rather than on God. This horrific book also let's the American dream get in the way of the Christian worldview. Wilkerson is so materialistic in this book it is pathetic. To be sure, there are a few places where he claims not to do so. However, he doesn't do that in the book. He speaks from two sides of his mouth.C. H. Spurgeon, on the other hand, preached a sermon on the prayer of Jabez from Chronicles which is God-centered and shuns the materialistic focus of Wilkerson's book. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dee Lundgren Christian Counselor Langhorne, PA","review":"This book is outstanding and well worth reading over and over again for inspiration. It is theologically sound and encourages Christians to seek more not for themselves but for God's glory. He takes a little read prayer in the Old Testament about a man named Jabez who was more honorable than his brothers and sought for God to expand his borders. It is right and biblical to ask to do more for God. This is different than for asking more for our own pride. Conservative Christians are often shy to ask for God's blessing but through the explanations and examples one is motivated to desire and pray for the expansion of one's borders."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Powerful Little Book I've Ever Read","review":"I have been an excited, believing, on fire Christian for 30 years. This little book has given me more direction, joy, power and know-how than anything I've read except the Bible. Wilkerson takes you through a journey that supercedes space and time, because what happens, DAILY, is so supernatural, yet natural, that you wake up with a feeling, \\"what is my adventure going to be today?\\" I start my morning by asking God to \\"make me an appointment\\" AFTER I have asked for His blessings, of course. Then, I look for people to help, to encourage. I email people boldly with hope and joy. It has aided my ability to share the Lord, with which everyone often have trouble. It is soooooooooo simple. Buy a bunch of copies. You will be giving them away like hot cakes. And, the joy outweighs the small expense. The blessing connections are awesome. And, the Devotional is a must. It even explains further. Wow! God keeps His promise to bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor theology","review":"Dr. wilkenson should know better. I have to seriously question this mans knowledge of scripture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far less than one star","review":"This book is so full of biblical error that one is at a lost as to where to begin giving a proper and fair critique. This book may be an indication of the excessive biblical illiteracy of many (Or rather most) people. What concerns me most is that this book also seems to be a run-a-way best seller among those who claim to \\"know\\" Christ. It doesn't suprise me that unbelievers are so gullible; but Christians? Lord help us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another get rich quick scheme","review":"There are only two reasons a person would buy a religious book, either he desires to learn more about religion in an academic sense or he is hoping to find himself spiritually. This book fails to deliver on both accounts. Academically, there is no serious study. I read the book in twenty minutes it's that short, hardly worth the ten dollar price. If you are looking for spiritual enlightenment I suggest you consult the Bible, Koran or the Vedas. Basically, he says repeat this line all the time and all your problems are solved. Furthermore, at the end he says oh yeah if I didn't rip you off enough all ready send me some more money at this address."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Book","review":"Bruce Wilkinson has \\"enlarged his borders\\" by wasting consumers' money by their purchase of this worthless book. It is amazing that this book has reached best seller status. Save some time by reading the prayer of Jabez in the Bible and apply your own interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prayer for More Money","review":"I find it repugnant that Bruce H. Wilkinson is legitimizing people's desire to pray for personal success. Of course the book is flying off the shelves. Suddenly people do not need to feel guilty any more about being greedy pigs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"A very remarkable prayer found hidden among the geneology of Abrahams ancestory. This prayer cannot be dismissed. Thank you Bruce Wilkinson for your God ordained investigation, insight, and remarkable explanation of such a wonderful hidden gem from God's word. The Prayer of Jabez; Breaking Through to the Blessed Life is an excellent addition to any Christian's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot said in a little book","review":"This book takes a small, single section of the Word of God and illustrates its brilliance. Jabez' prayer is an example of an honorable man humbly requesting God's blessing. Wilkinson breaks down the parts that make up this prayer and shows how this can work for others. So much is written about the Lord's prayer, but the Lords prayer is just one example and it isn't an example where there is an answer to prayer. The Prayer of Jabez is an example of godly prayer that explains what was prayed and the result. Wilkinson' book is a great aid to inspire and help buid a more blessed prayer life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why this prayer?","review":"I think we are missing the boat if we put SUCH great significance and focus on a few lines of a prayer in the old testament, then add our own interpretation to a prayer that seems pretty simple to decipher. Let us focus on what Jesus tells us. I for one feel that this work provides an excuse to ask for material things and find \\"proof\\" that we have the right to pray for that. The desire for material things is a human one, which I believe God understands, and forgives. However, as Christians, don't we wish to aspire to find joy from whatever God wills us? Funny how many \\"Christian\\" reviewers defend this book, and seem to loose focus on the Bible and especially, the direct guidance from Jesus in the New Testament. Also funny that the popularity of this book is going help answer the prayer for expanded territory of it's author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange, isn't it?","review":"Isn't it strange how such a little book about a litle verse can cause such an intense controversy? There are over five hundred names in the geneology of I Chronicles, yet one man has stood out to thousands, just because of a simple prayer he prayed. Blessings. We all want them-who said it had to be hard? Matthew 7:7 says to ask and we will recieve. All Jabez was doing was taking God at his word. All Scripture is inspired by God. This prayer would not have been included if God didn't think it was necessary to us. In all actuality, this prayer is not being selfish for oneself, but for God. Why underestimate what God can do? Jabez prayed that God would bless him by expanding his outreach. He realized his helplessness if this request was answered, and depended on God's strength to accomplish all things. Several people has misinterpreted this: PLEASE read it for yourself, and see all that God has in store for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst interpretation ever","review":"I read this book years ago. My first impression was, \\"this seems like a lot to pull from such a small passage.\\" I really felt that there was something wrong with it. A few months later, I read a textbook on Biblical Interpretation, and suddenly I could articulate what bothered me so much about this book.In short, this book is a classic example of proof-texting. The author ignores or violates just about every rule of interpretation I can think of. Most of the stuff he talks about comes from his own head.The book is nothing more but a money-maker and trendy consumer-culture fad. No Christian should read this book and take it seriously and Bruce needs to go back to Bible College."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Teaching and misleading.","review":"Discovering a 'secret' prayer, a one liner that will score with God, as BW asserts, is the first tip off that this book is from the pit. It caters to those who want to 'use' God on their terms and get the goodies. No wonder its a best seller. But it's also a misuse of scripture. I hope people will be tipped off to this spiritual poison before they start wasting time following its advice. What amazes me is that BW wrote it. I gave it one star because there was no lower option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forcing God to do your will","review":"Christianity today is after power and self fulfillment and to corner that market we have a book here that offers us a magical incantation in which all you have to do is to repeat this prayer over and over and SHAZAM.....God blesses you.Does this sound like vain repetitions which many think that they will be what it takes to get from God what they want. HMMMMM. Jesus had no place to lay his head, Paul was a prisoner in a dungeon who paid with his life, early Christians were killed in the lions den.

Work hard and formulate a plan of action. Love your neighbor.

Maybe he should read Jim Bakker's \\"I Was Wrong,\\" and get some tips."},{"rating":"2","title":"One sentence prayer","review":"I've read several of the reviews of this precious little book and I've found one in particular I can agree with. I, too, feel that this little book is to be used to teach us about faith in our walk with the Lord. Bruce Wilkinson didn't write it with the intention to have believers get greedy! He wrote it to guide and advise us. I've spent time in Chronicles and this one sentence prayer is about growing in faith. Jabez wanted to learn how to walk WITH the Lord, FOR the Lord. He wanted to be used by God; he didn't want to hurt others. Take a lesson from Jabez - be willing to be used by God!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever","review":"one of the best books i have ever read..was able to read it in one sitting could not put it down..the prayers are so helpful"},{"rating":"1","title":"prayer of Jabez..to who?","review":"The prayer of Jabez does not focus on our need for salvation through Jesus Christ. Everyday pray the prayer Jesus taught us to pray, the Lord's Prayer, not the prayer of Jabez. Also, when we sin, Wilkinson mentions we need to make it right with God. We do not. Christ has done that for us. There is nothing we can do, nothing we need to add to what Jesus did on the cross. The Prayer of Jabez is based on an inaccurate translation. Jabez was not necessarily an honorable man, the translation should read Jabez was honored above his brothers. This does not necessarily make him honorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Health and wellness Christian View.","review":"This book is 93 pages of drivel. It would seem that Wilkinson has received an answer to his prayer....Look at all the marketing rights there are to this book. This one book has spawned devotionals, calendars, Prayer of Jabez for teens...Next we will see Prayer of Jabez for the mentally challenged, Seniors etc. ITS MARKETING AND CAPITALISM GONE WILD.Now to my actual criticism of the book. The book seems to be telling the reader that by praying this prayer, one will all of a sudden be brought into a world of overwhelming blessing. Wilkinson gives the impression that this prayer is like a spiritual American express card, giving both worldly and divine riches. Maybe instead of sending foreign aid to countries we should just send copies of the prayer of Jabez...But seriously, the one prayer that we should add to our daily supplications to the Lord is the Lord's prayer.

Luke quotes Paul in Acts as saying to be on the guard for \\"grevious wolves\\" This, along with the Left Behind series are merely that, speculation, and false teaching. If you want to build a belief system on a few verses, why not try promoting canabalism by quoting Revelation 19:17-19? I had a friend tell me once that more often than not if a book or movement in Christianity becomes extreme popular, or mainstream, that it, as Steve Brown says, smells like smoke (i.e. it's from the Devil).

There is no way a top-notch theologian could squeeze 96 pages out of one verse and keep it focused solely on Scripture. Well, Wilkinson wrote that much, but he threw in so many examples from life that it totally took away the meaning of the verse.If John Owen and Matthew Henry were alive today, I wonder how much they could have written on just that one verse. Both of those men knew how to rightly divide the Word of Truth. Wilkinson does not appear to know this."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor exegesis","review":"For approximately 3500 years the Prayer of Jabez has been virtually ignored by scholars in both the Jewish and Christian communities. Now along comes Wilkinson who writes as if he has discovered some new secret to prayer. Jesus, in his introduction to the Lord's Prayer (Luke 11:2), said, \\"When you pray, say; ... \\". This prayer was given to his followers as an example of how to pray. The Prayer of Jabez was given to Jabez only, no one else. Any attempt to make this prayer universal, especially when it comes to increasing one's borders, spiritual or not, is poor exegesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugar Coated Theology","review":"After careful study of this book I have found that it is not only thelogically emptey but it uses a minority translation to establish its premise. That somehow this prayer which is not found in any of the Lord Jesus's discourse on Prayer is a wonderous solution for getting closer to God. If so, then why, when Jesus's disciples asked Him to teach them to pray did He not just say, \\"He guys, go with the Prayer of Jabez.\\" A better book by far, is written by Mike Nappa, \\"The Prayer of Jesus\\". If you want to get closer to God get Mr. Nappa's book and read it alongside your Bible. If you want to waste your time on trivia read the Prayer of Jabez but don't use your Bible alongside it, there will be an obvious lack of truth involved in comparing it to the Scriptures. You may have to order Mr. Nappa's book but it is well worth it.

Know the Bible, but get to know God more, in a very personal way, and \\"He shall direct thy paths.\\".

Its popularity is a bad omen for our society in the new millennium because it could be even more condensed by just proclaiming God loves me so he wants me to own my own business. Might be inspirational to the masses who think Jesus has a personal relationship with their every whim and who hope to strike it rich through pyramid schemes and Christian Amway. It combines the worst of the self-obsessed self-actualization movement, preachy evangelism and the insatiable appetite for riches through the \\"healing power of positive thinking\\".

This is a very bad, fast-food type religious book based on very shaky scholarship and is an example of what Fundamentalists like so much to do -- proof texting -- using one example to bolster an argument even if that example goes against the tenor of the whole work.

Consider the following points:1. If this is a great secret to prayer, then why is it buried in one verse in a genealogy of the Old Testament?2. The book violates the number #1 rule of sound exegesis: A verse cannot mean something today that it didn't mean to the original hearers.3. When the disciples asked Jesus how to pray He surprisingly didn't refer to Jabez. If this interpretation were true, wouldn't Jesus have mentioned it???4. Our problem as the Bible defines it is SIN. Not a need for blessing.5. Didn't Jesus comment on mantra-like repetitions?The botton line: You can't grab one verse in a genealogy and formulate a doctrine around it. This violates all sound theological practice. Save your money or spend it on sound teaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbiblical teaching","review":"I strongly disliked Bruce Wilkinson's book. He makes it sound like God is our \\"sugar-daddy\\". We simply need to place our order with him, then God will 'grant us our wish'. Where does it tell us that in the Bible? Where does the Bible say that when man prays, he always gets exactly what he wants? I think Bruce Wilkinson needs to label his book what it is: a work of fiction. Better yet, he needs to quit writing books until he becomes well versed in the scriptures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substitute 'us' for 'me' in prayer","review":"In the Lord's prayer, Christ never used 'me', only 'we' or 'us'.He was teaching, in this simple way, how to be a real community.If you want to be a blessing for others, make a corporate prayer for everyone's good according to God's will.Also, He honored God first in His prayer, another lesson for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"False translation","review":"I started to read the book but found out Mr Wilkinson had translated Jabez' prayer to fit the tenets of his book instead of writing a book that presents the tenets of Jabez' prayer. I suspect that's because Jabez' prayer -- as presented by every common Bible version, including Keil & Delitzsch -- is a whiney complaint for self protection. Mr Wilkinson changes it into the very opposite. Such intellectual dishonesty by an author is not to be honored, even if his writing supports the things I believe -- which this book does."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Effort","review":"As a fan of Bruce Wilkerson (having used some of his other material), I am very disappointed with this effort. Bruce should know better. Exhorting Christians to copy one of the most self-centered prayers of a tragic Old Testament character, is a mistake. That the book has commercially prospered and spawned an entire 'Jabez' franchise in our shallow, self-centered, Christian pop culture is hardly a surprise. The theology represented in this book will only fly in propserous Western cultures. The book appeals to the absolute worst element in all of us . . .\\"how to get the 'secret' key to prosperity\\". The Prayer of Jabez is little more than warmed over, self-improvement, pop psychology dressed in Christian lingo. Avoid this book.

This is the complete opposite of the self-denial we are called to in the Sermon on the Mount.Jabez devotees have put their faith in worldly treasure and as Jesus said, \\"they have their reward\\". But it's in the Bible, they say. Or, this is \\"for God\\". Satan twisted scripture too.This is just another abomination that promises to make God work for you. Wake up. God is never the object of man's designs or purposes. God is never the object of man's measure. God is the only subject, the great I AM - and we, unprofitable servants. Better to be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of the wicked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little book that can make a big difference in your prayer","review":"The Prayer of Jabez is a little book that can make a big difference in your prayer life. It is based on an obscure passage of Scripture found in I Chronicles 4:9-10. Jabez teaches us that through believing prayer we can overcome any limitation and change our future. Wilkerson does an outstanding job of bringing the passage to life while challenging the reader to apply its truths. Over the years I've prayed the prayer of Jabez over my own life and shared its truth with others, seeing supernatural results. I was excited to see that someone had written a book about the prayer. Little did I realize the great impact it would have. I've heard numerous people comment on the inspiration and encouragement they have received from Wilkerson's book.

He chose his. I recommend Hank's book in place of this one and others like it. God is not a cosmic bell hop, He is our God and his will be done in our lives on his time, not ours.

I have now read it and had the opportunity to hear Dr. Wilkinson himself in a Prayer of Jabez conference. Truly there have been many misconceptions to his book, many spurned by envy or unbelief.The amazing thing about this little book is not that the idea itself is revolutionary, but that it opens our eyes to a message that has been taught in the Bible many times: \\"We have not, because we ask not\\". The Prayer of Jabez teaches us a wonderful way to ASK; not for what WE want, but for what GOD wants for us. To ask for God's blessing is to ask for what He desires to give us. The book does not encourage us to forget all other prayer, but to include this into our daily prayers.I encourage all christians to read this book, to open their eyes to the amazing mercies of our Father who wants to bless us beyond our wildest imagination!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trinidad?","review":"I think my favorite part was where he told a group of seminarians to ask God for the island of Trinidad.This prosperity gospel nonsense is the most destructive popular theology to come out in the past hundred years, and this time it's drawn from an obscure genealogical table in a faux-historical book in the Ketuvim.

There is nothing wrong with looking at this prayer, in fact, since it is Scripture, we should examine the passage. Obviously, according to the text, God found Jabez honorable and his prayer at least somewhat legitimate, and in line with His will, so He granted Jabez's request. That's about all we can get from the passage using exegesis (getting the meaning of the passage by reading it as the author intended it to be read).If you are looking for some practical principles of prayer, especially if you are a new Christian, check out the book, \\"The Prayer of Jesus\\" by Hank Hannegraff. It's 96 very short pages long, and very readable.

Who wouldn't want to have all that God wanted for them?....spiritually, physically, mentally......so on.....This book teaches the reader about a man who was labeled as a \\"nobody\\" who cried out to God...to change him and not to let that curse rest on his life. God granted his request! God longs for us to cry out to him and ask us for his blessing......just as our earthly fathers want to give us everything we need and want, how much more does our Heavenly Father want to pour out his blessings on our lives?

Topics are introduced before the prerequiste topics are covered.Seibel also has a tendency to throw in details that are distracting and interrupt the flow of the material.For example in the chapter on classes he describes defclass and make-instance and then he throws in a long and technical paragraph on print-object.It is very frustrating trying to learn Lisp from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding Introduction to Common Lisp","review":"This book is an outstanding introduction to Common Lisp and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in becoming a better programmer. Few experienced programmers would deny the benefits of learning a new language, but with the proliferation of languages that are near clones of others, those benefits are not always significant or obvious.Not so with Common Lisp! Within the first quarter of Practical Common Lisp a reader is introduced to interactive development, code as data, dynamic variable scope, several function calling conventions, syntactic abstraction, and much more. True to the book title, these are tools that are useful in almost every program and their use is demonstrated with practical examples.Finally, a word of warning: once your programming toolbox contains such a wide selection of tools, it is very hard to limit yourself to the handful that most languages provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomely good....","review":"This is one of the gentlest introductions to Common Lisp that I have run across.

It focuses on simple but real projects to show you how to use this very powerful programming language. Yes, there are other languages out there, but in my 30-plus years of programming experience I feel that every aspiring or active programmer should learn Lisp just to learn a different way to look at problems. Learning Lisp will make you a better programmer no matter which programming language you eventually use, and this is THE book to use to learn Lisp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan-freaking-tastic","review":"Wow. The author really knows his stuff. I've been wanting to learn a functional language for a while, and Common Lisp seems to be the pervasive grandaddy (Even though the author points out that Lisp isn't strictly functional). There's various resources on the web, but nothing that even comes close to the detailed content of this book.I've been programming for 10 years, and when I get through this book, I'm pretty sure I'll know Lisp better than anything I've learned before, just based on the sheer amount of information, and the easily consumable language it's written with.Good show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vesper Series is Just Plain Fun!","review":"These are great light reads...A series of high spirited plots with quickly familiar characters, entertaining interactions and dialogue in out of the way locations strategically playing fairly moral protagonists against a materially brilliant, sociopathic arch villian.

The family is a single mom with two kids. The great babysitting job is not as great as Verna expected.....This book has an interesting format, it is written like a poem. Make Lemonade teaches you about appreciating what you have. You do not realize how fortunate you are until you read this book. This book teaches you that all the people that are poor in life do not chose to be poor and are trying to earn money to dig themselves out of the poor house. This book also teaches the reader about dedication because, even though Verna didn't really like the job she kept going back to help the family, out of the goodness of her heart. This book really teaches you many important lessons. I rate this book a 4 out of 5 because it was interesting but there were so boring parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking Hold","review":"This novel by Virginia Euwer Wolff was extraordinary! As a once teenage mother myself, I really appreciated the perspective of this novel. It was not the clich�� story about a teenage mom told through the eyes of the embittered mother herself, but rather through the eyes of her teenage babysitter, LaVaughn. The descriptions of Jolly (the ironically named teenage mother), the filthy apartment, the struggles to make ends meet, and the inability to \\"take hold\\" of a life that seems to be falling apart are incredibly dynamic.The book is narrated with a compassion and perception that brings an added sense of depth and sympathy to the situation. Through this narration, an unlikely friendship grows between the two girls-one who is working to save money for college, the other who is working to pay the bills and keep her children fed. Both girls are trying to take control of their lives and education becomes the only way to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I was forced to read this book in school.

There were even times when LaVaughndid not do her own school work because she knew how badly Jolly neededher help.I learned ... because you are still young and have alot tolearn about yourself and the world.

I think the author was trying too hard to make us feel sympathy towards the characters in the book. In comparison to the other books I have read this year, this book was very boring. It was all about a high school girl who dreams of going to college, but needs some money to get there. She takes an after school job babysitting, but it begins to consume her entire life. It would have been fine if the story came to a conclusion, but instead the words just slowly died off. I thought I would have liked it because it took place in an environment that I know well, school. However, it was all about tragedy and sadness. Frankly, this book depressed me. I believe the theme was to never give up, but I never reached it in the sea of boring words. Oh well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When life gives you lemons...","review":"Virginia Euwer Wolff really hit a homerun with this book. Make Lemonade embodies and captures all of the qualities that a good book should have. It captures many aspects of teenage life, and dwells opon the misfortunes that some may stumble upon. Jolly is a seventeen year old girl who has had a hard life. Left with two children, after a slew of bad boyfriends, she is having a hard time raising her kids, and giving them just their basic needs. LaVaughn is a very smart 15 year old, and is looking for a job. She sees an advertisement at school for a wanted babysitter. In no time at all, LaVaughn is watching Jeremy, and Jilly, Jolly's children. LaVaughn shares a special bond witht hese children, and genuinely cares about them. Yet in life, things go wrong sometimes, and a lot of times there is then nothing that can be done to make it easier.

I DID understand the book at length, and therefore enjoyed it. The relationships between the characters, most particularly Jolly and LaVaughn, were so well described, especially the complexity of them. This book does deal with many adult issues, and one of them that was discussed, applyed to my life only months after i finished the book. Characters that you can relate to are always a plus to a great novel. This book conveys a strong message, one that will apply to teens everywhere, whether living in an inner city like the characters, or in a wealthy neighborhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"I would usually find it very distracting to read a book written in the style of poetry, but it's a perfect style for this story. I liked this book so much that I immediately wanted to share it so that no one else would miss the joy of reading it. It's not a long story, but it is powerful. This story stays with you after you've finished reading it. Stereotypes are looked at and made human through the lives and courage of LaVaughn and Jolly-with all the despair, fear, humor and joy of a memorable book. I'm very much looking forward to reading the 2nd book of this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book about a persevering teen","review":"The book Make lemonade was a terrific story of a girl that only wanted to make money to go to college.

Instead of reaching or even nearing his goal \\"The Victorians\\" is a mish-mash of unnecessarily complex and incomprehensibly sentence structure that has been generated in the service of a viewpoint that is not so much revisionist as '60's hippy meets the Luddites.The reader in search of a 'pop' history of the Victorians and their world is still best served by the first two volumns in Jan Morris's trilogy of the Victoran and Edwardian world.

No warning signs--drive just failed. I was shocked because the Seagate name was highly recommended by a friend. Sure, the drive had an extra-long warranty and sure this could happen with any brand, but still a major pain in the ### dealing wih the aftermath. Fortunately I had all of my info backed up on an external HD. Less than two months out of this drive is ridiculous, after all, this is not a no-name company. Strangely enough, the drive that failed before this one was a Maxtor (which is also manfactured by Seagate).

Like some others with one of these failed drives the computer wouldn't boot and couldn't find the drive (not present). A real POS. The really frustrating part is this drive replaced an 18 mo. old OEM 320GB Samsung that died.

I don't have to empty it as often as my previous one and it acts as a normal trash basket as well-giving me more room in my office!I've just tested the pencil sharpener and it works so well I might run my eyebrow and lipstick pencils through as well!And the final plus is...it's not as loud and doesn't give off the unpleasant odor that my last one did.All in all- I'm a Happy Shredder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bought two....both broke","review":"Love Michael Graves line at Target'.

I particularly like the range of very simple tunes to really challenging pieces. Most pieces are presented in a simple form, and then repeated with more challenging versions. The accompanying CD demonstrates each piece in the book, so that you can hear what the tune is supposed to sound like. There are over seventy tracks, but each piece is quite short.What it is NOT: This is not a book that will teach you how to play a violin - it assumes you have basic skills. The CD does not have beautifully arranged songs - it just has the fiddle playing, along with a guitar strumming occasionally to help keep the beat.I have been taking lessons for only a few months, but there are a few pieces I can follow easily, and I see this book will be useful to me for a long time coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced Tunes","review":"There are positives and negatives about this product:POSITIVES: The tunes are great to play along with & the fiddling on the CD is terrific.

He takes the idea of stopping to smell the roses to a whole new level. Every day for over 30 years he has taken the same mile-long walk to his office. This book takes none of that walk for granted as Mr. Raymo examines every step of the way with fascinating detail. He explores the history of the city, the background of the path, and gives insightful, yet easily readable, scientific explanations of the wonders of the world that surrounds him.At times the book feels disjointed. After all, the only glue that holds this work together is the mile-long path through nature.

A great series showing what I��d like to think people would do if left to their own devices. The only gripe I have about this is that the commentary on some of shows didn��t tell me the little tid-bits about what was going on behind the scenes as I might like, but you don��t have to watch them, they are extras and do nothing to take away from the show they put on for us.

I do not have a problem with the \\"salty\\" language. But the DVDs are poorly made. Some will not play at all, others freeze and skip, and one is completely blank. The packaging looks great until you open it and realize the DVDs are not protected properly. By sliding them in and out of the cardboard sleeves they will likely become scratched. Because of the \\"Catch 22\\" return policy, (only DVDS in original shrink wrap packaging may be returned) you run the risk buying something that will not play.

I understand that in early western camps like Deadwood this vile abusive language was commonly used. I get the point ... and point is well taken. However after several hours of listening to the endless barrage of 4-letter words it becomes a detraction from the story line, a burden on the ears, and takes on a life of its own. Adult viewers should be able to maintain a proper perspective about this bad language but I fear younger viewers are apt to adopt a different attitude and perhaps mimic it.

There just is nothing else to say about this except to tell you to get it and watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"This was purchased as a gift on the recommendation of one friend for another.

I ordered this because we like Timothy Olyphant, especially Justified, and had heard good things about this series. We could not get passed the first 15 minutes of the show. The language is so filthy that we could not stand to watch another minute of it. The show may be very good. It certainly has a strong cast of talented actors. However, the language is so fowl and every sentence is filled with so many unnecessary cuss words that we simply had to turn it off. We are not prudes, are not easily offended and use our share of bad lauguage. Nothing, however, to compare with the language in this series. I should have known since it was produced by HBO.

The story line and plot had a lot of potential; however, the writers were so inept in their writing they had to resort to using vulgar, nasty, and offensive language, which seemed to be every other word. The language and nudity that was used was too unbelievable and made it difficult to follow the story line. I find it unbelievable that these well known people used that language and in that era. Maybe if it was set today in the intercity of most large cities or prison. It was a disgrace to portray these beloved characters from our past as nasty, vulgar scum. It was just for shock. I am disappointed in the wonderful actors who had to lower themselves to this type of film. I am not disputing the history or the facts, but remember Hollywood is known for exaggerating and taking liberties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I bought this for my husband because he is a huge fan of GOOD Westerns, we could hardly sit through the first episode because it was so raunchy!

Characters that I didn't like at first I ended up loving at the end. I was left with my jaw hanging open in many episodes...I loved how you never knew what was going to happen. The language of Deadwood seems a bit tacky at first but once you get into the show it just goes with the time and place in history. And there really is not very much nudity AT ALL. This TV series is loosely based on the real story of the town of Deadwood. The last disc is filled with interesting tidbits on the real town and is not to be missed. I would have loved to see where this show would have gone if it had not ended so abruptly."},{"rating":"2","title":"HBO Idiots","review":"Let me start this review off with a rant HBO have got to be smoking thier socks by not commiting to the deadwood story until the story was told.Deadwood has got to be easliy the best TV series of the past 10 years and concidering that it has gone up agianst shows like Californication, Entourage, House etc that is saying a lot.Set against the backdrop of the mining town \\"Deadwood\\". The story pulls no punches and in no way seeks to glorify the west instead paints a rather bleak though acurate picture of what life must have been for settlers in frontier towns. The cast do a great job of getting into their characters minds but none as good as Ian Mcshane who puts in one stelar performance after another.

(HBO, YOU WERE IDIOTS TO CANCEL THIS SERIES!) The acting was superb, and the writers awesome. The set design, costumes, language ... all very authentic. You got caught up in the gripping plots (based on actual events) and the tension of suspense kept you glued to your seat in eager anticipation for the next episode.

Was the language something out of a sailors wet dream? Hell yeah! It sure did tie together as a great show though and when it came up as a Deal of the Day on Amazon I decided I had to have it.

Even the ones that load, they too will sometimes crap out in the middle of an episode, regardless of what DVD player I use. I have made many fruitless efforts to find a remedy, but it seems like I am stuck with these rather expensive ersatz, plastic mirrors. I am furious!

Now have to return the product in the vague hope that a Region B (or Multi-region) version can be shipped.

Are you pressed for time in the morning and tense in the evening? I have been a fan of Callanetics for over ten years and this is by far the best of her videos. The exercises are deceptively easy, but trust me, if you do them right you will know it. I like this video a lot, as I am so pressed for time in the morning it is difficult to fit in a longer routine. This I can do and I feel stretched and great!At night, it is a perfect solution to releasing the tensions of the day that can interfere with your sleep. Want to speed up the results?

(2nd cd being from 1974 and sounds great). Released in 1997 with all its bad recording scratches and all comes nothing close to WBMFTTSTNE's power and punch.One of the all-around greatest groups, ever!

It was expensive but I will tell all of you ELP fans out there RIGHT NOW... IT IS THE BEST DAMN VERSION OF THIS DOUBLE ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE...

When they were with their 80 piece orchestra, double size drum kits and flaming/ wobbling pianos, those 30 minute instrumental solos seemed great.Without the visual, that same music is very boring and lacks the \\"punch\\". ELP is no \\"jam band\\" so the 3 minute radio version of \\"Karn Evil 9\\" blows away the endless 30 minute live version. The Greg Lake works (Lucky Man, Still... you turn me on) are much better in their recorded form.Only \\"hoedown\\" generates enough energy to make it interesting.I'm not saying this is bad but a 3 record live ELP work represents the good, but also the bad of the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ELP Gold Vein Is Mined Out...","review":"Don't get me wrong. I have Shout Factory's release of the eponymous first album, which I dearly love. Trilogy has it's momemnts, and Works is...well, that's another review. But this album, though nicely recorded, reflects the band as stage-stricken with their own hype, and one cannot help but be saddened that the band's edgy creativity became muted when the phony rhinestone glitz got in the way of the expression of true musical genius. The title itself was enough to turn me off, and rather than wait for still more self-indulgent hype, I turned to Bartok and Zappa. But enough said. If you like this album, don't miss out on the Kiss and Andy Gibb albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remastering worth it","review":"There is nothing new here, but the quality of the sound is so improved as to make this absolutely worth the cost for any serious ELP fan.

It is about a group of teenagers that morph into dinosaurs to help battle a bad guy. The content is a little over his head (he is 5), but it is a cartoon, so he can enjoy it without \\"getting it\\". Each of the DinoSquad DVD's come with 4-5 episodes on them, so you get plenty of dino-action in one disk! They do use a couple words I have heard that are not exactly age appropriate (like stupid or idiot), but I have not heard much of that and overall it is a cute concept for any kid that likes dinosaurs. I have even caught my older 2 children (11 and 13) watching intently, even though they pretend they would not be interested in their younger brother's show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Dino Squad","review":"Very healthy program for a little boy that loves dinosaurs.

It reads like an 8th grade book report, it is that predictible and structured (and dull). The author quotes whole passages from the Harry Potter books, without any analysis, and then will lurch into a historical discussion of the subject matter. However, after that, there isn't much connection between the two parts. I've read the Harry Potter books about six or seven times, and this book does nothing to inspire one to read them. The most interesting tidbits are the ones on the sides of the pages, which erudite readers are bound to know anyways.

David Colbert's book entertained me with delightful stories about mythical creatures, real history, ancient mythology and his own speculations on Potter's world. All too brief and lightly illustrated ( it is a very fast \\"read\\"), it left me wanting more. It also left me even more delighted with the talents of J. K. Rowling. The weaver of these wonderful tales has woven even more mythology and fact into the Potter books than I had realized. I had not know that Nicholas and Pernelle Flamel were real people (delighted that she had \\"made\\" him successful and brought him into the 20th cantury)and had forgotten from Greek mythology, who \\"Argus\\" was.

While there's nothing better than learning more about the facts and myths behind Harry Potter, it seems to me like David Colbert threw this book together in an awfully big hurry. Subjects like alchemy (ie, the making of the sorcerer's stone) and divination are discussed in much less detail than they could be, while much of the book is made up of filler--such as a three-page(!) quotation from \\"The Sword in the Stone.\\" And why Colbert chose to frame the book a series of rather contrived questions is a mystery to me.

Rowling.The author also shows some critisism in some parts.When I read the first book of Harry Potter,I had some difficulty understanding it,but this book helped me in this field.The author tells some interesting secrets about some characters from the book(Goblins,giants,etc.)Another thing which I found in my book(which may not be shown in this edition)is that in very minute writng,It has been stated that this book is not approved by J.K.

I checked this out of the library hoping it would help me cope with my Harry Potter depraivity. I enjoyed it, for a time, but quickly it grew dull. I was too familiar with its boring illustrations and skimming explanations. It didn't help. For those of you who read the old one with the old cover, don't bother reaching for that cool book with the cool cover. It's the same dull thing. For those of you who have not read it I tell you only this: you're better off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hermoine would love it!","review":"This is just the neatest book written.

It's not only a great read and a great gift to give anyone who loves the Potter books, it's a cleverly designed and illustrated guide that brings the whole word of Harry Potter to life in a way no other book does. This must have been a labor of love for Colbert and anyone who has ever done any research on a subject as complicated as this one can only admire how well he's pulled it off. It's sure to keep the interest going until the next Potter book arrives. Clearly, a \\"must have\\" for anyone who's into the Harry Potter world.

Statham's voice overs in Snatch were classic, illuminating and funny. The voice overs in \\"Revolver\\" add very little illumination to the story line. Ditto for the montage / flashback scenes but even worse: you think Ritchie is showing you something to \\"bring you into the know\\" but really they only end up confusing and wasting time.I \\"get it\\" that this was Ritchie's philosophical film treatise on \\"ego\\". Too bad it was so ham-handed. If this movie was 20 minutes shorter and more \\"to the point\\", it could have succeeded in showcasing the issues of ego and self. Instead it only serves as a Ritchie's own \\"will to power\\" vehicle for his message..and a fairly shoddy vehicle at that.So much potential wasted due to poor editing and plot development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I really enjoy Guy Ritchie movies but found this one so confusing that I still haven't figured out the plot.

I am a huge fan of \\"Lock, Stock\\" and \\"Snatch\\", and even thought Guy Ritchie's remake of \\"Swept Away\\" was watchable. So going into to this one I had high hopes. Well, the production design is lovely and the camera work features Ritchie's signature jazzy, vivid style. But the storyline? Seriously, if anyone can figure out what this movie is supposed to be about, the progression of the plot and characters, or the moral of the story they deserve a medal. I think is it something to do with gangsters and somehow ties in with the Kaballah religion that Ritchie follows, but beyond that I haven't got a clue.

You take your typical Guy Ritchie gangster crime/con artist scenario and breed it with some murky Jungian pseudo-psychology and this feeble mangled hybrid results? Maybe I'm not as sophisticated as the target audience here, but this film left me feeling leather restraints and a 10 milligram Haldol shot was a suitable antidote.

He was very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caught up in its own ego","review":"This movie tried to be too hip, too intellectual, too clever for its own good. As a result, it ended up being foolish and convoluted. Character development was sorely lacking, plot twists detracted from rather than enhanced the storyline, and all the flashbacks and voice-overs became just plain annoying instead of contributing to the experience. It had some potential, but fell far short of living up to it. I wouldn't say that I'd rather have a root canal than watch this, but I will say I wished I hadn't wasted my time on it. Definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prisoner for the ages","review":"This movie was confusing- but in a good way. In the beginning we see a man being released from prison, but really it's just exchanging one kind of prison for another.

They talk with working class british accent and are streetwise to a point of gaining credibility of being able to survive in this doggy dog world without any education but their innate will to live.I was hoping that revolver is going to be another movie about the underdog beating the gang of brothers but half way through it I could not wait for it to end. This is not \\"Machinist\\" or a \\"Fight Club\\" or any other number of the movies that we have already seen that address split personality or alter ego or some other kind of altered reality. It is failed attempt to create high art.Well, hopefully Richie got it out of his system and the next one will be back to what he does best.

It's about two ruthless loan sharks (Vincent Pastore, Andre Benjamin) who manage to turn several underworld mob bosses against one another, using ex-con con man Jason Stratham as their bemused pawn.There's a fair amount of dark humor to go along with all the bloodletting, but if you think the plotting is hard to piece together, it ain't nothing compared to all the voiceover philosophizing we're subjected to throughout the course of the movie.I bow to no one in my admiration for Guy Ritchie movies, but \\"Revolver\\" finds the writer/director at low ebb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better that I thought it would be.","review":"After reading all the scathing reviews this one received, I decided to wait to purchase when the price went down.

The viewer must work hard to stay engaged for at best a partial and mere intellectual reward of doubtful utility. The filmmaker's message is delivered in such a muddled manner that the the visceral, experiential moment of understanding required for it to be valuable is withheld from the viewer.If you want to kill some time, and enjoy the visuals, some scenes and takes on their own, and familiar actors, go ahead.

I found it an interesting read. The author exposes some of the weaknesses of the FBI, particularly the bureaucratic idiosyncracies that plague the agency; at the same time, I came away with a sense of an organization that can get the job done in the field and put the 'bad guys' away despite the red tape. The book does not follow the typical autobiography format that most ex-cops use, and I for one was grateful of that.

It is a marketing ploy and this woman should be ashamed of herself. I am a proud member of the Market Technicians Association. I share my ideas and vast knowledge and experience with others free of charge. I devote my spare time to reading books on technical analysis but I do not want to waste my time.

The only boring character was the one who narrates it. I wish the author had chosen any other character, as he comes off as a dolt and there are so many interesting plotlines, and other characters. As something considered an early 19th century publication, it is easy to read but I was frustrated by the narrators limited and naive world view.

At it's core is a wonderful love story of a boy John Ridd) who never forgets his first love, and ultimately fights for the chance to win her heart against his lower social standing, and a band of robbers that have kept her captive -- unbenownst to her, since she was a little girl.The BBC have made this into a mini-series many times over, and of course Nabisco has named a cookie for dear Lorna. I am sure Disney will catch up at some point.

Oddly enough, the very problem I'd had, erysipalis (don't mind the spelling) was mentioned in the book (the woman died of it; I didn't!) We don't need Reality! We need Passion, Moors, Wicked folks, Good folks, and Love!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thundering good tale!","review":"This book was a one hit wonder for Blackmore, but it's a classic in its own right. It's a book that concentrates on one little spot in the British Isles, and we get a thorough picture of that spot. The setting is in Exmoor. The story is about a maiden who preserves her purity of mind and body in a quite impossible environment. Lorna had been kidnapped as a child, but in spite of the barbarous surroundings that she grew up in, she manages to preserve her identity and her honour. Blackmore creates great characters. His John Ridd is brilliant. He encompasses all that is right and good deep within the English gentleman's psyche. Blackmore has a way of writing about animals too, that is quite unique. His account of Betty Muxworthy feeding the pigs is wonderful. This book is certainly worth a read at any time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ricky Nelson","review":"Merchandise arrived on time and as advertised.

All of these mixes have been butchered. Loleatta has to be heard in full length or nothing at all. The Greatest Performance is one of Ms. Holloway's greatest but sadly it has been edited. Not only that but it is very hard to find on CD if it was every released full length on CD. Plus what happened to \\"Were Getting Stronger\\".Disco is about the music. There are very rare exceptions to this rule and one of them is Loleatta. You need the fantastic music and her vocals in order to feel her magic in the right way. This CD is real sad indeed. Hold on to your money and try and get the full length versions through other means. You can find some on Walter Gibbons fantatic compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful collection from a real singer","review":"For me this collection is a gift, it's really wonderful. Fine ok it doesn't include all the original full length mixes but you can imagine that things like these cost money to the label and you know they haven't sold many of these. But focusing on the content on the cd, I cannot do anything but praise it. I have fallen in love with this singer. I love Salsoul and Loleatta Holloway is a fantastic vocalist.I think that the second cd might even be stronger than the first one, where her emotion really shines through, the emotion... I feel the ballads or love songs on the cd are really, really amazing.Also a note to that reviewer who complains that ride on time and good vibrations are not on here...erm, ride on time \\"by\\" black box was an illegally sampled song and is not a Loleatta recording, nor is the other sampling on the marky mark & the funky bunch song, they would have NOTHING to do on here! lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"The chairs are not steady and the picture on the top of the table is attached by bolts, not visible in the on-line picture.

The quality is typical of stuff made in China, not horrible for a mill selling for less than $16, but nothing to be glad you bought it.

Sooner or later, vendors will realize that putting \\"France\\", \\"England\\", or \\"Germany\\" on a product, and having it arrive with a peel off label, \\"Made in China\\", is not quality.

It gives great insight into the biblical basis for giving and the fact that while salvation has already been purchased for us, how we are rewarded in heaven will be based upon how we lived, gave, and sacrificed during this life. If you have ready Money, Possessions and Eternity by the same author, then there is little new here. This is simply a small part of that bigger work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and disappointing","review":"I expected a lot more out of Randy Alcorn after having read his book on Heaven. This book has very little deep thought or analysis. It is mainly a rehash of a number of scripture verses and multiple references to Jim Elliot's quote \\"Giving what you can't keep to gain what you can't lose\\". Mainly targeted toward the \\"rich\\" American. By the conclusion drawn from this book, the child who dies in infancy will live in a studio apartment with little furniture in heaven while the Christian who gives away all his/her money will live in a mansion. I agree with the concept of rewards in heaven, maybe not just the possession or power rewards that seem so prevalent in Alcorn's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"And after entrance into heaven?","review":"If we accept George Barna's statistics on Christian giving, then Randy Alcorn's book might be the panacea. Alcorn's treatment and explanation of Christian rewards in heaven is eye opening. He changes the perspective of simply \\"making heaven our home\\" to truly desiring to hear the words \\"Well done, thou good and faithful servant\\". For that reason, the book should be handed out with the certificate of membership and the right hand of fellowship. Excellent read. Potentially life changing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"From the first couple of Earth Band albums through to Nightingales and Bombers you got great rock music with a bit of flair and imagination. I felt Mick Rogers derparture would be fatal. However the albums with Chris Thompson were pretty good (more commercial & safe) but after Watch & Chance went down hill big time. This album is boring elevator music that shows no flair or energy. Beware of false reviews, this is NOTHING like the old Earth Band music. While competent and polished, it is NOT rock music and I can't think of any reason why I would play this again. I read a review that said this was Solar Fire part 2, so I couldn't wait to get it. Big disappointment like Criminal Tango and Masque, just enjoy the ones going back from Chance or Watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ride this train up and down and across a strange, wonderful land.","review":"This is not, as might be supposed, a collection on train songs. It is, as the subtitle of the album says, \\"a stirring travelogue of America in song and story\\". Each track starts with a monologue by Johnny Cash (backed by train sounds), where he portrays a different character each time. Then he will sing a song as that character. Some of the characters he plays are a coal miner, a lumberjack, a prisoner, a slave owner and outlaw John Wesley Hardin. This is a very enjoyable album. The CD adds four bonus tracks, which are of average quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"John R. Cash","review":"This album has some great Johnny Cash songs that fit the man, the image and the style.

The entire kit cost me $119 yet these baskets were $50 each? I paid $100 for 2 basket accessories yet the entire closet kit itself only cost $119? Something doesn't seem right.Anyway, these baskets are awesome and the configurations closet system + these baskets make a great replacement for a dresser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Configurations accessory if installed correctly","review":"This is a large, sturdy basket for the Rubbermaid Configurations system. The basket is removable in the installed position. The basket has full extension glides that glide easily with a full load. The basket is deep (approx depth of hanging clothes). The mesh is tight enough for small items.An important note: if you plan to use this basket in a specific space in your Configurations closet, the VERTICALS MUST BE INSTALLED AT THE RECOMMENDED SPACING; otherwise, the basket cannot be installed.Also, shelves should not be installed under the basket, as they become difficult to see/reach. The shelves are about half the depth of the basket.This is a great add on to any Configurations, and I really like these. The only drawback--expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rubbermaid customer service is lacking","review":"I purchased this basket in the titanium style a little bit ago on clearance at a store. I installed the closet system for my coat closet. I loved the product and decided to install the same system in my closets upstairs. I saved this basket for the upstairs. Fast forward to just a couple of weeks ago when I finally buy and install upstairs and go to install my basket. It was broken. Silly husband has already cut up boxes and I knew the store I got it didn't have any more anyway. I went back and forth online with Rubbermaid customer service and I was disappointed in the outcome. Instead of offering to replace the product (which was clearly defective,) they sent me a coupon good for $20 off any Rubbermaid product.

I not only feel that I learned a lot, but also got an inside glimpse direclty from a true Medicine woman. The story is at times jumbled but always interesting because it isn't just a biography of facts. It is about her connection with spirit and the Dream world and how this was her life. And it's about a time and culture very different from how most people grew up. So it's a real learning-curve to read about these traditions that we just know so little about.

Stuart Woods has missed the mark on this book. The reader finds out the two main characters like to jump into the sack; but the author has not developed his characters very well. It's like he wrote this book \\"on the spur of the moment\\", while sitting in a New York apartment, with nothing else to do. The story line involving the FBI, NYPD and others looking for the murderous bad guy, Trini Rogriquez, is not very realistic. No high tech equipment (except powerful firearms) is referred to in this book. As the book concludes, it doesn't take much effort to guess how it may end. On the positive side,however, this book, like most of Wood's others, is easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing!","review":"Stuart Woods used to be one of my favorite authors.

Holly, associated again with Stone, a coincidence or is Woods desparate for new characters? Trini has somehow endeared himself to the FBI and he's shielded by the Witness Protection Program.

Second, I do not find the character of Stone Barrington to be even remotely likable; to me he comes off as a pompous ass with too much money and time on his hands. Third, the plot of this book seems very thin. It relies too heavily on plot lines from Woods' other books.

Usually the females in the Barrington mysteries jump into bed with Stone in under 24 hours, which is another part of this series that I have never understood.

HOW MANY TIMES CAN YOU TALK SOMEONE OUT OF KILLING YOU? I agreed with her, but I have to add more. The reader, Tony Roberts, is terrible. He sounds like he is 100 years old, and makes all the male characters sound the same. Except for Dino, who he makes sound like a cartoon character. Holly sounds like a dumb bimbo, and not the sharp minded law enforcement officer we have come to know and love. This guy, Roberts is horrible, and I will never purchase a book read by him ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reckless Abandon","review":"I also wish I could rate this book \\"0\\" stars. Woods use to be one of my favorite authors. Alas, no more. In his latest attempt to write, he has made Stone and Dino into standup comics. The dialogue is awful. I wonder how many DAYS it took him to write this book. Certainly no thought or real effort was put forth.

With it's intense focus on those little early joys, it'll take you back to being a kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this would be the last car seat I needed","review":"I bought this car seat because it was supposed to be used for children up to 100 pounds and I thought it would be the last one I would need. My son is now 22 months old and he has outgrown the 5-point harness straps because they are not long enough and if he has a jacket on, I can't get them around him. He is too short and does not weigh enough for the shoulder belt system. It is adjusted at it's longest setting and it is too short. I had to buy a new car seat, I just got it in yesterday and it's 5-point harness system is so much better and fits kids until they are tall enough and weigh enough to go to the shoulder belt system. I now have a Graco seat and it is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty poor carseat.","review":"This carseat is hard to install with the booster still attached. The fabric is very cheap, and it melted in the dryer. I wash my carseats after every roadtrip, and it didn't even last one roadtrip before melting. It ripped the day that I got it trying to adjust the straps. I was very disappointed in this carseat. I would not purchase it again. I loved my previous carseats being the Alpha Omega, and a Graco. If you are looking for something cheap this is the product. There are other products out there that are in the same price range that would be better manufactured. Try those ones first. This is an awful carseat."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a practical point of view","review":"As a practical man, I look at results and behaviors. I really don't care what people say, because you can always tell what people will do from what they've done. Looking at the results of social theories such as this, I see some 200,000,000 innocent individuals senselessly slaughtered in efforts to obtain a more perfect society. People who buy into these rubbish theories will continue to do what the Hitlers, Stalins, and Pol Pots have done in the past.Again as a practical man, I ask the same question I always ask: Who do YOU, mister socialist, trust to tell you what you need to know, where you can work, what you can own, what you may say, and when your body is no longer needed by the state?This book goes in the trash with all the other failed socialist theories."},{"rating":"2","title":"The comic of Spodi Roti and Wise was brilliant.","review":"This was an enthralling read. I liked the depth of this book and it painted a realistic portrait of poverty and gang life. The best part of this book was the incorporation of the comics and illustrations into the plot. The comic of Spodi Roti and Wise was brilliant. I also liked how most of the main characters in this book were not gang members or looking to be involved in gangs but simply wanted to survive long enough to explore their talents in music and artistry.

I think he has written half a dozen classics, at least. I had planned to read everything he has written; this book however, made me realize that some of his work is just trash. I found myself wanting to kill every character in the book and had a headache in the end. I suppose you could say he did get a reaction out of me, but shouldn't there be at least one character you care about? These same criticisms apply to The Evening Star, the sequel to Terms of Endearment. However, if you want to read a great novel, I highly reccomend several of his other works: any of the four Lonesome Dove books (although Streets of Laredo was a little weak), Some Can Whistle, Anything for Billy, Buffalo Girls, Pretty Boy Floyd, and Last Picture Show. I haven't read the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"I felt like a hamster on a flywheel reading this book. It had no beginning, no end, no character development, no story arc, no conflict--nothing that might make a reader want to turn the page. What there is is a lot of mind-numbing conversation between the main characters about sex. Most of the main characters from The Last Picture Show are there, but just barely. The book is really about Duane Moore, the good buddy of Sonny who used to be in love with Jacy. Sonny is almost nowhere to be seen in the book. Duane's wife Karla and long lost love Jacy seem to be placed there just to berate him at every turn about every aspect of his life, including his failing business. He accepts it all by eating humble pie at every turn, aw-shucking laconic answers to the point of tiredness and repetition. The book is set and written in the late '80's but feels very dated. McMurtry is a great writer--Lonesome Dove, The Berrybender stories--but this one you must skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Texasville","review":"Texasville is an interesting contrast to it's prequel, The Last Picture Show. In Picture Show each lesson, each experience ripples with importance. The world is new and dangerous and waiting to be explored. In Texasville all of the ultimate dreams each character had end up as meaningless. This is the aftermath, the sad, energyless, repetitive wasteland that is left. Since nothing is meaningful to the characters, nothing is meaningful to the reader. Although the characters are colorful there is no conclusion, no satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn, yawn, yawn","review":"I made it through 80 pages. The book was going nowhere.

The movie is so low budget, that while watching the first ten minutes of ZIPPERFACE, the viewer wonders if they mistakenly rented a porn video. The acting is about the same level. Predictably a female cop goes undercover as a hooker in an effort to catch Gimpy, yadda yadda yadda in a gadda da vida baby. Even for a bad movie it doesn't deliver what you'd expect. When Willie The Gimp is finally unmasked you'll groan at the stupidity of it. You'll watch this movie with your index finger poised over the fast forward button. There's no shocks, no nudity and minimal gore, though there is a funny decapitation scene. In a nutshell, ZIPPERFACE is a piece a straight to video garbage that fails to deliver on any level.

The answer given in the back of the book is correct, but there is no way you would know the answer if this book was your only resource.It is a matter of the book not covering the subjects in as much detail as the review questions require.Since there are many other books on the market that cover this exam, I recommend choosing another."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is lacking in many areas","review":"This book lack many topics if you are using it for the exam.

The book is *littered* with errors both in the body of the text and the sample tests at the end of each chapter! I also found that to be the case with the TCP/IP study book in this same series. Gotta love it when their answers to the test questions contradict what appears in the body of a chapter! Makes me wonder if the people that wrote the tests even bothered to read the chapters! The individual who scrawled his (or her) name on the back of the book as being \\"Technically reviewed and approved by\\" should be ashamed. Or, maybe it's an illegible scribble for a reason.

I recently purchased this CD-hoping for more great Vandenberg hard rock, or maybe a new twist. The musicianship is excellent, as all of the band are talented and prodigious in the hard rock genre. The letdown is that although the production is A-1, the musical compositions are trite, dull, \\"been there, done that\\" stuff that really is not imaginative or interesting. These guys are capable of so much more! The guitar work is more like Kings X, with definite Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn influence-moments of brilliance, but mostly musical themes you have heard before. The music is OK; it is just not great. And for any fans of Adrian Vandenberg's artwork, the cover art is substandard as well-my kids could do better with a box of crayons.

It should make for some fascinating conversation.Tolstoy adopts a scorched-earth policy in this novel which deflates the \\"sanctity\\" of marriage. The protagonist is a man on the edge, and it seems Tolstoy was there with him in the writing of this incandescent novella.Chris McCandless, the ill-fated Alaskan voyager who died in a hunting shelter while trying to escape the ties of civilization, was reading this novel very close to his death. See the nonfiction \\"Into the Wild\\" for information on this...I'm sure most of you have read the other two selections in this anthology, so I'll limit my comments to Kreutzer. This novel made my pulse race, a physical reaction I haven't had to a novel in quite a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much has changed","review":"Not only are Tolstoy's stories enjoyable with their touching detail and, do contain valuable messages, they, are also beneficial in developing our writing skills.The Kreutzer Sonata: An unidentified man listens patiently as a wealthy stranger rants philosophically on his meaning and observations of life, specifically marriage--woman. He believes that the torments, the emptiness, the dwindling, hopeless marriage is not scarce but the norm--we carry on a deception. All this is the result of the moral decline. His wife goes on to develop his sense of vanity and eventually succumbs to unfaithfulness. He ends by killing her. Not much has changed.

It is an overlong, relentlessly endless, uber-puritanical tirade. Tolstoy was, at least at this point in his life, an unbelievable prude, and this is a master treatise on prudery. If you think that sex is evil, always, every time, even within the bounds of marriage, this story is for you. Otherwise, there's not much here. The 'story' such as it is, is paper thin, despite the awfully large number of words it takes him to tell it.Finally, if you are a Beethoven fan, and were interested in this story because of the piece in the title (as I was), forget it.

If you are looking for a Dewalt drill, it is best to pass on this and go right to their newer 970 or 950 model. This drill is bigger, heavier, seems to have less power and is just harder to handle the the competition or the other, newer Dewalt models.

ACT! 6.0 has a much nicer graphical interface and more enriched features than previous releases. ACT! 6.0 integrated nicely with my outlook XP so that I am able to compose and read messages that are sent with Outlook from within the ACT! console. This is a nice feature because email retrieved by ACT! this way can be scanned by my anti-virus software. The library tab is a nice added feature and it allows you to associate several media type files with your contact.Data conversion for me was quick. I found it fairly easy to set up custom field and reports within ACT. I would recomend this product strongly to anyone who is in the market for contact software.

There is no way to track competitors, no way to modify the screen for opportunities, no ability to track accounts (group is a klutzy workaround). In short those users who hoped that a little of the Saleslogix capability wwould trickle down into this new version of Act will be sorely disappointed. I learned from a dealer that Microsoft's new product will offer all these features, but it isn't due out until later this year. I'm eager to make a switch then!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!!","review":"I've used act for over 10 years, and am so disappointed that I am looking for another contact manager...probably goldmine.

The new mail merge features in ACT 6.0 only allow graphical email documents to be sent out using a merge. A very large file (the last one page press release with nothing but text I sent was 6.37 MB) is attached to the document. Many newspapers I send information to are not even allowed to open mail that has attachments, and many will not accept mail that large. So the new version is useless to me. If there is a way around it, I can't find it, and of course ACT's support is legendarily non-existent. There is no free technical support at all, and their so-called knowledge base fails me most of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed in 6.0","review":"I am a 10 year user of ACT and waited 3 years for the latest version.

It doesn't even support different font styles when integrated with Outlook. SAVE YOUR MONEY. When looking up email addresses it takes forever and I am running the latest laptop.

The ACT for Palm feature, the other item that sold me, is very limited - for example shows me only the primary contact for a given company.The real problem is the bugs. It causes unrelenting problems on my XP system. I have 1 GB of RAM and a 2.8 processor! Yet somehow it manages to cause memory shortages and locks up regularly. I've almost stopped using it because it's as much an annoyance as help. I've never had a software program that I evaluate before launching: do I have time for a lock up? NONE of my other software programs cause these kinds of problems, and I run some heavy-duty graphics programs.I'm at the point of looking for another contact manager, which is too bad because I was a solid ACT user for so many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regret Ever Upgrading to ACT! 6.0","review":"As a long time user of ACT!, we were enticed to do the 6.0 upgrade to finally get a useable integrated e-mail capability. Interestingly enough, the e-mail piece is the only real upgrade worth noting in 6.0... what a shame that it stinks! At least the old 5.0 e-mail module worked, although primative. 6.0 e-mail is buggy, crashes the computers, is a resource hog, slow, in fact, there is nothing good to say about it, even the html capability doesn't work. In my view I'd go back to 5.0 in a heartbeat. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for database novices","review":"I administer and use ACT at our 10 employee company. They used ACT before I came to the company so I am not to blame for choosing it as a solution. The program is built from Access so if you might be better off just going with that program. There is a steeper learning curve but you will not be slowed down by features you wont use.ACT does provide features you might want connected to your contact DB, like email and sales tools. If you choose to go with this almost turnkey solution understand that the program will probably lock up regularly if more than one user connects to it. And it is slow. But I would recommend for a single user without database experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"ACT! 6.0 - Review","review":"I disagree with the bad reviews on ACT! 6.0. I think ACT! 6.0 is a phenomenal product and it has been my lifeline since version 2.0. In the past my biggest complaint about ACT! was the e-mail client. In the past it wasn't real user friendly like the rest of ACT! but with ACT! 6.0 the e-mail client has caught up with the core competency and now I can stay within the program at all times. I can also generate simple invoices and quotes to my customers through the new library tab, which is one of my favorite new features.I think ACT! 6.0 is a solid upgrade from ACT! 2000 and it is worth the [$$] bucks just for the e-mail portion and I would pay another [$$] for the library tab...In my opinion, the people writing bad reviews on ACT! 6.0 don't use it to its full capabilities and therefore they do not recognize the improvements.Sincerely,Satisfied ACT!

He glorifies stereotypes that Hispanics activists denounce. Yes it's stand up comedy and he can say what he wants, but if you want to hear something like a Mexican will wipe his butt with the hamburger and serve it to you because you're white, then you might like it.

It looks as if someone setup a video camera and then videotaped the movie playing on a cheap TV. You can actually see the TV scan lines in the picture. Plus the colors are washed out to a dull uniform gray, and the picture is literally crooked on the screen (their video camera wasn't pointed directly at the TV, but was off to the side somewhere).If you can get a copy of the Polish release, you'll see this movie with the colors and picture intact. But you will not get subtitles. That's the only reason to buy this Polart release.NOTE: Polart recently remastered these DVDs. I took a chance and purchased the new ones - they are greatly improved.

However, the sound is inconsistent. It starts pretty loudly but about 20 minutes later, both the rain and especially the thunder die off. Also, the sound isn't smooth. It sounds like several separate storms patched together without any transition.My main problems, though, are the non-storm noises. I knew from the sampler of this series that there is a little dog barking in the background, but I thought it was quiet enough to ignore. The barking is present, no surprise. What I can't accept is a faint, disjointed SINGING like a ghost trapped in an insane asylum. Listen closely, and you will hear this phenomenon around 5:50, 6:10, and 9:00.

Where the alpha M/F step on each others words, and the charactors speak in half formed sentences.So I will just say this went above and beyond that. Georgia even left the two young kids alone to go shopping, and have lunch with Agrippa, even after the boys had already taken a taxi to see the flamingos.From the back of the book: 'Georgia felt sorry for the two children in the care of the unfeeling Agrippa Smith.

He focuses on three battles that are less well known by the general public, Okinawa in WWII, Shiloh of the Civil War and Delium of the Peloponesian War. While Victor Hanson does not approach these battles in terms of tactics and numbers, he does provide enough detatil of the battle so the reader will understand what happened and why this particular battle shaped the course of history. He does an excellent job of relating how battles of the past still influence American culture today. He also examines how the effects of these battles helped shape the reaction of the United States in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In this way, Victor Hanson brings a new and very intelligent prospective to the current debates of the War on Terror. By using the long lens of history, he presents an argument as to why the war has to be fought and won."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWAKEN THE MOVIE!","review":"My DVD box said the movie was in color, but mine was the color of of a washed out VHS movie.

The polyester filling feels like fiberglass and it clumps and forms ridges in the comforter. The bedskirt ... well, actually isn't all that bad, but be warned that it won't fit deep mattresses.That said, it's a comforter set.

The feel of the Microsuede is nice, and looks good. The only thing I would knock on this set is the thickness of the comforter. It is a little slim, so if you live where it gets fairly cold in the winter, you might want to look somewhere else, or plan on putting more padding in the bed for the winter. Other than that, an good set, and I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"limited luxury","review":"The comforter did not feel like true microsuede. It is okay for a sparecotton comforter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set!","review":"This is a very nice comforter set. Other reviews are correct in the material on the underside of the comforter is very thin. However, I have not had any issues with it. If you are using this comforter as a blanket only, you may have issues. For my use, this comforter is the 3rd layer on my bed, and it keeps me nice and warm when the sheets are not enough. The bed skirt is very luxurious and the colors of all the pieces match nicely. The microsuede has a nice feel to it, and it actually fits the bed. I have a small gap in the length which the shams cover, but the width has good coverage (I have a deeper mattress).

The quality is fabulous .. better than anything I have seen in bed and bath or department stores. The suede feel is very luxurious and substantial without being overly heavy. I got this camel set (as well as the paisley) and the color is very elegant and rich .. not too light or yellow looking. I bought this to layer with some other linens (such as a fabulous throw) to get a designer look on a budget. This camel set will do the trick no matter what color scheme you are using .. neutrals, cool or warm colors will all work with this so you can easily trade out other accessories with each season without spending a fortune to get a fresh look.(The paisley set is also very luxurious-looking .. very rich, warm and deep colors that give a Ralph Lauren look to the set.)I highly recommend this set if you are looking for something new and versatile for your bedroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product","review":"I love the bedspread.

I paid less than forty dollars, including shipping, and am thoroughly pleased with my purchase. The item was delivered in less than a week. For the price, it was much thicker than I had expected. The dust ruffle and pillow covers match perfectly. The part of the dust ruffle that goes under the mattress is of a better quality than typically found in lower price sets, and, it fit perfectly. The set has washed well with no color fading or \\"balling\\" of the stuffing. An elegant addition to my bedroom at a bargain price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick and soft","review":"Very thick and nice to touch.

It's quite a dark color, but it's very soft to the touch on top and seems plenty warm for spring/fall in CO.

The camel was a different manufacturer in different packaging, and is much \\"poofier\\" than the paisley. The camel has a heavier stitching in ivory, and the stitching on the paisley is fine and subtle. Both have nice dust ruffles, that are complimentary (the paisley dust ruffle is dark brown, the camel has a matching ruffle). I love the soft texture of the camel, and the paisley isn't as soft (but still looks nice). I have very high setting beds, so I had to customize the fit of the ruffle, but in a regular bed it would be perfect. I am glad I bought these! If I had more beds to cover, I'd buy more. I just might come back and get the brick color, just because..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ample!","review":"I ordered two of these microsuede comforters; one in green and the other in brown.

When people ask me why I like him, I say that he is a troubador of the 20th century and this album is a perfect overview of the best that he has to offer. From Come Monday, a classic JB lovesong, to a silly parody of the music industry \\"who can either go country or pop\\", this is the best. When my niece starting listening to him in the early 90's I bought her this album, and told her she could really not claim to be a fan, until she owned this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living&Dying in 3/4 Time","review":"A great album for someone who is interested in,or just finding out aboutJimmy Buffet.

There are few books that can capture the expressiveness, simplicity and magic that this book has. I disagree very much with the first reviewer. I'm a children's librarian and have shared this book with success with many children. It's a great opportunity for children to see picture books that offer a different perspective, technique (strong black outlined illustrations and odd color pallette), or story. Not all picture books need to be of lively color and busy illustration. This is a book that offers a child something different and very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can hear the music in this book.","review":"This beautifully illustrated book has a fun story pattern which makes it a great read aloud.

He has some drumsticks so he plays music. We loved his music the best! I think people should read this book because people get an idea to be in a band. We would too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This book clearly takes place in NYC, something my NYC nieces and I really enjoy - seeing Max's dad being a conductor on a train makes them laugh. Seeing the WTC in the background makes me smile and think. And of course the kids up and down the block where we live spend their life sitting on the stoop, just like Max does!The book makes great connections - each time somebody asks Max what he's doing, he plays the sound of something going on, and in the next panel he's using their bucket, or their hatbox, or their garbage cans to play his next rhythm.I strongly recommend this book to anyone, particularly anybody who is musically inclined.One note - the larger edition of this book is better. I got this edition because it was cheaper and in the bookstore, but the pictures end up a little scrunched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Max Found Two Sticks","review":"A boy named Max found two sticks and started to play drums on stuff like trash cans.

Anyone should read this book because it is a fun story to read. Lots of people should also read this book because it is exiting and surprising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Max found two sticks","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read it to my early childhod music students. They loved the book and listened intently to every word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing . . .","review":"A very confused telling of a familiar story, jarring modern slang, and distortion of historical facts. I have rarely been more disappointed in a book. I though I'd list it on Amazon and get rid of it (and get a portion of my purchase price back), but the depreciation on the price of the book is worse than a new car! Don't waste your time on this. I agree with some of the other critics - how the heck does a piece of junk like this get published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An appallingly bad book. . .","review":"If you love history and historical fiction, if you've been fascinated by Anne Bolyn or Henry VIII, if you love big, juicy period tales----please avoid this book at all costs! I, like many of the reviewers here,have long gobbled up everything I could about Anne, and even played her in Maxwell Anderson's wonderful drama, \\"Anne of the Thousand Days,\\" and this was a bloody awful attempt at a retelling of her story. I felt nothing for any of the characters---(how on earth can Henry and Anne be boring for heaven's sake!), got confused by the muddying of the sequence of events, and loathed her unaccountable use of modern slang which ruined any hope of getting a real sense of the era---she actually referred to Thomas Bolyn as \\"dad\\" in the book! I only finished it--scimmed it--out of a horrified disbelief that anything so unredeemingly bad could get published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even particularly interesting...","review":"To think I actually was looking forward to this book! It really is rather horrible. The language is too modern and just makes Anne Boleyn sound like some kind of mallrat...it's a shame that such an interesting historical character is treated in such a shabby manner.If you really want a good read about Anne Boleyn, try Phillipa Gregory's \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" a historically accurate and interesting account that rings true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Alright, But...","review":"I was thrilled to find that there would be a new novel about Anne Boleyn, and, I was a tad disappointed. Reading the sections for Anne Boleyn was a tedious chore, and I had to drag myself through the,. The Lucy Cornwallis parts were okay, but they were also a little slow. As most novels, they portray Anne as a shrill woman who bashed around 'poor' Henry. What annoyed me was the unnecessary use of cussing going on...it was as if I was reading a note written by an 9th grader! What was also annoying were the historical inaccuracies, but if you might notice at the end of the book there are explanations, which cooled me down.Definitely one to miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"a silly waste of time","review":"I could not even go past page 100 - I never quit a book. But, the vernacular described by other reviews is accurate - stupid, out of place and never allows you to feel part of the time. I am fascinated by Anne Boleyn and the other wives but I had to put this book down as a waste of time. The newspaper will probably prove more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"An entertaining read,but...","review":"While this book was an interesting read, and reasonably accurate as far as the events go, I found it a bit dissapointing in other ways. The chapters about Lucy are the best part of the book; it's a very accurate depiction of the average commoner's view of Anne Boleyn, and the whole divorce situation.The chapters concerning Anne are much less effective. This is yet another book where Anne is the calculating shrew, and Henry is the poor henpecked fool in love with her. Like a lot of books written about Anne, the portrayal of Anne (and Henry) is very one-sided; Anne is bad, Henry is good.That being said, I would have liked this book much more if not for its rather jarring use of modern day language. I found it very distracting and really kind of annoying. It's not that I was expecting the author to use historically accurate phrasing or anything, but it's really ridiculous to have Anne greeting a courtier with the phrase, \\"What's up?\\" It's just irritating after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst!","review":"This is the most boring book I've read on Anne Boleyn. The language used in the book is too modern, not in context at all - when did this happen, in the 80s? Sure seems like it from the prose. Too random and needs an editor. Frances's? What the hell. Blah, Allison Weir and Jean Plaidy bring the true Anne to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't realize Anne was a teenage girl from Jersey!","review":"As a big fan of the Tudor period, I was excited at the idea of a new book about Anne Boleyn. After reading a few pages, I noticed a modern slang term. Initially, I thought it was an editing error. Then, I read another, then another. Finally, when I read about Francis \\"Franky\\" Norris, I knew I was finished with this book. Modern verbage in the mouth of a 1500's heroine just does not fit and distracts the reader's attention from the story. I cannot imagine how this book got published and I was happy that I got my copy from the library. Absolutely awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be less than subtle: it's bad.","review":"Poorly written, poorly edited (too many typos!!), and full of modern-day phrasing. Nothing fresh or new in this tale, and numerous other writers have managed that quite well, so I'd also guess that this book was not deeply researched. It pains me to think that someone so ill-qualified can be paid for such poor work. Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"utterly disappointed","review":"I agree with most of the other reviews on this book. I love everything about Tudor history, especially the history of Anne Boleyn and her daughter, Elizabeth. I have read many other books about Anne Boleyn, but this one made me put it down after only 10 pages. I could not get over the use of language in this book. It was as if I were listening to a modern day sorority girl. I was completely turned off by the way Anne, who is probably one of my favorite women in history, was portrayed. I even picked up another Anne Boleyn book and read some of it after reading Sarah Dunn's to clear my head of her writing. I have not been so disappointed in a book in my life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Werst Hiztorick Book n Hiztorie","review":"There were many typos in this book, and there were quite a few \\"modern day\\" phrases, I love reading and learning about the Tudor Dynasty, however the many errors in this book detract and distract from Anne's story."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!

Anne came across as such a conniving, self-centered shrew that by the end you were glad her head was chopped off.

This is contemporary example of what you see at 'mens clubs' currently. Nice pro tips and approach for a beginner but if you are looking for actual GO GO, you will want more burlesque moves which this does not have. I guess it would also work if you want to impress your boyfriend but not appropriate for regular club dancing unless you want a lot of unwelcome attention.

I like to have a soup going just about everyday and this book has so many different kinds. It's my go-to book for soup. The recipes may seem like they call for a lot of ingredients, but don't be overwhelmed by that. Just find the few soups that you want to make over and over again and stock up on those spices and herbs. I'm fortunate to have a store nearby that sells in bulk, so I can buy small or large quantities versus having to buy a whole bottle. And sometimes I don't use a spice in the ingredients. For tonight's soup, I did not spend $9.00 on the little bottle of saffron threads. I'm sure it will slightly change the flavor of my soup but so what? I'm picky about what I'm willing to spend money on. I have found all of the instructions correct and easy to follow.

Unfortunately, a seventeen page introduction, with numerous literary references, is NOT accompanied by either a bibliography or footnotes. This is a serious omission.

There are no doubt simpler accounts around, but this repays careful reading and will take many students far beyond an elementary introduction. So far I've only covered the material on the pre-Socratics, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, but these really are the foundational thinkers for western philosophy. Copleston's own Thomist sympathies are clear but are not thrust upon the reader. Having these three volumes in one makes for a bulky book but the serious student of the hisotry of this discipline will readily see the advantages of tracing through the fundamental ideas of classical Greek philosophy in late antiquity and the Middle Ages (including the impact on Islamic thought)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Heroes Of Telemark","review":"This great movie is spoiled by this terrible disk.The quality of the video and audio is the worst I have ever viewed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have not as yet received a replacement for the defective one.","review":"The DVD had a visible defect on the side that has the image.

I was made aware of this story by a reference in Gen. Leslie Grove's \\"Now It Can Be Told\\" and again by Richard Rhode's \\"Making of the Atomic Bomb\\". The sheer heroism and sacrifice by Norwegians and British alike in protecting to the best of their ability the innocent civilians of Norway while destroying one of Nazi Germany's treasured resources is something that needs to be taught to every history class.

This copy has been cut to ribbons and offered to you at a lousy \\"full\\" screen of 1.33:1. Full screen, my aching arse. This is just an advertising ploy to dupe the consumer.

The first hand accounts of the authors' experiences with Ebola, Lassa and other viruses were interesting, but difficult to follow as they skipped back and forth in time and, in some cases, between each of the two author's perspectives. My overall impression was that the book needed a good editor. For those who are interested in the topic, I agree with others' recommendations to read The Coming Plague by Laurie Garrett. It's very long, but very readable, and offers a much more coherent reporting of many of the events discussed by McCormick and Fisher-Hoch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for scientists and non-scientists alike","review":"I just finished reading Virus Hunters and I was very impressed. The book is written in a very scientific fashion, but is not overloaded with science at the same time. I liked how the authors took the time to explain the procedures they used in their work. Especially interesting were the ways the authors had to improvise their work in Africa, it makes you realize just how much western scientists take for granted in our nice clean constantly powered labs.The book is more than interesting science, it also tells a great story, or several great stories. The book is essentially made up of the two authors' accounts of the different events in their long careers.

This documentary only revisits the old myths of the battle; From the Aleutian attack being a diversion, to the failure of Tone's No. 4 scout being the reason the American fleet was not discovered in time. Other myths, including the Japanese Carrier decks being loaded with planes at the time of the 10:20am attack, Akagi being hit 3 times, the American fleet being grossly outnumbered in the battle, even the purpose of the battle (as a jump-off point to invade Hawaii), are included in this typically inaccurate rehash.I really hope that a new documentary would be produced with the these fallacies corrected once and for all.

First, while the magnet is strong enough to hold to a hub, there is essentially nothing to attach it to on most cars because a front wheel drive axle protrudes beyond the hub and the axle diameter is too small for the magnet to be solidly attached to. Second, there is a little wingnut that is supposed to \\"lock\\" your measurement in place, but anything stronger that a mild breeze will overcome the resistance provided and render your measurement useless, thereby rendering the whole purchase useless.

Since the famous traders are hesitant to describe their best-performing systems, Krutsinger is left to scrounge for formal systems based on their vague answers. Krutsinger does test each system, although I found the results of almost all of them to be disappointing. For example, most systems averaged less than $7000 / yr, not including commissions.

It's too bad they broke up after releasing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Europe's finest effort","review":"I believe this was Europe's 3rd cd and what a fine cd it was. You won't find the bombastic pop/metal that were the first two albums but this is very melodic and listenable material. There aren't any big hits on this like THE FINAL COUNTDOWN and OUT OF THIS WORLD but every single song's a winner on this release. Unlike the previous two albums, you won't be programming your favorite four or five songs but listening to it all the way through. A VERY SATISFYING LISTEN. ENJOY!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Release","review":"I have never cared for this album from Europe. If you're expecting an album in the style of The Final Countdown, don't look here. I still wish that I hadn't bothered buying this CD a few years ago. Joey Tempest's vocal style is nothing like it was on past albums. That's disappointing since he had a great vocal style. The songs on this album are in a rougher vein and just don't shine. The only songs that are okay are \\"Girl From Lebanon\\" and \\"Prisoners in Paradise.\\" Skip this album and listen to The Final Countdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"They still rocked!","review":"Prisoners in Paradise is one of my favorite songs by Europe and this album by Europe which only has the album version. They still rock after debut album, they have not changed in style. This is my new favorite Europe album behind all their others. The linear notes provide all the lyrics plus thanks and a funny WARNING note! I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Europe, hair metal bands or 80's rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Total junk less than VHS quality.

This movie stinks! I am a huge Belushi fan and I like Chiklis in The Shield, but watching this movie just made me feel sorry for both of them. It has a rotten plot, premise and script. Please, for the love of humanity, stay away from this movie. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wired is a hunk of garbage.","review":"This is the kind of movie where after watching it, you want to demand your two hours back. For those of you who don't feel like wasting your time, here's a summary of the film: John Belushi dies of a drug overdose and then magically wakes up right before his autopsy. With the help of his sidekick guardian angel named (get this..)ANGEL, he re-lives points in his wild life, eventually realizing the error of his ways. Sound like a Charles Dickens story? Almost. The only difference is, he never comes back to life. Don't waste your money on this horrible excuse for a film. If you want to see how crazy John Belushi's life was, read the book the movie was based on (also titled Wired) or just watch one or two episodes from the early days of SNL. This movie covers absolutely NO new ground regarding Belushi's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obscene","review":"I was one of the unfortunate people who actually saw this movie in a theatre (me and three others: two walked out and the other would have but I was his ride).I'd read the book a couple of times and was impressed with its lean reportage and strict adherence to facts.Then I saw this movie....It's bad enough to go through the harrowing final days of Belushi in the book, but the movie takes it one disturbing step further: John didn't just die, he went to hell.Was this some producer's revenge for John denying the industry future profits for movies he wouldn't be around to make anymore? \\"Hey, Belushi's crowd is a wild-and-crazy audience, so let's make his tragic death a wild-and-crazy movie!\\"I'm glad this movie tanked.Chiklis does such a wonderful job of playing Belushi, but--for anyone who even remotely liked Belushi--this movie is infuriating and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if this movie were better, it would still be awful","review":"As others have mentioned, if this movie had been filmed in the book's style (worth reading, by the way), it could have been terrific. Instead, they messed up the movie with some really dumb fiction that ruins everything else. The movie starts out with John Belushi's body being wheeled into the morgue, and his ghost gets up off the table and does the whole \\"looking back on my life\\" bit. This is annoyingly unbearable! Even the most diehard Belushi fan will find this to be a frustrating waste of time. I was incredibly disappointed. Most definitely this is a \\"walk out\\" movie where most people would prefer to be doing anything but watching it!

It is not an exhaustive listing of every model the company ever produced. Nevertheless it gives a pretty good background of what one is looking at.

It is to-the-second accurate according to my atomic wall clocks and gets a signal update about every other night here in central Virginia. I put it on a bookcase next to my bed, don't need to stick it in a windowledge. This watch is a bit hard to read in bright light. The dial and numerals are polished and put off a lot of glare, but I have unconsciously learned not to look at it straight on, but from a slight angle and that solves the problem.

For instance, \\"How to Crash-land a Plane on Water\\" says \\"...remove the pilot from the pilot's seat.\\" Just that one step will be very difficult to do with an unconscious person in a small airplane, and many of the remaining instructions are equally trivialized or irrelevant.Maybe some of the scenarios and instructions are supposed to be funny, but the book was neither humorous or informative.

They also recommend that you wave for help when stuck inside the trunk of a car, so there you go.If you are looking for humor, I recommend it.

One of my favorite things that Madeleine is known for saying is how we should be able to be 10, 20, 35,58, and so on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Sequel to \\"The Moon by Night\\"","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed both of the previous Austin family books and looked forward to this one as being similiar. This was a very good L'Engle book, but reminded me more of \\"The Arm of the Starfish\\" than the Austin series. Nonetheless, it was a very enjoyable read.An intriguing mystery, new characters, and more of a look at Rob and Suzy than the usual focus on Vicky. It was nice to see Canon Tallis again. I liked the way Ms. L'Engle weaves in spiritual truths: we are truly free only in obedience/submission to God.I'm looking forward to the rest of the Austin series, and I hope Emily and Dave make a cameo or at least have a mention in the next books. I also want to note that one should definitely read \\"The Arm of the Starfish\\" before they read this novel. Though different series, they connect and \\"Starfish\\" will be spoiled unless you read it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"1. Doesn't fit well - looks cheap.2.

Spend a few extra dollars and buy a model with removable griddles. Toastmaster waffle irons are hard to clean. If you put in too much batter or the iron overflows on the side, you'll have a long project ahead of you to clean it. Chunks of batter get stuck inside the iron and you may find yourself taking the whole thing apart to attempt to clean it. I put my Toastmaster waffle iron where it belongs - in the garbage - and bought a much better model from a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one","review":"I bought this in Feb 2005 for $7.50 at Target, and the lights went out 6 months later.

The only problem I've found so far is that if you put a half-cup of batter in each side like it says, batter leaks out the sides and back, and that's very hard to clean. I tired using a little over a quarter-cup of batter in each side instead, and that seemed to be better. Overall, it's a good little cooker if you don't plan on making waffles very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"heavy waffles","review":"I bought this to replace an older model which worked well for ten years. I was shocked to find that the cooking surface area had been reduced by 74% !! This was done by reducing the size of the teeth from approx. 10 mm x 10 mm to 6 mm x 6 mm. This results in slower cooking (it took 10 minutes to get one set of two baked ... it used to take 3 min) ) and a heavier, less enjoyable waffle.

He attaches the ideologies of his life with the components of the wave. There is not enough depth to the story. The story fractures into too many different ideas that do not connect fluidly.

The description of his fright and obsession with these two dreams is written vividly and has a feeling of psychological realness.

Seriously? I understand that the author was trying to show that Emily found sex with him to be comforting, but there's a difference between comfort and apathy. Emily just seems like she's not into it at all, and he basically puts her to sleep! If I was Ashley I'd be seriously disappointed in myself as a man. On the plus side, I found myself enjoying Luke and Anna a lot, so now I'm going to go read \\"Heartless\\", since I came into this series backwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jena","review":"One big detail that I could not get past in order to enjoy this book: how does someone who has been deaf for almost all her life learn to read lips? How would she know what words meant? The author even states that Emily has \\"no conscious memory of sound,\\" since she went deaf when she was three years old. A hearing three- or four-year-old can learn words, slang, contractions, nicknames, euphemisms, and abstract ideas as she grows. But someone who can't hear muffled sounds, inflectios, sarcasm, etc., would find it impossible to know what random mouth movements mean. I couldn't get past that to believe that Emily was able to read lips flawlessly (as another reviewer noted) in almost every situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The acting, production value, and entire movie is just awful.

The history may be useful to anybody, likely a recent MBA, getting into the consulting field. You get to see how the different top consulting firms were differentiated in their business, their culture and the way they treated their personnel.Even though things have changed a great deal since this book was published, there are basic principles that are unlikely to change. The way that the firms recruit might not be that much different. The basic organization of the firms, where the new hire must put in incredible hours to feed the structure above that earned their place by being there longer has not changed. This is a very good historical book."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth reading","review":"A little basic, but a useful look at basic stats of the leading consulting firms.

Only one chapter is dedicated to the Philadelphia Experiment. The Montauk Project experiment is referred to continuously throughout the book.The majority of the book talks about and to the 'few' people that were involved at a very 'high' level of security on the top secret government projects - bases created underground so the government could work jointly with aliens."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book....surprisingly","review":"When I first picked this book up, I was under the impression that it would have a lot of the incredible claims that Peter Moon's Montauk series has. Instead, I found the book to be very well written and (surpisingly) researched. The book is not necessarily about the Philadelphia Experiment, but about a death attributed to a cover-up. Bruce writes well and manages to keep a story interesting. Her opinions are clearly kept separated from the facts. They are some sections that were written by Peter Moon that prove to be of interests as well. I also like they way he expressed the theories. I recommend this book for good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"very good book","review":"This book is very well written; the author extensively covers related areas of research in a fairly neutral and professional way.

Not to be confused with what passes for the same these days, rock and roll was at the crest of a tidal wave of social experimentation that for better or for worse shoved the culture of the young into prominence and re-made America from the inside out. Pamela Des Barres defies all preconceived notions in this memoir of her years as friend/lover/muse and so much else to some of the biggest names in late-twentieth-century music. Surprisingly discreet as well as good-natured, Des Barres gives her reader the ultimate backstage pass with stories of Jim Morrison, Mick Jagger, Led Zeppelin, Frank Zappa, and even the titular King of Rock and Roll, himself! This is a one of a kind sort of book, and it's a heck of a fun read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish it had been me!","review":"Great read, though she is a bit of a name dropper.

It's the voice of a sugary little Sandra Dee doll who trades her white nightie for mini skirts and platform shoes while she's looking for true love - and mistaking everything that isn't for what she thinks is. I enjoyed the epilogues more because they had more substance and maturity, and weren't so teen-agey in their tone.The book is almost entirely composed of sentences such as:\\"I was so relieved and so happy when we finished the album\\"\\"The girls and I spent a lot of time making lists of all the gorgeous boys we wouldn't kick out of bed.\\"\\"Donnie bought me exquisite little trinkets of love.\\"\\"I had an insance crush on Darryl.\\"I finished it, but I could as easily have put it down mid-way through and not felt as if I missed anything.

There are no details at all about sex with any of them, just names and how nice everyone is. Too sweet and neat to be factual. You would think they were all wonderful people who were good to everyone and knocked themselves out to be great to Pamela.

If you want someone gushing over every icon she ever met, then this is the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm with the band - book review","review":"I was disappointed with this book by Pamela Des Barres.

Basically all you learn about people like Mick Jagger and Keith Moon is that they had sex with the author of the book.The tone of \\"I'm with The Band\\" zigzaggs wildly between extreme infatuation and intense lonliness with nothing in between. After a few chapter you begin to realize that the entire book follows this formula:1) The author falls head-over-heels in love with some celebrity.2) They have idealized sex.3) The author gets lonely.4) The author meets another celebrity.Lather, wrinse, and repeat..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"Just a lot of mindless fluff I was expecting not just dirt but some behind the scenes look at a lot of rock royalty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Poorly Written","review":"Honestly, I haven't managed to muddle all the way through this book because everytime I start it gets too boring to finish.

I wouldn't recommend this book to my dog even if he could read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature juvenile writing style","review":"This was as if reading a grade school account of a person with no self esteem. The sentence construction throughout the book was highly immature. Incomplete thoughts, non-sequitors, etc. The drug abuse took quite a toll on the author. She has been seen rolling on the floor at the Whiskey A-Go-Go distraught and in tears over another \\"star\\" walking out on her. In her later book she tells of her son's later abuse and bullying in school over her notoriety. In the inside sleeve of Permanent Damage she thanks Jesus.

If you get this, be gentle with the handles incase you have one with weak or defective handles like mine. I might still keep it, just because the handles aren't essential, but I'm getting upset thinking the legs might break off too.Pros: Stainless steel, handles and feet, looks durable, easier to clean holes than some others, since holes are large and few.Cons: Handles are soldered/welded on weakly and break off easily, holes are too large to use as a strainer (my old one had MANY small holes)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This book is wonderful.

The rest of it is the same as any other good style guide, but the parts devoted to nuances of creative fiction and topics of interest to writers of today are worth the price of the book.

So I bought this book to enlarge my views and my culture...and a whole new world opened to me! chickens laying brown, blue or almost black eggs... black chickens... enormous breeds... fighting chickens, upright and severe... dozens and dozens of nice looking, historical european, american and asian breeds... bantams...The book is very well organized, featuring a lot of very nice pictures and interesting accompanying text on chickens social behaviour and other technical details on coloring (that I sometimes found a bit boring) and posture. It's maybe not really an ENCYCLOPEDIA, but it actually is a superb introduction to chicken breeds for a chicken enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"not complete","review":"Title is very misleading. This book while informative and a good source is far from complete. It covers most topics incompletely.

It is very informative, but certainly not complete. It does cover the basics & does offer detail but not in depth. It's a hard cover book with full color glossy pages. The photos are very good & it is a very attractive book to have. It will not answer all you questions regarding chickens though. You will need to purchase another book for that. Storey's guide to Chickens is very good.

When you finally sucessfully install it, you'll find this item takes way too much space than what it's worth. In the space you fit 1 pant holder, you can fit 2 x 26\\" shelves. If you fold the pants, you can put a lot more. If you use a pants cloth hanger, it'll hold a lot more than 7 pairs in that area.3.

The author mentions that this is an essential aspect of modelling, which it is, but gives very little instruction and drops you into a nearly impossible spline modelling tutorial.

Louis CK should be ashamed of this effort. His delivery is poor, he adds excessive expletives to his feeble stories in an attempt to shock(?) and he simply fails to 'connect the dots' between his attempted humor and his audience. This DVD is a waste of money and I'm surprised that some people rated it 5 out of 5... it's simply not that funny.

I feel that he's trying too hard to shock the audience by saying things that we find \\"socially unacceptable/questionable\\" (some of them and to certain degree) but the fact is, his joke's are more thought-provoking than funny.

Two kids who still had a roof over their heads and food to eat during that time period had it good, and would not be so foolish as to run away, even if they didn't like the way their father acted sometimes. It's not just that though. Josh and Joey ran into too much good luck. It seemed that every time they were hungry or in need of a job, something would happen and they would get what they needed.

Students will really get an understanding of the devistation the Depression had on people of all ages as they read of the experience these two young boys encountered. Hunt's portrayal of the characters makes the reader feel as if he/she really knows the boys. The reader will begin to feel the characters diappointments and joys as they travel across the United States searching for work. Trust, forgiveness, family, and perseverance are themes that occur throughout the book. These, and the many other themes which occur throughout the book can provide a great basis for discussion in the classroom. This is a book that both boys and girls will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slow Moving, Boring Book","review":"No Promises In The Wind contained no promises for an extravagent ending.

I'm not entirely sure why, but reading it was a chore for me, and it's VERY rare that reading anything is a bore to me.

It just seemed hollow to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a poorly written book","review":"This book was horrible. The writing style of the author was not captivating and it left much to be desired. The characters could not be related to and seemed more like figments of the imagination.

Furthermore, I would not recommend this book to anyone, and would strongly suggest you never read this atrocious literary work."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the boringest books ever","review":"I have to read this book for school. The two kids always have a magical stroke of luck that gets them through the depression. The boys run away only because there father has a some-what of a bad attidute.

Actually, don't even read it if you are forced to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"This book is amazing. The book may look disturbing but it is great. This is coming from a 12 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked \\"Scandalous\\" better","review":"\\"Irresistable\\", the second book in the Banning Sisters trilogy (note: Hey Karen Robards, where's Beth's book?), is a good read, but not as memorable as Scandalous. I am writting this review awhile after reading the book, and frankly, I don't feel like picking it up again and reading it. It was good, but it wasn't fantastic.Clare, the prettiest Banning sister, seems to have kind of a bum rap in this book. She's married to a fink who doesn't really love her, she goes through heck and high water by being kidnapped and such, but in the end ends up with Hugh, a good handsome man.I didn't think there was that much chemistry between the two leads here. Anyone who read \\"Scandalous\\" with mousy-looking, fire tounged Gabby, and cool, rakish Nick, and is looking for more of the same, will be a bit disappointed.Again, good book, but not really great."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Help But Fall In Love with These Heroes","review":"This was a great read from beginning to end, although a bit predictable. The story had much suspense and drama. The heroine is not my favorite as she was a bit immature and lacked good sense in picking her first husband; you would think she would've been more sound minded when choosing her spouse after having experienced such horrid events at her father's hand, as well with his less than low life friends. The hero had everything and lacked nothing; he had personality, charm, good looks, wealth but most importantly, a good heart.The author includes text from the next book (Shameless) in the series, and it appears to be just as riveting as the prior two books. However, in my opinion from having read both Scandalous and Irresistible back to back, Scandalous proves to be a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"This book was much to long in the narrative. There was virtually no dialogue and I didn't read the prior book, but I never felt any of Claires pain from her past.There were moments of hope and I think the plot was good, but it was written with no excitement or feeling.If I read about \\"Intimate Congress\\" one more time, I was going to rip the pages out.

Don't waste your time, or money, on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"very shallow","review":"I read a large part of the book and then gave up in disgust. Claire is kidnapped and mistreated by Hugh and all she can do is constantly drool over his body. He thinks she is a spy and a slut and he is constantly having a hard time focusing on anything but her body. If you are into sleezy romances and like the \\"pirate\\" keeps the girl captive thing and they don't know anything except how sexy each other body's look, then I guess this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long Winded","review":"I love Karen Robards so when I saw this book I grabbed it quick! But from the moment I started reading I knew this was not one of her better writings. It would take almost 3 pages for someone to say something or for the action to happen. She overly explained things that were not important and wasted time. Robards' previous writings can get exaustive sometimes, but this was the worse. I skimmed over pages until I saw dialogue. And how many times did Claire describe Hugh's \\"broad shoulders\\". If I heard that one more time I was going to scream! The only reason I endured the book was to find out who was trying to kill Claire and why and even some of that was muddled.

The sex scenes are not interesting and not as hot as in other book. But the thing that trashes this book totally is the main female character. I can't understand her motives. She's cruel bitch. I can't imagine David can forgive her and still loves her as much. I also can't believe she hurt David and Sato badly and still be happy, she doesn't have to do anything to redeem herself. She at least should have done something to show that she's extremely sorry and will never repeat her mistake. Drinnking sake is not exactly something to repair all the hurt she gave David and Sato.In conclusion, try Emma Holly but skip this book.

So this is a good deal at $4/pair.More importantly, they are heavy-weight cotton with no underside seam. They have elastic all around the opening and actually stay on your feet. They are cut generously -- My feet are about size 8 and they are a little big, but manageable. If you have smaller feet I'd try to get a different size than M/L. They do ride a bit higher on the foot than some of the others -- they are fine with loafers, but a lower cut shoe could be problematic.I've tried a lot of these socks: Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Peds, Leggs, et al.

It may have been more believable to its audience.This colorful version, whose everyday background contrasts with the original film, lacks the same credibility. While university professors may kill (Eichorn, Kaczynski), it is too much of a fantasy in this fictional example.

Not true, it was partly done in San Marcos, Texas, and there was a scene involving that cylindrical bricked building surrounded by a moat. That building is part of Texas State University (formerly Southwest Texas State University). I thought the makers could have filmed more of San Marcos, especially the river. Oh well, back to the film. It just sucked. Meg Ryan proved, again and again, that she can't act. The story was ridiculous. Dennis Quaid could have found a better film to work on. Daniel Stern's presence (or rather the absence) gave the film away for me, and I knew it was going to happen that way because that was probably the only plausible logic possible. Perhaps there was a power struggle between the two directors, resulting in a very chaotic film. All in all, D.O.A. is certainly Dead on Arrival for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned item","review":"The DVD was returned because it was for viewing in a different region (wrong country code) couldn't view DVD. Waiting for the refund on my credit card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"Given that this is dated, watching it from a 2012 perspective, it starts out like a pretty intriguing film. However, what really lets it down, is the un-believeability of human reactions the characters display. It ruins it. For example, the main protagonist has been poisoned, and is dying, yet he's full of energy, fight, glib remarks and BS. Doesn't ring true. The girl - Meg Ryan - is kidnapped, glued to Quaid, dragged out in a nightdress, shot at with a nailgun, and her reaction is little more than a girl who has broken her nail. Doesn't ring true. Emotion in movies has come a long way since the 80s, but even then movies were done better. If you find the idea of a young Meg Ryan showing a bit of shoulder attractive, you may find something other than the plot to be interested in. I didn't find either worth the time. Cheesy movie - watch something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"TITLE SUGGESTS ALL","review":"This is a remake of an old black and white film about a poisoned man who learns he has so many hours to live.

The story is so fast paced it undermines itself, too many plot lines, (Colin's emotionally explosive, judgemental, barbaric, but meditates and does Tai Chi? AND saves her in full ninja style? In SCOTLAND in the 1800's?) Please! Too much bantering, too heady, his/her love for one another just does not come across with any depth (except for the marriage). Just overkill on all accounts -Verra, verra, disappointing.Check out Susan Carroll's \\"The Dark Queen\\" trilogy for a more satisfying read.Comment to Jackie Ivie: Please slow down and write with more depth - you obviously have the talent for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"I WAITED ANXIOUSLY FOR THIS BOOK AND AM TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED.

I took the pitcher out of the box and rinsed it off so that we could use it for Christmas dinner. While I was washing the pitcher the red on the handle and around the bottom of the pitcher started to flake off in my hand. Pretty soon the pitcher no longer had any red left. The berries washed off and the bottom edge and the handle only had red residue. I also bought the water glasses at the same time and while my guests were drinking out of them the berries started to come off the glasses because of the condensation forming on the outside of the glass. I did not have this problem with the glasses that I bought at Macy's last year for the same price. I am very disappointed with the product and will not be buying again from this vendor. I will stick with Macy's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint washes off","review":"Upon first washing, the paint around the bottom peeled off in a long strip.

This is why I tried to order it online. The product I received was in a damaged box first off.

It does not even include the title story \\"Gifts of the Child Christ\\". This was apparently OCRed off an old book, and there are many typos. There is not even a single line between stories and story & play, and there are no headers or footers, so it is difficult to find where they begin. The Table of Contents does not list the individual works, but only \\"Part One\\" & \\"Part Two\\". Part Two begins in the middle of a scene in the play, and is an entirely useless division.

In a single word: No. And to those who regard the book with humor, and consider it a survival book from hell: You won't find the book interesting, either.And why is that? It is obvious that the book is too superficial to provide any substantial help for the true survivalist. One cannot expect to tackle such serious situations as the ones described in the book by using the overly simplistic and generalized advice the book provides. If that's what you're looking for, then there are plenty of other books that do guide you through these situations well enough.And as for the book being funny to read: It is simply too short to achieve that. It also lacks focus and covers too many subjects, most of which are not the esoteric material that makes for a good joke.I therefore suggest you look for your handbooks elsewhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"What isn't common sense in this guide needs to be relagated to the \\"maringinally interesting but useless\\" category.

How often will you wander around with your epee at the ready waiting to be attacked so you can parry and thrust?

In this thin (!) book, the authors Piven and Borgenicht tell you in a straightforward manner what to do in certain life-and-death situations. The authors add no humor or life to their topic.

And some is obvious (If killer bees attack you, run). But it's all compelling and clearly presented. Once I started reading, I found myself thinking that I \\"ought\\" to know this stuff.

As bitterly disappointing as an earplug can be, that is. Yes, they are soft and can conform to the interior of your ear, but all they do is muffle sound; in no way did they drown out the annoying cacophony of my neighbor who likes to start his parties at one in the morning. Perhaps they are better for higher-pitched sounds that don't have much bass in them, but they didn't save me any sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"blocked NO noise.","review":"My wife swears she can hear just as well with them in.They do gum up and must be thrown away quickly, so if you use them a lot, you would consider the cost of needing new ones every 1-2 nights.The good news is you wont need them a lot, because they don't BLOCK NOISE. These mold to your ears, I think they would work for swimming."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to mold into the right shape","review":"This is not a good earplug compared to the \\"foamy\\" ones. The noise reduction is only 22dB as indicated on the product label as compared to like 32dB by the other types and that only if you stick it correctly to the ear canal.

The noise reduction is outstanding for the first couple of nights. They have none of the comfort problems sometimes experienced with foam plugs (if, like me, you change position a hundred times a night this is important). Ultimately though, they are disposable and they never work quite as well after the second night or so. They tend to pick up lint up and lose their stick. So you can either replace them every 2-3 nights (which seems wasteful), or else you can learn to live with the slightly reduced effectiveness (they still work - but you don't get the dead silence of a fresh pair) until eventually they fall out during the night (for me, after about 6 or 7 days). Altogether a great product, though. If only there was something this comfortable which could be used long-term without any loss of performance...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I have been a long time Mack's earplug user, love the little blue/green foam plugs. I tried this kind because the store that I usually bought the other kind from quit carrying them. I figured that since I liked the other kind in this same brand that I would most likely like these as well...not so much. I ended up just using these for five nights. Every single night, one or both would fall out of my ear(s). I cleaned my hands before putting them in and I cleaned my ears, it didn't make a bit of difference.

I cannot insert plugs in my ear canal without them getting irritated and itchy after a few hours. I didn't give these 5 stars because they are not as good as Hearos as far as blocking out sounds go. However, my ears don't get irritated, I slept well, and the plugs last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides great sound muffling and comfort","review":"I found these work great to significantly muffle the sound of my husband snoring, the dog barking, and all the others things that used to keep me awake. Nothing on the market totally blocks ALL sound (I've tried them all!) but these mute them to an acceptable level providing you make sure you get a good seal. Try humming while you put them in and you can easily tell the difference between a total seal or not. Unlike other plugs they are very comfortable to wear during sleep. I only get two or three nights use out of each pair, but after years of little to no sleep I will gladly purchase all I need to of these to get some much needed rest! I purchased a two pair sample pack at my local pharmacy and now have a handy little travel container to put a couple of pair in when I travel. They work great for my children also when we are traveling and they have to sleep in a hotel room with their dad snoring in the next bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for swimming","review":"The ear plugs work great for swimming.

With all the effort involved, it's easier just to avoid the water without using these earplugs. Also, between softening them and molding them in your ears and then removing them without pulling your hair out, it takes at least twice as long to take a shower.If you're looking for earplugs to keep water out of your ears (for ear infections, etc.), keep looking!I would give them zero stars if I could. I tried several times, and they simply are not water tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I'd hoped","review":"I was impressed by the reviews for this product, but I have been very disappointed. The earplugs block barely any noise at all--with them in I can still hear people talking on the street (and I live on the third floor), my roommate closing a dresser drawer, and other small noises of the type that should be completely blocked out. I cannot imagine them working at all for louder noises like snoring. The only reason I gave them two stars is that they do block the high pitched hum of the fridge. And, there is no danger of oversleeping when wearing these earplugs--you'll definitely hear your alarm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable","review":"Should be called ear sealants instead of earplugs. Noise reduction not the strongest, but satisfactory.

That they were. The plugs did a great job blocking sound and are also a smart idea for blocking water in a pool when swimming, another reason I picked them up. While I wouldn't say that they can NEVER be worn safely, I would NOT suggest using them as a sleeping aid.I put them on the first night for the initial reason I purchased them; to block out the incessant barking coming from the next-door neighbor's full-sized standard poodle. The poodle did not wake me up that night. However the earplugs did, or rather the pain they were causing. The earplugs created a vacuum in my ear canal, causing a painful suction. This perpetuated an ear ache that lasted 2 full weeks. Whether it did irreparable harm to my hearing is yet to be seen but needless to say I won't be using them again.If you do buy them, please use them with care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, see - but not good enough.","review":"As with one of the other reviewers, my significant other snores like a tank. These bad boys are okay - not sticky enough to get a good seal - but if you combine them with a used foam earplug, they work well enough.

I recently discovered Physician's Choice Silicone Ear Putty and wow, what a difference. Mack's will do in a pinch and they block out noise just fine. But, as one reviewer noted, they tend to fall out unless you put pressure on them and practically push them in your ear canal AND they are only reusable for about 2 nights. I haven't had either of these problems with PC Ear Putty so I am making the switch permanently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor design of hearing protection","review":"Mack's Pillow Soft Silicone ear plugs are strange in design and a mess to use. The plugs are a sticky lump of silicone that is inserted into the outer ear - not the ear canal.

In the beginning, I used mack's pillow soft ear plugs, but then after 3 days, it would start leaking water into my ear. So I switched to mack's aquablock ear plug, still does't fit, water leaks in. Then I tried arena ergo, I figure since it's the most expensive swimming earplug on amazon, it must worth a try. It turns out hurts my ear, I couldn't even fit it in. $16 down the drain.

With just the right balance of momentum and energy, Monkman's playing allows the music to really take shape and emerge. The CD includes some excellent and varied renaissance and baroque works: a Pavan and Galliard by Byrd, two of Scarlatti's later sonatas and suites by Chambonnieres, D'Angelbert and Handel. The pieces on this CD are rendered with clarity, warmth and fluidity, a rare achievement for a solo harpsichord recording. Very highly recommended.As a side note, fans of Monkman's work with Sky will be interested to know that Rameau's \\"Gavotte and Variations,\\" a highlight of the \\"Sky 2\\" album, was inspired by Handel's \\"Air (with 5 variations),\\" from the Suite in D minor presented here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I own a signed copy of the book - Dr. Clifford B. \\"Bill\\" Casey was my great-uncle (PhD History, The University of Texas, taught at Sul Ross State University.)

Also, as has been mentioned before, the quality of workmanship that I have grown to expect from Leatherman products just isn't there. Another thing is. I DON'T LIKE the little notches at the ends of the blades meant for opening. If your nails are too short or too brittle, they will break before ever moving the blades.

When I checked Amazon's site, Poor Fish is now selling the EXACT knife for $100! Not sure why the increase, but none the less, Poor Fish should honor the original price. I now have to scramble, last minute for another gift. Thanks, Poor Fish!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped:(","review":"I got this knife based on the great reviews it had received. I'm not sure if OXO changed the knife, but it is not as great as people claim! The knife is ridiculously dull! It ruins the lettuce as it poorly attempts to cut it. I actually think it makes my lettuce browner than before just because it doesn't make a clean cut. I would honestly recommend trying a different one, I'm not sure which one, just not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it!","review":"I don't like the fact that it doesn't have a \\"regular\\" flap opening. Because of it's cylindrical type shape, the \\"mouth\\" of the bag makes it hard to arrange and load things on the bag. Getting things out is difficult also. If you put something toward the bottom, it's almost impossible to take it our unless you empty the whole content of it out. I would also like to see more external pockets on the bag which is lacking. Unless you plan on carrying a small load of dirty laundry or just throw things in you don't care much about, I would not recomend this bag.The quality on the other hand seem to be good. The stitchings etc are all well constructed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emma Holly \\"dominates\\"","review":"This was the 1st Emma Holly book I read, back when it was a black lace title.

The default is for 4M pixels, but user can select 6M. All the default settings are for automatic operation, and it's almost idiot-proof. For still photos, you can zoom, and you can take video with sound, too. The video is grainy and doesn't offer zoom, but for $129 you can't have everything. The software is simple to load. To download images, you just connect the USB cable to the camera. The software will open autmatically, and the images in your camera will appear, waiting for you to select the ones you want. Once you select them, download is almost instantaneous. Very easy! You can purchase a 256 MB memory card seperately for about $40, and I recommend you buy it. For under $200, you get a very capable, yet tiny camera. Can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I have used","review":"This is an exceptionally well made device. It has a very solid feel and heft. We are using it for salt because we have a different model already for pepper. However the pepper grinder, a Sharper Image item, is just not in the same category of excellence.We have owned it for less than two months, but it would appear to me that it will last a long, long time.The grind size is adjustable. It's very quiet. It is also beautiful, with a cross section that is a rounded square rather than just a plain cylinder.The top section twists only about 15 degrees, then lifts off to fill and to change batteries. The fit of the lid is satifyingly firm and solid.I wish I had something negative to add, but I just cannot find any fault with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd one","review":"I bought one of these 2 years ago and it has been flawless.

Although I had to return the first due to defect","review":"The Pepper Mill works very well, bought it for my spouse for Christmas, and she absolutely loves it. Unfortunately the first one we received had an electrical short that prevented it from turning off, when the enclosure was in place. Called the company and they sent me another one within 2 days and allowed me to keep the original defective one, not quite sure what I am going to do with it but it looks nice... One thing I am concerned about is how long the battery life will last in the device since it takes 6 AAA batteries. We have been using it on a regular basis (5-7 times a week) since a little after Christmas and it still seems to be going strong.Another thought: The light is a nice touch, but not always needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"It certainly is sleek and looks great. But, my mill only dribbles out a few specs of pepper a little at a time. I had purchased this for cooking to quickly add fresh ground pepper to roasts. This electric mill is many times slower than using a manual grinder. To give you an idea, to add a dash of fresh ground pepper to my eggs takes about 20-25 seconds. I gave up on using it for cooking. I came back here to see how much I spent on it! good grief, what I was I thinking?

I truly did not expect it to be as well written and to flow as smoothly. It felt as if I was reading a classic while I read of the adventures of Lynnette and Daniel. Have you ever been reading along and discovered that some part of a book sounds exactly like another? Well, that was not the case with THE MAIDEN'S REVENGE. It did, however, remind me of Gone With The Wind in the manner of the style of writing and the way that you feel like you are part of the storyline. THE MAIDEN'S REVENGE is much spicier than GWTW, though! I wouldn't mind being wrapped up with Captain Daniel Bradley! Whew, what a man!

This product is basically a chunk of dark brown color pushed deep onto the tines of a regular plastic comb. To use it, I had to try to push the comb down deep enough into my roots hoping to transfer some color, but all it did was dampen my roots from the water; no color came off the comb. This might work if the gray you want to cover is somewhere further down your hair but this is just a bad design for covering roots altogether. I recommend the similarly priced \\"lipstick tubes\\" of color over this inferior product if you have roots to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was hoping for something that had more authentic history to read as I traveled through Montana.

If it seems you are experiencing signal loss, it is probably just because of the type of cable you are using. Get the dock and use an S-Video cable if you need better quality. Instead of getting this cable, you can use a regular AV (3 RCA - 1/8 mini) cable, but there's a catch. Plug the red plug into your video in, and the yellow plug into your audio input. Apple says that \\"other AV cables are not compatible with iPod with color display\\" but all they did was switch signals around to try to make you unnecessarily buy more stuff from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great multi-tool for everyday carry and use","review":"I used to carry a Swiss Army Knife as my every day knife/multi-tool, but found that it had certain limitations. I decided to give the Leatherman Juice C2 a try, and have since used it every day. It is heavier that my old Swiss Army Knife (Soldier model), but the added functionality and design make it very worthwhile.The only thing keeping me for giving it 5 stars is the following: the screwdriver tips can be difficult to loosen and lock into place. Even after the oiling the joints, they still seem to tear my thumbnail. Also, if done improperly, the driver can snap out and hit your thumb (the extra-small driver actually broke skin when it snapped into place). This is a small gripe, but it does seem to contrast the clean and smooth folding action of the cheaper Swiss Army Knives.Overall, it is still my everyday carry multi-tool and I don't anticipate replacing it any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome leatherman","review":"Very small and handy for everyday carrying.

It is much more involved in theory than practice, and so it is better suited for those with some experience.Second, it says almost nothing about some of the approaches used in the UK or much of anything not derived from Stanislavski. There are two short chapters on \\"non-method\\" approaches. This doesn't really do justice to work done by members of the RSC, for example.Third, his writing style is NOT for everyone. I believe the word \\"twee\\" comes to mind. At times I would have happily shaken the author by the neck for his way of writing.That said, it does give a good overview of SOME of the great teachers and their methods.

Nintendo is trying to trick you with this junk. This whole Mario sports thing is dumb. Golf was the only good one. Guess what's coming next (really, I checked Nintendo's site). Mario soccer, Mario baseball, and (seriously!) Mario Dance Dance Revolution. Uggghhhh! There is only so much money Nintendo can make off Mario. Maybe if we boycott this game and the other Mario sports ones Nintendo will think about quality before cash.

You can play as different characters, such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Koopa Troopa, Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Boo, Shy Guy, Bowser, and Bowser Jr. However, this game gets four stars instead of five because sometimes you will find this game a little hard.

Not to say the the gamecube doesn't have good graphics it's just that........oh, never mind. But, anyway the gameplay gets kind of boring after a while but it is very fun at first. If you quickly fine this game boring. Then you would probably like the special mode. Other then that you should find this game very adictive and fun to play. Second of all the multiplayer allright. I still think online would be the best. I would probably have given it a 5, if it wasn't for the online failure. Over all this game is great for the holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable, fun, challenging, everything you could want","review":"I love tennis. It's my favorite sport ever.

I have to say, this game is great! You don't need any tennis skill at all to play this. The power-ups make the game fun and challenging. If you want a more vintage tennis feel, just turn the power-ups off, no problem. Each character has their strengths and weakeness which helps with the strategy part of the game.This is my favorite mario game ever and once you get it, it'll be yours too.

The reader is actually the great Grover Gardner, and Durant's flowing prose sound glorious under Gardner's remarkable presentation. I bought the audiotapes over a series of years, and sadly they are similarly out of print and to buy the entire series now is quite an investment (in the thousands of dollars, it seems). Still, if you can find them reasonably priced, buy them.

This is the longest story arc thus far in the series, focusing on a young man and his estranged father. The story opens at a murder scene on the streets of North Philadelphia, where Agent Graves reveals himself to the young man and offers him the famed attache and information on his father's whereabouts. Carlo and Daphne (the thug and cafe waitress couple from issue #8) visit from Miami as connections to the previous issues continue to appear. Fans of the first two volumes will almost certainly enjoy this one as well. I especially appreciated the references to Philadelphia throughout all five issues and the trip to see the Phillies game."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works with 360","review":"For the one who worried about whether it works with the xbox 360, I would like to tell people it works flawless!But be sure that you know this is not a direct replacement.You got to do some works, and you proper need to understand the procedures/replacement guides you found on the internet, otherwise, it will be a waste.

Every case details the shortfalls in the system that fostered these very costly criminal and immoral acts and concludes with solutions and standards to prevent history from repeating itself. It is a \\"must read\\" because it interprets these so called sophisticated accounting fraud cases into basic terminology for any level of investor to understand. The author has a great understanding for the true victims of these costly crimes, every citizen and our economy, not just a small enclave of very rich corporate barons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overpriced","review":"I bought this for Kindle at $9.50 - it should have been 99c.One expects an e-book at this sort of price to be fairly good - this certainly is not.It did at least hold my attention to the end, but it is poorly written and badly formatted - line breaks after one or two words, throughout the book, make it disconcerting to read.It's a much sillier story than it appears from Harriet Klausner's gushing review. And, by the way, after several duds that she has lauded, I no longer trust Ms. Klausner!If you want something that will undemandingly pass an hour or two while sitting in public transport, at all means buy it - IF the price is reduced - and delete it straight afterwards as it is certainly not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grandmothers","review":"I almost finished the book simply because it was the Book Club pick for the month. But I stopped just short of finishing it. I felt I'd had enough punishment! It was by no means of the imagination a page turner.

Lady Nina, Cinderella Search and Grendel are B sides and can be found on \\"B-sides themselves\\", the other songs can be found on several compilations and the excellent Fish-era studio albums. Torch song is a good song, but it shouldn't be part of a 9 song \\"essential\\" collection.

I probably should have chosen another CD because this one has some weak tracks on it. The liner notes focus on the chart positions achieved by the songs, and that gave me a bad impression of the CD because how well a song does on the charts is not an indication of how good the song is. The only songs I really like on this collection are \\"Grendel\\" (a 17 minute masterpiece that is reminiscent of classic progressive rock) and \\"Torch Song\\". I recommend starting with another CD, probably Jester's Tear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Good","review":"Bought on a whim, hoping it would be entertaining. Very slow to set up, run, progress.

A cruel, ruthless criminal mind who happened to be the main character of the book. He is, after all, the title character. He was not the Hero's punching bag. Far from it. Most of the time this Master of Evil WON.You can see the ghost of this great character within every evil genius of a James Bond film, but also you can find him being used by today's writers.

It would be hilarious if it wasn't for the fact that books such as these express beliefs accepted by the scientific and literary mainstream at the time they were written. In other words, the book contains countless musings on the \\"Yellow Peril\\" facing \\"White\\" civilization, the supposedly sneaky, deceptive, crafty nature of all \\"Orientals\\", and so on.The main characters of the book are white male British imperialists at war with an \\"insidious Oriental\\". Yet they cannot help being attracted to an Asian woman, who is apparently not herself \\"racially\\" capable of returning the \\"hero's\\" love in a genuine fashion. It was cartoonish and I actually think this book could be useful for scholarly research as evidence of how bad it really was...and unfortunately is, as the positive reviews by those not \\"infected\\" with \\"political correctness\\" attest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A crackling good yarn!","review":"I love a good adventure story, and this is surely that. Of course, as the other reviewers below mention, the book is not politically correct. But lay that aside and just let yourself get caught up in the fast-paced narrative sweep, which, I assure you, will NOT be hard.What WILL be hard is for any red-blooded fellow to read this exciting tale and not be enslaved ever so slightly by the charms of Karamaneh, the exotic woman who.... I'm stopping myself before I say too much about her. Suffice it to say that you will finish the book wishing that she had been in it more. A LOT MORE.Enough, enough! Buy it! Read it!

My husband took it apart, there is a small motor which powers the eyes, elmos's arms, as well as the propellar through a gear system but without this one tiny motor spinning none of these other parts it powers works. It just makes noises and our daughter says \\"Off??\\" in a pitiful little voice.

Batteries wear down too fast, and with all the bells and whistles I think it is somewhat over stimulating. A few times various components have quit working (like the propeller and the moving elmo on the front) and started working again later, which makes me think that there is a wiring issue with this toy. Between the simpler Little Tikes walker/ride on and this, my son seems to prefer little tikes more even though it doesn't have all the blinky lights etc. Unfortunately he received this heap as a gift so I'm just hoping it gets recalled soon so I can get rid of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for pre-toddlers!","review":"I bought 2 of these for my 8 month old grandchildren.

My nephew got on it and stayed on it the remainder of the night. He could've cared less about all of the other presents he had. It is very interactive and has lots of little buttons, etc. The storage under the seat is just right fo a handful of Cheerios. I highly recommend this as a gift for a little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly designed - dangerous","review":"My 18 month year-old just fell forward and hit his head because, as another reviewer pointed out, the toy has nothing to prevent it from tipping forward and the front wheels are located too far back toward the middle and the center of gravity. I highly recommend finding another, better thought-out riding toy for your child. What's more, this toy malfunctioned the second day we had it, making loud clicking noises when the propeller rotates (apparently related to the mechanism that makes Elmo move back and forth, which also does not work properly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta have this if your kid likes Elmo","review":"If your child likes or in my case loves Elmo this is a must.

Much of the filler is interesting but Rybczynski struggled hard, and wandered far, to find enough words to fill this very slim book (probably only 20,000 words). Since less than 10% is about the subject, the substance isn't quite enough for a solid magazine article. I wanted, and expected, more. I'm sure Rybczynski's editor did, too. Given the author's academic profession, I would think the book was the product of the \\"Publish or perish\\" syndrome were it not for his considerable resume of published books. I suspect that Professor Rybczynski, were he to read this review, might acknowledge that he was caught."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough content for a full book","review":"It's a book about the history of the screwdriver. Really it's an extra long feature article in book form. The author, a guy with a truly unpronounceable name, takes us on an exploratory journey to unearth the most important tool invented in the last thousand years. As he makes his case for the screw and screwdriver, he introduces a lot of great tool history and trivia. My favorite part was his discussion of the button hole, one of those very-useful but not-so-intuitive inventions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where to find a definition","review":"Great book. Enjoyed it immensely and appreciate the author's diligence in searching out his sources. He admits being unable to find a definition for \\"turnscrew\\" in any dictionary.

The history of the screwdriver and the screw is full of really interesting tidbits, plot twists and characters.Rybczynski does a great job of digging into the history of these seminal inventions and figuring out exactly where they came from. However, this is one of the most poorly organized books I have read in the last year. Instead of telling the reader the story as it happened, Rybczynski instead tells the story of his investigation of the history of the screwdriver. He jumps from the 19th century to the 15th and back again, making it really hard to follow. This book took a really fascinating story and killed it through a terrible presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than an essay","review":"An amazing review of the history of tools and a look into how a serious writer chooses and researches his subject.

I carry the knife on my key ring, and there is no way to safely extend the knife blade for use without interference from either the bundle of keys, or the knife's scissor blades. You can either have your keys in the way, mitigated by an awkward grip, or you can grasp the knife with the scissor blades against the palm of your hand. The problem could have been avoided by attaching the key ring to the opposite end of the knife. Since the knife blade is the tool I most commonly use, the Micra just doesn't work for me. I'll wind up tossing it in a junk drawer just as soon as I replace it with a Squirt or maybe a small Swiss Army knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geopelli","review":"The scissors are the star of this tool....easy to open and ready for use.

Primarily because it is small enough to be used as a key-chain and good enough to be used as a tool on several small occasions.For bigger knives you probably need a case and need a place to hook it up or keep it, but since micra can be used a part of key chain there is no storage issue.I got Leatherman micra as a gift from my girlfriend several years ago and I thought it won't be very useful since it is so small.

It is the perfect size for keeping in your pocket or key chain, it isn't too heavy or too bulky. You don't even notice the thing in your pocket. It comes with a pretty large amount of tools, but the three main ones that I use are the scissors, the knife, and the tweezers. The scissors and knife are extremely sharp and responsive. They are really well made and I haven't found anything that I needed to cut that these bad boys couldn't cut. Tweezers aren't standard in the multi-tool world, but I find that I always need them for daily injuries or tasks and the ones that come with the Micra are solid.

Its so handly that many of my relatives and friends are amazed by its compact size.The point is not just the compact size and weight. It delivers a quality that other scissors and knife of similar size can never match. The sharpness & efficiency of the scissors is fantastic. It can cut throught thick and stiff plastic. The knife is also very sharp.I strongly recommend getting this gadget for your everyday use. It is also a good idea to get this as a gift for your loved ones as its something that I deem versatile, flexible, efficient, useful.

I was contemplating this one or the wingman, which i believe has more tools and a spring loaded pliers which I like on my leatherman squirt. However i opted for this one because of the size and good reviews on quality. I am definately satisfied with my purchase. It really seems well built, and fits great a jean pocket without being to bulky or heavy. for the size and what I will use it for it is perfect.

I find the space below them useful for other items stored on the floor, so don't mind them being so high. They use space more efficiently than using regular shelves (in the Rubbermaid Configurations system) for shoes, but I have not tried the system's shoe shelves to be able to compare.

The album starts off with a bang, but then as you get past the 13th song it starts to loose creativity. The lyrics though don't have the same result. Every song was thoughtfully written and that makes up for some of the weak productions at the end. In this album Frost seems to strand away from the barrio life and tries to concentrate on spiritually and the soul, but there are a couple songs that do show his rough side.

The track is \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" from Tundra Workshop. This album is only released through Universal Music Italy but I was able to order it through [...] at a decent price.

I use a tension type of rod in my bathroom, and the \\"pretty\\" rings just don't stay hooked on, because they don't go far enough around the rod. It's a pain to keep putting them back in place!!These satin nickel roller ball shower curtain rings DO stay on the rod. They're not ugly; just not as pretty to look at as some others, but they do the job. And it appears that once on, they're going to stay there until I decide to take them off. The squeezy clasp is even a little hard to operate when you first start putting them on the curtain, but even my old hands managed, and I expect they'll stay tight and keep those rings right where they belong for a very long time.So, if you prefer functional over designer pretty, do yourself a favor and get these. They just work!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice rings, wrong finish","review":"I bought these rings to match everything else in my bathroom with the satin nickel finish (towel bar, sink hardware, shower hardware, robe hook, etc.).

It tells the story of a hitman through the eyes of several people. It jumps from 'present' day back to the past and back again. It tells the same story from different perspectives. At times this style is very hard to follow. He introduces too many characters and it is hard to keep up with everyone and their relationship to the story.

(This trend continues on in Patterson's writing career as those of you who have read every Alex Cross novel know what I mean.)I thought I was going to take a shot at all of Patterson's books since they are such basic 1-2 day reads and generally keep my interest. Those plans progressively changed as I moved along in the Cross novels and 'Berryman' may just prevent me from ever picking up one of his books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his better books","review":"I am a huge Patterson fan, however this is the first book of his that I have ever read (25 read so far) that I did not enjoy. It jumps around so much it is hard to follow and confusing when it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Patterson at his worst","review":"First I must tell you I am a BIG James Patterson Fan, I have read almost all of hislatest books, decided to try his earlier ones. I have never NOT finished abook until this one. I thought it was terrible. Its short chapters were 76pages long, the characters were jumbled together. I hated it...It proves that writersor anyone in their chosen occupation can get better. I love Alex Cross & LindsayBoxer and many others. This one you can forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another fine mess","review":"This novel is such a mess that it is unworthy of serious comment. Rather, it calls to mind 2 questions:(1) How on earth did this ever get published?(2) What tasteless literary jury gave this an edgar for a first novel?Don't waste your time on this. I pushed myself to read about 100 pages of it and it never got any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not best work","review":"In spite of enjoying most Patterson fiction and in spite of enjoying Will Patton readings of contemporary authors, this set is a dud. Not Patterson's best work and even Will Patton's reading cannot save this from being a work best not listened to in traffic or while operating heavy machinery. ZZZZZ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Patterson completists","review":"Judging from the reviews here on Amazon this book was really bad, but since it had won an Edgar Award I decided to give it a try. Now, the biggest mystery about \\"The Thomas Berryman Number\\" is why it won the award. The writing (a first person narrative) is not bad and occasionally funny, but the plotting is very weak. In the beginning of the book we're told the mayor of Nashville was assassinated and then we get to follow a journalist who investigates the assassination. There's never any suspense and I never really cared about the story of the characters. It's a quick read but a pointless one. The only reason \\"The Thomas Berryman Number\\" is still in print is because it was written by James Patterson and I would recommend it only to Patterson completists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to put down","review":"I listen to a lot of audiobooks, and this one I just couldn't get into. I found it confusing...in fact, after listening to the first 1/2 disc I went back to the beginning and started over to see if I had 'drifted off' somewhere, but it was just as confusing the second time around. A little ways into the second disc, I just gave up on it and made another selection. I've listened to a lot of Patterson books and liked most of them...at least the ones which he actually wrote and didn't just lend his name to the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very off-putting to a new Patterson reader","review":"I've been collecting all the James Patterson books and intended to read them in order over this winter, starting with this one. If I hadn't already bought the ones after this, I probably wouldn't now, but according to the customer reviews the rest aren't this bad. It's encouraging to me that this one appears to be an exception, validating my low opinion of it. It was impossible to keep track of what was happening when, and to or by whom. Now I wonder if I'll be able to enjoy the rest of his books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT ?!?!?!","review":"I've read almost everything Patterson has written, and loved almost all of it (this book and \\"The Final Warning\\" are the exceptions).I purchased this as an audiobook on CD to listen to when I drive out of town. The first time I put the CD in, I only made it a few chapters before I had to take it out. The second time, I vowed to make it further into the book and \\"give it a chance\\". Though I did make it further into the book, I still took it out... disgusted.I found myself wondering what the heck was going on and not caring about the characters at all.I just couldn't force myself to listen any longer.This would be something great to play out loud in a horror movie where you wanted to drive someone crazy... or maybe in a POW camp where you wanted to make someone \\"talk\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BORING BOOK THE MEMOIRS OF GLUCKEL OF HAMELN","review":"THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST BORING BOOKS I'VE EVER READ.

She talks about having fourteen children, working with her husband buying and selling seed pearls, how the Jews lived in northern Germany, how she viewed reactions to Shabbatai Tzvi the false messiah, arranging matches for her children, traveling, etc. After my Jewish women's book discussion book read it, we all agreed that we did not find the book an easy or enjoyable read, but we all felt that it was very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate to heap criticism--this is total garbage!!!","review":"this book is a total waste of money and time. my professor in college would often refer to \\"gigo\\"--garbage in, garbage out. nothing illustrates this phenomenon more so than this empty book. no original thought or commonsnese was used in its writing. save yourself some money and buy a book which is more realisitic and worthwhile. ned from fargo"},{"rating":"1","title":"more of the same--only less this time","review":"This book contributes nothing to the success of a trader.

It's one thing to have experiences but this in itself does not an author make. I have seen 4th grade compositions that were better examples of the craft.

How can I tell you my opinion about this book without spoiling it? Hmm. Let's try like this.Hellblazer is not about this kind of stories. Not normally.This is a very dark tale about desperate men and women in a desperate town - and the impossibility of saving them from themselves.Sounds good, isn't it?Unfortunately, John Constantine (the main character) really doesn't fit in this tale, and all the efforts to turn the story into something \\"Hellblazerish\\" repeatedly fail. Worse than that, they turn the tale into pastiche with all that forced and unnecessary imagery of disturbing, dead and corrupted stuff.Oh. And the basic premise for the story is waaaay improbable, as soon as you stop to ponder it, and really just a gimmick to inject some (well, quite a lot of) shock value in the book.Not excessively bad, but Hellblazer is another kind of stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very personalized.","review":"The description on the back of the box says something along the lines of \\"this cologne blends with your natural body chemistry to create a unique and sexy scent.\\"While I thought this was a gimmick at first, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this cologne really does smell great on me.With that having been said, you really need to test this out before you buy it.

From the cover of the box, I thought I'd get to see Ursula naked in the film. She comes close during her strip at the beginning of the film, but never does get naked. The film is a sci-fi/fantasy about a world where instead of war, people can relieve their agressions by registering as hunters. Hunters try to kill other hunters. A hunter who successfully kills 10 other hunters, can retire very rich. Once registered as a hunter, a person either kills 10 other hunters or is killed--they cannot leave the game.

Oh, and it's plastic. Expect the plastic tabs on the grind size adjuster within to break.Why two stars and not one? It was all I could afford and it does perform okay for its price level.

The Solis Maestro isn't an expensive low-end grinder, it's a high-end grinder at a tremendous value. For the money, it's not really possible to get the same combination of consistent grind and durability.This isn't the greatest grinder for espresso, which requires a highly consistent grind, but it does the trick. With a little work, it'll produce a good shot out of my Rancilio Silvia, which is notoriously picky about grind consistency. It's true that it can be messy, but what grinder isn't? At least it's easy to clean. Another tip; if you have a static problem, where grounds stick to everything, your coffee isn't fresh enough.

Postage and insurance paid by ME.

Sure, it does not deserve 5 stars, but I needed to bring up the rating because it was truly a good album. Its better than Wreath of Barbs anyways. Every song is enjoyable.

If your new to :W:, please don't start here...I suggest Embryodead, Music For A Slaughtering Tribe, Eevil Young Flesh, Bunker Gate 7, or Cannibal Anthem.

However I did find some of the stories a little tedious and one or two just plain boring, and that is why it only gets 4 stars. Perhaps I found these less good because they weren't directly about The Crow, and more realted to the theme of revenge and death.But a poem by Henry Rollins, and 'Spooky Codeine And he Dead Man' by O'Barr himself, and 'Twice By Fire' by Ramsey Campbell, this book gains its four stars, plus th great works by other writers, too many of which there are to mention.I advise you buy 'The Crow' before this book, as a lot of the stories refer to things in 'The Crow'.A good book for fans of The Crow and James O'Barr, as well as fans of dark fantasy/horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch 1591EVSK Gets it Right","review":"I have used many different jig saws in the past, although all were top handle models. The barrel grip Bosch is the finest unit I have used. The control with the barrel grip is far superior to top handle models. Cutting is superb and intricate scrolling work is no problem for this saw. The tool-less blade change system is the best around, and in orbital mode this thing will rip through wood like a beaver on steroids! The only drawbacks are that with the slide switch instead of a trigger you give up a little on ease of speed control, although the rear speed control is easy to reach. Also the dust blower only works really well at higher speeds. If you need a jig saw then you need a Bosch, and if you want precise control then try the barrel grip as it is a truly outstanding tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing power and control","review":"This is only my second jig saw, but coming from a black and decker jig saw I may be a little too easily impressed. But this jig saw is incredible. It has great control, and depending on the selected orbital action, it will either make very clean cuts and cut, in the words of another reviewer, like a beaver on steroids.With the anti-splinter insert, I got no tearout on birch plywood. I highly recommend this jig saw!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works good but","review":"I install cabinets for a living, so I like to buy tools that will last which is why I chose Bosch, the saw works great making nice steady cuts. The plastic boot that was supplied for the base had rough edges which will gouge up any finish the cord is too long if youwant to use the case.The body is very long making it tough to use in confined spaces, still haven't gotten use to the always on feature, meaning switch on or switch off, no trigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ooh, ooh, my first review","review":"Even though the older, very capable model is now available at discount, I splurged for the new 1591EVSK with the case. I opted for the Amazon credit card and free shipping for a total of $159. It is a replacement for a Sears unit that just turned 40.Smooth, quiet, precise; can't ask for more. The barrel grip is very good at controlling all that weight and power. The Bosch blades are really nice (I really wanted that 30-blade assortment that is not available at this time). Blade changes are easy and will make it more likely that users will switch to the proper blade during different phases of a project.The on-off switch is pretty clumsy and the fan action is a little weak at low speeds. Still, this is a great tool and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade guides do not \\"reciprocate\\"","review":"The blade guides, called \\"reciprocating pawls\\" by another reviewer, do not reciprocate. They can be adjusted a tiny bit, with an allen bolt, so they do not pinch tightly onto the blade. In operation, they can be opened or closed with a red lever on the port side of the saw. The controls are well laid out for each function. The blade guides are a bit above the workpiece, and a bit bigger than the Festool Trion, and the whole saw is close toa pound heavier and bigger. While the Trion is about $100 more then the Bosch 1591, it is the smaller size, smoothness, lightness, and fitment/design, that got this old carpenter with arthritis to spring for the Festool. The Bosch is still a wonderful deal... and I borrow a buddies on the jobsite whenever he isn't looking! I give it only one-half star less the the 5 star Festool. 4.5 out of 5.0."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yup, it's a good one","review":"Very impressed. After experience with the previous Bosch model barrel grip, this is definitely a step ahead.I just scribed an irregular panel to an opening and was able to stay EXACTLY on my scribed line. The panel fit could not have been better.A saw this accurate becomes much more versatile than a typical jigsaw. The other reviews are dead-on and this one is worth the money. They helped me make the decision to buy this after trying a DeWalt that had very poor blade support.The precision blade guide system is indeed extraordinarily effective and with the right blade keeps the blade from wandering. I did not think it was possible for a jigsaw to be this precise.The case is in my opinion completely adequate (unlike another review)Lastly, the saw is actually made in Switzerland. When was the last time you saw a power tool made in Switzerland?Basically, this saw makes this cynical woodworker sound like a shill for Bosch. If you new me, you'd know that that says a lot :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"precision and stability.","review":"My carpenters and I love this jigsaw.The barrel style grip, the good solid weight and weight distribution of the tool, and very long cord all make for a enjoyable, precise, and stable use of the tool.Highly recommended for high-quality cuts.NOTE: not sure why the review links to a seller selling it at $350+........ We paid $157.99, and that's around what the newer model sells for, fyi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This saw rocks! I bought it to cut decorative ends in some framing lumber for an outdoor project. Material changed to pressure treated during the planning stage. I was amazed at how effortlessly it made the cuts. The saw is on the heavy side, which I found to be a benefit. It helped dampen vibration. The blower didn't keep up with the wet pt saw dust, but that didn't surprise me. Only downside (if you can call it that) was that I pulled the saw out of a curve I was making and the blade hit the board so hard, it actually bent the blade! I blame that more on operator error than the tool's fault, but its something to keep in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've gotta have one of these!","review":"This is the best jig saw on the market, considering price/value. I researched many brands and kept returning to Bosch because of the reputation of the brand. The barrel grip configuration is very comfortable to use; it gives me better control over cuts, especially when scrolling. The adjustments on the saw give you the capability to vary the cut from very fine to very aggressive; blade control is excellent.

Plenty of power and the barrel grip gives you extra control. My major complaint is safety. There is an on/off switch on the side of the barrel. Bosch should have used a safety switch similar to what Milwaukee's angle grinders use. If the saw ever got out of your hands it would continue to run. Another point that I do not like is the speed adjustment is located on the end of the barrel making it difficult to adjust the speed while operating the saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"heats up","review":"Sawing for a short period of time is very acceptable but with prolonged use (over an half hour) the motor heats up so hot that you can barely hold onto the saw. A cool down period of up to 20 min is adequate for another 10 or minutes use, then the heating up begins again. Never had this trouble with any other jig saw but might have to do with the fact that you are holding this saw by the motor, not some accessory handle. Like the blade changing, best I have used but the heat is not acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for a DIY guy","review":"I agree with all the positive comments, and yes, the tool gets a little warmbut not hot. Low vibtration level. The cord is long and flexible and thecase has plenty of roomfor extra blades (no shoehorning the tool and cord into it). Since I'm ahacky DIY type, it was nice that the blade is exactly 1.5 inches from eachedge of the shoe. Makes measuring so much easier for simpletons such asmyself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"My only previous experience has been with lightweight Jigsaws and those weren't great experiences so I was skeptical about this one. I now know what I have been missing. My first cuts were plunge cuts made on the wall of the inside of a cabinet. It was great. This saw is very accurate and the blade release is a great feature. If all you've ever used are cheap jigsaws, you'll be blown away by this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it 6 stars if I could","review":"This is by far the best jig saw on the market for the money. It jigs, it saws. Smooth, easy to operate, a pleasure to use. Only thing to note is this is a barrel grip saw - you're holding the motor when you use it. It does get quite warm after a bit, but it's nothing to complain about. In fact, if you're outdoors and it's cold this may just come in handy as a hand-warmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jigsaw","review":"heavy, but does the job well.

It consists of a sheet of filter paper which you drape over a cylinder and secure by sliding a big o-ring collar over it.No matter how good you slide the ring on, it is only a matter of time until the ring slides off. When this happens, you'll know, as the vacuum spurts out an amazing amount of dust. We used this vacuum for about a year during many home renovation projects and I can't count how many times it has blown dust all over our house. We even got into the habit of checking the filter before every time we turned on, but it still happens some times.It just happened again: dust blown all over my kitchen.This puppy is getting sold for pennies on the dollar on craigslist and I'm going out to buy another.

You are better off with any other product unless you immediately throw the paper filter away and upgrade to a cylinder 903-- type filter. The paper filter that comes with the vacuum is secured by a plastic ring that you push (not screw or latch) on. It WILL will fall off during use with no warning - instantly blowing any dust you have collected into the room. By the time you see the dust it is too late. This happened three times in the first day of use (yes, we did push the ring on tightly, especially after the second time - didn't help). We would have been better of never turning it on.

After all, she danced with both Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly in several films each and is in the holiday classic \\"White Christmas\\". This book seeks to provide what information is available and although many unresolved questions linger, it's a great start to finding out more about who I think was the best female dancer in films. I enjoyed the book very much and would recommend it without hesitation to anyone interested in film and/or modern dance. It's such a shame she retired from films relatively young, but as the book describes, Vera-Ellen's career seemed to be doomed at every turn by miffed studio heads, bad timing and just inexplicable oversights of her abilities by those doing the hiring in Hollywood. There are a number of photos of her in her retirement years as well as classic film stills.

If you love Hadani Ditmars as much as she loves herself, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible dreck!","review":"This is probably the worst piece of journalism I have ever read. It doesn't even seem like the author was actually in Iraq! It is poorly-written and demonstrates zero knowledge of Middle East politics. It looks to me as if she wrote the book just to make a buck. This author should stay focused on her main career: writing bad children's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"The \\"author\\" of this \\"book\\" ought to be ashamed of herself. She isn't, of course, and that's saying a lot.A prior reviewer, after incomprehensibly gushing with praise, referenced the suffering children in Iraq, ending his observations with \\"...[d]oes it really matter who is most responsible for their suffering?\\"The answer is yes. Yes, it does matter. After the fact of the suffering, it is the ONLY thing that matters, because it is the only the recognition of who is responsible that will allow the prevention of future suffering. It is precisely this sort of mushy relativism that operates as a salve to the bleeding, leftist heart. Further, throughout history such relativism has always operated as an apology for those visiting the greatest horrors upon mankind. In the end, people such as Hadani Ditmars, and the aforementioned reviewer, are morally repugnant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original is right","review":"A prior reviewer mentioned that a virtue of this book is its originality. Well, this is half right. It is totally original. But this is hardly a virtue. Someone else has pointed out, and rightly so, that there is nary a fact to be found within. And so we come to what must be acknowledged as quite a feat of \\"spin\\" - taking a work that someone made up from whole cloth - a pack of lies, as it were - and casting said effort as worthy of praise for its originality. Well done, apologists. I'm sure there are equally questionable mechanisms to be employed in re-characterizing all manner of horrors, and one presumes that such people as the author will waste no time in getting to the employing. One is tempted to observe that such efforts are an affront to reason and humanity, but one quickly reflects on how such an observation will certainly fall upon deaf ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already doesn't work","review":"Bought this in October 2003 - CD player already doesn't work!

Willie Nelson has a nice storyteller's voice and pace.The stories are told in a variety of 3rd person and 1st person perspectives. They range from manhunts to range wars. The heroes are hard, upright men and the villains are greedy and conniving. I love the attention paid to historic detail- language, guns, landscape, clothing, and even thinking.The stories may be short, but there is not shallowness or rushed pace.It comes in a nice wooden collector's case.I recommend this collection to any Louis L'Amour or Western fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for Honey bunny","review":"It is often hard to find a gift for my husband who has everything - but this fit the bill just perfect.

It was great for serving chocolate popcorn in, but after I served mashed potatoes in it for Christmas dinner, there were two big chips in the rim. I assume this happened by the spoon hitting the rim, which I didn't see happen-- and no one did anything during dinner that would have made me suspect damage would occur. It was also hand washed carefully, and I still don't know how or when the damage occurred, because it looked great when I put it on the table. I never saw any instructions for not using hot foods in it, but its pretty obvious not to put it in the dishwasher. I am not buying another one, the rim just seems too easily damaged by normal use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as it appeared ...","review":"First of all, it is not dishwasher safe as it was described. I also was not impressed with the quality of the bowl.

Each LP had a theme and some of her best performances were recorded during her stay at Columbia. When this album was recorded fall of 1965, Patti was just coming off the Top 10 hit, HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE. Patti's arrangers and producers decided this was a perfect time for a new Christmas album since the original 12 inch album on Mercury was 10 years old. Patti does marvels with SILVER BELLS, LITTLE DRUMMER BOY, the too often missed SANTO NATALE and of course the song which became Patti 's biggest Christmas hit ever, HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESUS. Patti is a consummate storyteller and this selection again shows her skill, sincerity and perfection. This is a CD which is a family affair as many selections include an unnamed children's chorus.

I enjoy philosophy, what you have here is Ravi talking to Oscar Wilde about pleasure, the sacredness of why God created it. It's marvelous how Ravi chose a great candidate for his book of those who abuse the sacredness of pleasure. Oscar Wilde lived a life of debauchery, who indulged his lifestyle of vain and worthless things. A life that got him into prison and ultimately his death mirrored his lifestyle. A great read, for those who enjoy philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, easy, and spiritually beneficial","review":"Read this book because Ravi mentioned it in his \\"Problems with Pleasure\\" sermon.

I believe another reviewer mentioned \\"De Profundis,\\" and I agree entirely. Wilde was most definitely not a superficial, pleasure-seeking Victorian dandy; if you read nearly anything written after his imprisonment, it becomes quite apparent that he was anything but shallow. It's a terrible iniquity to characterize a man by the mask he wore instead of the person he really was."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd-rate moralizer mangles Wilde's corpse","review":"\\"Formerly we used to canonise our heroes.

A bias proselytizer, his insipid interpretations of Wilde's philosophies, and 3rd-grade understanding of art, are completely wrong, set up like strawmen to be batted about by his \\"Jesus.\\" Even worse: it's badly written.But don't take my word for it. Look at the sample pages, then read Wilde's \\"Critic as Artist\\" or \\"Decay of Lying\\" online, and draw your own conclusions.What a tragedy.

Nor does he seem to recall that Jesus preferred the company of sinners and prostitutes to that of the people who \\"knew\\" they were right.I suppose I should be grateful that Zacharias doesn't just toss Wilde into hell at the end, but I still resent seeing this gallant gadfly and seeker after truth reduced to a straw man for the author to knock down.

The book shows the corruption of the heart that is evident in all people, including: Oscar Wilde, Mother Theresa, myself, the reader of my review, and all other people. This is not a book about one man's struggle, it is about the struggle that every person faces in life, and it is an invaluable resource for all people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"I thought that this was a great fictitious conversation between Jesus and Oscar Wilde. It delved deep into the nature of man and our ability to enjoy our indulgences. The dialogue was well written, the conclusions made perfect sense and the book will really make you think.

All of the above review are correct, my only concern, and the reason why I gave it a low rating, is that the translation is terrible in this version. It is meant to be a simple and easy to understand version. For more serious students, I would stick to more scholary versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Good","review":"I had read Aristotle's Ethics many decades ago but recently had a chance to take a class so...I purchased this version.I really like this translation!

The game is more fun if you play the multiplayer mode. The game starts out with the playable characters being Jack, Elizabeth, and Will, but as you collect gold coins and statues you can unlock playable characters such as the voodo doll, captain pirate, Norrington, Jack as tribal cheif, and many others. The best of these in my opinion is the captain pirate(He waddles like a penguin, but can beat a guy in 2 hits). The game takes less than 5 hours to beat ON NORMAL SETTING.The game follows the storyline of the movie pretty well but skips a few parts like how Will gets the key. I dont understand why they didnt make the Flying Dutchman a level . It would have made the game longer. You start out with a cutlass but as you collect coins you can buy weapons. The best weapon you can buy is the native blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son Loved It","review":"My son is a bid Pirates of the Caribbean fan, especially the Lego game, and he really liked this one as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWESOME MOVIE, HORRIBLE GAME!","review":"I am sorry for all the Dead Mans Chest fans that wasted money on this game.

During the entire gameplay you only play as Jack, Elizabeth, and Will. There are parts of the game that were not even in the movie!

Much to my astonishment the same thing happens; only it sat at receiving center 36 hrs before report of damged beyond reconition!

I've only tried doing so through Photoshop 7. When I attempted to save my file and had navigated over to where the drive should reside, the Cruzer was not a visible option to save to. Of course, I could still copy and paste the file over without incident.Something to consider...I purchased this item instead of a portable burner for my notebook and so far have been very glad that I did so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea, but...","review":"Well...It started out being great. It saved me a lot of hassles moving large files back and forth between different computers during a business trip to the UK (Sept-Oct). In late November it started going south on me. Today it finally failed (Jan 23).The memory card wouldn't seat, or lost connection when you slid the USB plug out (which also moves the card forward) - when set to the operating position it stopped working! At first, gentle pressure on the card helped. The more force. Then force applied with a blunt instrument. And finally nothing.This device has a serious design fault. If the card could stay in place while the housing retracted to reveal the plug, it would work better, longer. SanDisk did it backwards.Look for a device that doesn't move the memory card. Less cute, more work.SanDisk says they'll replace it -- what I really need is a better device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Small To Be So Good","review":"It is about the size of your thumb and weighs half as much.

And, that's it! All set and raring to go.The 256 holds the data that could fit on approximately 170 floppy disks. And when you take into consideration the cost, the size and the convenience, this baby is worth every cent.So, if you need to have an Iomega Zip (they still crank out the 256) and want the added bother of power cords and space to put the drive, then go that way.

I came across this book after a long search and thought I had found gold. Unfortunately, it was not what I expected. I was really disappointed with the line sketches used to explain clothing choices and found those designs to be VERY outdated- especially considering the second printing was in 2002. For example, I could not disagree more with the advice for rectangular-shaped women- that they should opt for sack dresses that ignore the waist, rather than trying to create one.The chapters on jewlery choices and color charts were equally useless.I would not recommend this book to any fashion designer looking for figure-flattering design elements. \\"Dress Your Best\\" by Stacy London and Clinton Kelly is by far a better choice- especially considering the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Body's Design Pattern Paradigm/Genius Concept","review":"I found the Body's Design Paradigm, the foundation of the Triumph of Individual Style, to be a concept born from the mind of a genius.

The book covers the period of 1780-1835. However, the author on multiple occasions refers to the Civil War period. Too much \\"bouncing\\" around throughout the years.Yes, she does quote portions of historical letters but I felt these were used most likely out of context in order to support the writer's point of view without actual facts cited.The writer's negativity toward other books written on plantation mistresses and their authors, which she refers to frequently in the book, are deplorable. Why mention them at all. It only makes one want to read the books that she things so little of.Harsh...yes perhaps this review is harsh.

In other words, there are many places in which Wesley keeps differing concepts in tension, but holds them together. This tension or both/and is what makes Wesley unique and so deep as a theologian who has a lot to say about our theological thinking today.So often in the past Wesley has been explored to find only one of the poles and written as if he were only thinking about one, rather than doing the work necessary to find that Wesley realy is holding concepts in tension and a creative tension at that.This is a solid work that should be kept close at hand for the scholar.J.

(You would think that a company that makes sealant products could properly seal their own tubes, though!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Container burst on the other side and silicon all leaked out at first use","review":"As soon as I opened the silicon from the box, screwed the plastic cone shaped thing, cut off the edge and started using the silicon, I noticed that the silicon did not flow out that easily, and I had to really press on the tube to get it out.I was about half way done with my job (I think I used maybe 5-7cc of the silicom), I noticed something on my hand...The other end apparently burst and silicon was leaking out the other side... a big mess and I don't think I can use this twice!What a WASTE of money!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"european video version","review":"I was just recently deployed to al muhmadiyah, iraq where we had access to satellite tv. i used to watch the video all the time because the beat is so catchy compared to the us version which i saw the video a couple of days ago online. the videos are somewhat alike but the beat is so different, in my opinion, sounds better than the album version. she is an awesome performer. i usually don't listen to rap but when i heard this song its like a new undiscovered teritory"},{"rating":"1","title":"fairly boring","review":"i thought with a New Single that I Might actually like one song from Lil Kim but think again.I enjoy looking at Her but Musically She is still pretty Wack.this Song doesn't do much for me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't even get in","review":"I got this for my ferret and the hole in the front isn't even big enough to get in, not to mention it's made out of very cheap and thin fabric. Would not reccommend, it's practically unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little tool","review":"I've had this little Leatherman tool for over a year. I'm not normally a tool guy - I work with computers. But I wanted a small tool I could keep with me for incidental work.This is a great combo tool. The knife blade is big enough to do most jobs like opening boxes, cutting cords, etc. I keep it super sharp with a 3-stage electric sharpener and it holds the edge for a long time. The screwdriver blades all come in handy. The pliers are probably the component I use the least as I really need sidecutters more often. But the few times I've needed them they worked well.The BEST part of this tool is its size. It fits perfectly into the fifth pocket of my jeans (the little pocket above the front right pocket). I just drop it in there daily. It doesn't get in my way but is right at hand whenever I need it.Buy one, especially at the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little tool","review":"I love mine and everyone I given one to as a gift has liked it. Especially usefull is the smallest screwriver, it actually fits that little screw in the eyeglass hinge. The wire cutter cuts #12 solid quite easily. I've only 2 gripes, the philips screwdriver is only semi usefull, perhaps a precision philips would have been a better device there, and the bottlecap tool takes a few bites before the cap will come off. I do carry it eveywhere, and give them as gifts frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Squirt","review":"Although this tool costs much more than some similar tools made by other companies, it is a high quality tool that is well worth the price. All compnents of the tool are strong enough to stand up to years of abuse. I am most impressed by the file, which is sharp enough and durable enough to file steel occasionally for several years without dulling. The first Squirt I bought was 8 years old when I lost it, and I was eager to buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great","review":"I can't believe all the 5-star reviews for this tool. I almost hesitate to use the pliers because it's really easy to pinch your finger between the two handles when you squeeze them together. I've gotten blood-blisters more times than I care to count. On well-designed pliers, the handles don't come completely together when you squeeze them, just for this reason. Even if you hold it carefully, the handles are too short to give you very much leverage. Then there are the various tools--of the 6 stored in the handles, three of them are little more than flat-head screwdrivers of various sizes. Hopefully you never need a Phillips-head! Forget trying to use the wire cutters. Even if you're successful it's impossible to finish the cut without pinching your finger. The knife is OK--sharp and solid, and the file seems useful. But if you're going to use the pliers, be sure to wear a glove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable !","review":"Right out of the box these things were very comfortable.

I find that there is no wear streach going on like I wouldexperience from a leather western boot say. I ride a Harley and started to see athin top layer of material flaking off the shoe where the shifter lever rides,and where ever the lace eyelets rest against the tongue. These boots are coveredwith a thin vinyl like layer that comes off rather easily. It is a dull gray colorunderneath. I think the material these are made of is Cheezy at best. I won'tbe back for seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sole is faulty","review":"I bought these shows two months ago.

Anyway these shoes held up and wore comfortably at first, but after less than three weeks of use the entire sole of the shoe came apart. Horrible durability. Other than that they were great, but the fact I couldn't use these for even a month with medium use is what attributed to my rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The early and great Yeats","review":"This work contains the poems written by Yeats from 1889 to 1914. It includes some of the classic poems of twentieth century Literature, \\"No Second Troy\\", \\"The Song of the Wandering Aengus\\"\\" The Lake Isle of Inisfree\\" \\" When you are old\\" and many others.Yeats is a poetry who draws on Irish folklore and myth but his great power is in the music of his language, and his lyric celebration of life.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"non-Catholics like me find this fascinating reading too","review":"It is not just the Catholic Church that needs saving - by its caring members - but many other institutions in turmoil today in our world, and Kaiser's book taps a strongly felt yearning to stand up for our values - and the kind of civil society we want. Besides, it's fascinating reading about the behind-the-scenes maneuvering - even for someone raised Baptist, like me. That old axiom, \\"Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely' kicks in for any institution, from a corporation to a federal agency... to a church.No one had a better vantage point than Kaiser to write this kind of \\"inside/outside\\" book. -Kare from sayitbetter.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather read honest Anti-Catholicism than this!","review":"If I could give no stars, I would! I would rather read a Jack Chick tract - at least he's honest enough to admit that he hates the Catholic Church. Mr. Kaiser is a \\"wolf in sheep's clothing\\" in this book - he starts out talking about how he reported on Vatican II and throwing an occasional George Weigel quote on Pope John Paul II in to lure us into thinking it will be an interesting book on the Church and the succession. But no...he goes on to tell the reader how awful Pope Benedict XVI is, personally and as a churchman, how JPII wasn't all he was cracked up to be, how Francis Cardinal Arinze, an educated and intelligent man, is a smiling dunderhead and on and on. Sorry that the Church hasn't moved in the direction the author wants, but that doesn't make it wrong, now matter how much Robert Blair Kaiser wants to think so! The only good thing I can say is that I took it out of the library and didn't waste money on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A church in search","review":"Enjoyed reading Bob Kaiser's book very much. He knows his material and presents it well. Why not, he lived in Rome for years and studied for the Priesthood, before leaving to help make a better church. He was the Times correspondent in Rome for Vatican II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"Kaiser correctly describes himself as a throwback to the 60's. He follows that latitudinarian ideology, but obviously not to its logical conclusion. This is because high school logic is too demanding for the fallen-away Jesuit. To call the views of the Curia 'dated' or backwards, is as the man with the plank in his eye pointing out another's eyelash--Kaiser only looks to the future through is own threadbare past. Some never grow up, and they end up looking like ridiculous old men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal renegade wishes up Newchurch","review":"The Church hasn't changed -- we still despise the things and pleasures of this world in favor of charity and sacrifice. Everything passes away, except charity, which endures in eternity. Kaiser, in contrast, whistles up a notional church in which everyone is free to follow their own desires -- oh, I mean conscience. In Newchurch, conscience means carnality. This is how nations fall, folks. Follow your bliss and blow off your neighbor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best for learning how to catch stripers in inland lakes","review":"Fantastic. There is so much information in this book you can read it over and over and learn something new every time. Highly recomended. Keep it on your boat. Covers lakes, rivers, and all seasons of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fictional novel !","review":"One of the best known novels by Cardoso Pires, it gives an account of the comtemporary social life with great sobriety in a dry and witty style. A good book,dense and critical with a touch of \\"neo-realism meets existencialism\\" to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"The first time I drank Jablum I was nestled in a hammock watching the sunset over a white sandy beach in Negril. The flavor was exotic. Though the scenery is much more mundane here, this coffee still brings back memories of reggae beats and irie times. Not oily, very aromatic smooth coffee with only a hint of acidity and a silky sweet aftertaste. Definitely worth every penny, and then some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Customer Service","review":"I can't comment about the product itself but can tell you that the customer service on this product is not good. I mistakenly ordered the product twice and needed to cancel one of them, and tried repeatedly to call the company. NO ONE answered the phone for the returns or existing order department. Honestly, I hung on for almost an hour. When I tried calling sales, I finally reached someone but they quickly transferred me back to no man's land. I called back AGAIN and the person told me that maybe that department was \\"out to lunch.\\" I called back AGAIN to sales and finally got a nice man to help me cancel one of the orders. This was honestly and all day affair. I hope the product that does come is worth it, if it comes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad reproduction of superb material","review":"I awaited months for this collection and I was truly desappointed by the awful job Marvel Comics did of reproducing these gems.First, the paper: who said glossy paper was better quality? It makes the colors pop out way too much. The original colors were meant for a more absorbing paper. When printed on the glossy stock they just scream.Second: the gorgeous inking by the imcomparable Joe Sinnot is totally destroyed by the abysmal reproduction.These original comics are some of the absolute best ever. They need to be preserved for history's sake. I know Marvel can do better than that...This is why this book is rated 2 stars instead of the five stars the original material deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done and overpriced","review":"This run of Fantastic Four comic books by Lee and Kirby, of course, is great. HOWEVER, this Masterworks collection is something of a rip-off. First of all, the suggested retail of $49.95 is up $15 from the price they had a year ago on other Masterworks. Secondly, the reproduction of the artwork is subpar... not to mention outright terrible at times. Worst yet, the inking job by Joe Sinnot is many times obviously \\"touched up\\" or completely re-done by another inker (Steve Leiloha?). Half the beauty of the artwork in an FF comic book is Joe Sinnot's inks over Kirby's pencils. That beauty is completely lost in these reprints. Don't buy this Masterworks. Go to a comic book shop and buy the original copies of these comics... if you go for the \\"good condition\\" (as opposed to \\"mint condition\\") comics you'll actually pay LESS than if you bought the Masterworks edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvel Masterworks vol 6","review":"The stories are classic Lee/Kirby. This volume was everything I was hoping for when I bought it. I may be a little biased in that the FF are my favorite characters in the marvel universe but the price was low and the quality was good. I would highly recommend for any FF fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very nice seat, frustrating handle","review":"We had purchased this seat for our daughter before she was born. We feel that it is very safe and she is comfortable in it. We also liked that we could buy an additional base since we have two cars. It snaps in and out of the bases, shopping carts and the sit and stand stroller we also purchased very easily. My complaint is that it is very hard to depress the release buttons to move the handle. It seems the longer we use it, the harder it gets. I have two other friends with the same seat and the same complaint. It is very frustrating and after just 3 months, I am looking to purchase a new seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Two things I hate about this car seat is the handle that will not go down and the way you have to match the clasps to seat belt your little one into the seat. Sorry if that last one does not make sense. To explain more to lock your child into the seat you have to hook the to plastic clasps together like a puzzle to keep them in the seat. I called baby trend to complain about the car seat handle and they will fix it but I would be without a carseat for 4 to 7 days meaning I would have to buy another car seat to fix their car seat. I strongly would advise another brand of car seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the worst one yet","review":"I bought this car seat when my son was just under 1 month old. He is now almost 4 months. He is small in build, and around 12 pounds. The reason I state all this is to show you I do not have a big baby, he is long and lanky. Thst said we have the worst time snapping him into this seat. Not only is the clasp like a puzzle piece as someone else said, but we cannot make it big enough for my son to fit in. There is not enough room in the restraints. I have actually had to wrestle with it to buckle him, which causes an already unhappy traveler to become even more unhappy. When full blown winter comes I am going to have to put him into something else. What a SERIOUS waste of money. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book, Excellent Seller!","review":"I bought this book for my father as a gift, and he has literally NOT put it down since he received it! He loves the amazing narrative, as told by Mandela himself, and the outstanding pictures throughout the book bring the story to even more vivid life. I literally just had a two hour conversation with my Dad about everything he's read in this book about Mandela's life, and it was only one of many talks we've had since he received the book. I am so glad I got this for him. You will not be sorry purchasing one for the history/world events fan in your life.

A friend built a wooden stairway to make it easy for the dogs to enter the pool, and I was able to find a floating pool ramp which allows Harry & Harley to get out of the pool without assistance.

Ha! That's great!However, the novelty quickly wore off. The engineering on this disc makes it sound like cheap karaoke music, which I found a little irritating. In addition, the cover songs are funny, but like I said, the novelty wears off pretty fast.This CD would be good for parents with small children, because it is awfully precious and I think little kids would find it fun. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. I really don't think that anyone could listen to this CD frequently enough to justify the purchase.The bottom line is, Petty Booka is cute Japanese girls performing Hawaiian ukelele music.

I read \\"Beauty Queen\\" (second book in series) and I really enjoyed it. \\"Material Girl\\" was a bit disappointing only because I didn't like Robin at all. She has no redeeming qualities and was annoying to me. Kinda like Carrie from Sex in the City. A birdbrain who thinks the world should revolve around her. Jake was ok. I had such high hopes for this plot but it just didn't pan out. Too dull and do we really care about the parents.....I know I don't. The story didn't move along as I'd hoped.

At first glance, this tiny novel is deceptively simple in its structure and format. Without serious looking at the novel, it would appear to be flat and empty. Most of the chapters are less than 1 1/2 pages. There is no strong plot line but mere episodes in Esperanza's life and neighborhood. Yet, if you read this piece of literature as Sandra Cisneros wrote it to be read as a extended poem rather than a prose work, you can begin to see the depth of the characters and the action in the novel. The uses of color, imagery, and simple language all make the poetic influence stronger. For example, in the chapter titled \\"Hips\\", Esperanza describes her hips as \\"Ready and waiting like a new Buick with the keys in the ignition. Ready to take you where?\\" (pg.49) House on Mango Street is a great piece of writing with many layers to it that teachers are always looking for instruction in a literature class."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a fun and intriguing book, but a little confusing.","review":"I enjoyed reading it. It reminded me of how insightful young children are to the world around them. It examined Esperanza's life and the type of community she grew up in.

As a professional myself, I have adopted some of his techniques over my more difficult and time consuming finishes that I use. I look forward to his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, basic book about various painting techniques","review":"I liked this book. It has very good instructions with pictures. The author is also rather eclectic and makes jokes throughout. It can be annoying, but it kept things upbeat. I would have liked more in-depth discussion and more pictures of the samples of each technique. The idea to always test your paint idea on a woodboard (before doing an entire room and then not liking it) is a great tip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is fauxbulous","review":"I reviewed several faux finishing books.

It is also pleasant to read and full of nice pictures. I plan to buy Vol. 2, as well as Vol. 3 and 4 when these become available. I didn't read D & S books and they seem to be also fine.

As soon as I got home, I logged on to Amazon.com and ordered a copy. It's an outstanding album all the way through: the performances sound spontaneous (even in the studio setting), the recording quality is excellent, and the tunes are well selected to show off both performers' range of styles, from cheery to meditative to bumptious. When I read the liner notes later, I was astounded to note how many of the tunes were original compositions by the two performers (mostly Liz Carroll) -- the melodies are interesting and piquant, but they're so thoroughly in tune with tradition that they sound as if they've been around for hundreds of years. The album is an impressive achievement in both composition and performance, and if I could give it 10 stars I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic music lover","review":"If there are any two musicians better at their instruments than these two I'd be surprised.

However, other than \`wow they play fast' and \`gee that sounds tricky', I find nothing here that moves me emotionally. Furthermore, the production is very slick and I don't care for it. The fiddle sounds too smoothed out and the guitar is too high in the mix and has a high frequency hype that I find irritating.I realize these are two highly respected players and certainly some will and do love this cd, but I wanted to state an alternative perspective so that others may know that this is not an automatic go-to great ITM disc as others have professed here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in fiddle and guitar","review":"Liz Carroll and John Doyle are wondeful musicians on their own.

I was excited to start reading some of this advice, but once I started, I wondered why I even bothered buying this. Most of the tips in this are pretty stupid and just obnoxious, and the \\"good\\" advice were mostly just common sense things anyway. The only part of it that I enjoyed and found useful was the section on how to put out a microwave fire. Obviously, others enjoyed this though, so maybe it just depends on the person and their situation. I mean, I know who my roommate will be, and I won't be having to use a public bathroom, just for some examples.

The Squirt P4 weighs a mere 2 ounces, yet provides pliers, screwdrivers, knife, awl, file, and bottle opener.The knife and awl have obvious advantages in the backcountry. The pliers can be used to crush, twist, and pull all sorts of things. Unlike other models with nail files, the P4 sports a heavy duty wood/metal file, which can be useful for flint strikers and magnesium sticks, among other things.Everything combined, it's lightweight and functional, exactly what I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still a dippy hippy","review":"From her early Lisa Gilkyson goofiness on being a \\"rainbow warrior\\" to her pacifist dopiness, a lovely voice is wasted.

The software was actually released with a catastrophic bug and won't start with out the download patch. Graphically, the game is weak and unimpressive. I realize that it's built with a new 3D engine, but still; I expected more. It's rated \`M' but I really don't know why: the gore is quite tame. Game play is slow and the objectives are rather unintuitive (I was stuck a number of times and had to use an online walk-through).The storyline is weak at best and the ending was not worth playing for. I would suggest you save your money and get a better / more stable 1st person shooter.

Installed great and when I went to play it... it would not work. I am serious! I spent hours going through the readme files with a fine tooth comb and they will tell you in the same file that THEY KNOW the game will not run with the majority of sound and video cards on the market. I patched the game and even installed it's included safe mode drivers (Yes it comes with a safe mode version- so what does that tell you!) and it still didn't work. I patched it- nothing! Wrote customer support and they said that they are aware; and I quote, \\"Like yourself, we are very disappointed at the problem you are experiencing and are working hard to correct this\\".

It can be very frustrating but if you think(or look online), you will get passed it.I would rate it a 4 star, but when I get stuck, it takes a while to figue out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Away","review":"It's the same DVD as Death By Decibels .. Read those reviews.The producers put out the same DVD, which BTW has little to do with the band, under several different titles with different covers in order to rip-off the fans of a band the producers have nothing to do with. The cover gives you no clue that the Deftones are not on this DVD.I also got ripped off by buying the same Muse DVD twice by producers who had nothing to do with the band.In future I will be reading the review of a music DVD before buying from a music store.This sort of crap only serves to hurt the bands, the music stores and the music industry in general.

The story of this noble turned stonecutter in the often brutal medieval period was nothing short of magnificent. Although this book is out of print and quite lengthy (899 pages)it is well worth the historical romance lovers time to read this magnificent story! Love, honor, hate, feuds and heart wrenching forgiveness. This novel covered it all. Absolutely fabulous!

The accuracy of the times, mores, and construction details flow with any research I've done. The depth of characterization and heart have overwhelmed me. I cried, laughed, and groaned. I cursed Ralf Isambard, and praised him. I hated to have to sleep, disdained the age of my eyes at times, and had to pause to weep, occasionally. The length of this work should not be allowed to deter anyone, I am recommending it to my daughters, and friends. This is, thus far, the best I have read of Ms. Pargeter, or of any of my favorite authors. The reviews given by the professionals don't do this story justice, but it is the most compelling story.

In addition to that I found some printing mistakes in some of the examples in LookupDispathAction and MappingDispatchAction classes. I saw such mistakes somewhere else also in the book. The Tiles chapter does not cover some of the basic things, which someone new to Tiles should know.Overall I do not think I would recommend this book for struts. I liked the book Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework by Ted Husted and Struts authors, which covers the nitty gritties on every struts topic and is more thorough."},{"rating":"2","title":"top notch - hands down the best struts book","review":"I reviewed several Struts book before choosing this one. there are several books to pick from and hands down this book has the most up to date coverage. most of the other books only cover struts 1.0 with some of coverage of 1.1. this book has a clearer tutorial teaching style and many others jump around too much. this book is also a great reference. I often have to ask the members of my team to give me the book back since they always use it for looking stuff up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This an excellent resource book. Every developer who uses Struts as their application should seriously look at getting this book. I've been using the Struts framework since 2000 and this book is exactly what is needed in a team environment. If you have new developers on your team, this book can bring them up to speed very very quickly. James Holmes breaks out the entire Struts framework in a logical and well thought out way.

We've also found the book to be very helpful for the experienced developer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let this be your struts primer","review":"If you are about to start learning the struts framework, then i would recommend 2 books, start your learning with this book (the complete reference) and finish your reading with : Jakarta Struts Cookbook.This book does a good job of describing the various elements of the struts framework individually with a Demo that builds on as we progress through the chapters.The second part of the book is a manual for the tag libraries. The example usage of individual tags with attributes is very helpful.This is something that lacks in the usual java documentations.The explaination for the dtds (struts-config,validator,tiles) is also helpful.The author has also build a utility (which is available for free download from his site) called the \\"struts console\\" which is a gui tool to configure the dtds.Parts 1 and 3 are good for learning while part 2 servers as a good reference material."},{"rating":"1","title":"The online documentation is better","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, and will probably not buy another from this publisher (McGraw Hill/Osborne).

The tropics are on his mind and he devises a plan to escape his harrowing existence and trade it in for a real life filled with palm trees and sunshine.

This was the only one that did and it even included an example. Even though there are two errors in the code which prevents the palette example to work correctly in 256 colors mode, the author still has the merit of being the only one to have the courage to explore that difficult subject.Most difficult areas of Microsoft Foundation Classes are equally well explored.

Looks great on my stainless steel topped island, blends right in. The bottom tray should have an area for the water to drain into the sink because it does show water marks and needs to be wiped quite often to prevent them. You do not have to use the tray though because it is not attached. This rack is not meant for a lot of large items such as pots & pans, but works fine for small things that I do not put in the dishwasher.

This would probably be considered the \\"drug\\" album.It still rocks, but a majority of the songs have a trippy sound...lots of weird echos and studio noise.This seems to be the bastard child of the early years, but I actually think it's better than NITR....but just barely.How can you argue with songs like the title, \\"Get It Up\\", \\"Kings and Queens\\", \\"Sight For Sore Eyes\\" and especially the closing rave-up \\"Milk Cow Blues\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The whole is less than the sum of the parts, but...","review":"...I still like it, regardless. Like it a lot, in fact. There is some really good material here, definatley worth checking out. True, this is no 'Rocks' or 'Toys in the Attic' but it has its own unique charm. My favorite songs here are the title song, I Wanna Know Why, Critical Mass, and Kings and Queen, which was written by Joe Perry. Pick this up, keep an open mind, give it a chance, and maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the way I remember but smaller.","review":"Sound as good as the record without the white noise.

In fact, it's still fits in very well with rock of the '90s and surpassing rock that is coming out today. Bad press simply serves those seeking work and/or providing job security...Being born in 1960, we literally wore the grooves thin on 'Draw The Line' LP. My musical taste hasn't wavered that far off the groove in over 30 years and to see this album offered in a 20-bit re-mastering is a welcome approach.Simply put, Just get the album-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad album at all","review":"I can't say I understand what a lot of people's problem is with Draw The Line. It is a fantastic album in my opinion. I give it 4 instead of 5 because I don't think it is as good an album as Toys or Rocks, but still, it is a great listen. There isn't a bad song on it, and in fact, it spawned a few hits to end up on a greatest hits album. In my opinion, if you're an Aerosmith fan and you don't own this album, you won't be dissapointed if you get it. It has the great bluesy/rock Aerosmith feel that has made them the classic that they are today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling might slowed by the likes you...","review":"It is interesting to go back and listen to the older, less known 70's Aerosmith records twenty-some years after the fact. Toys and Rocks are still well received and continue to spin on R & R stations around the country (and for good reason). Not so for the likes of Draw the Line or the equally stellar Night in the Ruts. No surprize because the stations still take the safe road. Anyways, Draw the Line definitely deserve another listen. Songs like 'Sight of Sore Eyes', 'Draw the Line' and 'Kings' serve-up the funk- fortified metal that still makes you want to grab yo mamas vacuum cleaner and scream into like you know who. And that goes equally for Night in the Ruts. 'No Surprize', 'Chiquita' and 'Cheesecake' will leave ya with a 'Three Mile Smile'..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does this one get so many bad reviews?","review":"Draw The Line is sloppy, groovin', and coked out as all hell. It has the great vibe of a band hangin' out and partyin' and knockin' out a sloppy record and I actually prefer this to their more polished stuff.Rocks was my first Aerosmith, and it was so-so but nothing I wanted to listen to more than a couple times. I picked up Draw The Line and can't stop listening to it.If a good, raw, rock and roll record is what you're after don't hesitate to pick this one up.

You won't be disappointed. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Bag","review":"Like many other reviewers, the band was in decline on this batch. The record starts off strong with the gritty Title Track and I Wanna Know Why(probably the best track on the collection). However, afterwards its very much hit and miss with more of the miss quality. Kings And Queens is fairly creative at elast with some noteworthy piano, strings, and Tylers best vocal performance on the record. Get It Up is a cool track but the rest is mediocre or even abysmal.

It was then that I read so many people slamming this album.\\"What! \\" I said to myself.

Aerosmith lost their rhythmn they once possessed on the prior four cds that were all five-star efforts. This album along with the latter day Aerosmith stuff is just noisey as far as I am concerned. I have the first four releases (Aeromsith, Get Your Wings, Toys in the Attic and Rocks all 5*****), but they no longer impress me except maybe for a track here and there.

However, in retrospect I should have bought a new one or a used one in very good shape. I received this cd and on the last song it starts, then stops, then replays the entire song. Also, the person I bought this from just burned the cd so when you download it on an ipod you just get \\"Track 1\\" etc so searching it on your ipod is a challenge. I should have known better.

The chapters on Edison are particularly useless. Edison is painted as directly murdering three people (a childhood friend, a drug addict and his first wife) and indirectly causing the death of many more. The portrayal of Edison as a sadistic torturer is so at odds with what is known about him, that it makes me wonder what references the author was using. There are none listed. It is as if the author has a personal vendetta against Edison. The story itself is told in a disjointed style as noted by a previous reviewer. It is difficult to read because of the misspellings and the number of people who just pop into the story without introduction. How any publishing company could print this book and sell it as a work of non-fiction gives the whole publishing industry a black eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"extension kit","review":"pro: great price. including shipping.con: Having purchesed this exact opener extension before I expected it to be the same great design as before.

Reading accounts of historical figures and events should be intruiging, even fun, and not as boring as this book.The life and death of Captain Robert Nairac is one of the most compelling stories related to the Irish troubles, regardless of which side you're on.

The first book hooked me. It was a fare read and I took a few days of free time to finish it. The next I found I had trouble reading. It dragged but I could see a goal and could wait for it to come to appear. Oddly Some things seemed rushed. The third book seems to ramble. I had a hard time to even finish it. so many pages were wasted on plot points that were neither interesting nor moved the story forward. It almost reads like a stream of consciousness composition. It is clear that the book swelled to over 700 pages because a filter wasn't applied to rough ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional installment","review":"The Farseer trilogy are some of the best books I have read in my life. Many have gone into detail about the books, so I will just quickly sum up my experience.This trilogy grasped me and would not let me go. I was completely immersed in the world and the joys, and mostly agony, of Fitz. This last book in particular was extremely emotional and painful for me. My heart ached at the events in the book, especially towards the end. Although I wish things could have ended differently, I think the end that I wanted(and by the look of other negative reviews, many others) would have been a little too cliched and hard to believe. So overall, although it left me with an aching heart, I am pleased with this book. Hobb is a magnificent author and I am looking forward to reading the Tawny man trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, boring and painful","review":"Wow. This was the slowest book I've ever read. Like many of the other reviewers, I thought that this book was about 500 pages too long. To make it worse, many of the truly interesting elements that were focused on in the book were wrapped up in about 5 pages at the end. Instead of those interesting elements we, once again, got to focus on Fitz's misery--over and over and over again. It just seems that the author lost her steam on this book and even part of the second book. It's too bad because there was a lot of potential to make this more expansive and focus on the issues of the kingdom. It just felt like a waste of time. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading, good book but not perfect!","review":"This I think was the expected ending to the series - not sure if I've just read too many fantasy novels now but I could see what was going to happen pages before it did! That's not to knock the book - it was good, and hard to put down (a sure sign of a winner) but maybe it was a bit too drawn out. There was a point at which the words seemed to be just to fill a quota rather than tell a story.There is an especially nagging tendency for Hobb to repeat/summarise events at the start of each section of these novels using 1, 2 or even 3 paragraphs - though it is nice enough as a refresher I found it got very tedious by the second novel! Still a great trilogy and this was a good if a bit melancholy ending! 4 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"Okay, so I was disappointed with the ending of this book just as much as the next guy. I wanted to see Fitz live happily ever after, but what I got was reality. Well I still loved it. Robin Hobb is an amazing author. She has the ability to make the reader care immensly for her characters while at the same time constructing a complex and interesting plot. I highly reccommend!P.S. For those of you wishing Robin Hobb would continure Fitz's story with another series, you'll be getting your wish! She is currently working on a three book trilogy continuing in Fitz's point of veiw. Pretty exciting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No pleasant, but real life ending","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers. It is a great book, the story is enthralling and the end uncompromising. I was fascinated by the idea of an hero who really endures and though deserving receives hardly nothing at all personally. love ends,he loses many of his friend and his health, although he saves the crown and mankind. Fitz remains, as is often mentioned in the book, the catalyst of the story, and does not , as usual in the young prince who wins the crown and the girl. All those people complaining about the end, perhaps criticize its true greatness: not to give in to the easy, usual fantasy concept of sugar endings.It is tragic and I nearly cried frustrated.Does anybody remember what happened to Frodo in Lord of the Rings; III? Fitz fate is just as sad and lonely in its depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anticlimax and the long road to nowhere","review":"This book revolves around the characters being twisted up emotionally continuously and talking about it a lot. It's a very long journey for them and you to the climax of this story, and when you get there all the exciting stuff is paraphrased. Reader beware! Stop with her first one which was excellent and imagine it was a stand alone. I was tricked and bought the rest of Fitz series 1 and all of 2 after the first book and greatly regret it. Fitz especially is feminized as most of her male characters are and it's hard to swallow. Why didn't she just make the protag a woman???????Sorta spoiler BEWARE!!We must find the dragons! They're sooooo important, it's soooo hard to make them, soooo much sacrifice.... MANY MANY PAGES of buildup.... and then one chapter of \\"the dragons did this\\". Fitz wants out of all this, hell so do I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Oh Why","review":"I don't understand why the author would write a third book for a trilogy that discards almost everything set up in the first two books, including most of the characters. This book feels like the beginning of a new series, not the end of one, and slogging through the pages in which nothing of note happens is so frustrating that it almost feels like the author wants to alienate the reader.I'm around half-way through, and although I've never done this in my life, I think I may just put the book down because my burning desire to find out what happens to a character in whom I've invested so much time has been burned away by the tedium and plot-holes of these 400 pages. Or, after reading the other reviews, I may just jump forward and read the end of the book so i can have my unsatisfactory ending and be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing conclusion to the trilogy...","review":"The previous books unfolded a whole new world in almost a \\"realistic\\" way. The concluding part, \\"Assassin's Quest\\", ruined that illusion. The first part of the book, of Fitz going after Regal was the same good quality reading that was the lifeline of the previous books. Then Fitz started hearing \\"Come to me...\\" and everything went down. The last 2/3 of the book was actually boring! Traveling stories and frequent beatings soon caused me to lose my interest, and the ghost cities with Skill-rocks and -roads, carving dragons and becoming one yourself, just didn't fulfill the expectations I had for the Elderlings... The best chapter was the last one, explaining what happened after the \\"epic\\" part of the story was finally finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but who is her editor?!!!!!","review":"I really have enjoyed ready Ms. Hobb's books.

I usually dislike when the hero gets \\"reset\\" and has to start from nothing, especially multiple times. However, Hobb did a fine job with the initial books.Assassin's Quest ruined it all. Nothing 'exciting' happens during this book. Walking, talking to one's self, more walking, and finally wrapping up 3 books worth of questions in the span of a few pages made me almost sorry I'd read it.It was well written, but ended so horribly I'd suggest anyone interested in the trilogy stop after reading the first two."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely well-written and engrossing book...","review":"I cannot say how much I loved this book, and the entire trilogy.

Otherwise, it was a satisfying and good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hasty ending...","review":"I could not put down the two previous books. I totally fell in love with Fitz. Halfway throught the second book I learned that Robin Hobb was actually a woman, which explained Fitz's almost immediate acceptance of Molly's Misterious new lover. He never questions her as to his identity. As a man I can tell you that if the woman I love tells me she's found another, my first reaction would be to find out who it is, not to simply keep going about my business and drink to her happiness right after she leaves me! It also explains Fitz's blind devotion and faithfullness to molly, specially when he rejects Starling twice. The ending gave me the feeling that Ms. Hobb was under dead line preassure from her publisher. I also think that after all Fitz when through he earned one moment of glory at the end...or at least not such a lonely ending...Other than that, GREAT READ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great Series","review":"Never have I read such a heart tearing tale, a tale that will never be excelled.

But this one left me thinking a lot. The Fitz did everything for his King like he was asked and in a way did give his life. But at the end he lost everything he cared about. The ending actually depressed me and I just about cried for the guy. Overall this book was excellent a little slow in couple of parts but the rest made up for it.

It really does [draw] you in, and I think the character development is beautifully done.However, I must admit that I enjoyed the first two books better.

That said, it is still a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawn out in excruciating detail then it's over","review":"Very disappointing.

The author victimizes the main character way too much, makes Regal way too evil. They make everything go wrong for him, I seriously think it would've been a happier book if the main character died. *SPOILERS AHEAD* Then at least his heart wouldn't have been broken. The kings and princes demand too much from him, the characters become suddenly stupid after the first book. In the 3rd especially everyone is stupid, everyone is willing to believe the propaganda, even the stupidest lies. Fitz himself turns into a blundering idiot who falls into traps too often. *SPOILERS OVER* I already got the first book of another of her series (I got it before reading the 3rd book) but I am wary to read it because I don't wish to be so disappointed by later books in the series. IF YOU LIKE A TRAGEDY THIS BOOK IS PERFECT FOR YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfection","review":"This last book was \\"the big bang\\", reading this book one could say is like going on your own incredible journey. The story is filled with so much change, the characters go through some amazing and unexpecting twists and turns. The pages are full of magic, the writing of the quest comes alive, each scenery and detail emblazned on the mind. You will worry,laugh, and maybe cry ( i know i did). Describing this book is like describing color or sound, you simply can not unless you see or hear it for yourself. This trilogy was wonderful, so wonderful that i read the second trilogy about Fitz \\" the tawny man\\". I know alot readers did that too, we just got so attached and could not let go -sniff,sniff-.

The first 730 you get to know every thought of every character, what they ate, drank and wore day by day than just when you think something is going to happen....it does'nt. The last 27 pages wraps up the story in a hurry in an ending that is totally unsatisfying. I would not waste my time on this one unless you just feel you need to wrap up the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"tasty","review":"the only dissapointment was the conclusion.

Prehaps, its the way of life, and we dont always get what we deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't compare in any way with books 1 &2","review":"I waited months to read this book and when it finally came out I was so disapointed. I thought the beginning had so much potential, but it was simply wasted. The plot is engaging for the first half of the book, and then goes completely downhill to the point of being very tedious and very boring! And why does Fitz have to end up alone after such an epic! After reading 2000 pages how can that ending satisfy anyone?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best stories I've ever read.","review":"If you are looking for nonstop slugfests between wizards and warriors and monsters, the Farseer trilogy may not be the fantasy for you. If you are looking for a well-written story with great characters and heart-wrenching drama, told from an unsung hero's point of view (and add in some magic, just a few battles, and a dragon or two at the very end), then I think you will love these three books as much as I did. Make sure you have plenty of time to put aside for this, so you can read it slowly and enjoy it to it's fullest."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!","review":"I enjoyed reading the first two books in the Farseer series. This final book dragged and dragged and dragged and dragged. I wondered if Fitz and his companions would ever find Verity. And when they did ----- NOTHING. It is as if the author and editor had no ideas for character or plot. The book died along with the personalities of the major characters. Then to end the 3-book Red Ship war with a 3 or 4 sentence hindsight . . . and the red ships were defeated. Unfortunately, I have already purchased the first book of Hobb's next series prior to reading Assassin's Quest. I wonder when I will have the courage to open the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, depressing ending","review":"I read a LOT of books and enjoyed the first book very much just like I enjoyed Robert Jordan's first book in his \\"Wheel\\" series. But this series, like Jordan's, just got more and more depressing.Maybe life really is all that depressing, but I read to enjoy and relax, not have sad feelings follow me around hours after I put down a book.I will really have to check out reviews of Hobb's next book before buying any more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadfully long way to disappointment","review":"Like may other readers I had hoped the Fritz (main character) would develop and take an active role in his kingdom. However his character was painfully stagnant, neither sharp of wit or sword. Clearly 500 pages of monotonous trudging to get to an ending that just was like \\"really?\\". To sum it all up Fritz; lived as a defeated coward for three long books and at the end of this \\"dashing\\" trilogy, he was still a defeated coward. End of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riviting Saga","review":"Has good continuiation of Fitz's life and restoration of the Kingdom. His quest isn't just to find his king but to protect his child."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best fantasies I've read","review":"This is one of the best fantasies I've read in a long time. And I read a lot of fantasies. And I've been reading them for a LONG time! Unique, complicated characters, No attempt to follow staid old plots. Each book in the series (Assassin's Apprentice, Royal Assassin, and Assassin's Quest) are beautifully tied together but stand in their own right. This is not a simple child's fantasy. It's complex, unique, sometimes harsh. The closest I could compare it to is Wheel of Time. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful ending.","review":"I loved this trilogy. I felt that Fitz was one of the most realized characters I've seen in fantasy. I truly loved him and I felt for him. Many times the end brought me to tears. I felt the bittersweet, more bitter than sweet, ending was true to the characters and I look forward to starting on the next series. If the're half as good as the farseer trilogy, I'll be very happy. I don't think the book was too long. I felt all the detail heightened the drama and tension at the end. I would highly reccommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic trilogy, rushed and depressing ending.","review":"After the Buckkeep centred tale of the first two books this is a pleasant change of setting for fitz's adventures. The ending of his quest for Verity was a very pleasant surprise (refreshing after so many \\"crest the final hill to find the glowing city/dragon/magic item\\" endings). The story not ending with a massive battle over the Red Ships was a nice change, as was the fact that Fitz was not the big hero at the end. The big let down for me was the way Fitz was left. Fair enough to lose Molly (and Kettle/Kestrel's speech on \\"not truly loving each other, only that time in their lives\\" rang painfully true for me), but for Fitz to be so isolated from all his surrogate mothers and fathers and was a major disapointment. I hope that this will lead to further tales of the Six Duchies, with Starlings comments about Fitz being an \\"old man in a young damaged body\\" giving me something to wish for. PS What did \\"Fitz Fixes Feists Fits\\" mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"After reading the previous books in the series, I was expecting more from the ending. The book was very interesting until he went looking for Verity. After that it was long and streched out for miles... Then to finish it with a tragic ending?!? After all that, I didn't find it believable that he would end up a hermit. And Nighteyes lazing around? I would think they would find a mate for him...or they would go hunting frequently, or something... All I can say is that it was very dissappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"AQ is a superb conclusion to the Farseer Trilogy","review":"Robin Hobb was the first female fantasy writer I have read for some time. I always thought that women couldn't write fantasy well, but she has proved me wrong. The stunning ending, which is bleaker than many other fantasy novels, leaves you with a sense of melancholy at Fitz's situation. There is so much character development and plot that the book sometimes becomes too complex. Those that complain that the book is too long have forgotten the incredible journey that Fitz embarks on and the number of incredible escapes he makes from the clutches of his evil half-brother Regal.Unlike other reviewers here, I found the ending to be one of the most extraordinary in ANY book I have ever read. Yes, it isn't totally upbeat, but it is much richer for that. Robin Hobb is the future of realistic fantasy, and in my opinion one of the most talented writers in the genre at the moment. I can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"whhhhhyyyyy?","review":"*Contains spoilers* Throughout the whole series the main character has suffered dramatically. Nothing in is life is meaningful except for the girl he loves. I know this isn't real life and that things don't go right and just fit perfectly, but after suffering this long for 3 books I felt that there should had been something for him. (and for the audience)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually not as bad as some have said. *NO SPOILERS!*","review":"Just finished reading the Farseer books. I was impressed with the characterization and the way Hobb tied up all the loose plots. The protagonist's ending was believable. Hobb writes the story in first person, but is able to use third person to tell stories of others via The Skill. Smart lady. Her portayal of the young man who grows to a grown man was excellent. She leaves certain things out of the story until the very end which is nice. That way, you the reader, will not be able to say, \\"Oh, I know what's going to happen here.\\" She does not tell you specific things until the very end that ties things together wonderfully. I am impressed. Read these books, and you too will enjoy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"enchanting, as good as lord of the rings","review":"if you thought \\"lord of the rings\\" to be a good book - than you must buy this book, and fast"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a major dissapointment!","review":"The first 2 books were excellent but the author doesn't seem to understand what fantasy readers want in what is basically escapism. The trials that Fitz goes through as a \\"kings man\\" are definatly enough to warrant his \\"getting the girl\\" in the end. I was so dissapointed with this ending that I'm certain I will never buy another book by Robin Hobb. She is obviously very talented but I wont spend my hard earned money on the possibility of getting another trilogy that is 2 parts fantasy and one part horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of its kind","review":"Most fantasy books can be described as someone lights and raises a torch in the darkness. Different books, different amount and kind of light. But your spirit soars, because there is light in the darkness so you feel good after reading the book. With the Farseer trilogy, there is only darkness in the dark and I felt miserable after reading the books. I am happy only because other people thinks these are good, so I was able to get rid of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After the first two great installments in the Farseer Trilogy, Hobb bungles the closing piece. Read some George R.R. Martin or Steven Erikson and stay away from this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap (an english term!)","review":"Pitty - the first two books had me hanging on the edge of my seat waiting for the third - and what a disappointment it was.

I await ur next (reading soon, after Otherland pt 3 - hope that doesn't go the same way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great 300 page book. Too bad it's 700 pages long....","review":"Haven't been this disappointed since I got sucked into George Martin. Love fantasy and there's so little good stuff out there. Great concept, first two books in the triology were good to great, last one was horrible. It went on and on and on. Occasionally it's good if something happens in a book, and precious little happens in this book until the last 30 pages. Not recommended. Go read the lies of Locke Lamora instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deus ex Machina","review":"The subject sums it all up. I think that Robin Hobb was written into a corner and had no way out but this ridiculous ending. The first two books in this series were great, and most of the third, but I just can't forgive the end. It reminds me of Neal Stephenson's abrupt finish at the end of Cryptonomicon or The Diamond Age, but without any of the subtlety or polish that take his sudden endings and turn them into gems. A disappointing conclusion to a fantastic trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with it already","review":"The first two books were great, with one exception. It appears that a major theme of the story is Fitz growing up. But he doesn't. He nearly dies in one stupid decision only to \\"learn better.\\" Then, having survived that calamity, he moves directly to make some new dumb move. He's not really learning anything. He doesn't get smarter.Also, the trip to Verity is annoying. Go to find Verity. Get betrayed and captured. Escape. Go to find Verity. Get betrayed and captured. Escape. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. It makes for tedious reading.With all that said, Robin Hobb is a great writer. I hope the next books don't fall into similar patterning because I really enjoyed the first two in this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series, good book","review":"This series was a wonderful read for me and I really enjoyed the creativity of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"And then there was completion","review":"Oftentimes series end leaving you not quite happy, not quite feeling the completion that an ending should have. Hobb does a great job in achieving the meaningful and completed ending. Not only is the book written well with a great plot and storyline, but it doesn't fall prey to the normal endings that are so often fallen into. Without going into detail, this ends with a more real note to it than the typical fantasy book endings (all in smiles and happy endings). And yet it works wonderfully.I would certainly recommend this series to anyone who is looking for a fantasy author to read. I would rank Hobb right up there with Bakker, Martin, and Williams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme let down!","review":"The first two books of this series had me thoroughly intrigued. The combination of politics and fantasy had me locked in my room for some steady reading. Then this final book brought every thing back crashinng to earth. How could you rush a finish and ruin a series at the same time? 3 book limit from publisher? I hope so! I hope Robin Hobbs future contract or imagination allows for more books to do things the way they should have been, right to the final period."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long journey that the reading audience is invited on...","review":"The series was so damn good that I was somewhat let down by this book (the first time that I read it). I have since reread the entire series 3 more times (sometimes you just find a darn good series). I now have a different idea on the ending. It suits the book but is very bittersweet. No ridicously happy endings. This book is a serious conclusion to a very powerful series. I do reccomend it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Literary Disappointment of My Life","review":"This series begins with a well crafted plotline, intriguing character development, and finely crafted prose. The plot in this third book falls apart. It becomes like a skipping record where events seem to repeat themselves. Nor does any real character development take place in this book. Perhaps, I was most disappointed because an idea that began with so much potential devolved into a third rate hack job. I will NEVER read anything by Hobb again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hobb is Burnt Out","review":"After reading the 1st two books in Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy and enjoying them immensely, I was more than just a little disappointed in the 3rd volume. Hobb appears to have burnt out. He devotes pages and pages to boring pointless journeys, opens a promising theme - Old Blood - and never develops it and his evil king character develops a split personality, alternatly swinging from evil genius to drug addeled dilettante. I finished the book but it was so poorly done I had a real hard time not just chucking it part way thru."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow plodding completely narrow plot with no imagination","review":"After such a good first book in the series, I was disappointed with the second, but hoped it was just a bridge to a quality end book of the trilogy. The book was terrible. There was very little in the way of twists from the plot established at the end of the first book, and the author continually repeated entire paragraphs of events which spoils the narrative. The authors imagination of magic was somewhat flawed in that obvious uses that would destroy the plot were left unexplored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This book has a bit of everything. Its not very predictable, a bit meloncholy and you end up wanting to read the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible third book to an otherwise solid trilogy","review":"Hobb fails to deliver in the third book of the trilogy. The protagonist, FitzChivalry, does not have a direct confrontation with the story's antagonists. The reasoning behind the forging of the kingdom's inhabitants is explained away in roughly a page and a half. By the first third of the book, I realized Hobb would be unable to reasonably resolve all of the conflicts in the story. Very disappointing and very sloppy. I doubt that I will attempt any of her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"Robin Hobb did a great job with this series. I read the last book over an international flight. It kept me enthralled to the end and made me forget the uncomfort of coach flying. I would rate this among my top three favorite fantasy series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ended up disliking protagonist","review":"While the trilogy started out wonderfully with superb character development, Hobb seemed to go downhill with this last in the trilogy. There was so much put in to make sure that the reader truly disliked the protagonist (Fitz). I found myself continuing reading simply to find out the grand finale of the trilogy, which wasn't so grand once I found it out. I gritted myself through endless encounter after encounter and disliking Fitz more and more to get to twenty pages or so of wrapup in the end. And the wrapup wasn't the slightest bit satisfying to me. There were too many questions left unanswered. Altogether disappointing, considering Hobb's excellent start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad ending, but should have been longer.","review":"Robin Hobb has a tendancy to write incredible fatasy series, only to cut the ending short. The conclusion to the farseer trilogy, has the same brilliant prose and captivating magic that makes this a first class series. I disagree with the idea that these kind of fantasy series should be trimmed down. It is the depth of the description of the smaller detials of a story that makes the story come to life. Hobb spends a lot of time bringing the characters to their final destination, but then hurries the ending in a manner that somewhat unsafisfactory. The conculsion was not bad, she had the respect for her story to aviod the unseemly good ending that kills some lesser authors.Overall this is a first class fatasy series that places Hobb as one of the premiere authors in this genre. She writes stories of a managable leangth, which allows her to try new ideas and new kinds of characters in ways that many authors cannot get away with in their 6,000 page epics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Third Book","review":"A stunning end to the series, full of ups and downs, and an overall exciting book! The ending didn't bother me with its shortness, as I feel the bulk of the book was spent on the appropriate subjects: Fitz finding his ultimate \\"quest\\", further explanation of the Skill and Wit, and the land beyond the Mountain Kingdom.I am glad to have found Hobb and more glad to add her to my \\"favorite author\\" list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful ending to a promising series","review":"The Farseer trilogy was great through the first two books. This last book however was not worth the cost of the paper it was printed on. A shame so many trees were Sacrifice for this dribble. I will not muddle along as Hobb does for 750+ pages. I will leave with a stern warning. DO NOT give in to your curiousity. Leave well enough alone. Go buy anything by Michele West, Jacqueline Carey or George Martin. That would be money better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad!","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this entire series. The first book was mediocre with a slight increase in the second and a complete let down with the final installment. To sum it up, having a root canal done at the dentist's office would be preferable than having to read this series again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geez, this thing went on and on and on................","review":"I was already tiring of this fantasy trilogy by the end of book two. Book two could have been pruned by at least 200 pages, and the entire 'trilogy' actually has a plot that's so slim it could have been edited into just one book of around 700 pages. But noooooo, both Hobb's and her publisher stretched as much out of it as possible, obviously so they could make more money.I read Hobbs' 'Liveship' Trilogy and loved it. The story was smart, fast-paced and involved, and set in a world that was full of detail but not overly explained. It was also full of interesting characters. In Assassin's Quest, the 'hero' (if that's what you MUST call him, because he's the biggest idiot ever to appear in fiction) is so incredibly dull and stupid that I just want to do King Regal's job and kill him myself.A huge disappointment. I think this will be the last book I read of Hobb's, as her ability to write believable and compelling fiction seems to be waning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was she tired of the Plot?","review":"After breathlessly waiting for the end of the best set of books that I had read in years, I felt I had been duped by how little thought and effort went into the ending. Was Ms. Hobb tired of the plot? Were there deadlines to meet? What possible explanation could there be for the abrupt way in which this story was laid to rest, or should I say shot in the back. I was so let down, that when her new book came out, I couldn't even bring myself to read the back of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ending Ever","review":"The first book of the trilogy is very good with characters that are well developed and scenery that is well described leaving a person with a scense of being part of the story. The second book of the trilogy starts the decline and is not as enthralling as the first.As for the third book of the trilogy, the first half was slow and the last half was awful. I almost stopped reading during the last fifty pages, but I trudged on. I have Never read an ending as truly gut wrenching as the end of this trilogy. Much of it didn't even flow with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and Slow","review":"I struggled with this book. I struggled to like it, I struggled in wading through chapter after chapter without momentum, endless events of Fitz getting hurt or meandering.I should have simply skipped 600 pages and read the last couple chapters sooner. The first fifty and last fifty pages are decent. The conclusion does wrap up the trilogy, but what you slog through in getting there is terrible. The 657 pages of the Middle needed an editor willing to cut sequences which added nothing to the story. Those 657 pages could be condensed into about 150 pages, and only then would this novel be wonderful.My recommendation is read the first three chapters, and read the last three chapters. You might like the book then; if you read the whole thing, you'll probably get sick of endless angst and Fitz being stupid, and keep putting it down. Like I did. It took me a month to finally finish with this book, due to boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Read With A Disappointing Ending","review":"Robin Hobb takes the time to pull the reader deep into the lives of her characters. I was more invested in the characters of these books than anything I have previously read. I felt the pain and disappointment of the main character as personal attacks. I was right with him through each trial and heartache and on to eventual redemption. Professional reviewers have commented that these books were too long. I think that the investment pays off. Except. This is another of those books where you are really invested and the plot is thick and you know it's the last book and you look in horror to realize that there is only 15 pages left. Someone either got bored or ran into a deadline. I agree with a number of other reviewers. The end was sloppy and unsatisfying. After all the evolution and growth the main character goes through, the ending truly belies the magnitude of the character's strength and accomplishments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I actually pay to be depressed?","review":"Sorry, call me old-fashioned if needs be, but I tend to enjoy a book, or trilogy in this case, that has a GOOD ending. I cannot, in mere words, describe the utter disappointment this shoddy and ill-contrived \\"final chapter\\" engendered within me. I still frown whenever I think of this book; I felt, as a reader, cheated by the author. The plot went from adventurous to flat-out weird straight to contemptuous drivvle. The only reason I rated it two stars is due to the fact that the first two books were engaging. I stronly discourage anyone who doesn't fell like taking a mind-numbingly depressing jaunt through a literary catastrophe from reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read from Robin Hobb","review":"Another great read by Robin Hobb.

Think you have to remember that it's Fitz telling this story and the ending wasn't that slash dash heroish conclusion, and i think that Fitz didn't wanna end the story a second time knowing that he didn't get what he wanted or expected. So when he got to the point of the end he rushed it, in order to end it. . . he was just as scared in his old age as he wrote, then when he was actually living it.

Good Reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Assassin's Quest","review":"This third book in the Farseer triology, ends the series in the only way it could end.

Who cares if it doesn't end with the typical \\"and they lived happily ever after\\"? I found the ending fitting to the main character. It was great to have the central character be a complex and REAL individual. I get so tired of reading about a zillion main characters, stories that never seem to end, and heroes with no faults!

However, I plan on someday changing the system to include a couple shoe racks or more horizontal shelves; to do this, I added these extensions to each of the vertical bars that didn't have them already.The extensions are exactly the same as the two that you get with the Configurations kits, so no worries there; as long as you mount them in the wall correctly (make sure you use anchors if there's no stud behind the screw!), you'll have a closet system that will outlast your closet!The only reason I didn't give the extensions five stars is that they're sold for at least $10-15 each, plus shipping.

I took more pictures and short video in two weeks than I had taken in two years with my old 35mm camera. It is a Minolta Maxium 5000, with a 35-85mm lens and a 70-200mm lens. This Kodak is the most like a \\"real\\" camera that I have seen in a digital format. The macro mode and the sport modes are great. You can even get great 8x10's at the 2 mp setting. You won't be dissapointed with this camera, but I recomend you get at least a 128 mb secure digital card to go with it and take the pictures in at least to 2 mp mode because with all the pictures you will be taking you will want to print them out.

Took awesome pictures, the rechargeable batteries were great, and with a Smart Card, I was able to take as many pictures as my heart desired. But two weeks ago, a year after I bought the camera, it would NOT turn on anymore. I didn't drop it, nor was it exposed to any water and it JUST quit on me, for no reason, which doesn't make sense. I tried to contact Kodak about it, but since it is not within the year warranty, they won't do anything unless I pay, even though I didn't do anything to the camera. It's still in new condition. So, after paying 300 dollars for the camera and dock, I'm out of a camera just because they failed to back their product. If you want to spend that much on a camera that will only last for a short while, just make sure you enjoy it because it won't last you long.

Here are the highlights based on 3 weeks of use.It's memory can be expanded with standard MMC cards. It has good zoom and video with sound. 3.1 MPIX photos have same quality as film based cameras with good lens. Pictures taken with flash are also very good. Exporting pictures to PC is very easy and they can be archieved and edited.There are some negatives as well. The quality of video is poor when exported to computer or video recorder.

It (of course) has a 12-month warranty. 2 weeks out of warranty and it dies. While this has been an excellent camera while functioning, it is particularly frustrating when an electronic item fails moments after its warranty period. Kodak will not budge. Other electronics companies that I've dealt with in the past have stepped up and responsibly honored their warranty slightly beyond norm in appreciation for customer loyalty. So far, no luck with Kodak. After talking to a service center, I've found that the repair is likely to cost me about $200. Important note; the camera was never dropped or exposed to moisture. This is simply a mechanical failure.While this camera was great while it worked, my experience has me doubting that I will replace it with another Kodak."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAIIEE AAIIEE AAIIEE","review":"Camera worked pretty good for 18 months.

It wasn't dropped-in fact I had used it 30 minutes previously, set it on the table, picked it up for a final shot and nada .

So even on a slight downhill, it goes fast. For instance, some other carts/cars have ways to tighten the wheels so that they go slower when your child is younger, this doesn't. It also doesn't turn from the steering wheel, which is just as well for that age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun But Assembly Is Annoying !","review":"We bought this for our daughter's first birthday.

This absolutely fit the bill. One can ride while the other pushes. One of my twins started walking a little more than a week after getting this toy and I believe it helped a great deal.We have had ride ons with lights, bubbles, and sound in the past but those things just break and cause frustration. Sometimes simple is better. The only thing that I think may improve the fun factor a bit is a seat that lifts with storage underneath.

Go listen to the Moody Blues, Procol Harem, Iron Butterfly, Janis Joplin or Bob Dylan music instead--time better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a spelling class","review":"While reading this book, I was constantly annoyed by the countless grammatical and spelling errors found throughout the story. Did Mr. Jedick not proof-read this before sending it to the publisher? I noticed in another review that he graduated with honors but does not know when to use the proper forms of \\"to\\" or \\"too\\". He also made a reference to \\"Brett\\" Butler and Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind. Hello, everyone knows it's \\"Rhett\\"! The book is poignant and entertaining and gives first-hand insight into this very wild decade. I did not dislike it but found it rather trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A VERY GOOD READ","review":"I'm not sure whether the numerous spelling and grammar errors are due to incredibly sloppy editing or whether the author was using them to demonstrate that the narrator isn't a particularly bright person. I think that in more skillful hands this story could have been fairly interesting, but as it is the characters are too one-dimensional to generate much reader empathy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Serving Attempt at Literary Immortality","review":"The book just isn't very good. My neice bought the book for me as a gift. I attended Kent State, and drank beer, WITH Pete Jedick. His accounts of what occurred at that time are too far filled with literary license. This book is not to be construed as an accurate depiction of Kent State, the City of Kent, or what actually occurred during the Spring of 1970. It is an extremely amateurish attempt. I'd like to know what other books the other \\"critics\\" have read. Their general praise is far beyond what this book deserves. I can admire the efforts and dreams of a wanna-be... but the bottom line is still WANNA-BE. My neice wasted her money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful with Great Organization","review":"This is a great study guide particularly because of1. The extensive and insightful content2. The structured and accessible organization of the material/information3. Her ability to concretize the data with multiple, practical examples.It's an expensive book though and it will be wise to flip through the book or borrow it from a library (hard copy); download a sample or even rent it for a day or two (with e-readers) before moving forward with purchase.

Being a first time home buyer/owner, I really thought it would be a useful tool. When it arrived I was very disappointed. 1/3 of the book is devoted to dreams and plans for your house (I already have a notebook for that) and the rest is for writing down information about appliances, paint, repairs, etc. I returned the book and will be starting a notebook. A 3-ring binder will suffice for me. However, for an unorganized person this book might be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Choice","review":"I bought this book because it is attractive, but it has one flaw so annoying that I am currently shopping for something to replace it. The flaw is that the area designated for paint chips is both bigger than the size of an average paint chip and a vivid aqua. I like aqua, but the aqua border that shows around whatever paint chip you add changes your perception of the color (and, depending upon the color, can be incredibly ugly). This problem is a deal breaker for me, as I buy these things to keep track of interior design decisions, and you can't hold the book against fabric, etc. to gauge color matches. The rest of the book is nice looking, but I'd trade the design features for utility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent First Time Out Novel","review":"Frank does an excellent job on this, his first work.

Way to go Frank."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic read.","review":"This book is incredible. I've heard a lot of people complain that the book is shallow, but come on, that's real life. Tom Reasons, the lead guy, is more human than many of the \\"deep\\" characters that you read about. Sure, he drinks a lot, he objectifies women, he gambles, and he doesn't do anything of any worth, but doesn't that describe us all? This character is truer to most guys I know than any I have ever read. If you're looking for deep symbolic meaning and extended metaphors look elsewhere. If you're looking for a real-life character in a great plot, without a ton of pretentious attitude this is your book. If you're not buying this book you're sitting in your beret, discussing existentialism, and reading books by Hume and Foucault that you really don't understand. Tom Reasons is the True american male."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Novel I've Ever Read About Darts","review":"This novel is harmless fun; good airline or beach read. I read some of the other reviews where people were comparing this work to Jay McInerney or other authors and blah blah blah...This novel stands on its own as a funny, smart book. There are not a whole lot of lessons, and Tom Reasons, the protagonist, even says at the end, \\"Don't ask me to add everything up. It's too early in the morning, and I've never been any good at spotting the moral.\\" This book is about gambling, darts, 80s and 90s music, single life in NYC, and, what I think a lot of the other reviewers missed, a novel about friendship. He treats his friends like a jerk, and, like true friends, they are still there to bail him out. Just read it for the fun of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self-guided tour of the Larchmont Manor neighborhood in Larchmont, NY","review":"This is a self-guided tour of the Manor neighborhood of Larchmont, New York (a 19th-century resort for wealthy New York City families, now a 21st-century commuter suburb). It contains about a dozen photos, and detailed, scholarly information on several dozen sites in the waterfront (western boundary of Long Island Sound) portion of the incorporated (1891) Village of Larchmont. It is in pamphlet format (fewer than 96 pages, soft cover, center-stapled, 8.5 by 5.5 inches). The author was the official Village Historian of Larchmont, NY, for 30 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"infuser ruins it","review":"I got this because it has an infuser and I could make tea and drink it all day.Unfortunately the infuser is too small to allow tea leaves to expand, it's a piece of garbage plastic, and the holes are too big allowing tea leaves to escape.After the first pot of tea using the built in infuser I had 2 issues.1. tea tasted like plastic2. i couldn't take the tea leaves out of the infuser since it's so small and narrow.I'll have to use a different infuser. Hopefully the plastic taste is only from the infuser and I can use it as a regular pot.EDIT (Dec 2009):I was reading other reviews and someone recommended these bags to use (100 Finum Tea Filter, Large, Brown). I think this is the only way to use this carafe. I don't want it to be a waste of money... On the positive side, the carafe works ok and tea made with the paper tea bags tasted alright. So it's not a complete waste. It held tea warm for a long period and I like how the base is wide so it's tough to knock over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Unnecessary Collection","review":"Only 9 tracks.

I would say this Sony definitely fits the bill. The 2.0 Ghz Pentium 4 performs considerably fast, you have 512 DDR RAM at your disposal, and the 60GB hard drive is more than enough space to last me a while. The entire system is solid, I just wish it included USB 2.0 slots, but that probably won't be a problem for most users. Also, the graphics card is nothing spectacular, but only hardcore gamers wil probably notice/care.

If you really like Rush, you'll still need to buy several other albums, but for a Greatest Hits collection, it has the minimum. Rush has recorded so many good albums, often with themes, that it's hard to pick/choose and make it all flow on one, so the only reason I'm not going 5 stars is that I think it this collection should have been a 2-disc or more anthology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush for begginers","review":"For the people who listen Rush for the first time, this is the Rush album you need, this is a clear example of their best work. The Rush from the 70's and 80's is an example of creativity, passion and variety, and is just one cd with 16 essential songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fidelity Problem ?? (MP3 version)","review":"With some of these songs, the mid-range and bass are lacking. Sounds like the engineer for the MP3 version screwed up. I like a good bass guitar that is prominent when you hear these songs on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Some, Unnecessary for Most","review":"There are several Rush compilations, and this is not the best but will work well for some. At sixteen cuts and just under eighty minutes, it has songs from every Rush album through 1987 except Caress of Steel. Virtually every Rush song heard on radio is here, and anyone wanting only those will be satisfied. However, Rush is a true album band; deep cuts are often as good as or better than singles, and albums usually work better as a whole. This collection is thus only for extreme casuals. Anyone who is even slightly more curious would be better off with Rush's half dozen or so best albums. There is also no reason for completists to get this; it has nothing new. All this points to the fact that The Spirit was a record company marketing ploy to coincide with Rush's thirtieth anniversary, which is all that need be said."},{"rating":"2","title":"One disc, 16 hits.","review":"I do realize there's the 2-disc \\"Chronicles\\" collection, as well as others, but being a minor fan this made the most sense to me. It has most everything you've heard on the radio (hence the title), plus some. Included is \\"Fly By Night\\", \\"Closer To The Heart\\", \\"Freewill\\", \\"New World Man\\", and the popular \\"Tom Sawyer\\". Plus it ends with my favorite \\"Time Stand Still\\", with guest vocals from \\"Aimee Mann\\". The only thing I wish they had fit on is \\"Show Don't Tell\\", from the album \\"Presto\\". Some copies of this came with a bonus DVD with lyrics and 5 videos too. Overall, these songs are a real \\"Rush\\", and it's a great collection for the casual fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Reason......","review":"... I'm guessing Geddy, Alex, and Neil owed the record company some type of release within this alloted time span but why this? As previously mentioned, these tracks are all available via other compilations and any ardent Rush fan already has all of the albums anyway. The tracks are all great and the dvd is nice but this is just a hastily thrown together collection of tracks purely for the money. Rush could have easily released a live album from their vast collection of back archives which I would have bought in a second. How about the '76 2112 tour or better yet 1978-80's Hemispheres/Permanent Waves era. I guess like all other bands (with rare exception) Rush has become a slave to the record industry... Recommended to bandwagon Rush \\"fans\\" only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Rush greatest hits compilation? Give me a break.","review":"When will this madness stop? I mean, don't we already have Chronicles and the two Retrospectives? And to top it all off, all the songs on this compilation can be found on the 2 CD/cassette Rush compliation, Chronicles. Also, all the videos on the bonus DVD can be found on the Chronicles DVD. So save your money and buy the 2 CD/cassette compilation, Chronicles, and the Chronicles DVD. Universal should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this, as it's just another way to keep making money off a band that's no longer with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"other bands you should listen to","review":"This compilation cd is great but like the other revewer above me stated, it does not cover all of the hits. if you want the real greatest hits get the chronicles.

The song Lime Light is so true. It hits on one of the universal themes, that the world is a stage (Shakespearean). The song The Spirit of Radio speaks of what a great age we live in where we can listen to the Radio for almost free. The song subdivisions is another theme of life. The world is conforming to popular demands. THe entire CD is a gigantic theme and the songs were so well written. The rhyme and rhythm of all the songs mixed with the superb instrumental skills of the band compliments the theme, making this album come alive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not another greatest hits!?","review":"How many times can we buy a cd with the same songs? Obviously Rush is going to find out if three times is the charm. I think their last effort \\"Vapor Trails\\" was definitely lacking as well.

Now, I love Rush, and I own all their releases but I cannot think of any reason to recommend this. Yes, the songs are great. Yes, the musicianship is first rate. However, all of the songs on this release have shown up on two other greatest hits collections \\"Chronicles\\" and \\"Restrospective Vol I and II\\". If you are new to Rush and want a good sample of their music I suggest purchasing the Retrospective releases. They include a much wider range of songs than found here or on Chronicles, which just has two songs per Rush album (three from Moving Pictures). So why release this? The record label knows there are loyal Rush fans out there who will buy any product released and are exploiting them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mercury records selling Rush for own benefit","review":"In 1989, Rush left Mercury Records and went to Atlantic Records. Mercury is still buying off the Rush name and selling overpriced complimations without the bands consent. You shouldn't buy Chronicals, Retrospective I & II and Spirit of Radio or download illegal songs with subpar quality - YOU SHOULD BUY THEIR ALBUMS. When you buy an album by Rush your supporting their career so they can make more quality albums you can enjoy. If all music was free than quality music itself would cease to exist. This is why the RIAA cracks down, it could destroy the existance of music. Take it from me, buy their albums, from Rush to Vapor Trails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chronicles Redone","review":"This is everything you would get in the Chronicles CD and DVD.
