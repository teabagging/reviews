Not only is the sound quality fine, but more importantly, the Berlin Philharmonic plays with ample technical precision and warmth. Still, Karajan's interpretations lack the vibrancy I have heard in recent recordings by Dutoit and Maazel; they tend to be sluggish in their tempi, most notably the \\"Pines Of Rome\\". Karajan is a bit more successful with the works by Boccherini and Albinoni; the string playing is a bit more refined than with Respighi's scores."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mistake.","review":"Bought this CD primarily for the track of Boccherini's Passacalle. This track is a delight, but I should have bought the MP3. The rest of the CD is 'heavy duty' Berlin Philharmonic, and totally out of keeping with the Passacalle.

The car seat covers matched pretty well with my car, though the pattern towards the center looked like snakeskin.

The color is much more brown than tan but the fabric is high quality and design is nice, however the fit is less than to be expected and there are no straps to help secure the covers to the seat portion so they continue to spring off the seat which is frustrating. Perhaps on cloth seats the covers might secure more firmly. I do not recommend for anything but cloth seats as they continue to slide off. The back portion also slides and requires adjusting.

What better way to appreciate the world than to glimpse it through the twisted view of quasi-feminist Andromeda Veal? Better yet, as Andromeda struggles with her concept of God, and pleads not-so-subtly for a dolly, \\"even though they are bad\\", she becomes one of the most endearing characters in the book. And who needs more reason to re-immerse themselves into the life of Adrian Plass himself as he writes letters and sends snippets of his diary to the \\"horizontal attraction\\" Andromeda? Our favorite characters reappear in this book as well, which alone makes it worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarinet Bible","review":"This book is the clarinetist bible like the Arbans is the trumpets bible.

Playing them with such perfect sensitivity and expression falls squarely in the realm of the superhuman. Even after repeated listenings, certain movements of this recording bring a lump to my throat and make my heart flutter. Violinists especially, I think, will discover special meaning and beauty in this recording. However, anyone who listens to classical music will find this recording to be one of the jewels of their CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time Szeryng fan","review":"Szeryng made two complete cycles of the Bach sonatas andpartitas: one in 1954 for Columbia records, and the one currentlydiscussed in 1968. The 1954 recording is a slightly better performance. I have the old Odyssey LP copy of the 1954 recording, and am seeking the quickly-out-of-print Sony CD version of the 1954 recording. Having said this, the DG CD version here offered is a marvelous recording, and cheap to boot. You won't regret this purchase. When Artur Rubinstein first heard Szeryng play Bach, he was reduced to tears and begged to become Szeryng's accompanist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Typical, But Good","review":"This may not be your \\"typical\\" Joe Walsh, if you are more familiar with his earlier solo efforts or his work with the Eagles. However, I think his own personality really shows in this album.Many of the songs highlight his emotions of mid-life transition, so it is equally impactful for those of us going through those same feelings. When an artist puts his emotions into the music, that is what really draws me in. Putting intellect into it is helpful, but not as crucial for me. This album has a good mix of both.Make sure to listen to \\"You Might Need Somebody\\" and \\"All of a Sudden\\". The album became popular with \\"Ordinary Average Guy\\" and some for \\"Gamma Goochee\\" and \\"Two Sides to Every Story\\". My all-time favorite Joe Walsh song is \\"Pretty Maids in a Row\\" (from \\"Hotel California\\" with the Eagles), but this album has a good mix of his own moods and the Eagles."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's solid but not a masterpiece","review":"Honestly, I think this is a pretty good CD. It's got a good mix of different types of \\"Joe\\" songs. He goes from the strong opener \\"two sides to every story\\" with his typical sound, all the way to \\"where i grew up/school days\\" which shows deep emotion and looking back toward his childhood. I think the best cut on the CD is \\"All of a Sudden\\" which I do believe found air time on the radio. This album also highlights the title track \\"Ordinary Average Guy\\" which is about exactly what the title states, being ordinary, average, and a guy. Check out the lyrics, you'll have a laugh with some of them. You should check this CD out if you have nothing better to do, it will be worth your while."},{"rating":"1","title":"its an ok album...there are two pretty good songs on it","review":"Ordinary Average Guy and Two Sides To Every Story are pretty good songs but other than that, I was disappointed..Joe was going through hard times but now that he is clean and sober, lets see how he does on his new album that he is working on right now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Lee - Fist Ringer T-Shirt","review":"I just recieved my Bruce Lee -Fist Ringer T-Shirt today, Great fit, great feel, good quality material, im 1000% satisfied!

The rhythms seem hypnotic at times--shamanistic and primeval. This music gets me in the spiritual gut (listen to \\"Long Way Around\\" if you want to see what I mean). In later works Whitley abandons, to greater or lesser extent, the lyricism displayed here. Living With The Law reveals him, however, as one of the most talent singer/guitarist/songwriters on the scene today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why haven't you bought this?","review":"I remember the first time I heard Jim White, Tom Wait, Leo Kottke. Similar experience with Whitley. It was my first year of college; he made it one of my best.

But first, pop out that too-easily-obtained credit card and toss some debt Chris' way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floored...","review":"Once in a while, an album comes along that I wish I'd written. Without a doubt, this is one of those few and rare albums- it will stay with me until I die. Chris is one of those rare artists worth emulating and desiring to write and perform like. I saw him on the tour for this album in a small club with about 50 people in attendance. It is still the best show I've ever been to. His material is timeless and stands on its own without the big band or all the trimmings. Just Chris and a steel-top git'. What more do ya need?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My #1","review":"I first heard Chris Whitley while listening to the Kevin Matthews radio show in Chicago.

It is nothing like \\"Big Sky Country\\" How are people saying this is the best album. It is not even good. I almost bought his newest album instead because I love the song \\"Radar\\". I was told that this was his best. What a shame. Please, do not listen to others. This album was so boring. It sounds like someone in his garage was just playing out of tune blues with a loud guitar. Not hypnotic, moving, beautiful music like it was supposed to be. Nothing like Daniel Lanois which was why I bought it. Why? Why did this have to be so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonely Lizzy found by students!","review":"\\"On the shores of Bitty Bayou, along a bitsy bog, a lonely little lizard lived in a lumpy log.\\" Over 400 of my primary library students were already hooked into the book by these words and the pictures in Izzy the Lizzy.

This book was a mixed emotion for me, as I had to remind myself that this is FICTION, and historical accuracy wasn't as important as the bodice ripping romance that we look for when we read these types of books. While parts of this story made me roll my eyes and think \\"really?\\" (like most of the beauty and the beast romances do), overall I would recommend this book to those of us who read to get lost in the story, and aren't looking for something that makes a person think to hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Set in the highlands","review":"Can you believe that Duncan doesn't call her \\"lass\\"?

This stroller is comfortable enough for a child to nap in while still being lightweight and extremely durable. I could take this on the bus with my child, fold and unfold it with one hand (no thank you to the strangers who wanted to help by holding the baby), and be on-the-go very quickly. I bought straps to hang from the handles so I could hang my extra large diaper bag, although the storage underneath is pretty generous. As soon as my kids could sit in this front-facing stroller, I got rid of the bigger Graco that cost 5 times as much. Perfect for the urban mom who needs convenience over frills."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE - STROLLER","review":"I've bought this stroller via the internet. I read the reviews and thought - WOW, just what I need for my 10 month daughter. But, boy was I wrong. If you want a sturdy stroller this is not it. The backrest is not firm and you recline it with a string. My daughter is not comfortable. Her back is rounded and she appears very uncomfortable. Her head sticks out and the canopy is flimsy and does not provide sufficient shade. The right side of the leg rest broke after 3 uses. The one good thing about it is that it is light weight...But for the price and becuase of the name Britax I expected a better quality stroller. I could have purchased a sturdier stroller for alot less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stroller","review":"I love this stroller. It is so easy to use, up in a minute, easy to collapse. Even my eight year old can carry it. I would highly recommend the britax stoller. I bought it because I've always had great luck with their car seats. The only thing I would change if I could would be to make the handles longer, but I feel that way with all my stollers. Great color, decent basket, the cup holder is a help. Took minutes to put together. Great buy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not like this stroller.","review":"The Britax Esprit stroller is reallly nice looking and I liked it at first. But after about a month, the recline would lower by itself and the locking clip became really hard to use. The backrest is really just a flimsy piece of plastic that offers no support and it is impossible to adjust or raise when my baby is in the seat. Now I'm looking for a new stroller...I do not recommend this stroller at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"Chained is not my favorite of the Sam Jones novels. This book was again centered on a mystery of sorts and drama (in all forms), but the \\"kick [backside]\\" detective girl was just slightly off (and no mantra to the mini skirt - which is a key Jones symbol). It could be that she has a steady man, or that she was written to be less aggressive, but whatever the reason it makes her less of a hero and more of a normal character. I liked Sam as the [bootie] kick action hero type. I also found the \\"chained\\" part of the story a bit too dark. Over all a good read - but not the best one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth finishing -- or even starting","review":"This book was so \\"not me\\" that I quit reading after five pages.

After I delved into it, I was pleasantly suprised. I though to myself, here was a book written in a slightly arciac style chronicling the adolesence of a nearly forgotten writer that I could still relate to. I suspect the only reason I found it interesting at all was because I like the character in the story was still a young man myself. The way Joyce anaylsizes the times he lives in, and gives philsophical insight, is trully inspiring. I recommend this book to anyone who Irish or not, seek a clearer understanding or themselves, and a glimpse into a now forgotten realm of youth and mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!!","review":"I saw Tift Merritt at a small venue in Chicago, and was completely blown away at her talent.

This is an excellent CD, and it's an even more remarkable one considering it is a debut. She writes her own songs and while her writing is good, her voice and the arrangements are even better. Her voice is a cross between Dusty Springfield and a young Emmylou Harris, with a hint of Sheryl Crow. SOme of the songs have a country or a roots feel, some country-folk, some rock and some pop.

This is easily one of my favorite artists, and her Cd has not left my player in the months that I have owned it. Her lyrics, and her voice just speak to me ..

Let's hope she doesn't go the way of other country chanteuses who start out in roots and end up in pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tift Merritt is AMAZING","review":"How Tift Merritt is not fantastically famous and on everyone's top ten artists lists is beyond me. This is one of the best records I've heard in years--heartfelt, great lyrics, and Merritt is one of those all time triple threats. She is an amazing talent, and if you buy this record, she'll show you what country music really can be. I love this album.

Variable speed is simple to use and effective. The release on the saw dust collection bag is not a zipper but a slide device which works nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"First belt sander lives up to its reputation","review":"I'm a hobby woodworker and just starting to add to my tool collection. This is my fist belt sander and I while I don't have experience with any other sander (other than a Dewault that a friend lent me to scribe a counter top in my laundry room - and it seemed to work well), I believe the Makita lives up to its stellar reputation. Everything just seems to work flawlessly. Once you have belt adjusted, it tracks perfectly. I understand this is the one issue that most users concern themselves with and I can't speak any more highly about it. Tracks straight and true for sure. I'm delighted with my purchase but only give it four stars because for $200 I think it should come with a bag or case.

I highly recommend this 4-pack to collectors that want all of the timeless characters from the comic books and the cartoon. It includes Superman, Lois, Lex Luthor, and Brainiac. This is a great set especially for beginners who've never bought from any of the previous toylines.I'm only disapointed in the Superman figure because his huge arms are basically good for throwing. They have a spring mechanism that makes both arms move together. Otherwise, he is sculpted very nicely to resemble the WB cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for average jobs","review":"I have owned this drill for 5 years and have never had a problem with it.

The live athmosphere makes you feel the performers very close to you and this magnificent concert is recreated in your'e own livingroom. Many things have been said about Michelangelis share here, it's simply superb. But I must say that I found Giulinis share not less noteworthy. The sound of the orchestra opened a new world in the 1st one for me, expecially in the rondo. Giulini doesn't rush through it but keeps it very lively at the same time.

It's like a swim in healing tropical waters. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful performance and recording","review":"This is a wonderful CD, at an excellent price. The interpretation of the First Piano Concerto does allow Beethoven to be Beethoven, as another reviewer has remarked. Some performances of this concerto sound dismissive, but this one is evocative and sensitive.I love the Third, Fourth and Fifth Concertos. The Third was my introduction to Beethoven Piano Concertos through listening and following the score in Year Ten Music classes.

It's not like you don't know what you're gonna get with Michael B, as far as his delivery is concerned. So what you're saying is you buy it and then you're surprised? I don't think so.

The production is very good, everytime you listen to the songs you can hear more and more instruments playing, sometimes it feels like a kind of \\"modern orchestra\\" is playing the music (I am sure you'll feel like this when you listen to the title song called \\"Time,love and tenderness\\", it's one of Michael's most famous song and one of my favourites. I found influences of rock, pop and gospel in this song, in fact Michael has done a lot of black music and his songs that have gospel choirs are part of his label, and to me the best ones!).

Now, the XI can be found at significant discount. The XI is one of the best Asics has made and the XII is probably the worst. The XII is much lighter, but less of a stability shoe and certainly not durable and not made for a heavy runner. I hope that the XIII is more like the XI and less like the XII.

This is a dream cast for this opera. I don't normally think of Bohm as a Wagnerian, but his conducting on this recording rivals von Karajan. Nilsson has always been the ideal Isolde and Windgassen is in surprising good voice as Tristan.

Plus Eaglen has a warmth and flexibility to her voice that Nilsson lacked. Not to mention the fact that she has an equally matched Tristan in Ben Heppner (another incredible artiste).

If vocal gymastics is your thing then you'll be well pleased with what's on offer here.For me, it's about the romance. I want to feel that the players show vulnerability, and a despair that's more....quiet. I want voices to crack, to not hit every high note, to be human. I love this opera and, in the famous Furtwangler version, the music and the voice complement eachother beautifully, increasingly merging until the great final release. It draws you in and its power is ultimately more understated.The Bohm set is exciting, of that there's no doubt. But it's relentless (and tiresome) in its showcasing of Nilsson.

I thought the PVM545 Pepsi Dispenser would be a good compromise, even after hearing the comments about the loud fan, not keeping drinks \\"ice\\" cold, and the presence of water where the drinks are dispensed, I decided it was worth the risk. Not only were all of the above concerns true, but after six months the fan stopped working. The online retailer referred me to the company that makes them (the Helman Group). I contacted the Helman Group and since it was past the 90 day warranty, Helman essentially indicated that I was out of luck. No, \\"Sorry, how can we make it right\\". No, \\"We can locate a part for you\\", No, \\"We can give you a partial credit for another machine\\". Just a standard form email that said were were out of warranty.

My first day with the drink dispenser was fine. I filled it with drinks that were already cooled from the fridge. It did an OK job keeping them cool. The first problem came when the fan noise stated to get louder and louder after the first week of use. It did not sound normal... but it eventually settled down. The second and most relevant problem came when I refilled it. This time with cans at room temperature. They never cooled. Not even after being in there for another week.

And here's the thing about the new maps: they're lame. If you check on available game servers, you'll see mostly original BF 1942 and Desert Combat maps. Secret Weapons maps are rare.

But Mazzel has decided to be fresh-sounding and edgy. It's not your grandmother's Franck D minor, and this is a piece that died out on the concert stage about that long ago. Maazel makes it propulsive and more than a bit gritty. It's a velvet cushion touched with sandpaper and worth hearing.The same goes for Mendelssohn, who epitomizes Protestant respectability and appealed greatly to Queen Victoria. Maazel, this time with a virtuoso orchestra, tries to make the Reformaiton a piece in the mode of Schumann's Rhenish symphony--a flrry of strings, quick pacing, and romantic trust are the guidelines in this performance, with lots of Schumannesque surges in the dynamics and tempi. It's very much a young turk's reading, and frankly I liked it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great Mendelssohn 5 \\"Reformation\\"","review":"NOTE: This review doesn't apply to the Franck D minor that is on the same disc. My main gripes with this performance of the Mendelssohn are that:1) The brass section has an intonation problem. I thought it was especially noticeable at the unison part in the very beginning of the first movement. They aren't horribly out of tune, but enough that it really bothers me.2) The tempo of the third movement is too fast.3) The whole performance, especially that of the restatement of the hymn at the very end of the fourth movement, is too sterile and clinical.Skip this recording and look for the one by Charles Munch and the Boston Symphony. The CD cover has a picture of a butterfly on it. The Munch performance is quite a bit more emotional, and although there seems to be a change to the trumpet part at the end (it ends on the tonic in the Munch instead of the median like in the printed score) it is quite good. I also feel the Munch is better than the Paray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a kids cd that I like!","review":"I will listen to this even when my kids aren't in the car.

While Austrian by birth, it took von Karajan some time to develop a feel for the Strauss family idiom; indeed, the notes say that his earlier attempts (in the late 1940's) produced recordings that were panned as overly-serious and stiff.Never having heard any of those older discs, I can't give a before and after assessment of von Karajan's interpretations. This recording, nonetheless, is quite good. There's dash and volume where appropriate, as well as a melancholy undercurrent where that belongs as well. So, you have a conductor who's finally hit his stride with this type of music, and playing a few lesser-heard pieces as well.

It might have helped if he had paid attention in physics class; he might of understood how the alien was destroyed by water in the third Alien film. His analysis of each film is marred by obvious contradictory elements. Most of his criticisms are not original and could have been overheard in coffee shops in the first week of release. And his rewrite of Alien 4, with Bishop as stud in a sexual fantasy ... ??? That truely boggles the mind. The real problems of the later film lay in scripting and production influences, which is hardly rocket science. The book is not without value, but it wouldn't be particularly helpfull in understanding the success of the first two films and the failure of the second two. In fact, the same bogus intellectualization that took down the later films seems to also ruin Thomson's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Letdown","review":"There is a great book to be written about the Alien series. This is not it. It's not that the subject matter isn't up to the challenge - certainly a film series that spawns one of the strongest female characters in the history of film, guided by four of the finest directors in cinema today is worth exploring. Unfortunately, the author spends 80% of his time in a useless retread of the films' storylines. This is only useful if you haven't seen the films, and then why would you be reading this book? The author also tries desperately (and poorly) to examine the deeper meaning of these films. Unfortunately, one of his central theses (that the aliens have somehow \\"chosen\\" Ripley) is predicated on his misunderstanding of several plot points in Aliens, an inexcusable mistake in a film critic.

It was good to see a vision of Star Trek that had action and aliens that were not all too trustworthy. More than any of the others; this series embodied all the values of Trek.

Relying on lustrous tone, humor and breathtaking musical intelligence, Gilels sets an imcomparable standard wisely highlighted by chronological programming of his choices. The quizzical beauty of small music requires urgent musicianship of both composer and performer, something that defines this CD. I play it every chance I get. Gilels' playing is one of the wonders of the world; I'll always wish he'd recorded more repertory than he did. Thankfully we have this, his Mozart and especially his Ravel. Hard to be disappointed with a CD this fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful performances, muddy sound","review":"Gilels selection of some of the best of Grieg's Lyric pieces are very thoughtful and profound readings. Each piece transports you to some delightful scene, and you really feel yourself there with these renditions.Too bad Gilels never went on to record a more complete collection.There is no *definitive* complete collection of all of the Grieg Lyric Pieces on CD. The only complete sets I am aware of are the Daniel Adni set from EMI and the Eva Knardahl recordings that are part the complete Grieg piano works on BIS. Neither of those sets give anywhere near the pleasure that one gets from Gilels' magical readings.If only BMG would get around to issuing the Liv Glaser set on CD. Then, at least we would have something decent for a complete collection, even if she is still quite distant from the superlative quality of Gilels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at first listening","review":"I heard this recording on LP about a decade ago and I had a crash on this recording. Before I heard this recording, I did not have a very good impression on Gilels. Only other recording of him I heard till then was a brittle-sounding Beethoven's \\"appasionata\\" sonata, recorded in Russia back in the 1950s. In that, he sounded as if he was trying to \\"outbang\\" Horowitz, so when I found this recording, I was more interested in the pieces than their performer. But when I put the needle on the LP, I was absolutely shocked. \\"My God\\", I thought, \\"is this the same Gilels???\\" In these pieces, Gilels became a poet of piano, a gorgeous minituarist. Since then, I listened to this recording countless times, bought a CD transfer, and managed to even learn some of the pieces myself. This CD is really a jewel. Gilels is at his best. Never I heard him play with such an intimacy of feeling and conviction. This is an absolute \\"must\\" for anyone who loves romantic piano music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Einar Stein Nokleberg Complete Set!!!","review":"Grieg's Lyric pieces are miniature jewels and they are well played by Gilels.I wish to recommend the complete set of Grieg's piano works on the Naxos label by Einar Stein Nokleberg which outclasses Gilels both in recording quality as well as in performance.Nokleberg is excellent and consistent throughout playing with incredible sensitivity.Especially the Lyric pieces (Vol 8 -vol 10)is played with poetic flair and rock steady rhythm.Great Piano Playing.A must Buy for all Grieg Lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and delicate","review":"Why did I wait so long to buy this disc?!

They are basically nice salon pieces: charming, melodic, lightweight. I notice that several reviewers have pointed out that Gilels does not play up the sentimentality in these pieces. Perhaps that's what I find lacking in these performances. I guess I am saying that I would prefer to hear frankly sentimental compositions such as these played with a great deal more sentiment.Please be aware of the very real possibility that you will find this music boring. The music has grown on me over a period of several months of frequent listening, but I prefer to listen to a few pieces at a time and then put the disc away for a while.

Rhythmically the 3rd is a joy. Be prepared to dance. Someone should have tied this man down and made him conduct more.

By pressing a button on the side, the unit opens up and you can see the scanning light to blow off with canned air every once and a while.Overall, 5 stars for painless preservation of old photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Money","review":"This book, or as I prefer to call it, \\"pamphlet\\", has a total of 50 pages, but if you remove the blank pages, contents, glossary etc. there is only 27 pages. There are a lot of pictures of hoofs, telling you the name of each part. I learned nothing from this book other than a lesson to look at a book in person before I spend... on a \\"pamphlet\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"I love this book. I am reading it again for about the 10th time, and every time I pick it up I am touched by the beauty of Ondaatje's prose. It really is glorious. I believe this is his best work and as others have said, this one should have won him the Booker. I highly recommend this CanLit gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Skin of a Lion: a passionate Canadian story.","review":"This is a wonderful novel, well worth a read. It is not quick work, as the reader becomes lost in Ondaatje's poetic prose. At times, it is difficult to follow all of the elements of plot, but this is precisely because of the disparate elements of the protagonist's life.This novel was recently selected by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as the subject matter of a national book club. What a grand idea for all Canadians to share, discuss, and appreciate this fine work of one of our most memorable writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very lyrical and non-linear","review":"If I never read this story again I'll remember the images more the plot. And then the characters. Patrick and Nick Temelcoff are two characters that live inside thier heads, and reading their dreams and impressions makes me feel like they've crawled inside my head.One the scenes that Patrick watches, the Finnish ice skaters at night on the frozen riverbed, with flaming cattails to light them, is scene I've never imagined, and the image haunts me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical and intricate story of all things human","review":"'In the Skin of a Lion' is one of the most beautiful and inteligent novels of this century. I first read this book when I was fifteen, and have read it at least eight times since then. I am now 17 and find that the book has had a profound effect on me and my life. Ondaatje writes intricately and poetically of the poetry of life, making contrasts and connections in such a way that it is hard to lose faith in the world around you. A truly magically book, by an amazing man."},{"rating":"2","title":"epic poem or novel?","review":"more like a modern epic poem than a novel, this brilliant construct contains little dialogue, shifts between \\"reality\\", dreams, memories, past and present. this may prove frustrating to some, but it's totally compelling and a wonder to behold as the story unwinds itself like a dying pocket watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to my taste at all","review":"This is supposed to be a classic, highly recommened to me by a literate friend. I agree that it is poetic, and has a gossimer feel to it. But, I found it a tedious read. It is in that somewhat detatched present tense that I do not relate well to. The story line is difficult to follow, the character hard to understand. I will not read any more of Ondaatje, I imagine."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the skin of the lion","review":"We chose this book for our bookclub based on \\"The English Patient\\". It was reviewed as a prequel. The character of Caravaggio is in it, but the chapter in which he appears seems to be more of an afterthought and totally superfluous to the rest of the story. In a sentence, this book can be summed up as: The rich get richer and the poor blow them up. We actually chucked this as our discussion book after 2 of us read it, and picked another!If you want to learn to build a bridge, this is the book for you. If not, then SKIP this dog of a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but elitist","review":"I feel Ondaatje's book is an interesting way to give a history lesson, especially to us (you know, we brazenly pompous Americans living in a morally bereft culture who really don't know anything about our own history - the stories of our ancestors and their exploitation at the hands of our ruthless, capitalist leaders, not just the Founding Fathers), which is odd considering he wants our $. Gee, Mr. O, can I sit at your knee while you dispense your wisdom?Give me a break.I was actually going along with this story, but I got sick of O's characters doing totally incongruous and unbelievable things (wait to you get to the end). You can't sacrifice this much realism for the sake of getting your point across - and I know the whole point is O saying \\"look - see how people don't do things they're expected to?\\" But, again, give me a break - too heavy in political overtones that make me feel that O should stick to poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know I will read this book again and again.","review":"I can't imagine finding this book \\"hard to follow,\\" but maybe because each time I've read it (twice), I've read it in a single sitting (so enthralled, I hardly moved a muscle for hours on end). I've bought this book three times because I keep giving it away. I think it sounds silly, even as I write it, but this story (and Ondaatje's writing) glows."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I'd give him another try, but I shouldn't have","review":"I think this is a pretty terribly written and overrated book. I didn't like English Patient to begin with, but I thought I had read it when I was too young, so I gave In the Skin of a Lion a try. What bothered me most was the dialogue--it felt so contrived. And I couldn't care about the characters. In fact, the whole novel seemed vaporous--that is, superficially lovely but lacking any substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Sucks","review":"I've read many a good book....this is not one of them. For those that are rating it highly, I see them as those fools who said the King was wearing splendid clothes when in fact he was parding down the road naked; they think they are intellectuals when in fact they are misleading others.

I thought there might be some other people who felt the same way about this book as I did. Well, everyone else loved it so I guess I'm on my own.Of all the books I've read (and they aren't Dick and Jane books), this one was the hardest to follow. The story jumped all over the place. I always had to go back and try to find things, which doesn't make reading too enjoyable. Actually, I found it annoying but I had to finish it because I started it....and I paid $15.00 for it.This book did nothing for me...other than put me to sleep on the train coming home from work. All of those other people liked it, though, so there must be something to it (those chapters must be missing from my copy).If you like getting lost in a book (literally), then maybe this one is for you. It definitely wasn't for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"After the English Patient, which I thought was a beautifully written and constructed book, I found this to be a complete bore.

It did jump around alot and I had to keep going back and looking things up to find the significance of past events.

I had a list of books to choose from, and for some reason I chose this one. I regret it because I find this book extremely boring. This plot has no point at all. It is difficult to read, since not much is happening. I am required to compare this book with the movie Gladiator, and find similar themes between the two. I have the feeling I'm going to have a very hard time doing that.As a fellow Canadian, I am not disapproving of the Canadian history behind this book, but it doesn't make much sense to me. Maybe I will have to read it a couple more times. This is the first novel I have read by Michael Ondaatje, and I don't think I will be reading any of his works again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to my taste at all","review":"This is supposed to be a classic, highly recommened to me by a literate friend.

I had to keep going outside to see if they ever did finish the bridge and was glad to find out that Yes I would be able to make it to work in the morning. Did someone drop the manuscript and forget to put the pages back in order, was it mixed with another book? I don't get it and I ain't dumb either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I grew infuriated (and bored) with this novel when I discovered that, about halfway through, that it had no idea where it was going. The small elements of the book that deliver actual story are some of the most engaging efforts at fiction I have come across in years. It is genuine, deeply interesting, and swolen with careful, careful writing.Unfortunately, \\"In the Skin of the Lion\\" strays far too often into a kind of lazy poetry-prose, a landscape where every notion is ephemeral and fleeting. In some parts, this book is not so much a novel but a dull soliloquy on the helplessness, bravery and romance of the people we are supposed to be interested in reading about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

Why is this ok? Why was it forbidden in the first place? These points are not addressed3) The history starts with Abraham...but surely he had parents, and they were probably important.

I'm afraid that while it was probably competitive when it first appeared, it has simply been surpassed in terms of both performance and recording.The playing is fine, and the mono recording OK-ish for the mid-fifties, but Sanderling's interpretation (not to mention the cuts) make this hardly recommendable....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This CD originally appeared as part of the 5 disc COLLECTION and as such doesn't stand up as a reording in it's own right.

Made In China is rife with textual and statistical quotations from Chinese State agencies and media arms; agencies that well known in most circles to be innacurate and propaganda laden sources of information. Any insightful analysis of modern Chinese society and economy must look beyond the fascade of Beijing politics and party sponsored proclamations.

Hard core fans may clammor for more in-depth reporting but I think Huxley manages to stay on that fine line of giving the reader all the important details of Em's life while not getting into the sordid or too-personal details that really aren't the reader's business.

If you try to use the bench dogs to clamp down a large item, it spreads the crack even wider. I'm afraid if I clamp down hard on anything, it'll pull the bench into two pieces. The shelf and drawer bottom were both warped. The drawer bottom so warped it couldn't be used. The bench smelled bad from urethane. It was so bad I had to move the bench outside, it was stinking up my shop. The vises both bind up when you try to screw them in, or out.The packing for shipping was also shoddy. The box was falling apart by the time it got here. The only way I could send it back would be to buy a new box and packing materials and repack it for shipment.The bench is now used in the back yard by my wife as a planting bench, but It won't last long.

She didn't have it one week and it started having problems. Some deal.The first problem was that she couldn't download all the pictures without the camera shutting off. We found that in order to download the pictures from the 128MB SD memory card we had to download them 20 at a time.The second problem was the battery life. Even when using 2000mAh NiMH AA batteries we could only get about 50 shots before needing a fresh pair.Lastly the color representation was very bad. I have a picture of some flowers that I have shared here on Amazon. The blue flowers to the right of the yellow rose were really purple, not blue.I've had better luck with my older Olympus and my wife's new Canon camera.

All in all an excellant step up from a beginning camera, but less involved then my complicated Nikon professional equipment (which was at least ten times the price of the this camera).

I was tired of cramming my stuff into a very small ceramic holder that was constantly tipping over from the weight. This puppy can handle every single utensil I own, 26 at present, and still has room for a few more with skinny handles. I was even able to fit my potato masher in and it has a very fat handle. It has a nice brushed stainless finish, and although I have had a couple of fingerprints that were tricky to get off, it looks very nice. The bottom is grippy so it won't fall over. It has three compartments inside to separate the utensils so they're not all thrown in and bunched together, which would make them hard to get out. I put wooden spoons and spatulas in one, turners and ladles in the next, and my baster, masher, and meat tenderizer in the last. Great size!

This holder is very sturdy and the great design of the product keeps it from tipping from side to side when I take something out or put something in it, and it only takes up a little more space on the counter than the old one. But best of all, it holds lots and lots of utensils. I have all my large cooking spoons, spatulas, ladles, potato masher, whisk, etc. in it and there's still room for more.

It is sturdy enough to hold large items, like potato mashers and ladles, without tipping over.

It has three dividers inside, so the utensils don't get tangled and jumbled, and you can easily remove only the one you want to use.A nice detail is that the bottom tray removes easily, and is dishwasher safe.

The glue is so strong it is impossible to remove the sticker without leaving gluey marks and part of the paper. Forget about conventional ways to get rid of these residues - scratch marks on a nice brushed finish guaranteed. Paint stripper could probably do the job. Seriously, a \\"permanent\\" sticker, which will get ruined after a few cycles in the dishwasher? If that wasn't enough, my copy has a deep ugly scratches at the front!

The plotline is amazing (and yes- THERE IS one), the art too, and everything else. The first book in Cardcaptor Sakura is an innocent one. Sakura has a crush over Yukito, and that's it. But the later ones has somethings that maybe parents won't think it's a good idea that their children will read.The later books contains hints of homosexuality and lesbian relationships, and teacher-student ones. NOTHING is graphic- but the hints are still there.One day, Sakura finds a book named 'Clow'. She opens it, and sees cards. After a few seconds there is a strong wind that takes the cards. Then the gaurdian beast of the seal comes out, and makes her the Cardcaptor. After all - IT IS her responsibility. And so, she goes to collect the cards with her best friend tomoyo (the nut friend that tapes EVERYTHING on the video, AND makes her battle costumes), and Kero, the sun gaurdian beast."},{"rating":"2","title":"s'okay","review":"not a bad translation-- but if you're a true manga fan then you're better off with the bilingual manga ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Manga!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This manga is pretty cool.

So I decided to give it a try.I am so glad I did! This series is in the same genre as Sailormoon, a comic for girls involving some kind of magical girl. Although, I enjoyed Cardcaptor Sakura more than Sailormoon.Although Sakura and her best friend Tomoyo are fourth graders, people older than that will find their adventures interesting. And there are still some high school guys in there for people who aren't sure.True to Mixx translations, there are some weird phrases, such as \\"thanky swanky\\" and the art isn't as good quality as in the original Japanese version. But if you can ignore that, there's an awesome story behind all of that.I highly recommend this title!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sakura","review":"is about a girl who sets free clow cards, from a book called the Clow.

Tokyopop did good on this one, though not as good as they did on Marmalade Boy, it is certainly a much better adaptation than that of Sailor Moon or Magic Knight Raearth.Personally I think the art in this is a lot cuter and funner than other CLAMP works, it's easier to understand as well, even if a thousand tributaries of side stories run though it since it still _is_ shoujo manga. I'd give this a 5 star if the sixth book wasn't better, keep reading this, the story just gets better and better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"three cheers for Cardcaptor Sakura!!","review":"this is definitley a manga you should check out. Beating out all the other shoujo mangas out there breaking all the artistic barriers that held back many of the other shoujo mangas such as Sailor Moon.

As a result, it would not run on my daughter's computer.When I installed it on my Mac, it did work but then the game revealed its more substantial drawback: it is a boring game with unclear instructions and non-challenging quests.Another technical weakness worth mentioning has to do with the SAVE function. It appears that you may only SAVE the game at specific points which would make you go back and do over and over again quests that you have already done. Getting into the MAP is risky as you are forced to lose your zoombinis in order to get to the options.In sum, this is a very poor game. Your child is likely to be very disappointed, as my child was."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a good idea","review":"Despite the glowing reviews, I had nothing but PROBLEMS.

Kids have to rescue the Zoombinis by helping them relocate to a new land. On their journey kids are met with obstacles, each with perameters, for kids to navigate. For example, figuring out which toppings the pizza troll wants on his pizza from a number of choices. Listening to his response gives the clues to help them figure it out and it changes each time.My only 2 gripes are that you have to change your color setting on your computer and that there is very little explanation initially.

It's even fun for grown ups. Each journey begins with 16 Zoombinis who must survive treacherous traps, overcome obstacles and solve problems of increasing difficulty. The only caveat is that all 16 Zoombinis must survive each step so if a child has completed many levels and spent over an hour on the game and then lose a Zoombini, they have to start all over.

I'm going through a romantic phase right now in my classical listening, so I'm into Tchaikovsky. All three of these symphonies are just tremendous -- loud and boisterous one minute and then sublime the next. The Penguin guide to classical music said that these were simply THE best recordings that Karajan did of these symphonies and after listening a few times, I believe it. The sound quality is not muddy, but it would be nice to have this exact recording with more perfect sound. Still, this is a minor bone to pick on this outstanding collection that manages to find great recordings of these 3 symphonies and gather them into one conveniently priced package. A great deal and many hours of listening pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tchaikovsky Symphonies 4,5,& 6","review":"The Karajan BPO was, quite simply, a great orchestra -- especially in the mid to late 70's It had a depth of dynamic range rarely approached by other orchestras then and now. Karajan's tenure, contentious as it was at times, brought this orchestra together as a compleat ensemble because he and the players knew one another. They also played with pride and dedication to the tradition of the ensemble and the music. The rendering of these symphonies reflects all of these attributes. The quality of the recording is excellent and no one could not dispute the purchase value of the collection.

Haviv was in the middle of this carnage. He was the court photographer for a twisted band of murderers, winning their confidence over a period of years. He did not attempt to stop the crimes, he photographed them instead. He did not run from this vicious mob but instead he chose to remain with them.In the book he is referred to as having been brave.

I am very careful with my player and now it's broken and with no options for repair or warranty exchange. Basically the sound cuts out and disapears and with some wiggling comes in and out. This makes the unit useless and annoying as hell to listen to. I bought the unit back in August making the 3 month warranty worthless of course to me.

The whole point, surely is to get Mahler's emotional tensions and aspirations across through the performance and somehow Boulez seems to filter them out altogether, leaving something which is only Mahler in its bare essence!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the Adagietto","review":"Those of you who shy away from Boulez will probably find this a bit odd, but by far the most affecting portion of this disk, and which is in my opinion the most overwhelming version ever recorded, is the stunning rendition of the famous adagietto. It is one of the most profoundly moving symphonic movements ever written, and Boulez captures both the romantic and religious elements of this movement in a way I had no idea was possible until I heard this disk. The rest of the disk is wonderful as well, although there is nothing overwhelming to distinguish it from its competition in the way the adagietto does. Even if you hate the rest of the disk, it is most definitely worth it for the fourth movement. I've nearly worn my disk out from playing it so often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baladi Plus - a must for fans of belly dancing","review":"This album sizzles with sexy beats from the master.

The lack of chart success, though, doomed the band, with Matlock calling it quits in 1979 and - with New - touring and recording with Iggy Pop.Though the music may have gotten lost as punk rock sped into pop culture, Matlock's sound and vision showed that these kids were alright."},{"rating":"1","title":"neck split from body","review":"When we first got this guitar we were impressed with its sound and size.now approx. 8 months later the neck has split from the body.

Instead of telling the hows, the author kept on quoting academic studies of how useless TA had been, and preaching the importance to look into the \\"context\\" of individual scenarios. I dont mind how bad the author disliked TA. However, he should have provided a solution, which is nada, but shallow fundamental and behavioural stuff, readily available and much better presented in books that focused on \\"Fundamental Analysis\\" and \\"Behavioural Finance\\".

I for one do not even deem these books as part of the WC universe, but rather some silly offshoot universe where pilots are teen hearthrobs and Star Wars ripoffs abound. It's all gone so downhill since Baen stopped making the books. First WC: Prophecy, now this. ::sigh::"},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfying pretender to the Wing Commander series","review":"I found that the book was describing a universe which does not gel with the Wing Commander novels written previously by other authors. The characterisations of the basic characters abraided my own feelings gleaned from a distillation of the previous books. The basic plot premise, inherited from the film, may have been a handicap to consistancy within the series as a whole, but I regret that I do not see this mini-series as filling the background of the previous books, but instead as a seperate 'mayhavebeen' parallel storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Even though i'm not a big fan of the Wing Commander movie, Pilgrim Stars was very good. The story was intresting, and the charecters were very well developed and true to the Wing Commander Universe. Admiral Tolywn fit well with what had already been established about him, as did Todd \\"Maniac\\" Marshall and Christopher \\"bunch-of-callsigns\\" Blair. Also, the novels main antagonist, Amity Aristee, really makes you love to hate her.This is a very good book, and I recommend it to any Wing Commander fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review of Pilgrim Stars","review":"I found the characters to be well rounded, and each character had his or her own problems. Each character developed in his or her own way. Blair expanded his world to include his heritage. Marshall grew beyond his loss and into a new relationship. Angel still had her problems with her emotional relationship with Blair. The supporting characters fill in the background and contribute to the traditional and familiar theme. One government forcing its will on another and how it effects the lives of its own people. Telep leaves the many questions in the ending which could lead to further novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy addition to the Wing Commander Universe","review":"This is a good book, though as a follower of Wing Commandersince the first computer game, I found it a little hard to reconcilesome of the differences between the game and the movie. Telep tries to maintain the integrity of the characters (for example, Angel is actually Belgian, despite her English accent in the movie). All in all, a fine read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip the movie--read the book!","review":"I got the prequel to this book because I saw the movie \\"Wing Commander\\" and liked the \\"universe\\" enough to hope that the book would be better. The book blew the movie away, creating rich characters set in rich, complex plot structure. This sequel continues with the same great characters, increasing their depth and putting them in great new situations.

The story follows the life of a little house, built long ago in the countryside and then slowly swallowed up by the spreading tide of urbanization, only to find itself surrounded by tall buildings, noise and hubbub, and condemned to destruction. The house is restored to happiness by being moved back out into the countryside, where it can once again ejoy the night sky and the songs of birds and laughter of children playing. Young children, age 2 to 6, will enjoy the story and pictures, even if they don't care about urbanization or anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lasting Impact","review":"This book is one of my childhood favorites.

As the years pass, the city comes closer and closer and eventually surrounds the little house which misses its old hills and trees. One earlier reviewer expressed concern about the apparent anti-urban bias. I think Burton simply had a pro-nature bias rather than anti-urban. And, I think any of us, including those who live in cities or suburbia would not care to live in the sprawl that was depicted in the illustrations and was indeed present in many cities in the 1940s when the book first came out. The book won the 1943 Caldecott Medal for best illustration in a book for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great illustrations. great moral...","review":"My 3 year old son loves this book.

It stands as an enduring classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written story of changes","review":"I read this to my three and five year old, and we all enjoyed it. People of all ages can appreciate this book though. It is a great book to show little ones the changes that occur from day to night, in yearly seasons, and changes that take place over longer periods of time. The book shows the same house in day and in night and in each season of the year and then shows the changes that take place as people trade in their horses for cars and roads are built and the city comes closer and finally all but covers the house. This book opens up discussion with little ones about several topics and can be used in teaching so many things. . . History, changes in travel over time, inventions, city vs suburban life, seasons, and the importance of preserving history or family memories. I think it's important for children to make their own observations about what takes place in the book, and I'm sure what they take from it will be different as they read it at different ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Children's book ever!","review":"I love this book and have loved it as small child.

I now live in a 142 year old house, one of the oldest in Minneapolis. How I wish I could go back in time and see the little house when it was first built in 1868, and see the surroundings of it.

This is misleading, because Dame Julie Andrews (of THE SOUND OF MUSIC, et all) is not a performer on this CD. The Julie Andrews on this recording is a bassoon player, and merely a member of the ensemble that performs the background music here.The actual \\"performer\\" here is Harry Enfield, narrating two \\"re-told\\" fairy tales. I'm not sure who the target audience is for this CD -- the narration is interspersed with instrumental music sections, and these music sections are quite lengthy. I would imaging that small children would lose interest quickly during these long segments without dialogue. Musically speaking, the instrumental passages are pleasant, but certainly not exciting or interesting, so this CD isn't exactly of interest to adults who are serious music fans.Just don't buy this CD expecting to hear something new from Julie Andrews -- she's nowhere to be found."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the ULTIMATE.","review":"After spending almost a year researching the breed of dog that would suit me best, I finally found Zoe, she is the best companion, and my best friend.

A great (and costly) disappointment.UPDATE: After 18 months, the speaker quality steadily deteriorated and my outgoing conversations became inaudible. The connection for the charger no longer functioned reliably and the batteries had to be charged in the base unit (had several friends who experienced similar breakdowns).

The most serious is that it periodically (every other day on average) resets during a phone call. It then takes an unacceptably long time to reboot. This is very fustrating when you are in the middle of an important phone call. In my experience even the cheapest category of cellphones do not reset like the Treo.Another serious fault is that the Treo sometimes crashes when running programs. Sometimes the crash results in the Treo going into an endless loop of resets that prevents the use of the phone. The remedy for this situation is complicated and not contained in the instruction manual.The Treo is also a little too deep, a little too wide and a little too heavy.I have also had problems with the battery overheating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it!!!!","review":"This product is massively annoying.

(Why in the world aren't they locked out when the keyboard it locked out?)The accessories are the cheapest of cheap junk.

The author knows his stuff and loves the land he writes about. This could be considered a romance, but it has a gritty reality and a true feel for the times and people of the west. For instance, how often have you seen the American cowboy portrayed carrying a sack of rocks to throw at the horses he is herding? Not romantic, but probably true to life. Other details ring true, from the authors huge knowledge of the flora and fauna of the country, to his extensive knowledge of firearms. This is a very well written book by a pulitzer prize winning author at the top of his game. Too bad H.L. Davis was not more appreciated in his time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best spiritual teachings","review":"If you are looking for your \\"real\\" purpose in life this is your DVD, and if you are \\"ready\\" it will blow your mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phantasmagoria","review":"Everything Tolle says is emotionalism taken to its most extreme.

The end result is a high quality product, but one that I believe will not be Rob Dougan's best work. Songs like \\"Furious Angels\\" and \\"I'm Not Driving Anymore\\" are examples of the kind of excellent craftsmanship that Dougan shows on some tracks, but others lack the same weight and intensity. As a result, the album does not flow particularly well.Additionally, choosing to include the now several-year-old \\"Clubbed to Death\\" on the album makes it seem like Dougan was just looking for tracks to fill in around the shining pieces of the album.In the end, I think that Rob Dougan would have been better served by releasing two or three EPs. He is a very talented artist, but he still has a lot of room to grow and miles to go before he reaches his potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh","review":"It was not at all what I thought it was going to be.

This may piss people off, BUT I am not a big fan of the Matrix movies. Not a big fan of Keanu or big screen action movies. Big explosions and cool visuals do not make up for awful dialogue and script (sorry, just my viewpoint). Anyway, I had heard Rob Dougan on a 12\\" remix he did for Moby that I really loved. His music is very moody, very orchestral, and yeah I dig his voice too. It helps tell thestory and sets the mood perfectly. If you like Craig Armstrong's work (\\"This Love\\" w/ Elizabeth Frasier and \\"Weather Storm\\" Massive Attack)then I think you will like this cd too. And yes, do buy Furious Angels with the bonus instrumental disc. A: you may not like his gravelly voice; and B: even if you do like his voice, the instrumentals are still phenomenal and the music can stand alone perfectly without the vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"beauty.....simply beauty.

It also has an excellent storyline. It is about two sisters whose father is 'dating' a woman with a son-John D. Jones. The girls are very resentful of these newcomers. The sisters feel that John and his mother have invaded their privacy, especially when their father invites them to go on holiday with the family. The girls and John get on very badly. The two sisters are determined to make life for him and his mother as difficult as possible. I will not give away the ending completely but John does something which convinces the girls to give him a chance. I thought that this book was very gripping, as I was worried about what would happen-would the girls drive John and his mother away, or would they brave it? A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful True Story","review":"I read this when I was in second grade, and my parents read it with me.

It's good to have this rare recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"I've heard of this twosome for years, heralded as the epitome of jazz standards performed with sophistication. But, I'd never heard them until I bought this CD.My take? I'm not impressed with Jackie Cain's voice. Perhaps, it's partly due to the need to attenuate it at times, which, I've noticed, is what many female singers do to keep their voice from being overbearing. But, when Jackie lets hers have full vent, there is also something in the quality of it that I don't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compendium","review":"This tome might be more accurately titled or described as a Biographical Compendium, not a Dictionary.

If you need a reference tool for speech writing, oral presentations, or the like, this Dictionary will not work out for you.

Unfortunately, all I found were more ways to worry about how I was already negatively affecting my baby. I was already busy worrying about my baby's well-being in the womb, and trying to ensure that he developed properly and was healthy. This just made me more of a head case. I think it's important to be positive, nurturing, and spiritual, but it's equally important to forgive yourself when you imperfections, or have a human, negative thought, or if you see some violent story on the news. Personally, I found it very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"If your idea of a spiritual book is one that tells you your fetus has direct access to your actual thoughts, and you should be careful about what you even SEE during pregnancy because it will have a DIRECT EFFECT on your growing baby, then THIS is the book for you!!! Honestly, it reads like a newer-age take on What to Expect - a lot of subtext about all the harm you're doing by seeing non-beautiful images (and heaven forbid you're a fan of scary movies, don't you dare think about seeing one because you'll scare that kid senseless!) It's not what I was hoping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical book","review":"This is a book that makes you feel more envolve in your pregnancy, in a way that is forgotten.

The bonus games are really fun and can get you really ito it. Once you win the bonus games its really rewarding to improve either your car's wheels, engine, or sheild.

As with all tests before this, I used the exam cram book, transcender tests, and work experience and I was able to pass with a 90% or higher. But with out the help of a co-worker and his Sybex book I would have never fully grasped subnetting. I would definitely suggest you are 110% comfortable with subnetting and IP addressing before taking the test, if you are then this book should be all you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"I passed my test using this book!","review":"I want to say that I found this book to be extremely helpful. My knowledge going into this was at a very minimum, at best. I bought the book on a Saturday afternoon, took the test Tuesday and passed. It's organized so well. The sample questions are right on with those on the actual MCSE exams. What I like most was it's layout, easy to read. No big lengthy explanations that you get lost in the words over. To the point. Also, they not only explain why the answer is right, but why the wrong ones aren't right. Very helpful! I just bought another one of their books. Wish I'd have known about them for the first 4 exams! Try it, you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"I bought this book strictly on recommendations written here. Even though I was warned not to, I bought the Sybex Test Success book also. Yes, Sybex had some errors. But Exam Cram's questions were nothing like the questions I got in the actual test. Sybex's were very close! And in the case where there were errors, I noticed it right away. My recommendation is to always use TWO different study guides. Usually one will fit your studying style better.

I passed with a mid 900 score 20% over the required to pass and I credit my success to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good material, occasionally confusing","review":"Exam Cram books are the best test prep books I have read so far. It is the first book I read on a subject and it usually gives a very good account of what you will see on the test.

Also a few of the questions on the sample tests are wrong, including questions they inlcuded on the online Adaptive Exam.Despite the few errors you will run into, the book is full of the information you will need to pass the exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good overview of the test","review":"I took the test and passed w/ a 948. In addition to this book, I read the New Riders and MS Press titles. This book is definitely worth the read. But, by no means should it be the only thing you read before taking the test. A couple of the chapters are really sloppy, and there's some outright wrong information contained. This one is definitely not on par with the other Exam Cram books. But, as a final review, it is still the best thing available. I would recommend this book and the MS TCP/IP books, in addition to the Transcender tests to give a knockout blow to the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Install","review":"We tried installing this on a G5 iMac on OSX 10.5.8.

The photos do not in the least convey the \\"soul\\" of cloistered, contemplative life. The poses are stark and stiff and remind me of passport photos!

Lili Almog takes us inside the sometimes mysterious world of contemplative nuns with photos of the sisters and their convents.

This book tell you exactly how to be nice, something we may have forgotten after years of work, kids and marriage juggling.I really, really recommend this book and after I read it, I passed it on to my newlywed daugher who's 24. She gavve it kudos, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish my mother read this book","review":"I wish my mother read this book. I read this book after I had kids and had to undo what I learned from my bitter mother and society. Our grandmothers were right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Your Man - OH PLEEAASE!!!","review":"As is usual with Laura Schlessinger's instant psychobabble, she offers immediate blame to women for all failing marriages. Her approach is not only blatantly one-sided, but she does an extreme disservice to women in problem marriages who have tried valiantly to hold things together in the face of men who are emotionally detached, unstable, or whatever the case may be. The issue is that not all women are to blame, and not all men are either. Each marriage should be considered individually, based on the facts particular to the couple. It is unfortunate that Laura Schlessinger dishes out more guilt to women whom already shoulder their fair share of guilt based on their roles of primary nurturers. But then, what could you expect from a psychologist that 'solves' problems on the radio in five minutes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing title but it ends there","review":"This book is a best an amusing joke. It is insulting to both men and women and fails to admit the vast differences between individuals. Furthermore if either partner agrees to have sex just to please the other (as she advises) it turns a beautiful act of love into somthing meaningless and dirty. I do not know of anyone in a happy relationship that has not figured out that sex is best when both partners are satisfied and a disapointment when only one person is \\"in the mood\\".Sure going out of one's way to make your husband feel extra special once in awhile is a good idea but to make it a cornerstone of a relationship is VERY bad advice. When reading this book I could only think of the people I know who did live their lives as advised in this book and how unhappy they were in real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"PROPER CREATION OF DOORMATS","review":"I will admit some guys do think like this because my Dad gave me this as a present. I reread it everytime I even think of remarrying. If that's marriage I dont want it!The summary is this: shut, up dress nice and clean your house. Dont talk about your problems or your day. All the guy has to do is go to work and then prop in front of the tv. He also hangs out with his friends and leaves you home. You do all the work in the marriage and in the home. No talking. The end. I wish guys did this before you marry them because no woman would marry them!Picture it: Dating like a husband: He shows up at your door and pays your bills or gives you cash then leaves you so he can have real fun with his friends. While he is out you can go to his house and clean it up. And dont talk to him or expect any romance! IT's a DATE!Oh, I love that guy! **sarcasm**"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"I think this book is brilliant. Dr. Laura is absolutely right. I am a wife and mother and I totally agree with Dr. Laura's assessments in this book. Love is a verb, not a noun. You give it and you get it back. I can't believe that so many people out there think it is a sign of weakness to be kind and loving to their husbands. No wonder the divorce rate is so high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I was hoping this book would have some more info for those of us that are 2 income households.

She warned me that there will be a lot I don't like in the book but there was also some good information in it.After digging through all the jabs at women, feminism, and evil liberals I'm able to say that I did find a few good things in the book. The problem is having to force yourself to get past Dr. Laura's hateful attitude towards women and anyone who doesn't agree with her.She lacks any type of respect for people like not her and it really diminishes the value of the book. It's unfortunate, could she have learned to be more respectful towards all people then this book would have been fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book and Great Deal!!","review":"Highly reccommend this book to women of all ages.

I like to give it to my friends as a wedding gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best manual for women who want to understand their men","review":"I give this book (along with a similar book by another author targeted to men) to young engaged couples (and recommend it widely to others).A lot of the men read her book. They rave about how well she gets it. She says \\"men are simple creatures\\". The men agree (we are simple creatures, truley we are). She explains how to interact successfully with men. The men say she has it exactly right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for me.","review":"I listen to Dr. Laura every work day, and I very often am blown away by her uncanny ability to pin-point the problem and present a very good solution. However, my description of this book would be that it is a disorganized collection of rants about how women do everything wrong. Each chapter is filled with conversations with women and men that belabor this point. The majority of these conversations are belittling and paint the woman a selfish fool. All the conversations with men are sympathetic to the tragedy that their wife doesn't do this or that for them.I was hoping for a cute and insightful step-by-step \\"manual\\", but what I got was completely the opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"I found this book sensationalistic and the title in particular designed for shock value, of which Dr. Laura is a master. Dr. Laura puts the onus of responsibility for the relationship on the woman when the reality is anything but that. It takes two responsible, respectful individuals to make a relationship work. Period.Anything \\"helpful\\" Dr. Laura has to say is flat out common sense that you can aquire for free. Everything else is mindless fluff that's at best useless and at worst offensive and misleading.Bottom line: if your marriage or relationship is in trouble, this book won't help. If it's not, then this book won't do you any good and you don't need it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not horrible, but not great","review":"I just finished reading this. It one of those books with a cute title meant to hook people into an impulse buy. Then you read it and you feel like your are reading a bunch of Dear Abby collumns thrown together to make a book.I've read worse and some people might like it. Frankly there is no real advice here for a married couple. However there are a few funny spots. I regret paying money for it, so I suggest getting it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulative beasts vs. idiotic puppets","review":"Sometimes Dr. Laura makes sense. Other times, she conjures up the image in my head of a wombat with gills that emit crazy gas. I think Dr. Laura would rather no other women ever go to college again, so she is the only woman with a profession, and a life of her own. What a hypocrite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this woman bashing book!!!!!","review":"This book is so horrible, Laura Schlessinger (Author) must have some built up anger agianst women. If you have any self respect as a woman DO NOT buy this book!!! Just to give you an idea of how bad it is here is a quote from the book\\" remember without him you are a sorry excuse for a person \\" and that's only in the introduction. In my opinion if you really want to make your husband happy, be happy with yourself. This book just basically tells you to forget about your self and do everything a man says because he's always right. I suggest more of a self help book, than an obey from your master book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This book operates on two basic premises:Men want a mommy/maid/prostitute who raises their children, cleans up after them, and puts out whenever he snaps his fingers. No relationship is necessary or even wanted.Women only want to spend money. So in order to acheive that goal, they should actively pursue the mommy/maid/prostitute role without complaint and they will get presents.In Dr. Laura's world, husbands and wives are (at best) not friends but co-workers; and (at worst) parasites manipulating each other for personal happiness. According to Dr. Laura no communication should take place between the husband and wife, and if communication HAS to take place then it should be the husband communicating to the wife what he wants/needs. There is no room in Dr. Laura's worldview for people who are interested in maintaining an equal partnership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for the modern Woman - very liberating!","review":"I am a recently married woman with a 16 year old stepson and a one year old son. Upon reading the PCFH, many things were confirmed in my heart, many questions answered and the lights came on. I immediately began making changes and I immediately began seeing results in my family. We are not anywhere near divorce,and are fairly happy, but the changes I've seen and felt are amazing. The points in the book really reach the heart of important issues. This book is a must read for EVERY woman, single or not! The challenge will be to approach the philosophy with humility and selflessness. I believe our society needs the changes that this book calls for and our families and culture, as a whole, would be in a much better place if the principles were taken to heart and put into action throughout our society and our world... please read!Woman Power: Transform Your Man, Your Marriage, Your Life!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Demeaning to both men and women","review":"Wow, I have two friends that swear by this book, and both are in troubled marriages. I finally gave in and even bought the dumb book, and I regret it. I want a refund.Why not just be honest in your marriage? Its worked for me for almost two decades. When I say honest, I mean honest without being a jerk or argumentative. Isn't that common sense?The whole book is full of women manipulating men into getting what they want because women are the brains behind the relationship, and men are too dumb to figure out what the women are doing, so they will go along with anything the woman says as long as she says and does the right things.I completely disagree with manipulation in any form, especially in marriage. If you use Dr. Laura's advice and pretend when you \\"don't feel like it\\", because it will get you what you want, beware! My husband loaths this tactic as do I. Maybe we're just different."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for those that desire a long and happy marriage","review":"Dr. Laura's advice and strategies actually empower women and strengthen families hopefully resulting in fewer divorces and children growing up in harmonious homes. I dare the skeptics and critics of this book (that actually read it) to ponder your own attitudes and alter your behavior for just one week. I guarantee you'll be amazed at the warmth, closeness and mutual respect you receive from your husband. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand the male beast a little better...and improve the communication in your marriage. You will certainly reignite the flame that has gone a bit dim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I love that Dr. Laura tell's it like it is.

This is a difficult test for a successful authpor whose books are bought notwhistanding the level of its quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful only as kindling","review":"Schlessinger spends much of this book belittling women and explaining away all the shortcomings of men. For example, if a man is philandering, you can bet his inattentive wife is to blame. I found her overall tone to be disturbingly anti-woman and felt bad for having read it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book for wives - must read","review":"Dr. Laura provides thought-provoking insight on the relationship between husband and wife.

Finding ways for wives to please their husbands in no way negates the duty of husbands to please their wives. (The latter is the subject of another book.)Schlessinger notes how modern feminism has devalued men, such as in the quip that, \\"A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle.\\" There are also more subtle versions of this thinking that variously imply that one person does not need another person, that men must cater to women's every whim, that men must be unilaterally sensitive to women, that women should meet with their lady-friends to complain about their husbands, etc.The author focuses on such things as the realization that men also have feelings, that men and women think in different ways, that women like to talk things out while men like to solve problems, and so forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great marriage advice","review":"I had a good marriage before I read this book and now my marriage is great. I never realized the bad attitudes I harbored towards men before I read this book.

Thank goodness I borrowed this book from the library. \\"A husband is like a horse. At the end of the day he is usually rode hard and put away sweaty..\\" this is the authors rationalization behind why women should \\"serve\\" their men at home and forgive their men any shortcomings. That is the premise of the entire book. Fine for women living in the 1950s, but the current state of our economy requires both husband and wife bring home the bacon. I do believe that your husband deserves your respect, understanding and kindness, but not because he is supporting you financially."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT!","review":"The best book ever written for marriage and I am not married. I have given this book to about 8 married people and watched all of their marraiges turn around. God is good.

And btw, its more of a practical book not religous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great practical book ;-)","review":"There was some language throughout parts of the book that I had to skim over, but otherwise, this was a great book with many practical ways to apply what was read.

This is the world according to Dr. Laura: Men are always right. Women are always wrong. If there is a problem, it is because the woman is being selfish, inconsiderate, and spoiled. If you have a problem with your man, try to change yourself because you MUST be the issue. Dr. Laura's overly simplistic analysis is the reason that so many women lack self esteem. This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not every husband is that simpleton","review":"Men are not all the same. This book can help women who have a certain kind of men.

And on the top called these ex-wives \\"too emotional\\", \\"too clingy\\", \\"not serious enough\\", \\"not challenging enough\\" etc.An advice for the women out there: \\"Be true to yourself\\". If he doesn't like, you are not made for each other, period. Get over and try to find someone who really loves you for who you are, instead of pretending to be someone you are not.

Well, I got in about 130 pages, just after all the exposition, the bad guys had entered, the plot had been set up and it was clear that the author was going to find every boring legal way to make it come out that the good guys would win, the good guys who didn't like each other would end up loving and respecting each other and the bad guys would be foiled.What a bore, the characters were stereotyped, drawn in crayon. The plot was intricate and well over-cooked and not a 3 dimensional person in the bunch. All that was missing - and maybe that came in after I put the book away - was a wise old Irish priest who said begorrah a lot and kept a bottle in his desk.

Yes, the fabric is good and sturdy but I have to agree with the other review, the strap is too long. Not just a little too long, I'm talking 2-3 feet too long and it's not adjustable. It totally defeats the purpose of having a laundry bag with a shoulder strap. Yes, grommets would be good and how about a plastic stopper so that the cinch remains cinched on the way to the laundromat? I'm changing this from a 2 star to a 1 star, it's a useless bag and it was a waste of money even at $6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I am 43 years old and never left a review before.

If its the only version of these two works you have heard I can understand why, but having heard numerous versions of these works both recorded and live I must say that these renditions are not at the level I am used to. One would think that with the Chicago Symphony at his disposal Abbado would let loose a little more, but instead of a blazing interpretation we get a rather tame, definetly non-Mahlerian piece of hash. Abbado never really lets the brass shine the way they could and the recording quality is sub-par for DG. As for the recording of the fourth symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic, I was even more dissapointed than with the Ressurection symphony. Very dull sounding and lacking a lot of character found in other renditions. All in all not an invalid interpretation of these two works, but you can certainly do A LOT better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"time travel where the man comes to the present","review":"I love time travel books and this was a little unusual because the man jumped to the present time instead of the woman moving to the past.Sam Evans, a cowboy from 1800's Colorado took the place of his friend Kurt when time was ready to transport him to the future.

One of the attractions of OpenGL is that it is cross platform. While not a bad book, as early as the second chapter it immediately focuses on WGL, which is a Win32 API that presents an interface to OpenGL itself -- if you're not a Windows programmer you'll get lost quickly as there is nothing for you here that you can actually type in and experiment with. I don't understand why they chose that path instead of simply presenting pure OpenGL, but being Windows-centric will make this book frustrating for anyone trying to learn OpenGL on a non-Windows platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"Admitted buyers remorse","review":"There is nothing fundamentally wrong with this book.

Yeah Right...","review":"This book is utterly useless for both a beginner like me, and someone who knows C++ well. All it does is explain what each function does rather than teaching you how to use it. In the 2nd chapter alone, there's a 200-line program of all OpenGL functions that you're expected to understand by about 3 pages of explanation. I'm a beginning programmer who knows a lot about C, but not everything, and this book isn't helping me at all. Also, I can tell that it doesn't teach you much, as the end of book game example is slow and buggy. Go learn C++ then get an online tutorial or reference page, don't waste the money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for beginners","review":"This book is basically an updated version of \\"OpenGL Game Programming\\", with the old chapters on DirectX placed in a CD-ROM. It is definitely for C++ programmers who are unfamiliar with OpenGL. It doesn't focus on intermediate or advanced topics like performance, 3d math, collision detection, etc; it just covers the API.

One thing that I found particularly annoying, however, was that the book claims to go into \\"much greater detail\\" concerning models later in the book, but after that line I found nary a reference to them. The author just uses the MD2 file format in the concluding \\"End Game\\" sample on the CD without ever having mentioned it in the book. Writing any useful graphics application requires using a model format, and it irks me very much that the book didn't cover it.One other problem with the book is its age - it covers version 1.5 of OpenGL, while 2.0 has been out for a while now.

It says how to create an openGL bitmap, but not an image like a windows bitmap. There is then like 3 pages on loading a TGA file but its too much of a weak introduction.

My toes do not get pinched, and my legs and feet are not sore and tired after a 9 hour shift in the store I work for. I can honestly say I will never buy another brand of shoes again, since Merrell makes all sorts of different styles of shoes and boots, even sandals!! Well worth the cost of the shoes, since they have very good tread, and I cannot imagine I would be walking through the soles on these in a matter of months, like I was doing with normal sneakers, even the most expensive of sneakers I would walk through the soles in 6 months or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice shoes","review":"Great shoes, very comfortable.

We found the story hard to follow. It often seemed unclear who was who and who was doing what to whom. The story at times veered off into love interests, but they too were a little confusing, poorly done, and bland, adding nothing to the story. Except for Michael Caine's supporting role, the characters never came to life, and we had no reason to care about them.

My reaction: Put it in the yard sale box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable, surprises at every turn","review":"This movie is a must see.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play very convincing roles and succeed brilliantly in drawing you into and submersing you in their endless cycle of revenge. Does this movie have some small plot holes? Yes. Does it leave some questions unanswered? Yeah, but, overall, this is an enjoyable roller coaster ride and is much darker than I anticipated. I've never been big on magicians, but this one definitely had me saying \\"wow\\". Somewhat predictable and somewhat off the wall - this one definitely leaves you wanting to make peace with people."},{"rating":"2","title":"One trick too many!","review":"This is basically a good, but not great, movie--I'd give it 3.5 stars if the system allowed. It's a tale about two competing magicians whose intense rivalry escalates to the point of obsession. There are plot twists aplenty. Even though I figured out one big reveal early on, there were lots of other mysteries and surprises to keep my mind engaged.The only problem, the reason I'm giving it a merely \\"above average\\" review, is that it was all so cleverly done for about half the movie--everything that happened had a logical (though perhaps far-fetched) explanation so that you could figure out a lot of things if you were paying attention. I was having fun trying to keep up! Then, suddenly, there's a deus ex machina plot device that demands utter suspension of disbelief ... I found that quite disappointing and it detracted a lot from my enjoyment.Other than that--great movie. I just wish they'd been clever enough to work out the plot in a more plausible way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This movie really keeps you on your toes and interested.

The second viewing is just as good because you can see all the clues and all the foreshadowing you missed the first time around. When i watched this the first time, i was pretty confused as to what just happened. It was on my mind for hours because i was amazed at the conclusion. This whole movie, literally, is a magic trick. If you love psychological thrillers and movies that mess with your head, you surely want to see this. Set in the Victorian Era, two magicians battle it out to become the better magician/illusionist. They will do whatever it takes and you will be surprised as to how far they will go and who comes out on top in the end.I would also recommend other Christopher Nolan films, especially Memento and Inception."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing thriller","review":"I have not yet read the book The Prestige was based on, so I can't give a comparison there, but I can tell you that this is a fantastic movie!

The movie is quiet a bit entertainment, the plot is curious and the performance of Hugh Jackman is far superior than Christian Bale. I think that the ending was a little unfair due to the body of the movie. Sure the movie is covered with tricks and always changing performances and that's what makes the movie interesting but besides that, I will say good for a one night rental with cheddar cheese pop corn but not for buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay close attention","review":"The opening scene tells you to pay close attention- and you have to - like other Chris Nolan movies. If you walk away you might miss something important. It's one of those movies where, when you get to the end, many pieces that you were given earlier, come to make sense. You have to make some effort to 'get' this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather depressing movie.","review":"I have enjoyed most all of the movies that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman have done, so I thought that with the two of them together this film would be a great one. It wasn't. I couldn't keep track of the plot after a certain point, and it quickly devolved into the two of them just trying to one-up each other, like two kids arguing over whose dad is better. I never felt any positive emotions from anyone and I ended the movie feeling kind of depressed. Not the way I like to leave a movie. It was also incredibly dark during certain parts which made it a little more difficult to see what was going on. Mainly, this movie confused and upset me."},{"rating":"1","title":"HD Exclusive in Europe","review":"This movie is ultimately confusing to someone who's a natural blonde like me. It starts at the end, ends at the beginning, and throws in an unnatural amount of twists & turns throughout the duration. It's complicated, and it doesn't help that I was trying to work out the final twist, but I didn't. It was right there I should have done.The Prestige has an outstanding cast, including Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale (who I'm still not sure about as an actor), a short turn by Piper Perabo, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johannssen and a surprising appearance by David Bowie! Of all people! (He's looking old.)I have to say this movie kept me riveted throughout, but I just couldn't understand it. A big hand for all those who could. I just couldn't follow it. But why should a film about magicians/illusionists be straight forward?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well acted, beautiful imagery, but SLOW, DULL and OBVIOUS.","review":"All-star, REALLY HOT, awesome cast; excellent acting, great costuming and beautiful cinematography. A+ shirtless Jackman scene.However, a convoluted mess of a movie with a labyrinthine storyline that is made mind-numbingly clear by the repeated insertion of painfully obvious foreshadowing. The story circled back upon itself several times, which made the excruciatingly too-long dramatic scenes seem even longer in a deja-vu sort of way. Could have been half an hour shorter, takes an ETERNITY to get to the point. I would have enjoyed it more had I fast forwarded through most of it. I'm glad I watched it, but a second viewing might be the cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad, not too good either","review":"Loved the movie, but the movie took a lot of pauses before resuming back, making the movie watching unsatisfactory.

Which wouldn't be so bad if the movie wasn't a boring downer. The \\"secret\\" of the movie is obvious to anyone over 7, and is even revealed 1/3 of the way through. And yet it plods endlessly on, like a truly bad opera. You've got better things to do with 35 years. The choppy flashback structure breaks up the story so much you never get an emotional connection with the characters. Which would be difficult anyway, since they're all repulsive. Not a protagonist among the lot; you're practically rooting for them all to come to a terrible end. The Instant Video rental is especially annoying as the movie is extremely dark and almost impossible to see under home conditions, while the sound is muffled and nearly unintelligible for large sections. I only paid $2 and I feel cheated. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!!! Slow and unentertaining.","review":"A show with a poorly written plot. Poor acting with unrealistic accents.

He's quite a good actor and of course you can't miss with Michael Caine and Hugh Jackman. I just loved the way these two illusionist/magicians tried to outdo one another.

Not going to go into intricate plot details, all I can say is that if you enjoy drama and suspense, this movie is certainly it."},{"rating":"2","title":"so magical!","review":"The Prestige is both brilliant and entertaining. Thanks to a clever screenplay and a beautiful photography, Christopher Nolan creates a bewitching atmosphere, and directs a compelling movie with a great ending. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, perfect in their roles, are just mesmeric. A must-have movie in your DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real good.","review":"I was thrilled to watch the Prestige. I saw it twice. I have seen all of Nolan's movies and they all better the second time. Here is why. Besides theacting being over the top Nolan knows how to keep you fascianted on what is going on. So being on the edge of my seat is hynotizing and I begin to miss some of the wonderful details. The second time I am able to take it all in.Obsession not love (the Illusionist is a magical romance) motivates the two Magicians. Both are seeking the reappearance of what they are missing.Actually what we are all seeking. I was pulled into the story by the wonderful magic and trying to figure out what I was missing. One magiciansays he is sorry and so was I that the movie was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs out of runway....","review":"A really intriguing film up until the final payoff. At that point it requires a sci-fi leap of faith that many will be unable to make, myself and my wife included. Great cast (especially the treat of David Bowie) that ultimately almost redeems the end game plot conceit...but not quite.Reminds me of landing jumbo jets at the old Austin airport. Drop out of the sky like a rock but get it down safely and no one complains because they're just glad to get home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great stars clever twists","review":"I do not have the enthusiasm in this movie as other reviewers. I watched The Illusionist and liked that so I bought this when it was released. I didn't know what to expect, it was a clever movie with great stars but it seemed to lack something. I liked the Illusionist better and not because it's a 'chick' flick because I don't go for those. It took a bit to get in to The Presteige and by the end I was bothered by the outcome. I will have to watch it a second time to see if I can come to a better feeling about the movie but until I do, I am disappointed. I don't care for happy endings either but I cannot think of what I'd have hoped the outcome to be.Maybe if... No I wont say it because I don't want to spoil the movie!Sorry this review is simply on my opinions rather than important specs of the movie.

It takes a really long time for the story to develop. By time it does you are almost asleep. I was excited to see this movie due to hugh jackman and christian bale being in them.

My recommendation is avoid this movie. if you want to see a decent movie that has a magician theme to it, check out The Illusionist."},{"rating":"1","title":"See The Illusionist instead","review":"You end up hating everyone in the end...there are no heros. The magic was historic and accurate for the era (though lots of modernism and creative license was used to entertain the crowds of today, who wouldn't sit through the longer \\"older\\" presentations). Interesting story...somewhat predictable \\"twist\\". See \\"The Illusionist\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've seen lately","review":"Wow! Let me just say, this movie is awesome. You're thinking, a movie about magicians. How lame. I know, I thought the same thing. The previews didn't really inspire me that much either. But this was a total surprise.The movie is about two magicians who are bitter rivals after an unfortunate event that occured at one show involving one of the magicians' wife. The plot follows them as they try by any means to steal the other's secret.I must admit, the ending was somewhat confusing. You had to be paying attention. I actually ended up wikipedia-ing it just to clarify some loose ends. But this movie, I can't even adequetly describe it, is amazing.

She is amazing in every role she has played. I beleive she is very naturally talented no matter what school she graduated from. She just has the charisma. She is natural. I almost own every movie she is in. This is not the strongest role ever but she is very good as always in this particular movie.The movie's subject now is very interesting and it twists in many ways to the point that you cannot really comprehend exactly what happened uless you watched it twice. It 's a smart comlecated thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they explain everything at the end???","review":"Let me just say that I loved Memento. Part of that movie's appeal is that they don't spoon feed you everything at the end but rather provide hints that leaves the viewer to try to unravel it's mysteries and inspires one to watch the movie multiple times to try to figure it out. The Prestige is frustrating as it had the potential to provide the same experience, but instead everything is explained to you at the end. The movie provided enough subtle hints to allow the viewer the fun of trying to solve the film on their own, while debating the possibilities with friends. I felt robbed. My suggestion to viewers is to turn off the movie with @ 5 minutes left and attempt to figure it out on your own....Are you watching closely? - No need to do so if you watch the movie to it's disappointing finale..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"The Prestige is a slow, tepid, and completely annoying film thanks to all those tricks and twists. I can't believe how boring this film was, Christian Bale is a talented actor but his character makes you just want to punch him about 500 times, he is so unappealing in this role. To my surprise Hugh Jackman is the character you feel the most sympathy for, too bad he plays such a sucker in this one. And oh god that old-looking, shallow, and unattractive Scarlett Johanseen is enough to ruin anybody's day, ugh! The film has a good premise but all the \\"I got you\\" surprises becomes too much and I lost interest after 45 minutes, the ending was cruel and lacked spontaneity. Stay away from this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! What an amazing trick...,","review":"One minute I was sitting uncomfortably in a cinema throwing up at the thought of having to sit all the way through 'The Illusionist' and suddenly, poof!

The movie is all about revenge for the death of a character we only saw for a few minutes. Any normal person would have simply walked away but these two go after each other for years and we all know how that ends. The plot twist was nice but easy to figure out so this movie ended up being dull, and stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"REVENGE IS AN OBSESSION - It can never be satisfied not","review":"even with oneself dying, repeatedly. The Prestige is to learn to forgive,INSTANTLY. THERE IS MAGIC IN THe ACT. NOT FOR CHILDREN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"One of the best movies I have ever seen. Even if you guess some of the surprises during the film, keep watching. You won't guess everything. I thought I had it figured out, but continued to be very surprised, all the way up until the shocking ending! Then I immediately wanted to see it again. I'm not a huge fan of Christian Bale offscreen, but I have to give it to him; he does whatever it takes to bring his characters to life. He is a great actor and really goes the extra mile for his audience. The entire cast does a wonderful job with this one. No complaints. And that's not something I say about a movie very often."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU CAN DO MAGIC","review":"THE PRESTIGE is a sumptuous, atmospheric, if ultimately empty tale of deception and misdirection. MEMENTO's Christopher Nelson uses his typical enigmatic writing and directing style to weave an interesting if sometimes confusing tale of magical revenge. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale competently portray the two competitive magicians constantly trying to outdo the other, particularly Jackman who holds Bale responsible for the tragic death of his magician wife. The ineffable Michael Caine plays Jackman's mentor who tries to help him best his competitor but also give him good advice not to go too far.I found the movie entertaining, but wasn't completely satisfied with its protracted resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric Mystery Worth Watching","review":"I really enjoyed The Prestige. I enjoy period movies and books especially those around the turn of the (last) century, so I was drawn to this movie. I was interested to read the reviews to find out how others related to the film. The plot was fascinating and the acting was excellent. The storyline was well done as well. Not really one feel good moment in the film, so if you are interested in that, look elswhere.I recommend this movie to those with a bent towards period pieces and the accompanying accents and outifts. For me, this was a very enjoyable 4 star film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie I've Seen All Year","review":"I went into the movie theater to see 'The Prestige' with high expectations. It did not let me down. With my father being a magician himself, I just had to see this film. The old saying \\"Watch closely\\" is perfectly fitting for this movie. I was completely surprised by the ending, and it kept me on my toes the entire time. It was a fast moving story that didn't have any dry, dull moments. Hugh Jackman was excellent as usual, and Christian Bale was wonderful as well. This was the first movie I have seen him in. Don't forget about Michael Caine either. The wisdom his character brought to the story was essential. I believe this is a movie you can watch several times and always find something you didn't see before. I can't wait until it is released on DVD! You have got to see this movie, what else can I say?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Loved it! But...","review":"I loved this movie! I thought it was incredible. But after watching it the very first time I turned to my friend, who owned it and had seen many times, and asked \\"what just happened?\\" I had to watch it a few times to competely understand the entire movie. But I love LOST for the same reasons. I loved the twist at the end! I love when movies make you believe one thing and at the end it's something you never expected even though it was right in front of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Added to my collection","review":"Have seen this movie a couple times. Don't take your eyes off the screen or you will miss something important. Prepare yourself for a fascinating movie but you'll never be able to prepare yourself for the ending. So many twists that you'll want to watch it a 2nd time right after you see the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please ignore the mindless negative reviews!","review":"Is this film perfect? No. Is it fascinating, unsettling and dark? Yes. Those qualities don't by themselves equal a good movie, but Chris Nolan has done a splendid job of taking an excellent, but cinematically challenging novel and molding it into a fine film. Read Christopher Priest's award-winning book \\"The Prestige,\\" and you'll appreciate just how many original concepts and new writing went into the film script. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both perfectly cast. The reviewer who wrote that the film has \\"nothing to do with magic or magicians\\" must have seen a completely different movie! And David Bowie does a super job of bringing the brilliant Nikola Tesla, the \\"father of electricity\\" to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prestige for the Prestige","review":"Movie is excellant and for the price its great entertainment which is what I desire in a movie. If I get educated or lost in a movie in anyway then thats always worth the money and time spent watching. I forgot how long the movie was so make sure you ahve the time and aren't rushed to view. It is an excellant movie and I love all the main characters. A great stay in on a cold rainy night snuggle with your honey kind of movie. Would have a 5 star but then I wouldn't have had to mention the length. I do not normally buy movies to keep. I have maybe 35 movies and several of those were gifts. So I proudly added this one to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definate keeper","review":"As others have said if you like Christopher Nolan's other films you should enjoy this one. I really liked David Bowie's potrayal of Nikolai Tesla.Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine are all great in this story of passion,jealousy and deception. Christopher Nolan is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors.As far as the \\"forced ads\\" goes you can't jump to the menu but you can track forward through everything but the FBI warning, its annoying but not as unbearable as the other reveiwer made it out to be. I too wish they would stop this nonsense. I'm all for the previews on the disc just give me the choice of watching them."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 acts: HD picture, HD audio, HD quatlity!","review":"Great film, you will not be upset with this purchase. Oh did I mention that the picture is top notch, not to mention the audio and bonus material, don't wait order it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"this is a great movie... so much so that i want to show it to a friend... i bought it just so that she could see it... the weekend after we saw it... i found that i already owned the movie... so i guess i really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"obsession!","review":"What I love about this movie (perfect or not) is what I love about all of Christopher Nolan's movies -- the mesmerizing sense of obsession. Plus, this movie -- aside from having a marvelous cast and an intricate plot -- has wonderful atmosphere. Give it a try. If you're cerebral at all you'll enjoy picking it apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Problems, but Intrigues","review":"Bringing iconoclastic Sebro-Croatian scientist Nikola Tesla into the mix was probably the smartest move the filmmakers chose, and the \\"Don't Look Now\\"-ish conclusive montage will confuse as many as it pleases,and almost seems contrived, too much, to feel real to anyone but a puzzle-picture lover like myself.Jackman is convincing, and Chris Bale can't seem to offer a lousy performance in anything - a truly interesting guy to watch in any genre. Nolan remains a captivating filmmaker to watch, but it's hard to outdo \\"Memento\\". That film raised enough questions for a dozen more films."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Twists and Turns Never End!","review":"Two rival magicians (Jackman and Bales) in the late 1800's. Each trying to sabotage each other, outdo each other, and decode the secrets of each others tricks. The twists and turns in this movie never seem to end. The story even brings in Houdini's water closet escape trick as well as the great scientist Tesla. The story does exaggerate a lot about Tesla but it seems to work in this film.The acting is first class and Michael Caine puts in another great supporting spot. Scarlett Johannsan is not quite as good as Jessica Beals was in The Illusionist but she is acceptable a the magician's assistant and lover.I would have given the film 5 stars but I was a little disappointed with the ending which seemed too implausible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent movie. Well acted, suspensful, entertaining. Some movies I only rent, this one is a buy as it will be watched over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie.","review":"Having just watch the Illusionist I decided to buy this movie as I missed both of them at the theater. While I find the Illusionist a better movie than The Prestige, both are good movies well worth having. I found this movie a bit hard to follow as you really have to pay attention. This is defiantly a movie that you have to watch multiple times to see something you missed the last time due to it's fast pace. If you like magic then this is a must have movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"shocked by these reviews!","review":"ALBERT is a great fantasy / speculative fiction / erotic story, the best of its kind, maybe even the only of its kind. Perry Brass's writing is flawless, the characters are hot, the story has meaning, and the sex . . . I devoured up this book, and then had to get MIRAGE and CIRCLES for more!_____The story begins in MIRAGE, with Greeland and Endiku of the planet Ki.It continues in CIRCLES, with Endiku and . . .It culminates in ALBERT, with their son.They travel to a planet called \`Earth', contemporary times in the first two books and the future in the third, facilitated by stimulating the \`The Egg of the Eye', a mystical testicle.Perry Brass does this tell two stories, which do intertwine. 1/2 fantasy, 1/2 historical fiction or, with ALBERT, 1/2 speculative fiction, with a dash of erotica . . . I recommend all three books, as well as any others by Perry Brass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words, Don't Buy.","review":"Man Pipe? Third Testical as source of power?

The regular wooden track trains work with them, but the regular wooden tracks do not.

The sounds quality resembles what you would get by throwing a couple of wet blankets over the microphones, or maybe moving the mikes out to the lobby.The disk originates from 1996. DG was useing something they called \\"4D\\" DDD recording technology. Thankfuly it died a quick and well deserved death.If you can put up with something that sounds like average mid 1950 mono quality only in stereo, you are good to go. Otherwise I suggest trying to get a cheap version from an Amazon merchant.Worth having for Stravinskians for the reasons other reviewers have stated, but be aware of what you're getting. Revier GD calls \\"the 1945 Firebird suite well worth hearing if lacking just a little in color and magic.\\" I agree. But the color and magic is missing because of the sound problems.The 2 stars are for the really poor quality, otherwise 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected science fiction.","review":"Of several lower budget, recent SF movies I rented (e.g., Earthstorm and Android Apocalypse ... even the higher budget, more mainstream The Fountain, for that matter), this was definitely my favorite. I enjoyed the plentiful SF ideas and the lead actress. They actually tried on the special effects, keeping the visuals coming (however nowhere near state-of-the-art, Star Wars type realism). Recommended for those who like to read SF, appreciate better writing, but can forgive the budgetary limitations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not even rent this movie...","review":"This movie is bad. It is long and it has terrible production. The movie is like narrated by her daughter. Bad special effects. You can see the terrible movie production in everything. Do not waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous - if only there were a 0 star rating.","review":"A terrible film with no attempt at coherent plot. I've read the plot summary and still can't connect it with the film. Neil Johnson is obviously some narcissistic hack, as is the case with anybody being the writer, director, composer and acting in his own film. What further disturbs me is someone's attempt to boost the IMDB rating and spread good reviews about this film. The only thing monumental about this film is it has to be the worst film I have seen thus far in my life. Don't bother, don't buy, don't support shameful film making like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidist movie in the history of mankind","review":"Worst waste of two hours ever. We must have been two of the ten people ever to see the end of the movie. If you think you are going to make it to the end of the movie...shoot yourself first. My ears are still bleeding. Porky's revenge deserved an emmy compared to this piece of cosmic crapola."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"Science fiction it is but that is about it. Not a worthwhile DVD to have as the story line is OK but the narration style and poor acting really makes it almost boring to watch. Thank goodness for fast forward.

I rented this movie at blockbuster because I couldn't find anything interesting lately in the SCIFI theme. This movie is terrible, no plot, CGI graphics are a joke.

It's just a lady running up and down dunes running away from bad guy and guess what she has a video game addiction that she has to subdue with drugs!!! In the end she commits sucide to save and restart the universe...oh yeah the big bang!!! What a joke!!!! ha..ha..ha..ha..ha..ha!!!!!!!

The characters are one-dimensional, the gritty-cop-feel very forced, the supers themselves uninteresting, and the crimes and criminals cliche. Most importantly, our ace detectives Walker and Deena don't actually solve any of the murders, even in the bonus Previews material; the perp or a witness literally just shows up and explains what happened. There are no suprises. The sequencing of the panels also jumps all over the place, which had me pausing to re-read pages constantly.In the end, I opted to return this book and grab Invincible, Vol. 2 instead. A far better comic, IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comic!","review":"This is a wonderful collection of an amazing series. Bendis is at his best in this series and Oeming's art is excellent. The only reason this collection didn't get 5 stars is because of the binding. Because it is hardcover some of the art and word balloons are cut off. It wasn't that big of a deal for me because I have read these issues previously but if you haven't you run the risk of breaking the binding when you try to open the book up to see the complete pages. Still well worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's so poorly bound that some pages cannot be read","review":"I was looking forward to reading this, but I can't read it because of the way some of the pages are bound.

It hit home because I too had the same problem and my mother treated me the same way. She had hung my sheets out the window a couple of times, but I unfortunately wasn't able to run home and beat the bus. The school was too far away.Humiliating a child can make matters much worse. I found that because of my mother, I continued to have a problem up until the time I moved out. Once I was away, I didn't have the problem anymore because the stress my mother would put me through was gone.Parents should think before they speak. Don't belittle a child because of something they did wrong or by accident. Try to correct the problem instead of shaming them. You'll find it works much better.I would really love to see this movie come out on DVD... or even a re-make of the movie would be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolfie Would Have Approved","review":"Having grown up listening to records (yeah, those big black groovy things) and cassettes of Mozart's later symphonies, I was hoping to find the best CD of those symphonies, and I think this is the one. Frankly, I don't care for period instruments (they may be \\"authentic,\\" but my ears prefer inauthentic), and I think the Berlin Philharmonic does justice to these exquisite pieces. The G Minor Symphony, No 40, is one of the great symphonies of all time, but I've always thought the slow 2nd movement does drag on a bit too long (12 minutes on some recordings), but here the tempo is bumped up enough that it runs less than 8 minutes, so the movement doesn't become tedious. I think the 3rd movement, menuetto, from Symphony 39 is the best I ever heard. I've heard the recordings of 40 and 41 by Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic, and they are decent, but this set is hard to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correct Polarity","review":"Most CD recordings, basically the industry standard, are presented with inverted polarity. See [...]. My Cd player allows me to change the polarity, which I generally leave inverted, to restore most recordings to correct polarity. I can't even listen to inverted polarity now that I have this ability. I wondered why this recording sounded so strident, unbalanced, bright, of one dimension and incorrect timbre. I could hear the power of the Berliner was sumptuous, but the engineering was dreadful. So I changed the polarity and there it was, music.

But two hours of storming the piano keys can wear on the ear. So I also love this set too. #2, according to the Gramophone critic, is played as marked by Liszt- how can anyone argue with that? Liszt, your wrong in your own music? It will make you sit up and listen. Yes, if you have heard the big thumper it strikes the ear as wrong. That's more about intrepretations we have got used to. Not what his \\"right\\". There is perhaps more music in this set than Cziffra. It is quieter, more searching, even frenetic. I don't find it robotic at all. If anything, to me, it feels just as willful as Cziffra but in a different way, rhythms jump out and shift on a dime. Yet, I can see how the guy who wrote this became a monk later in life.Biggest test: does it make me sit up and listen? Absolutely. Is it all of one piece? Yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"eccentric and irritating","review":"Szidon's interpretations (and they are very much interpretations) are downright weird. He messes with everything, it seems, just to sound different. The tempi are off, he adds awful cadenzas and other passages of his own, and misses the spirit of these pieces entirely. Of course, it was standard practice in Liszt's day not to play the notes as written. In fact, such was expected of any good pianist. But these interpretations are just willfully eccentric, and they destroy the music rather than enhance it. Buy the Jeno Jando versions on the Naxos label--they're cheaper and MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The man is a pedal freak !","review":"Mr. Szidon makes excessive use of rubato and pedal, he screws up No.2 and No.12, the greatest ones in my opinion.In No.2 for example, he plays the most cold LASSAN I've ever heard (and I've heard 24 versions of this rhapsody), with very staccato chords, and pedal lack. Then in the Friska, he seems like he wants to make it up for the LASSAN, he uses the pedal in places that are not indicated, in the last chromatic octave run he uses so much pedal that the sound is distorted (I think he saw fffff on the score). His cadenza is awful and the final Prestissimo is screwed up by a ridiculous pianissimo.No.12 is so rubatoed that it seems like he's pausing every minute to change the page.A bad impression in general, get Campanella's version, it is far more warmer than this one.

The narrator goes on for at least 15 minutes about how great she sounds and how much people are seemingly in love with her. The language the author uses to describe Kelly is just rediculous. I mean this person can not be serious. Here is an example from the first track on the cd:\\"her tunesmithery is deceptively deeper than most charts' pop, devoid of inane fluff and facile sentiment. it sneaks in and luring dissonances abetted by melancholy twists and turns so virtually every song of hers plays nice sweet and sour tricks on the ears\\"I am so glad I did not buy this CD.

It has a tendency to bend when heavy pieces of wood are passed over it. It also leaves streaks of red paint across the wood as they are being cut. I had to drill and install an allen screw at the front edge to take up the slop between the insert and table top. And with all these problems how on earth did this thing become it's current price of more then fifty plus dollars? These were about $20.00 a couple (two) years ago. Since when did Delta become so money hungry? If you don't absolutly need this...don't buy it. It's not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard Manufacturing & Quality","review":"I concur with another less than desirable review of this product. This is suppossed to be a Delta Part not an aftermarket product. The fit of this cast aluminium piece in the cast iron table is deplorable.

However, it was incredibly difficult to install on a Mac because you need to have a really old font installed on your Mac as well as have the ability to set your screen resolution to a really low setting that some Mac's don't let you do. We ended up having to use a different Mac at my wife's school and used a few tricks we found online (google this product's title and these issues will all come up with solutions) to get it to ultimately work.

There are a lot of people who say they grew up playing The Oregon Trail, bought this for the nostalgia, and loved it, but I don't agree at all. Those people were either playing a different version or optimists.The CD Rom I got came with no instructions so it was difficult to navigate the game. I didn't know how to get in and out of the general stores or what the point was of exploring the forts. I think some of the new features and games made it extremely tedious. I suppose a longer playing time is good and makes the game worth the money, but I just couldn't get over the disappointment of it not being enough like the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS XP","review":"Just purchased this game and it does not run on my computer with windows XP.

The kids LOVE it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and Fun","review":"I have Windows XP and the game downloaded fine on my computer.This game is very accurate. It does a great job of gently reflecting the racism during the time. But by no means does it encourage racism! It mentions people buying their way out of slavery, the California Gold Rush, etc. It even has the Chinese building the transcontinental railroad! All these details show that the people who developed this game really knew their history.The game also gave great realistic information for anyone who wanted to survive the Oregon trail. The player can learn about the variety of animals to pull a wagon, how to cross a river, about different species of fish and plants, etc.The game was a lot of fun. But it was actually pretty short. The increase in features from older versions may have led to decrease in playing time.I would definitely recommend for any parent to buy this for his/her kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love this game & so do I","review":"My 23 year old loved this one when he was younger, so when I saw they'd updated it, I got it for my 14 year old.

The font is from OS 9 and is called New York. It was a default system font in OS 9. When you try to launch the game in OS X it asks for the New York 18 font. The original font was a Truetype Font and 18 was an included size. Problem is that OS X doesn't see the 18 part. The FIX is a really simple one and that is probably why nobody figured it out yet. First, get the font New York from someone with an old OS 9 System or if someone still is running Classic on an OS X machine you can get it there. Don't worry about the legalities. Apple no longer cares about OS 9. Rename the font by putting a space and the number 18 after the name New York. Double click the font to install. Restart. DONE. Hope this helps. By the way, you can probably get the font New York by going to this webpage at apple where you can download an old system for free. As in NO CHARGE.

But sometimes when I play it, I never get past the original city to get my supplies. DO NOT follow what your trail guide says about getting suplies. You always end up getting too much. When your out on the trail, make sure you have a gun and the stuff you need to work it, fishing gear, and plenty of vegetables. When you run out of meat, you'll need to hunt a lot.

It is time consuming and confusing to get supplies in the beginning of the game. The supplies you can get are what would have been available back then, but we don't use them today so I had no idea what a lot of them were used for. You also have to go from store, to store, to store to get different supplies. You can leave from more than one city, and choose more than one city for a destination, but the map doesn't even show the locations of all the city options. My biggest problem is the hunting and fishing. You can shoot right at an animal and it just scares it away. With fishing, they will swim all around but not catch the line.

However, after every brew, I find water under the tray (and it is not full) and if not dried each time, it then leaks onto the counter. Maybe it's defective. Also, the portafilter spreads the coffee too far apart so if you are only making one cup, you have to hold it up to the spouts so a not to lose the brew. Finally, I think the switches are counterintuitive - you press on the top of the switch to turn them on, and on the light at the bottom to turn them off.

The coffee drinks that can be produced with it are superior to many machines - never sour or bitter when the right amount of beans are used and they are tamped properly - and it makes great micro-foam.Other qualities to be appreciated are its heaviness, good looks, quiet operation and metal steam wand. If you are looking for great results at home then the machine must have a burr grinder of a similar standard. When the grind is right before brewing then I believe it's down to using beans that have been roasted within weeks, not months!Silvia is a great machine and probably the cheapest entry into the semi-professional units and when you get all the variables right she makes exceptional coffee.

The temperature is an annoyance, but if you take some enjoyment from 15 fairly labor intensive minutes in the morning to make your perfect cup, this machine just isn't for you.We've made over 2000 lattes since we got it, and even if it doesn't come out perfect, it's still always better than a Starbuck's automated latte and we've rarely ever wasted a shot.

There's a series of little velcro tabs that need to be wrapped around the back and front that are hard to manage one handed. The seat belt doesn't fit through the back of a standard shopping cart if yours (like my grocery store does) has one of those ad placards on the back of the seat. Alternately, the seat belts that come on the grocery cart don't fit through the holes on the cart cover. After all that, if you do get it all set up and your child inside, the sides of the cart are left open to germs.

As a tummy time mat it was ok, though it was annoying how the velcro stuck to the carpet.But as a shopping cart cover, it's useless! You can use the strap around the baby as a seat belt, or feed it around the cart, but it's difficult to do both. It doesn't fit over the handles of all shopping carts. The snack cup flops over and won't hold a thing. The pea pod backrest is cute, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about this item.There are a lot of other shopping cart covers that are a lot easier and faster to use.

The padding is worthless and provides no cushioning to prevent the metal digging into my baby's chubby thighs. It's very cumbersome to attach all the velcro to make it stay in place, and then it's too narrow and doesn't cover the sides. The cup holder in the front doesn't grip anything. I don't know why it's even there. Now I use the EZ Carry Floppy Seat. It's much better and covers even Costco-sized carts with plenty of cushioning.

So protect them from all of those terrible germs in a shopping cart but they will find a way to defeat your best efforts.Save yourself the time, money and energy and accept the fact that WE (as adults) survived shopping carts, dirty sandboxes, bugs, playgrounds, etc. and survived.

You could certainly use some of these in an emergency, which is what the author suggests, but that's not really the point of the book in my view.The real use would be for kids-- or, even better, kids and parents-- who want to mess around with some every day items in ways they haven't previously, have some fun, and enjoy some \\"Wow! Look at that!\\" moments. Had the author designed the book explicitly for that purpose, many of the negative reviews here wouldn't have been written.So, the book is both pretty silly and enjoyable, but it's not any sort of survival manual.

By speaking to terrorist leaders and recruits, Stern creates an engaging, thought-provoking book about the nature of religious terrorism. The combining of terrorism with God creates a super-potent cocktail for violence because the goals of the organization now have sanction from a higher power providing all the justification many leaders and followers need to justify their actions. Stern does not target one individual religion as any religion can be used as a pretense for evil. However, Stern goes further in her interviews by providing insight as to why some people join terrorist organizations, while not making broad sweeping generalizations or creating the prototypical image of a terrorist. Highly recommended reading for anyone interested in learning about religious terrorism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold, Informative - an inside look at the religious militant","review":"This is a very interesting and informative look into the minds of today's religious militants.Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this work, is the fact that a fortyish Jewish/American woman gathers her data by roaming around the streets of Gaza, Islamadad, and Kashmir (amoung many others). For the most part, these militants treated the author with respect - and often went out of their way to make her feel comfortable. It reminds us that these are people, despite their radical beliefs and actions.I found the right-wing Chrisitan and radical Jewish content a little less interesting.Nevertheless, this book was very well-written, thorough and enlightening to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrifying Absence of an Editor","review":"I knew I was headed for trouble when I found that the jacket materials of her book have defined this author to be the preeminent authority on terrorism today--a preposterously inflated claim, and irresponsible to boot in these uneasy and confusion fraught times. Equally disturbing is the quality of the writing, as awkward as that of a marginally capable graduate student and so strikingly in need of extensive editing as to put in question the legitimacy of the publisher. Certainly an important topic. We simply need a first-rate book on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit jumbled","review":"I caught an interview with the author and was not convinced by her nervous and jumbled words. Now, most people have a problem with public speaking, so I wasn't willing to discount the book simply because of a poor author interview. I found the book to be similar to both interviews I've heard from Stern: jumbled content. Perhaps the book was hastily finished due to the times, but I simply can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Although the concept is interesting, this book was not as accurate as I would have hoped. It was also fairly monotonous. I saw Stern speak in person; she never answered the questions from the audience and did not really even know her own book well enough to be informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"More money being made on 9-11. There is a disconnect between true discourse and the race to get rich before Americans realize that 9-11 was precursor to the 21st century's own bogus cold war. Russia had no ability to do much of anything to us, we now know that. The oil politicians allowed us 9-11."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable look at a difficult subject","review":"I have grown utterly weary of the explosion of terrorism studies following 9/11, but this book held me rapt from beginning to end. Stern has written a deeply personal work far removed from either dry academic prose or \\"I was there\\" anecdotes without losing the ability to present a fairly balanced view across a number of regions and religions. The result is a remarkable look at both the personalities of those she interviewed and her sometimes startlingly honest reactions to each one. Her style is solid and the footnotes are filled with extensive, valuable resources for further reading. This is not a good buy for those readers that prefer the author remain detached from his or her subject, but in my opinion it is Stern's first-person style, descriptive narrative and open revelation of her thoughts and reactions to each subject that makes this an especially powerful work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technology as religion","review":"Both religion and technology are seductive in their ability to both soothe and explain - but both are dangerous in the hands of zealots of either discipline. Stern, a Harvard professor and former fellow on terrorism at the Council on Foreign Relations, expands her definition of religious terrorists worldwide by including the Muslim jihad in Indonesia, militant Palestinians, zealous Israelis, and Americans who kill abortion doctors in the name of Christianity. Stern outlines how militants of all persuasions find recruits and recondition them in cultlike sects to embrace suicide and murder.Stern spent 5+ years traveling worldwide to research this book, which combines psychology and forensic science in a remarkable study that all who are interested in keeping abreast of the growing role of religious terrorism should be required to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Made Hardcore","review":"Great album simply put.

A few (few) of the things she suggests (and she admits) aren't necessarily \\"You've Never Heard of This!\\" type stuff.

Harnoncourt drives the vienna philharmonic to before unreached heights. The musival content of his vision, the power thereof, and the mirror it produces for the listener is most unsettling. Here is music at its best, not necessarily beautifull, but confronting, harsh sometimes even aggressive. Harnoncourt knows about PEOPLE and how they work..."},{"rating":"1","title":"beauty made repulsive","review":"In my life of Mozart-worship, the only interpretation of his music that I can't stand is this one. (I couldn't even make it through the first movement of the second concerto.) Harnoncourt does something disgusting to the music--I can't quite define it, but I know it involves removing the cantabile element of the music, which is essential to Mozart's style. Kremer's playing is very good, but he is under the spell of the conductor, and his playing suffers for it. Harnoncourt's recordings of Mozart's operas have been harshly criticized (including many pleas that he avoid Mozart for Mozart's sake), perhaps we can see why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extended Revelation for those without this album.","review":"After discovering TSOOL through the Behind the Music album , I decided to investigate further, and luckily for me, came across this gem. Its smart, clever and it influenced by the folkish elements of the late sixties.The band seem to be a lot more relaxed with this affair, as opposed to the faster and more urgent Behind the Music. This does not mean that this album is all laid back folky whimslings however. It is at times meaty, rocky and toe tapping but it retains a psychedelic aura that makes this album a supreme pleasure on the ears.Alikened to Kula Shaker, and also supporting them on tour, Crispian Mills (Kula Shaker's lead vocalist and guitarist) once declared the Soundtrack of Our Lives as the 'best band in the world ever', although this may be a little tounge in cheek, he does make the point that this band is very special, and hopefully one that can keep up its excellent musical past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music despite sub-par recording quality","review":"Joe Lovano's latest cd, recorded live at the Village Vanguard has been receiving a lot of press, some of which has to do with the recording quality. Well, let me say that the music on this disc is 5 stars all the way. Great songs, arrangements, and solos. Joe's nonet is a superb band, and if you like Joe Lovano, or \\"little big bands\\", get this cd.The sonic quality is not great, yet it is not horrible either. I'd say its different. It sounds a bit like some bootlegs that are recorded in the audience, but only a bit. The sound quality is not as good as most recordings from the Vanguard, includings Joe's previous recordings there. But if you are a fan of Joe Lovano and small big band recordings, I'm pretty sure you will like this cd, and will consider it money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't we pay for the quality of sound as well as the music?","review":"This would have to be one of the worst sounding CD's I have heard. Don't get me wrong, the music is excellent. But the recording quality? It sounds as if they forgot to take the covers off the microphones. There is no excuse for this. Considering that the recording company gets the bulk of the money, what else are we paying them for other than excellent sound quality. If I was Joe Lovano, I would be hopping mad. And if Blue Note were serious about presenting their artists in the best possible light, they would admit they stuffed up big time and take Joe back to the Vanguard and do it all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for begining writers!","review":"I purchased this book set because of the Natalie Goldberg connection, and since I wrote a thesis on her works, I like to keep up with her publications.

Not so. The writing is wooden, mechanical and impersonal. All of the characters talk the same and we have to rely on the authors to tell us what each of them is like. Which often comes as a surprise. 15 years is a long time for any book that centers on computer technology, so one wouldn't expect this to have aged well. But consider: Heinlein's The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress is from 1962, this from 1992. Heinlein's book is fresh and thought provoking, this one is just boring. The computer ideas aren't really very interesting and, really, Minsky should have known better. So how can you have the right ingredients and have such a lousy result? I got this used and very cheap. It's still a waste of time. Alas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad, it had potential","review":"I picked this one up at a second hand book shop -- Harry Harrison and Marvin Minsky? Wow, how could I go wrong!Unfortunately, the ideas are not backed up by very solid storywriting here. Very little characterization is used, and the interaction comes across as somewhat dull and empty. None of the characters seem much to act realistically to what happens to them, except possibly Shelly, and Brian's personality never seems consistent.As for the ideas, most are predictable and very straightforward extrapolations. The mecahnics of the AI is interesting, but comes across at times almost as textbook lecture, and many of the other more interesting ideas are left undeveloped.Well folks, this is just my comments. Personally, I was disappointed somewhat by the book, but didn't consider it a collossal waste, either.Your Mileage May Vary"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed and badly written","review":"Though the books has some interesting ideas about AI, few of these ideas are truly new. There are a lot of tired examples of Machines throwing off the yoke of their human controllers to prove they are worthy of equal consideration.

All I can say is, I didn't wait long enough. This book could have been pretty good. I kept expecting a twist or surprise that never happened. It just kind of plodded along and then ended. Granted, technology has been chugging along so maybe some of it felt a little dated. But the characters just didn't engage me at all. I even enjoyed Prey more than this book (I think I even reviewed it here at Amazon) and that says a lot. I guess I'll put this back on my shelf with the other hardcovers.

Here it is performed by a rather large string orchestra. The original clarity, drama and brilliance of the sextet is compromised. The fugues are hardly decernable. Nowhere on the Amazon.com page or liner notes of the CD is this fact explained. The Sextet version is far superior to this muddy string orchestra presentation, so I returned the CD as unacceptable. The Rocco Variations and other pieces on this CD are acceptable, but not outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as impressive as hoped for.","review":"This book held so much promise but for me was a real let down. Firstly, I had hoped that there would be far more examples of international textbooks for each historical topic. For many aspects of US history there were alternate history book texts from just 2 or 3 countries. Hardly impressive. My impression is that the author simply rounded-up history books from a core of 6 or 7 major countries and then just took excerpts. It is no where close to the wide & varied study I was expecting. In addition to the lack of true variety and comparison, the book is also very dry reading, even for a history lover. I would not suggest this book to anyone. It promises a colorful and exciting look at how nations observe and teach historical events from their perspectives but really offers very few comparisons and most of those it does include are not all that provocative or insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like","review":"If you are looking for structured and useful ideas this may NOT be the best book on turnarounds.

In fact, there is no doubt that I shall be reading more of her books in the future!It was wonderful to see hero's feelings and longings. In most books, the hero's thoughts and desires are not described in-depth. We OFTEN see the heroine being the one vulnerable. But this book introduces a different kind of heroine, one who is gutsy, able to defend herself, smart, and so REAL. She stood by her ideals and her conflict was so well-drawn that I felt her confusion! What surprises me is that the hero was equally well-drawn as the heroine! Usually we get lop-sided characters--one overshadowing the other. But in this, both had their demons (literally)--and not stupid ones either and both felt the same conflicting feelings for one another.I could almost feel the tension and anticipation between the two!

I understand the typical quality of items at this price point and wasn't expecting miracles, just something with a flat bottom that would hold my work while drilling. The problem is that the base is EXTREMELY warped and will not sit flat no matter how clamped. This means that, no matter how well you have your drill press calibrated, you can never drill something perfectly vertically using this vise.

I cannot believe that this vise was sold being represented as a Delta Product which it was not. The casting was poorly manufactured and cast.

It's so inert, undernourished, and detached that one can't imagine the conductor had any interest in the performance. Yet every bar is under control, and the Cleveland Orch. plays suprbly, so boulez had something in mind. He isn't simply drifting.

A absolute overlooked gem of a recording that is everything this Boulez recording is not, and in much better recorded sound.Kudos for coupling the rarity to fill up the CD, but nobody is buying this CD for that rarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was ozawa and boston thinking with this one","review":"skip this and get dutiot montreal synphony version it is way better in every way.the sound is pretty bad to.how any body gave this 4 or 5 stars is beyond me .to me its just a bland and empty performence,its like boston synphonys playing is like by the numbers or the notes .and this is my favorite composer and one of his greatest works of art,and one of my favorite works of his"},{"rating":"2","title":"Karajan's great, but Ludwig doesn't trump Fischer-Dieskau","review":"With one of Mahler's major symphonies and two of his more important 'orchestral' song cycles on this CD pair, one can anticipate great listening. At the moment, I can't compare Karajan's Mahler 9th to any other performance, but I feel Christa Ludwig's performance of Ruckert Lieder and Kindertotenlieder simply do not come off as well as the same works performed by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. Regarding the 9th Symphony, as well as Karajan does it, I simply don't find it as interesting a work as the 8th or even Mahler's first symphony. Since this CD pair is not really 'budget' priced, I would consider other sources for your Mahler Lieder over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art disguise","review":"1 1/2Shallowly off-kilter electronic ambiance is little more than wheezy samples and pecked notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Create an Interest","review":"The book was purchased for two reasons.

It is aimed for younger readers but as an adult I enjoyed the book and want to learn more. There is nothing offensive and with the illustrations has appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Some New Rap/Nu- Metal","review":"Im sorry but im a big fan of rap-metal.... Maybe it's because it's hard to find good rap metal these days. Hed pe and downset can't make a new album every 4 months. This cd is great, it's got the rap, the screaming, the melodies, everything to make you happy. I really like the rap voice he has. Not too many people are gifted with it(vanilla ice, other rap/metal poser bands). But the people that are Limp Bizkit(i guess). The others that have a great voice to rap is Nullset(even though they got a new singer) Downset, Taproot.

His remarkable narrative of the life of the church, together with extracts from historical documents concerning individuals involved in church, city, colony and state, repeatedly give readers the feeling that they have lived through those 370-plus years themselves.The names of the church's leaders, from the Puritan beginning to the Unitarian Universalist present, provide a rich continuity, through some extraordinarily turbulent times. Whether you are a historian, a Unitarian, or simply a lover of Boston, I cannot recommend this book too highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I would rate myself at the intermediate level when it comes to editing. I was fairly new to Premiere Pro 2 (was using 6.5 before) when I purchased the book. There were some things I knew already that the book described but I didn't know a lot of the shortcuts. It also taught me a great deal about using all of the Audio features, so that was a huge bonus for me. All in all, I thought the book was great. It was easy to work through and follow.

The controls are by far the best for the wii yet. Activision managed to take full advantage of the possiblities of the wii remotes. However, the graphics are just okay, as well as the sound. Still, this doesn't stop you from enjoying this game. Like I said, the controls here get an 11/10! There is a major drawback here, though. I beat this game in under 7 HOURS, not including extras. This story mode is UNBELIEVABLY SHORT! Upon beating this game, rather than being happy I was dissapointed that it ended so fast. I would advise you to rent this game or buy it cheap, but do not spend your $50 on this incredibly short game. Fun but not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"After shown what was possible with Spiderman 2, this game is a BIG let down.

The webslining is fun, but it takes a while to learn how to use it effectivly. I also didn't enjoy how the game didn't follow the movie at all. Yes the few villans spiderman fights in the movie are in the game, but the way you fight them, and how they die are completly different. Also they tied in some aspects of the movie that are false in the game (Sandman's daughter). Yes she is a character in the movie, but in the game they changed her character. I also would have like if they would have stuck to the timeline of the movie. The game feels rushed, and it just goes from one thing to the other.Thats my opinion...take it for what its worth.If you want to play...rent...don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Beijing","review":"This is a terrific piece and a great way for people who didn't go to the conference to understand the significance of Beijing and the motivations of so many women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever!!!!!","review":"This book is wonderfully written. Michener easily combines his information on Afghanistan into a gripping story which will leave you awake till two in the morning. There is no book like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened to the plot?","review":"Caravans by James A. Michener combines romance, comedy, adventure, and mystery all in one. Even if the United States was not focusing so intently on Afghanistan at present, I still would have very much enjoyed the book.The characters are very lifelike and the plot and setting are unique. However, the plot wasn't exactly compelling. It was overshadowed by the detailed descriptions of Afghani culture and history, which was interesting to read, but had the plot been strong along with the descriptions, I would have given the book a higher rating. At some points it feels as though Michener wrote a non-fiction informative novel, rather than fictional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Journey","review":"First published in 1963, this is just one of many remarkable books by James Michener. The setting is Afghanistan in 1946. It's a story about nomadic tribes, diplomats, an American woman and an incredible journey through the Afghan hinterlands. Factual events and places are woven into a riveting adventure of danger and romance. Michener draws upon the vast history and culture of that ancient land, expertly chronicles the intrigue and violence of its post World War II years, and keeps the reader eager to read the next page. Check it out and draw your own parallels with what is going on in Afghanistan today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now and then","review":"Six months ago I reread this book. Caravans had a profound influence on me 35 years ago. It was my first exposure to a Middle Eastern culture and its views about women. Perhaps if more people read this book or books of its caliber there would be more understanding of the Afghan people. The main thing to remember is this book was written prior to the Taliban being in control. Since 9/11 this book has come to mind over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"The book arrived quickly and in great shape. Just what I wanted. Good book at great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caravans","review":"I did not like this book. I did not find it very entertaining.

It is the tale of a young American diplomat sent to retrieve an expatriate girl from Pennsylvania who has run off with an Afghan man. Michener weaves around this plot an intertwining love story quite different from the love in \\"Caribbean\\" or \\"Tales of the South Pacific.\\" Michener's craft is evident as always: he is able to bring life and love out of a barren or hostile climate, in this case the steppes of Central Asia. Not his very best, but short and very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Novel","review":"Caravans, like the other Mitchner novels, is all historical information except the plot. Caravans takes place in Afghanistan where an American woman name Ellen Jaspar has been missing for 13 months and no one knows where she is, so Herr Millar, a worker from the American Embassy goes to Afghanistan to find out where Ellen is or what happened to her. This book is very interesting to learn from especially after the September 11th tragedy. This book contains lots of information on Afghani culture in a fun and easy way to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not read it yet","review":"I have not read this book yet.

The book, set in Afghanastan, introduces one to some of the cultural and environmental aspects of that land, which were interesting, but I never truly seemed to care much about the fictional characters. Call me spoiled by JAM's later blockbuster bestsellers, but I barely finished this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michner's Afghanistan","review":"Another great Michener novel. This one much shorter than his usual, but a wealth of information and insight into Afghanistan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great History Lesson and Great Read!","review":"Don't be fooled by the \\"Harlequin Romance\\"-looking cover art. Caravans is a ripping good adventure/travelogue/history lesson, with some romance thrown in for good measure.The story is simple: An American girl who married an Afghani man is missing in Afghanistan. Her family is frantic, and a military man stationed in Afghanistan in 1946 is assigned to find out what happened to her. The story veers into some unexpected territory, and Michener delivers a TON of Historical perspective on the people and places of Afghanistan without ever making you feel like you're back in History class. (This is a VERY illuminating book to read after September 11th...)The characters are interesting, and the book just zooms along: I finished it in no time flat. My only complaint is the map in the beginning of the book: It's printed so dark that it's totally useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big thumbs up","review":"The biggest negative about James A. Michener's Caravans is that it's too short. I could have read on about 1946 Afghanistan, about the fascinating nomads who traveled the upland plateaus of Asia, along the three thousand year old caravan routes that took them from Jelhum in the winter to the mysterious Hindu Kush mountains in the summer. I have not read other Michener novels, yet, hoping by the way that more of them reach the kindle. The story itself is ok, but it's the underlying sociological and historical setting that makes it so compelling.Michener traveled to Afghanistan in the 50's and, refering to a trip that took him from Qala Bist to Rudbar he writes : This took us across the Registan desert in a caravan that camped at night in sand dunes with little water and less food. It was from the experiences of this trip that i developped my love of desert life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caravans Review","review":"This is a wonderful book. I read it years ago and just finished rereading it. Michener is a great story teller and this book bears that out. Some parts did upset me, but that is what makes it a great book. A definite must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still relevant","review":"James Michener wrote Caravans in the 1960's and everything in this story is relevant today. Nothing seems dated in this wonderful story set in a country that should be foremost in our minds. In fact, also read Rory Stewart's book, Walking Through Afghanistan, for a another viewpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Not his best - a bit superficial. You really don't get much understanding of the Afghanistan culture. Perhaps because this book was written in the early 1950's before Islam rose to the level it is today. I didn't find anything compelling in the characters. A fairly quick read of a once first tier author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but. . .","review":"Great, but why this one and not the rest of the Michener books? I have them all in hardbound, but want them on my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"learning about the future from the past!","review":"Michener always captures the essence of his subject. Caravans brings to light a society unchanged for centuries. Tribal government and loyalty know no artificial boundaries, and the religious right of yesterday becomes the Taliban of today. While this book is more than 40 years old, it's a great lesson in the culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paperback vs. hardback","review":"I was very annoyed by the fact that the book that I received was paperback when it was supposed to be hardback so beware of \\"bearbooks.\\" When I tried to return the book, I has problems with Amazon so beware of Amazon customer service. Having given up trying to return it, I have recently started reading the book. It is excellent. It gives a tremendous amount of insight into Afghanistan. One amusing line was the advice given to the American embassy worker who was launching on a journey to the south. The advice was that he should keep his eyes and ears open because one never knew when the US might become involved in a war there. The story itself is gripping, moreso than Alaska, Hawaii, or Centennial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one from Michener","review":"James Micheners novels are just awesome, never read a bad one. This one is much shorter than his typical novels, but it was packed with history, a great a story and again, it really left me with a desire to visit Afghanistan. Why, you may wonder now? Although this book was written over 40 years ago and the country has changed, a lot has not really changed.Great perspective especially considering our ongoing military ventures there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love The Story but.... 4 stars for the story 1 star for the errors.","review":"I've read author James Michener since the 70's and love what I learn from him and can count on him for a good page turning book.

I had read Harriet the Spy, and loved Louise Fitzhugh's books. This is the last book that Fitzhugh wrote before her untimely death from a brain hemmorhage.Eleven year old Emma and her eight year old brother Willie don't really get along. Their parents won't let them grow up to be what they want. Overweight Emma wants to be a lawyer like her father, while slim Willie wants to be a Dancer. Emma's father is against female lawyers, and finds Willie's dancing most irritating.I really liked the part when Martha, the babysitter asked them if they wanted custard or ice cream for dessert, and Emma asked for both and Willie asked for neither. ... Other than that, this is a great book, and I would reccomend it to any teacher or student. Buy it at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, humourous, with a serious theme","review":"Yes, it is a serious theme. It's still going on around here (stereotyping, sexism or whatever you'd call it), tho' I wonder if it'll be as bad as Emma's - her father being the one who's being \\"unfair\\". I like the fact that Emma and her three new \\"friends\\" realize what's going on (in a way), and that not everything becomes solved coz that's the way it is in real life. And it's still humourous in some ways... I think it is, anyway.Emma wants to be a lawyer - her dad is against female lawyers. Willie (Emma's younger brother) wants to dance - but again his father is against the idea and would really like Willie to be a lawyer.

The author makes the point that being a mother is not all sweetness and lace - but self-sacrifice and more self-sacrifice. She makes a good point - that Motherhood is not for everyone. It is a decision that should be made carefully and thoughtfully and no one should ever be pressured into having a child.Around this same time, Ann Lander's survey came out - where she asked her readers - \\"If you could do it all over again, would you have children?\\" And a large majority said \\"NO!\\".This book explains the reasons some folks regret having children."},{"rating":"2","title":"For moms who know that raising children is not all sweetness...","review":"If you wouldn't want to trade your children for a barrel full of diamonds but sometimes you just get so 'burnt out' with parenting, you could cry, then this book is a good read.

When you're playing through the storyline, you can only be 1 person. Collaborate playing in Shrek 2 is gone except for maybe in minigames, and we loved that! Also, there is entirly too much fighting and *very* little puzzles. From level to level, scene to scent, we find ourselfs fighting endless people by eldlessly shaking the controller.

In his attempt to make Paul's theology accessible to all readers, Barrett sometimes opts for a less-than-full-orbed exegesis of the text. This is particularly evident in his translation. There are moments--some of which can last for several pages--when Barrett takes his readers right to the heart of the Apostle's mind and heart and lays bare the genius that has inspired and confounded great thinkers of Christendom for ages. Attributing his gratitude to Luther, Barth, and Nygren; Barrett draws from a wealth of historic knowledge from several different traditions, adding his own penetrating insights at some of the most crucial points in the epistle. His exposition of chapter one is worth the cost of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I STARTED TO GROW IN TO IT","review":"I DID NOT LIKE THIS ALbUM WHEN I FIRST GOT IT,bUTI LUV IT NOW,MIKE T FUNKY TRACC IZ DA HARDEST LOC."},{"rating":"2","title":"the pause rapper","review":"1 of my favorite albums of all time.

But it doesn't matter here. This isn't real life, nor meant to be real; it's about much bigger things. A friend told me that the film wasn't about baseball, it's a modern-day myth, a tale of love, of redemption, set not in Greek temples with gorgon-like monsters, but in 1930s America. The result is a beautiful inspiring film (with an ending a little bit different than Malamud's novel); a tale of light and dark, of good and evil, of the choices we make in life -- the ones we regret, and the ones we keep paying for.A pat on the back, too, to the wonderful cast, the breathtaking cinematography, and Randy Newman's break-out film score, the majesty of which still plays in your ears years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Natural is supernatural fantasy.","review":"The Natural is one of the best examples of missed opportunities you are ever likely to see. It pits a baseball hero against all odds and nearly keeps you in suspense up until the ridiculous final third of the film. The whole plot falls apart when Hobbs becomes Superman, and begins skinning baseballs with his fantasyland bat. The climax, which involves a Grand Slam into the floodlights, is really silly, and would be better served in a Three Stooges comedy. A terrific buildup to a goofy climax. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Dissatisfied!","review":"I couldn't even play my new DVD, The Natural, in my my DVD player or my 2 computers.

After a very promising start, the movie just went way over the top and became almost a cartoon. Every time the guy hits a homerun the cover actually flies off the ball or he hits the lights, setting off fireworks or something else larger than life happens. I went into this movie with great expectations and left feeling like they blew it.

I ended up hating the book. On the other hand, Robert Redford is perfectly cast as Roy Hobbs, just how I pictured him to be. The story is well done, and Barry Levinson does a fantastic job in mythologizing the legend. I think the ending of the film let me down because it just ended quite cheaply. Moreover, the poor acting as always by Kim Basigner doesn't help the film any. So, I prefer Major League as the best baseball film made. All in all, The Natural fell short of perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"The book was one of the best sports novels I've ever read, the movie pales in comparison.

I would only add the following:There is every chance that other than a mature individual will not enjoy this movie so greatly as others obviously have.There are moments in the actors' dialogue, comments on life and its lessons, that the casual viewer will probably miss.Robert Redford attended the University of Colorado on a baseball scholarship.Redford and Hall of Fame member Don Drysdale were starters on the same high school baseball team.Don Drysdale is among the best hitting pitchers, ever. He was elected to the Hall of Fame the same year \\"The Natural\\" was released at theatres."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director has lost sight","review":"I don't understand how someone could allow such a sub-par edit of a great film to leak out, and pretend that it is some superior \\"cut\\" of the original. Every director's cut I've ever seen carefully improved the existing film (with the exception of George Lucas' nightmares: SW) Barry Levinson forgot the emotion in his own characters if he actually had anything to do with it. The added scenes were cool, but tainted by such an inferior editing job that robs any emotion the film originally had. Bottom Line: The pace of the film is totally off and with no good reason.The special features should include the original cut so buyers get a decent film in the package. All things considered, The Natural is my favorite movie ever. And they made it into a sloppy hack-job. Terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Director's Cut is the only version to see!","review":"The Natural (Director's Cut)This version of The Natural was so much better than the original theatrical release.

This one didn't have much substance, though. It's about a baseball player in the 1800's that is shot in the chest by a stray bullet and continues to play in a baseball game. Due to an electrical failure and a defective baseball, the game is halted and his team is granted the win to much fanfare. There is also a subplot with some woman... possibly a lukewarm love affair. I did not pay much mind to those parts so I can't recall every detail of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to find anything good to say about this movie.","review":"I am absolutely baffled by all the positive reviews for this film. I can't even count all the things I dislike about it, but I'll list a few:1. Redford is way too old for his role.2. Ditto Glenn Close. And not nearly attractive enough, either.3. How did Roy go from being a prodigy of a pitcher as a teen to being a prodigious power hitter later?4. The mythic hits by Roy are ludicrous. How in the heck can you hit a foul tip harder than anyone else, so that it shatters a pressbox window? And the climactic homer near the end -- what's with the broken lights raining sparks for what seems like 10 minutes? Not to mention the fact that the sparks shower down on the basepaths, which are about 300 feet away from the lights.5. The \\"home run music\\" was okay. Just okay, not so great that it has to be used over and over, ad nauseam, at half the ballparks in the country.Very, very mediocre film, at best. Again, I just don't understand why people rave about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated tripe","review":"The Bottom Line:A baseball movie that knows nothing about the sport (Roy Hobbs is a pitcher the first time we see him and, inexplicably, a slugging right fielder the next time he's on screen) and attempts to impose a larger-than-life mythological feel on a simple story that manifestly cannot support it, The Natural is an overlong, overrated, and unenjoyable film that didn't even have the guts to follow its source novel to the dark conclusion the plot warrants.2/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"Where are the US online reviews for this DVD?

The print is so incredibly tiny that I had to take it work and enlarge it on a copier just to read it (and I have very good vision). It is written in 4 different languages and offers one sample and very basic reading. The rest is up to you. The descriptions of the cards are very simplistic, and although the cards themselves are attractive, I'm sure there is more to their meaning than what is described. I guess I'll just have to wait and see if someone decides to publish a book to go with this deck or put one together of my own interpretations. Overall, disappointed with this one.

All of the titles were written by Mariah that proves her talents inside and outside the booth. The title track starts off this album with a more pop, R&B feel to it. Into a more emotional, heart felt ballad, \\"And You Don't Remember\\" has the production, lyrics to match the big voice of Mariah. And continuing on the quiet storm tip, she struggles with letting go of a past love on \\"Can't Let Go\\". \\"Make It Happen\\" is an up-tempo track with a message of hope and belief. She captured a more classic feel of a 70's tune with \\"If It's Over\\". Track 7 \\"So Blessed\\" is another slower tempo song where Mariah Carey shows her vocal range quite well as is on \\"Till The End Of Time\\". Last but not least \\"The Wind\\" caries this album to heights to match her voice and to match the success of the previous album with a jazzy touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know why people hate this album","review":"This album is a great follow up so what the sales of it didn't match her first album!

One of Mariah's best","review":"This is one spectacular music CD. The name of this album says everything about what Mariah is about. Gorgeous sound stage throughout the whole CD. My faviourite song is 'till the end of time'. It absolutely exudes emotion and it suggests to me what Mariah is all about. The instrumentation is also brilliant. Its great to listen to something so classy and orignal. For example the way in which the end of song number nine fades into the last. The piano on the last song also gives the CD that extra oomph!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old sound","review":"Mariah Carey produced wonderful music in her \\"Vision of Love\\" album, but this is like the same thing all over again.

EMOTIONS is the best example that rush things always end up wrong. EMOTIONS is Mariah Carey weakest album. Vocally and musically. Holding a safe spot is CAN'T LET GO(even though it sounds like a clon of any of the ballads in Carey's debut), and MAKE IT HAPPEN( a church favorite gospel track). The rest of the album is simply done so fast enough, that the lyrics don't matter at all. Even the leading single EMOTIONS is so weak and cheap. IF IT'S OVER is a drop cut of CAROLE KING, and SO COLD, TO BE AROUND YOU are so dated, and filler. Definitaly an album to forget.

And even up front, we still get the occasional noise into the signal.

Somewhat of a modern and more cynical interpretation of the religious communities several centuries in the past and probably more accurate as well.

That explains a lot.Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not impressed","review":"The writing made this a difficult read until you are able to comprehend the style which occurred to me halfway through the book. I did not find the book a gripping read in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for College","review":"I purchased this when I found out I needed it for an American Literature course and was worried that it wouldn't arrive before I needed it (as it didn't offer any sort of quick shipping); however, it arrived well before it was scheduled to and for the books age, my copy was from 1987, it was in remarkable condition aside from the natural yellowing over time and some highlighting other students had done before me (which I view as an aide rather than a hindrance). I was briefly worried as my professor wanted a specific edition (Vintage) and the cover I got didn't match hers which is the one I thought I was getting as it was the one pictured, but the books appear to be otherwise identical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but I don't think it merits more than 2 stars...","review":"This book is sad and hopeless. The entire tone is about death and dying and the unhappy people surrounding it. The character Darl is interesting, and Faulker's unique conveying of the story from different viewpoints as the book unfolds is what I feel is what makes for the sensational reviews. Although I understand many find this a work of literary genius, I don't feel it merits that much enthusiasm. This is essentially a unhappy story about sad people transporting a dead woman's body across a broken society. It does have it's creative points, but a reader looking for a good story to invest their time in reading would find better stories elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"As I Die Reading","review":"Man, this book is not written for the reader. The story is fascinating, sure, but that's after reading a lot of notes, and listening to a lot of criticism. Why couldn't the issues like the pregnancy, who was speaking, jeez, was Jewel a boy or girl, a brother or sister, how many times did you have to reread to figure out what the hell was going on. Sure, for those of you who got it, you liked it, but that was after having a professor tell you how great it was. On its own, this book would slowly die out. Clarity is important in writing. This book is muddled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish it 2nd time around.","review":"I read this book about 20 years ago in high school and hated it. I just tried to read it again for a book club discussion. I thought that 20 years of life experience and growth may have changed my attitude toward this classic. It didn't. I made it half way through and decided to quit wasting my time. The characters are self-serving, and I just didn't care about them. The stream of consciousness style of writing is not my thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching Paint Dry Is a Better Alternative","review":"William Faulkner is considered as one of the best authors in American history. But after reading this book, I must disagree.The novel is about a southern family dragging the corpse of the mother through the state of Mississippi to get her buried at the proper place... (I have to keep myself from laughing when writing this)... while encountering different obstacles such as broken bridges and flooding rivers. Along the way one family member breaks his leg and another seeks an abortion.The novel is written by different members of the family through short narratives and dialogues. The family is hopelessly anachronistic: pouring cement to fix a broken leg and looking for an abortion in a pharmacy. This book constantly reminds me of the \\"Beverly Hillbillies\\", except it's as much dull as the \\"Hillbillies\\" is humorous.Personally, I fell asleep numorous times while reading this book, and unless you're forced to read this or is a Faulkner devoutee, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"May Not Have Otherwise Read","review":"Classic fiction really isn't my cup of tea. I did really enjoy Faulkner's \\"stream of consciousness\\" writing style. At first, I really fell into the story and the plight of the characters. Then I began to lose interest with the slow pace of the plot. However, towards the end, the drama increased and I got back into the story. There were some amazing lines of thought in the story that really made me think. I think my favorite was a line from Addie Bundren \\"... and that sin and love and fear are just sounds that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words.\\" Overall, As I Lay Dying was a dark novel that is deeply moving and lyrical at times, and sharply to-the-point and simple at others. Glad I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I read this for my English 111 class at the University of Washington and, though it's not my favorite (check out The Fox and the Hound by Daniel P.

I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE this book BUT...","review":"I have read this book in the paper edition and wanted to have it on my kindle as it's one of my favorite books. I bought this and was very excited until I got to reading it and discovered this is the \\"corrected version\\". I prefer to read a book in the way the writer wrote it, not corrected. No where in the description does it say it's corrected. I am unable to locate a kindle edition that states it's not corrected so I'm hesitant on purchasing another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, One of the Greatest Works of American Literature","review":"Actually I had avoided this book until I had read what sounded like Faulkner's most interesting and important works. And I am glad I did wait, As I Lay Dying is very funny in a grim way and terribly sad. Having come from Appalachia, I can see the essential truth in his portrayal of the white -trash Bundren family. (My mother is a fish ????) Let's all hope that the Sean Penn film version pulls no punches."},{"rating":"1","title":"No need to pick up","review":"It was a bit painful to read at some points, but in the end I was able to look back a get something from the novel. th dark humor was laughable only after the novel was read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"I can sometimes be a literary snob* when it comes to classics, I guess due to being an English grad. Suffice it to say, this is probably one of the most boring books I've ever read. I truly don't know what the \\"hype\\" is about (I suppose because it's Faulkner?) and I could barely finish this novel. I'll be trading it back in to Amazon ASAP.With that said... how does this BOOK COST $21.95 and only have a trade-in value for $0.50??? RIDICULOUS how books are so overpriced.*Literary snobs are overrated anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promises kept","review":"'As I Lay Dying' is the fifth novel written by William Faulkner. The book tells the tale of the Bundren family and the journey to take their mother back home to be buried. As Annie Bundren is dying her family prepares. Her husband promises her that he will take her back to her family home to be buried. This promise proves to be the much more of a burden then could have been expected.The story is written in the 'stream of conciousness' style. The characters take turns telling their viewpoint of the journey. We get to see into each characters mind. Seeing how they cope with this loss and other troubles that are on their mind. This style of writing may not be for everyone, but I found it fascinating.This book was a joy to read and has sparked interest in more of Faulkner's works. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible!!","review":"Yes, the language is easier to understand as you go along, but, truthfully, why would you want to? The story is silly, the characters are even sillier, and the ending is completely confusing. I am a high school student, in an advanced class, and I really don't see the value of the book. You have to grasp for straws to find meaning, and it's not really worth all the energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful imagery but not much more","review":"I appreciate Faulkner's vivid imagery in his writing, but I am not a fan of this novel. I cannot seem to get interested in any of the characters, or the plot. I can't relate to any of the characters because I can't even get to the point where I know them. Perhaps, it is the devices, such as stream of consciousness and dialect, that he uses. I've heard he's been compared to Toni Morrison, and I really liked The Bluest Eye, but I really cannot seem to enjoy this book at all, just appreciate it for it's style."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLLLAAAAHHH!!","review":"I had to read this book for my second semester Honors Literature class at Northern Arizona University, and I respectfully disagree with all other reviewers that praised this work. I found it dreadfully dull and boring, and loathed reading my daily self-allotment of pages each night. The personality quirks of the characters were ridiculously aggrandized, particularly that of Clara. If you're looking for something better than dull - this book is a must-skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"A struggle to get through","review":"First off I am baffled at how many people like this book. You know a book is written poorly when you have to go on to sparknotes.com just to figure out who the characters are and what the hell is going on. Clear is something this book is not. What is with the round about ways of saying things? Is it that difficult to just say what you mean. Ok maybe it's because I'm not a English Lit major and I didn't have my professor explaining every sentence to me which is what I could really use to get through this book. I don't care for any of the characters and the story line is just plain boring or at least I imagine it is if I knew what was going on. I like reading books with themes and symbolism and I have even been referred to as a \\"book snob\\" but maybe this book is just over my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"People actually liked this book?","review":"The book was absolutely awful. Not one person had any sensible thoughts. If someone came close to making sense, their thoughts were hard to follow with a different speaker each chapter. All i got out of this book was: don't cross a river with a coffin, and bananas must be really tasty (the characters probably ate over 10 tons of them)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was insane!","review":"I picked this book up because the title caught my eye. I mean \\"As I Lay Dying\\"?! That's pretty cool! I figured it had to be cyberpunk with a philip k. dick title like that. Or a book about zombies. Boy was I wrong! I guess I should have read the back of the book first.Turns out it's a book about these people who are trying to take the stinking corpse of thier dead mom across the american south, which still sounds like a pretty good plot even if thier are no zombies. Actually these people are about as smart as zombies.Even though some pretty funny stuff happens to these people, like when one guy breaks his arm and the family pours concrete on it, on the whole this Faulkner guy could learn a thing or two from Stephen King. Keep trying buddy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"really stupid and annoying characters","review":"really ahrd to understand. The characters are really selfich. It was really un realistic as well and all in all I thought that it was aretty stupid and not worth any one's time. Byt the way, even my dad and Mom agree with me and my mom is and English magor."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Faulkner novel.","review":"I just wanted to let everyone know that there ARE high schoolers who enjoy and understand this book. My AP English class just finished this book. The characters are creatively diverse, the plot is interesting and allowing each character to voice his/her version of the tale provides insight otherwise impossible. I had no problem with the stream of conciousness style and the religious symbols provide for a striking message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take your time, it's worth a slow, thoughtful read.","review":"While you read this book, listen carefully to what Jewell has to say - and note how infrequently he's allowed to speak. His true, heroic nature would have shined through too obviously if Faulkner had often given us Jewell's thoughts. A careless reader may infer that Darl is the normal, loving son, while in fact he is insane. Read the book carefully, to find out why Darl is insane, why Jewell is the hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Funny Yet Pathetic Book","review":"Well, What can I say except this book was a pleasure to read. It is written in a somewhat \\"modern\\" style and is easy for the average reader to comprehend. The humor of the book is found in the characters. Because each character gets a chance to narrarate a part of the story, the differing points of view help to move the story along quickly. The book was cleverly written, centered around a pathetic goal- to burry the character's dead mother and wife. It is a truly pathetic tale told in a funny way!! Bravo to Faulkner!!!- A superb book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Read the original book from which graham swift wrote his booker prize winning \\"last orders\\"...and didn't even give due acknowledgement to Faulkner. A good novel, heavy with Biblical undertones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-reading Faulkner","review":"I grew up about 60 miles from Oxford, MS, Faulkner's home. He was a \\"must read\\" in high school and college in Mississippi, and I recall liking the stories he told but having difficulty with his stream of consciousness writing style. I think another reviewer I read made a good comment-- just read and let things work out. Faulkner will let you know what you need to know. It is a lot more enjoyable reading his novels for fun rather than for testing! I plan to go back and read lots more. It is a great story with a surprise ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As I Lay Dying","review":"Read this for my book group; disappointed in it.

I find it amazing that Amazon would accept a book whose pages were not cut properly, and then sell it as a book that is in first class condition!!!! I am sure that you hope that I need this book immediately (which I do) so that I will not return this \\"defective\\" book. Since I have to use it immediately, I have not returned it, but this review is to warn others about your deceitful tactics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for leisure reading","review":"Faulkner uses vivid descriptions and varying narrations to tell this odd tale. Despite the seemingly clear-cut style in which this book is written (the chapter title denotes the narrator), it can often seem confusing, and the story is not told in chronological order. Although the ironies and humor found in the novel do not compensate for faults, they do make the story stand out and memorable. This book requires much patience to interpret the personalities of the characters to fully appreciate this novel, if that is possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"great insight","review":"I read this preposterous book in high school, got the point of it but I still can't scrape off the impression that it's a fancy angle on daytime drama; the characters, with the exception of Darl, haven't come into relief for me even years after I finished reading the story. The best Faulkner can to with this superficial tale is to obfuscate the plot enough that the readers are forced to pay way more attention to his writing than it merits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate Faulkner!","review":"I hate Faulkner. would never recomend reading anything by this man. If you want to read literature read something else. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Although it's considered politically incorrect to contend that As I Lay Dying is not a great (if not one of the greatest) novels of the 20th century, I have to differ. Despite all the acolades for his style and \\"stream of consciousness\\" writing, this book just isn't well written or enjoyable (Apparently, Faulkner cranked this book out very quickly with little editing - it shows). A hallmark of skilled writing is, to say the least, not to make things tortuous for the reader. This book is not only tortuous, but not worth the pain. The literary poseurs who fawn over this book should gaze in the mirror. You're not wearing any clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucked!","review":"As a high schooler I was forced to read this book for anassignment.

I am not going to provide a lengthy explanation, because all of you who rated this 5 stars will just condemn me as a moron, and all of you who don't like this book will only agree with what I have to say.I agreed with most of the one and two star ratings (beyond the argument that it was \\"confusing\\"), and did not feel obligated to write a review other than to hopefully lower the overall rating of this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Work Of Art","review":"A testament to human endurance. Faulkner wrote this one in his spare time (while working 12-hour days)in a matter of weeks. The narrative structure (simpler than Sound And The Fury)allows glimpes of a tormented, fascinating inward eternity only Faulkner could achieve. Never read a Faulkner book? Begin here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As I Lay Dying","review":"Beautiful experiment in seperating voices and subtle plot. I read it in one day. Classic Faulkner. Highly recommended for writers or serious readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"As I Lay Dying--Critical Edition","review":"Faulkner is not for everyone, I think anyone who has ever read a single page of his writing canagree to that. Stream of consciousness dictates to the point of distraction, characters contradictthemselves, and you almost break out in a sweat as atmospherically he's nothing but pure Mississippi.But, he's fascinating with his use of language, and, amazingly, his stories moveforward. The trials and heartache involved in seeking to transport Addie Bundren to her desiredresting place in death are so haunting that the book is nearly impossible to forget.The newly released Norton Critical Edition is a great help in putting it all together.There are explanatory footnotes included in the text, along with a fine introduction and criticalessays at the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both \\"tragic\\" and \\"hilarious\\"","review":"I love Faulkner's brand of humor, albeit is is exploitive on some level. One could look at this as early \\"mississipius peccadillus\\" and be right on the money. Certainly the poor folks of Mississippi had layers of problems back in the early 20th Century (and as they do today!) and this family was no exception.Here, The mom dies, but before she does, she forces her husband to promise that he'll bury her where she wants to be buried -- far away! They are poverty-stricken and have neither money nor viable means to get her there where she wanted to be buried but the old man tries his damndest to make good on his dubious promise.I should say that this work is VERY much akin to Jesse Stuart's \\"Taps for Private Tussie\\" in both subject matter and in Flavour as well. So if you end up loving this one you may as well grab \\"Tussie\\" too.This one is a hoot -- one of Faulkner's best and true to his unique, \\"back-door\\" writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing but daytime drama","review":"I read this preposterous book in high school, got the point of it and identified with the Darl character but got into it emotionally. In fact, I still can't scrape off the impression that it's a fancy angle on daytime drama; the characters, with the exception of Darl, haven't come into relief for me even years after I finished reading the story. The best Faulkner can to with this superficial tale is to obfuscate the plot enough that the readers are forced to pay way more attention to his writing than it merits."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is confusing","review":"Im 17 and am pretty intelligent but when i read this book for my AP class I didnt understand what was going on to the extent that i would have liked. I dont see the point in making what could be a humurous and vibrant description of an unusual occurence into a laborious chore to read. The lack of cronological order is very annoying and i dont see why Faulkner did it that way unless he wanted to make people angry. I would not recommend this book unless you have great comprhension and read at a very high level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful dialect","review":"This book is perhaps useful as a linguistic reference point for a particular dialect of English, but is nearly without worth as a piece of literature.

I was attracted by the concept, which was hardly adressed throughout the book. It is told through vignettes of different characters and their perception of what is happening, which is an amazing idea and I loved it greatly. However, I found that the book circled the \\"story\\" and \\"point\\" a lot, instead of keeping to it. A lot of the vignettes have no relevance but character development, which is good...just not when it interferes with the overall \\"story\\". I dragged my attention through this book, and regretfully the only parts that could intrigue me was the beginning and the end...the core was just a simple story of an eventless journey. I guess the best way to describe this story is: Imagine writing about a long family road trip...long, scenarically devoid, and dead. \\"As I Lay Dying\\" relates to the reader dying from boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT KIND OF CHAPTER IS THIS?","review":"VARDAMAN\\"My mother is a fish.\\"(If you happen to know the answer to this question or can tell me how this is relevant to the novel, please feel free to e-mail me.

The only drunk smarties were Mozart and Edgar Allen Poe, but they were brilliant before they started drinking. Also, if you have not completed the 5th grade and then write novels, you are not a genius either. I promise. I wish someone would've let Faulkner know that before he stumbled home toasted one night and barfed up this novel. Whoops! Did I say novel? I didn't mean to imply that it was new or fresh in any way. Reading this book-esque object just reminded me of reading Mark Twain. The only subtext was 'Being stupid and poor is artistic now. Ha ha ha.' The subject matter was dull to me. Every character was so appallingly obnoxious that by the end, I wanted them all in the damn coffin. Don't buy this book unless your coffee table legs are uneven and you need something to shove under one of them for stabilization purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chore...but worth it in the end.","review":"This was my first experience with Faulkner and I was overwhelmed. As I forced myself to get past the first few chapters, I loathed the language, the names of the characters, the interrupted style. To Faulkner's credit, however, I could see the vultures, smell the smells, and commiserate with the [unbelievable] lot of characters. I found myself getting completely unnerved just wishing they would hurry up and bury her! The ending was a great surprise and earned the story a few extra stars in my opinion. Reflecting back on the painful task of getting through it, I realized that this book actually made me think! His style is unlike anything I've ever encountered and I'm a better person for having read it. Tough? Definitely. Worth reading? I think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurts the brain a little, but it's worth it!","review":"This book was packed to the brim with dark, ironic humor. It's definitely a thinking person's read, as it jumps back and forth between points of view frequently. Sometimes it can be hard to tell what's going on, but if you read closely enough, it'll come to you. Also, you can tell everyone when you're done \\"I've read Faulkner.\\" (If you're not really literature savvy, that's a good thing. It means you are saying you're smarter than them without saying it directly.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A psychological masterwork","review":"This book is one of the most psychologically compelling pieces of literature I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Faulkner, a master of the macabre and the psychological, intricately weaves together the psyches of his characters, making each one different and interesting. The personas range from childishly humerous to deeply religious to downright frightening, and it is an interesting task to attempt deciding which characters are truly insane and which are not. The book is stunning, especially if you are willing to look into the different aspects of the characters and their lives. Definitely one of the best books in existance, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short read, but good","review":"I usually don't like Faulkner, but this book was quick and easy to follow. The differing narratives gave a lot of life to the story and the dialects and personalities within didn't really take away from the plot going on. Overall the plot of taking the mother to be buried seemed like a vehicle to use the device of multiple narratives.I can see why it's a classic, but personally it isn't my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"No middle ground","review":"You're either going to love this video or hate it. I fall into the love-it camp because the perverse and dark nature of its humor is entirely in keeping with the decadent style of one of my favorite artists, the great Michael O'Donoghue, brilliant National Lampoon editor and writer for Saturday Night Live. Mr. Mike's world view is on ample display for 70 minutes here, and it isn't pretty. It's twisted, cynical, and frequently marries the heroic to the mundane. If that's not a style of humor you enjoy, you will find this show off-putting and it will probably test your patience.

In real baseball, hitting mechanics don't involve placing a stupid cursor to a certain spot according to the type of pitch the hitter estimates will be thrown (the cursor becomes a shade of red if you've guessed it right in this game but not always a guarantee the pitch will be delivered in that particular area). In real baseball, you simply keep your eye on the ball and simply time your swing just right if its at all hittable. Contact can be made here, but not so much with skill, but blind luck. I give it 1 star for decent graphic detail but tah.. that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dumb game","review":"Dont buy it. one time I hit a ball and it went up the middlle. the announcer said\\" down the 3rd base line. it stupid"},{"rating":"2","title":"best since mlb 200","review":"I nhave played many next gen baseball games on ps2 and all star 2002 on game cube and still i thought i would never play a better game all around than mlb 2000 on ps 1.

Graphic wise I was blown away,rendered stadiums, player batting stances, pitchers deliveries it is all here. I had a little trouble at first batting but it gives you a handicap option until you get used to it. Fielding is also a tad bit difficult at first but with time you'll be making lunge grabs with Nomar like a pro. One thing i noticed though is the game is labeled an arcade style big scoring game, i dont really agree with that, I have played about 20 games now and have hit one homer, and that was with Jave Lopez, not exactly a long ball hitter you know.

The book is short (\\"little kid's book length\\") and you really feel for the line (and get rather disgusted with the self-centered squiggle) in those few pages. The two-color, full-bleed illustrations are perfect and really add to the book's impact.I recommend the book for intelligent adults... and perhaps 10- to 14-year-old kids, if they are bright and independent (or if you want to encourage them to think critically about what it means to be \\"cool\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much general information","review":"I wasn't sure what audience author was trying to target as I read this book.

The Berlin Philharmonic under von Karajan is consistently wonderful. I have many of the tracks here on other recordings, so the real advantage here is compiling them into a collection that is slow, quiet and serene. The silky sweet slickness that critics often complain about imparts a sound, especially when played at low volume levels (as in background music) that makes it quite effective as a relaxation CD. Ear candy for the weary. The set begins with an excerpt from Debussy's \\"A Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun\\", and includes Respighi and Ravel pieces that give this particular set a distant, ethereal, stoned feeling.

EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS \\"BAD TO THE BONE\\" This is a perfect example of what gospel hip hop, or whatever you may want to label it, is all about. I would have to say that Kirk Franklin has out done himself. I praise GOD for this fella. He mentions in one of the songs that he has gone through something and he didn't realize that GOD was making him, breaking, him, etc. If it takes that to bring forth true GOLD, the Lord has done it. No one wants to go through trials and tribulations but, when the outcome is produced one realizes why they(Trials) are a necessity of life. I recommend this CD to each and everyone out there who is a true lover of gospel music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirk Franklin's rebirth","review":"In my opinion, this is a great album because contributions are made by other artists such as Yolanda Adams, Shirley Caesar etc. There's also a guess appearance from Bishop T D.

I'm not saying that he is I'm just not as sure as I used to be. My younger brother approached him backstage at a concert in Kansas City about some gospel material he had written and Kirk shrugged him off very un-christian like.

The only thing wrong with this game(and maybe I just have Attention Deficet Disorder...)is that it gets so tedious dueling people over and over and over and...sorry. I can't say I love the storyline, that would just be sick (however, I do love Yugi), but I do LIKE it alot. This is a good game if you don't mind kind of lame jokes and a few boring characters here and there. And I can tell you not to depend on card codes from Gamefacts.com-- some don't work.

Here is a hint:Go to a place(most likely a card store) where you can look at some cards and write the 7-digit code and then try entering them on your game.

I bought it as soon as possible. The graphics for the game are average compared to ps2 but for ps one they arent that bad. The only flaw of the game is that cards cost way too many stars and your oppnents usually have better ones. Right now i have Exodia, and 3 blue eyes white dragons. Some of the battles commands get confusing. Even if you havent seen the show you will stil like it. I guarentee it. If you buy one RPG this year make it be Yu-Gi-Oh!. Trust me on it you will love it......Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"another review for all ya gamers","review":"Alrite ive had the game for about a month now and let me say the game still rocks. This game is a must buy. I have barely put it down. This game is EXTREMELY challenging later on in the game. If u have gotten to the high mages you no what im talkin about. A major flaw to this game is that the good cards in the game cost 9999999 star chips which would mean u battle about 40000 times in free duel mode which would take years. If u have a gameshark i suggest you use it because i doubt u will ever get the cards u want with out it. A bright side to the game though is fusions which is when u combine cards to make more powerful ones. The best fusion is the dragon scroll,a plant beast, and a lightning beast. This will make the twin head thunder dragon which is one of the most powerful cards in the game. If u want a challenging game but is fun at the same time buy Yu-Gi-Oh! you wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game Is Off The Chizainz","review":"WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THIS GAME REALLY IS BUT HEARING HOW THEY EXPLAIN IT SEAMS REALLY PHAT I'M GONNA GET THIS GAME FOR CHRISTMAS AND I'M GONNA LOVE THIS GAME I ALREADY HAVE SOME CHEATS FOR IT BUT I'LL WAIT UNTILL I ALREADY BEAT THE GAME OR HAVING A HARD TIME AND CANT GET BY SO I'LL USE THE CODES.

It is best personified in the great character study of the beleaguered Carol Kennicott, who left the big city and dreams of culture to exist in mediocrity and banality in the small town of Gopher Prairie, Minnesota. The reader is taken along her tumultuous life in this small town with her husband and family. At times the book is slow and can seem depressing. As a student from the Northeast who moved to the Midwest for college, it genuinely helped me gain a greater understanding as to why people act as they do in the Midwest. While Lewis wrote this book in 1930, his lessons are still applicable today in understanding human social interaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"So small towns really are unprogressive?","review":"Ok, so small rural towns are unprogressive and full of gossiping narrow minded simpletons. So what else is new? I assume that if you're interested in reading about these boring people Main Street is good. I can only guess that when the book was written, small towns were considered a glamorous place to be and the book exposed otherwise - making the author a hated person by rural WASP's all over America."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic tale of an idealist in a small town","review":"In this classic novel, newlywed Carol Kennicott moves from a city to the small town her doctor husband calls home and must struggle to survive a social and cultural environment she finds oppressive. College-educated and ambitious, she is frustrated with the town's lack of artistic and cultural endeavors and her attempts to raise local standards are met with disapproval.\\"Main Street\\"'s strongest point is its humor: through dialogue and description, Lewis paints a detailed picture of Carol and her neighbors - their thoughts, plans, manipulations and foibles, particularly those they all have in common. The book is both powerful and frustrating, since the issue it raises (how to fulfill any but the meanest aspirations in the context of the trivial daily lives most people live) is still applicable, and since the book offers little in the way of solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"We All Live in Our Small Towns!","review":"Obviously the protagonist Carol wants more to life in Gopher Prairie. She wants culture and intelligence and witty conversations. Of course where can you find that now without paying a price. Even in the urban cities lies problems beneath the surface, I think Carol should learn to appreciate what she has much like the author who despised small town America. If you come from a small town, it does not mean that your mind is small. Of course, most people travel around the world seeking a utopia or paradise to call home. Carol represents the author's resentment and hatred toward his hometown. I thought it was funny that the author wanted a Pulitzer when he would receive literary's highest honor of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the first American to receive such an honor. Oh well, be grateful what you have and remember the grass may not be as greener on the other side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Main Street","review":"Main Street is a satirical novel in every sense of the word. Lewis attacks the narrow-minded, intolerant and rude citizens of Gopher Prairie, Minnesota, and compares them to every other small town in America. 90% of the book discusses this topic while the other 10% speaks of the methods the main character uses to try and change the town into something it is not. Though there is a touching point at the end of the book where he praises the simplicity of small town life, by then you are so depressed by the dull town, the gossiping townspeople, and the straying main character that it loses its meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL Deal!!","review":"This Is an Awesome Game!

If you want to hear how completely different the same music can sound, listen to the Cleveland Quartet doing Beethoven. I have bought a number of the Emersons CDs and sadly the pattern in my opinion is much the same - exceptional musicans displaying how well they can perform.

This music is difficult enough as it is without having it fly by you at breakneck speed. The Emersons are obviously in love with their own virtuosity -- isn't that special -- but the point of performance is to let the music speak for itself. Nuff said. 2 stars is generous. P.S.

I was skeptical that this could really out-do my old standby turtle wax so I did a side-by-side comparison on the hood of my 2011 metalic black VW GTI. After a wash and glaze treatment I applied half turtle wax and half Meguiar's #26. They both applied the same and the Meguiar's was a little easier to buff off. Initially there was no noticable difference between the two. Then a couple of days later, after a little rain and pollen accumulation I noticed that the Meguiar's side still looked brilliant while the turtle wax side looked like a waxed car that had dried pollen stuck to it. The verdict is still out on how long a coat will last but with the ease of removal and the general sheen, I'm happy to keep using this on my cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on par with other Rogers novels","review":"I was very disappointed with this novel. I've read & enjoyed many Rosemary Rogers novels before, but this one was boring from the first few pages. I had to force myself to finish it.

Rogers repeated the gypsy dancing theme (it was a little annoying) and she threw in her infamous rape scenes. However, I found \\"A Dangerous Man\\" and the characters and their love for each other to be a bit mroe believeable and their final unite was not as annoying to get to as \\"Sweet Savage Love\\". The ending of \\"A Dangerous Man\\" did lack a little more passion than I was hoping for. But overall, it was a good book. The beginning is a little boring, but keep reading.

I love authors like Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett. I'm willing to overlook the odd shortcoming or flaw in a book for the sake of a good story, and Road to Mars begins as a good story. The meaning of comedy theory is a little irriating, and disrupts the narrative flow, but one can always skip irritations. But no matter how good your story if you don't end it right then your lost, and the ending in Road to Mars is simply ludicrous. It just brings too many ridiculous coincidences into play. If you like big-budget Hollywood action films then you'll love Road to Mars. There are just as many gaping holes in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas poor Eric, I thought I knew him....","review":"Initially, I was thrilled to find Mr. Idle had penned a novel. But then I began to read it. Through the entire novel, I prayed it would get better. While it was readable, the plot was disappointingly average and the jokes were few and far from his best Monty Python efforts. Perhaps, my expectations were too high as the novel came from such a comedic genius. As a result, it pains me to be unable to recommend the book to friends, many of whom know the words to every Python bit verbatim."},{"rating":"1","title":"mmmmm","review":"Personal reviews can often be meaningless without some idea of the personal tastes of the reviewer. I love writers like Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett. I love off-the-wall, bizarre humour. I think Monty Python is terrific. My favourite movies are made by the Coen brothers, experts in weird humour. I thought Road to Mars was an entertaining read....until I hit the appalling ending. Urghhh! Talk about writing in a twist just for the sake of writing in a twist! Road to Mars is easily the worst book I've read all year. Really, Eric. I expected so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Look at Comedy","review":"Originally, I bought this book simply for the namesake of the author, Eric Idle. I thought that even if I never read it, the book would be a good piece of Monty Python-esqe memorabilia (I'm a big Python fan!). I laughed, I cried, and then I read the book. It was better than I had expected, combining the act of the witty Muscroft and Ashby, the inquisitive (and somewhat crazy) robot Carlton, and the ambition of the micro-paleontologist narrator. The book explored the background and roots of comedy while setting up the characters in the story to experience the effects of irony, tragedy, and the dumb luck of comedians. It also combined comedy with a zany futuristic setting, making anything and everything possible. The book was truly worth reading and I highly reccommend it to anyone who likes irony, wit, and is searching for their own meaning of life or, more importantly, comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"embarassingly ordinary","review":"as a huge fan of his other work, and of humourous scifi in general, i can hardly begin to tell you how disappointed i was with this book. his editor seems to have decided that it would be too hard to edit the manuscript into any kind of reasonable shape, and has instead relied on the author's fame to sell the book and win the readers.

Bravo Eric!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm sorry to express my non-conformist opinion........","review":"But I thought it was a good book. Being a truly fanatical Monty Python fan, I picked it up expecting spectacular results. Admittedly, those were not what I got, but I thought it was a good book. It's quite funny, and the incredible number of Monty Python related stuff that slips in is great fun, like when Carlton can't understand with the Flying Circus is all about, and John Cleese's name appearing twice, and Eric Idle making fun of himself. Bits of quotes appear as well. The characters are not exceptionally developed, that's true, and the Bill Reynolds narrator person is a bit odd, but it's just a fun book. It's not like reading \\"Crime and Punishment\\", people, it's just a nice book to sit down and read when you're bored or slightly hyperactive - so calm down it if wasn't a literary masterpiece. It dosn't have to be to be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps not a masterpiece...","review":"I belong to the generation that grew up on Monty Python. Therefore I had to get this book. I do have mixed feelings about it. First, do not expect a Monty Python style book! All the members of the Monty Python group are now making their own careers, on their own merits - not their Monty Python merits. Second, some parts of it are really good, others, shall we say, not so good....Basically, the story is about a not very succesful comic duo and their robot. Superimposed on their story is a rather bland crime story, involving interplanetary terrorists.The book has its funny moments, that is true, but that is not the reason for reading it. Rather, Idle uses the book to explain the nature of comedy and the character of the comedian. That is a serious and interesting topic. It is the robot who is not happy with its station in life and wants to become a comedian itself. To achieve that it must first work out what comedy is and how it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit his laughter button as perfectly as I had anticipated it would","review":"Purchased this product as a \\"gag gift\\" for a very VERY close guy friend...it received the best reaction I could have asked for....we laughed and laughed about it...

In this age, such a logically balanced view is quite imiportant and - I feel - quite rare to find in Christian community.Well, being logical itself is not against Jesus.He has done all of those efforts to be a true witness of the LORD.

The entire drama with Nicole grew and evolved to become one of the central foci of the book. For that awesome scene at the end - and the realization of the meaning of the Universe - it almost deserves a \\"*****\\". But Nicole's other self seems so human like in her wants and desires.

The ingenuity of the multi-layered intelligences, and the religious overtones really resonated with me. The great strength of the 4 Rama books is the fact that one can achieve a genuine flow, with believable characters: some real heroes, some genuinely evil people, and the rest, like most of us, somewhere in the middle. And the plot can unfold at a sane pace - rather than cramming every idea one has into one book. And a very mature, subtle, spiritual ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it possible to rewrite the last two books?","review":"Wow! What an absurd concept, that GOD, the creator of all, would need a starship! It left gaping holes and could have or rather should have gone in another direction altogether.

The character pattern is so definitively established by the time they wrote this book that except for the history lessons you already know how it is going to end.In the end I kept reading in the hope that there would be something worthwhile to be garnered from the effort it took to read this atrocity.

I really dont know why Clarke had to invoke god in order to explain the alien constructs - couldnt something like just a very advanced alien civilization or something do? And for that, you come across one of the weakest, most powerless gods youve ever read about anywhere! I mean this god thingy is creating multiple universes to conduct his experiments, and he cant even manage faster-than-light travel? The guy defines the very physical laws thatd govern the universe, and he has to cart his observers and subjects around in a huge arkship pondering along for generations just to reach from one star system to another?

If you want a superautomatic espresso machine that's going to make espresso with a simple push of a button and look great in your kitchen without costing you an arm and a leg, then this Cafe Dolce baby is it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undelivered Merchandise!!","review":"Well the item didn't get delivered from my understanding!

I gave it a good hour, and I tried to get into it, but I could'nt. The fine people at Sega, I would say, missed a really good chance to make a really good game. Its basically a point and shoot game, but it does alot of the pointing for you. The controls are frustrating and the whole concept seems un-original. Like I said, its ok. But not a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing Game","review":"I was pretty excited to play this game so I combed our local rental places until I found it. After half an hour my opionion could be summed up as \\"I am so glad I didn't buy this game\\".The controls are a little difficult but my real problem with the game is that it just isn't fun. The level objectives are \\"kill all of the enemy units\\" or \\"find item x\\" and you find that you spend an awfull lot of time combing the map to find that one guy that you missed. Very boring. Also, I've read quite a few reviews that say the graphics are impressive. They're not. The graphics are actually below par for an XBox game, and the music is downright bad. I didn't realize how important music was until I played this game.To sum up, pass on this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Game","review":"I kind of like \\"Gun Valkyrie\\", but after watching a number of friends and especially kids play it, I have to warn against spending $ on it. Two reasons:1. The controls for flying/jumping are over-complex, and several missions cannot be completed without this move, so you get stuck, and ultimately bored.2. You cannot save DURING a mission, so if you get bored with trying the same jump over and over, you will have to go back to the beginning of the mission if you don;t want to leave your XBOX running all night. This, IMHO is the biggest single mistake ANY manufacturer can make with a video game...As I said, I kind of enjoy the game, and my more dextrous gamer buddies have little problem with the controls, but a majority of \\"casual\\" gamers that I have watched play, get frustrated and even angry with the game. So I would have to recommend against buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure [Junk]!!","review":"The graphics are the best thing about the game and they are nothing special, when you consider what the xbox is capable of.The story is retarded.Voice overs are stupid.But by far the worst is the absolutly idiotic controls. Apparently whoever designed the controls did not want anyone to enjoy the game.If you want a good 3rd person shooter go back to the Tomb Raiders, for now. I felt cheated on the rental thank god I didn't buy it. There is nothing about this game I would say was worth playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Waste of time and money.

The timed missions are the worst. There are only two characters, and the upgrades for them are limited. The best thing I can say about the game is that the graphics are amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real POS","review":"Installation was straightforward, but I could only program this (along with the SWI-PS) to give me volume control.Worked for 15 minutes, then started throwing random commands to the stereo.

These folk songs are all in English which is nice since I speak English and not German. But this music is just beautiful. I can't recommend this more highly. It's an incredible shame that more people, especially young people of European descent, are not listening to this type of music.

With a scholarly, yet fierce courage Coleman reinvents the characters and scenes he portrays, with a technical skill which borders on the supernatural. In a recent show in Rotterdam, Coleman's work was hung beside those of Hieronymus Bosch, a deserved honor.The essays in this book are excellent, describing Coleman's ground-breaking history as a performance artist as well as a painter. The design of the book by Katharine Gates is beautiful, and enhances appreciation of Coleman's work. I recommend this book to anyone who cares about art in the early 21st Century (or the 15th Century for that matter!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"learn to be with the patients","review":"This is a good book for health professionals to read.

This is my favorite book on these topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hallelujah!!!","review":"Recently I have gotten back into running and started to feel a lot of discomfort from my IT band (left leg). Of course the first thing I did was run to the computer to scour my beloved amazon.com to find a product that would remedy my problem and found the Pro-Tec IT Band compression wrap. I have to admit I was a little skeptical, but because the reviews were so good I went ahead and ordered one and boy am I glad that I did. Since receiving this compression strap I have had NO pain and I usually run four times a week. I have also since started stretching/massaging my IT band prior running with my husbands foam roller and that has helped as well. I must admit the foam roller at first might take your breath away because you probably don't realize just how tight your IT band is, but the two products work well together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it came with directions","review":"Once I figured out where to position the band and the pad that goes over the IT band, I've had good luck with it. It has lengthened the time I can run before pain sets in. Not a miracle but helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It simply works","review":"Around mile 15 in my second marathon I experienced severe knee pain in the lower right outside portion of my right knee. I ended up walking in the last 11 miles. Demoralizing. A trip to the doctor revealed an IT Band issue. He prescribed some stretches and a foam roller. In addition, I picked up the IT Band Compression Wrap. The combination of the three has me running pain free two months later. It took some experimenting to find just how tight to wrap it so that it would provide the correct support, but I have it down now. The band stays snugly in place during my runs. I live in Florida and it is already hot and muggy. However, still no slippage from the band. I would highly recommend this to anyone with IT band issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Crap It Works!!!!!","review":"This has saved my running! I was unable to run over 3 miles without the side of my knee absolutely killing me! But after wearing this strap, I completed (2) 3 miles runs and an 11 mile run back to back in 3 consecutive days. Now there was a little stiffness on the 11 mile run about 7 miles in, but there was no real pain. I stopped and stretched for about 1.5 minutes and tightened the band a little more and I was good to go. I have faithfully incorporated stretching before and \\"AFTER\\" along with the use of the foam roller every night. Check this video out I found useful...[...]I am a firm believer that this product will help if you combine stretching and a foam roller. Here are some YouTube video that helped me make my mind up. For a review check this out... [...] For proper placement check this out... [...]Please let me know if this review is helpful. I usually do not write reviews and would love to hear any feedback."},{"rating":"1","title":"works but lacks comfort and won't stay in place","review":"I purchased this IT band to use during long distance hikes. First, I tested it by walking around my home. However, when I removed it, a rash had formed on my leg under the band. This surprised me, but I assumed that I had wrapped it too tight. On my hike (25 miles), the band would not stay in place (obviously, I was sweating). I tried several adjustments, but eventually gave up and it slid down close to my knee cap. At the end of the hike, I saw that it had rubbed a sore on my leg (about an inch long). So, in the area of comfort and staying in place, it fails on both accounts. The product description specifically says that the band is comfortable and stays in place. This was not the case with me.Nevertheless, the band held my IT band in place, so I'll rate the item with two stars. I'm returning the unit to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"This band did not do any for me in activity other than restrict my range of movement. I did have a very tight IT band from dancing for years. It might be better for runners. What worked? A super firm black roller and stretching out the hips."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT Band it's a rap","review":"This is the perfect product for my needs! I'm so glad I had a friend recommend it to me. I ran a 1/2 marathon and never had to adjust the band around my knee. On top of that the strap applied the right amount of pressure to the point I needed it and my knees were not sore(sp?) the next day. I would recommended them to anyone who has knee pain after running."},{"rating":"2","title":"It saved my training","review":"I've had been dealing with ITBS for about 4 weeks when I bought this. I was training for a half marathon. It got me back on my treadmill with out pain. I was able to run for almost 2 hours with the wrap, whereas I had to stop after 20 minutes without it. It worked so well, that I wondered if I was all healed up, but I kept it on while running just in case. Yesterday was my half marathon, and I was really hoping my knee wouldn't act up. Well, it was cold and raining pretty hard, so it made the wrap slip out of place (I had it on pretty tight). At about mile 3 my knee started to hurt, so I stopped multiple times to readjust the wrap. The last 10 miles were pretty painful. Maybe if I would have worn tights or an ace bandage under it, it would have stayed in place. So, for me it worked well until I ran in the rain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"If you have an over developed IT band I do not recommend this product. I got mine in the mail today and couldn't wait to go for a jog... After about 30 mins I started feeling the infamous \\"IT band ache\\" . I removed the compression wrap and felt the worst pain I have ever experienced since I started having issues with my IT band 7 years ago. I can barely bend my knee right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"I received this item a couple of weeks ago and ran already twice or three times with it. No issues, I actually feel the knee and IT band are well supported by the pressure it makes. My 1st impression was that the item was low quality, but actually the material needs to more flexible than, for example, jumper's knees bands (patellar) because this way it can be fixed over the knee. Perhaps my only complain is that the compression area could be bigger, it's just a small square and kind of soft. On the bright side is the little manual that comes enclosed, it has some explanation on the problem and suggestions for stretching exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Hello,I've been training for my first half marathon for the past several months. About three or four months into my training, I started having trouble with my IT bands at about mile 3 every time I ran. I bought these straps and the first time I used them, my IT bands didn't hurt until about mile 6. Having that extra 3 miles of pain-free running was great. I took about a month off of running and just last week, I ran 10 miles without any IT band trouble. These are totally worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually works","review":"I ran a half marathon and had major IT Band issues after. For 6 months my IT Band was bothering me whenever I ran 2 miles or more. I read reviews and watched a Youtube video about it and decided why not try it. Me being inpatient, my first run with the wrap was 5 miles. I was able to run the 5 miles without any issues/soreness/tightness. It was awesome. If you are someone that has IT Band Syndrome I highly recommend the wrap. It won't solve all of the problems but will definitely alleviate a lot of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, a little uncomfortable and doesn't work","review":"I got this hoping it would help with my IT band issues. Not only did it not work, but I had to constantly adjust it on the run as it has a tendency to bite into your leg if it's not perfectly positioned.I think the company paid Scott Jurek to use his image using it, that's about the only good thing I could determine about this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do anything for my IT Band syndrome","review":"I tweaked my IT band 3 weeks before marathon. Purchased this product in hopes of getting some relief since I was not about to stop running and rest the leg (until after the marathon). The product did nothing positive for me.

Look elsewhere.","review":"I had ITBS and was grasping at straws to find anyting for relief - so I bought this product. It did absolutely nothing.Money would be much better spent buying a foam cylinder to roll on Foam Roller - 6\\" x 36\\" Round or go to a health food store and buy an ointment called TraumeelTraumeel Ointment 100 Gm Tube. The high density foam roller, though painful at first, definitely helps. So does the ointment - much better than Ben Gay or equivalents, although they do help a little.Don't waste your money on this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritation and break-out on legs","review":"I walk about six miles a day on my job and I don't believe these are intended to wear for an eight hour shift(40 hours a week). The material next to your skin is rubber (does not breath) and causes irritation and break outs that take forever to go away. Itches like crazy! This product does support and relieve leg pain, but I would not recommend this brand to others who need to wear on a regular basis. Another employee bought these also and had the same problem that I did, so it's the product, not the user. I recommend a product that 'breathes' as a better alternative to these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why this thing has to be so expensive?","review":"I found a pair of stretchable Velcro bands at Lowes for $4.97 and it does the job nicely.

I found myself readjusting this one more than the New Balance one. But I did find this acceptable because when I cinched it down, my leg and knees were pain free. I'll continue to use it as long as it keeps the pain at an acceptable level so I can continue to play basketball. Basic but it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work for me","review":"It didn't work for me. It arrived in a timely manner in good enough packaging. The quality seems fine.

The different puns and play on words were very funny. The different puzzles to figure out, it was all quite an adventure. Though this was a Short game once you got everything figured out.

I searched many web sites and looked at many stuffed animals. Fluffles was chosen by description for his age appropriate size, his soft texture, his stitched face (no button eyes or nose), for his gentle expression, and for the reasonable price. I did see it cheaper in a local, privately owned toy store a month later, but it didn't cost much more online. Our grandson is not quite ready for it yet, but his Mama and 22 month-old brother loved it, and I am sure he will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Konzertstuck, Unorthodox tempos","review":"I was somewhat disappointed by this album. The Konzertstuck, a magnificent and devilishly difficult work for four horns and orchestra, receives a solid but unspecial performance. Thielemann's tempos, particularly in the Schumann Symphony #2, seem ponderous and rather unorthodox. FOr the second symphony I much prefer Wolfgang Sawallisch's recording.What I still find bewildering is that DG produced the greatest-ever recording of the Konzertstuck and yet that recording is now out of print. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra recorded the Konzertstuck in the 1970s, with principal hornist Dale Clevenger playing the high part. Those guys produced a spectacular \\"wall of sound\\" with pinpoint precision and accuracy. And, the CSO of course is a much better orchestra than the Philharmonia. Hopefully, someday DG will re-release this recording digitally remastered."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this fragrance.

It flies well and it has tremendous potential as a first trainer. It has virtually no drawbacks and no bad habits in terms of its flying pattern. HOWEVER, the plane has a fatal flaw and that is the very very very very very poor construction of the boom.The thing is so brittle it will not take a hard landing, let along a crash. If Hobbyzone descides to modify the boom, which should be extremely easy to do, this plane will be the best thing in the market for beginners. As it is now, it is essentially useless because it cannot do what a beginner needs most: withstand a crash.Given the fact that the boom is bonded to the pod and it cannot be extracted without deamging that part of the fuse, one would think that HZ is just trying to force us to buy the fuse over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This plane is terribly fragile. My son has owned the plane less than a week and it is already trashed. The tail design is very poor. Once the joint in the tail breaks (45 minutes of flight), you must replace the fuselage ($35).

They got the airplane up in the air one time and when they tried to turn the airplane around it took a nose dive to the ground and the wing broke off. They did have the auto landing on and it crashed anyway.

Hoagy's own performances are interspersed by the likes of Red Nichols, Frankie Trumbauer, Paul Whiteman, Jean Goldkette, The Chocolate Dandies, Mills' Merry Makers, Irving Mills & his Hotsy-Totsy Gang, and Ed Lang (and that's just the first disc!)To crown it all, there is an 86-page booklet which has been contributed by Richard M. Sudhalter, the author of \\"Stardust Melody: The Life And Music Of Hoagy Carmichael\\". All of which makes it a very considerable bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for Hoagy","review":"Great collection,Didn't know I was getting so much music!

It was done for Green Mountain Energy Resources and in addition to the songs comes with a guide on saving our eco-system, since some of the songs concern enivormental issues (i.e. the title song, which Al Gore dubbed \\"the unofficial anthem of the enviromental movement\\", \\"This Island Earth\\"). You won't find \\"Footloose\\" or \\"Danger Zone\\" here, but more of Kenny's personal favorites like \\"Celebrate Me Home\\", \\"This is It\\" (the acoustic version from the 1993 Redwoods concert) and of course \\"Return to Pooh Corner\\" (in which he reprints the liner notes from his best selling children's album of the same name). There is also the excellent Redwoods duet he did with Michael McDonald \\"What a Fool Believes\\" which tops the Doobies' version or Loggins' own from hisNightwatchalbum. And even one Loggins and Messina track- \\"Angry Eyes\\" (the LP version, which he claims is his favorite L&M; collaboration)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful Beethoven","review":"In January 2000, I visited Bonn, Germany's Beethoven House and found this CD in its gift shop. If you are looking for a soothing, soulful selection of the master's work, this is it. I am surprised that this CD isn't as big a seller in the U.S. as it obviously is in Germany. For those of you who have also seen the film \\"Immortal Beloved\\" -- you'll recognize some of the cuts on the CD, particularly track 7, the Klavierkonzert Nr. 5 Es-dur op. 73 (forgive me, I am looking at the CD I bought in Bonn -- in German of course). Once you listen to track 7, tell me if you don't think Beethoven translated the art of making love, into music, in this crescendoing piece. Beethoven may not have been able to add sensual lyrics in his day, but they are here if you but listen. The entire CD is magnificent, and the Nightmoods series of this composer, and others, is also the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emad Sayyah always pleases","review":"He never fails me.

It was almost impossible to follow the italisized running commentary by Artie who was attempting to write another fable.

Was really disappointed with \\"If you ever tell\\" and \\"Since you've been gone\\", found both books very confusing with too many characters.If you want to give Thompson a chance, start with \\"All fall down\\". I think it's even better than her first book \\"Black for Remembrance\\", because it creates such a great atmosphere.\\"The way you look tonight\\" and \\"In the Event of my Death\\" are excellent.\\"Don't close your eyes\\" is very well written.\\"If she should die\\" has a very slow beginning, but after almost 100 pages it picks up and develops a humorous relationship between the main character, Christine Ireland, and the new sheriff which really cracked me up.\\"Last Whisper\\" was very thrilling and recommendable.\\"Share no Secrets\\" and \\"Last seen alive\\" are not bad, but not among her better ones.I still need to read \\"You can run\\", so I cannot say anything about that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely FANTASTIC","review":"Have you ever read a book and had the ending freak you out so much that you threw the book across the room???Well, that was my experience when I read \\"Black for Remembrance\\".I am a very hard critic and rarely do I read a book that I can remember years later.I have read an enormous amount of mystery/suspense and this is by far one of the best thrillers I have ever had the privilege of reading.From the first page to the last, I was completely enthralled.

That would be a grave mistake.Social workers play an important role in our society- increasing the efficiency of those who have suffered some kind of trauma (those who have witnessed murders, or been raped, for instance). However- this book highlights the need for increased scrutiny of claims by those who lack training in the areas they write on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I was ready for Hurricane Sandy.....instead, a nightmare....this product is crap","review":"I live in Virginia and lost power for 3 hours during Isabel and my basement flooded. So I installed this backup system in my basement sump about a year ago. When I got home from work today, the regular sump was already running about every 10 minutes, so I went down to check out the backup... To my horror, this thing didn't come even close to keeping up with the inflow....then.....not two minutes into the test...the low battery light/alarm goes off. TWO MINUTES?? ..... In a word.... Worthless. It 2:19 AM and here I sit, trying to stay awake so I can be ready to bail if the we lose power. (At 4am, my wife will take her watch).

I was so glad that my Watchdog backup sump pump kicked in. But soon I discovered, the outflow of water was much less than the inflow. Before long, my basement was flooded. Next morning I got a portable generator. I started to pump out the water through the AC powered primary sump pump. I could tell by comparison that my Watchdog sump pump could only deliver a fraction (maybe 1/5) of what my primary pump could do.

Just before hurricane Irene I serviced the system to get it back up and on-line, unsuccessfully.

It won't recharge now and I need a new battery. Since this happened with no warning I am a little unhappy. The battery did not last the advertised 5-7 years and I am dreading buying a new battery since you have to add the acid yourself which is messy and dangerous.

I'm sad to say I was very disappointed. The story was exciting, and I think it will make a good movie. But the author didn't do a good job describing the action scenes, in fact he did such a bad job I couldn't figure out what was going on. I'm sure the kids this book was meant for will be even more confused. I was rather surprised at how badly this book was written, because I read the author's original novel Survivor, a prequel to the film, and I loved it. It's really not worth reading this book.

I encourage you to be selective and present things in context. . .Speaking of things in context, I really can't trust this book as gospel because Minutaglio quotes sources in such a sporadic way, footnoting the quotes only to look more credible. The quotes are sometimes ridiculous and misplaced, it seems, but albeit, very entertaining.That's just it, this book is entertaining and nothing more except to provide a biased peek at what Minutaglio believes is the driving force and reasons for our President's personality, politics, career choices, and other personal decisions.Juicy.

This particular book is extremely well balanced. If you love the Bush clan, or hate them, you will find something within. Personally, I found it an insightful and interesting tale of one of our nations most powerful pollitical families. Is George W qualified to be President? Well that is a question that only time will answer. My thoughts are he is as qualified as the guy we have recently given the nod to twice, except, maybe George will actually care more for the country than himself. He does seem to learn and grow. Now that would be a pleasant change. However one thing is for certain, the Bush family is a political dynasty (now more impressive than the Kennedys) and the people of Texas sincerely love both of their Georges."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful ring","review":"I bought this ring for my fiance as his wedding band.

All doubts melt away with the refreshing intro to \\"Golden Age\\", the lead track on \\"Capricornia\\". With its chiming duel guitars & melody, one can't help but be reminded of the Midnight Oil of old...the sound is earily similar to both \\"Diesel and Dust\\" and \\"Earth and Sun and Moon\\". The entire album is great, & best enjoyed when listened to as a whole rather than one track at a time.

There's no flow, no energy, no tunes. As a fan of the band from the early days, it's really rather startling.

Whilst not the sheer rock of titles such as Head Injuries, 10,9,8..., Bird Noises, Place without Postcard etc... Capricornia is a real return to form. The basic elements are all there - the interplay of 2 electric guitars, brilliant drumming and those big, big Oils choruses.... plus Jim Moginie's brilliant songwriting/arranging continues to tap a rich vein that is worth repeated listens.

He doesn't sugarcoat or sensationalize. Claudia must have written the chapters on Mormons facing contemporary issues. They are refreshingly candid, and give the accurate impression that Mormons are human beings who struggle with personal problems along with everyone else. The two viewpoints nicely complement each other and give insight into a much-misunderstood movement. That they have been a successful couple in the New York academic world should make Mormons proud and should attract the attention of curious \\"gentiles\\":-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not finish","review":"I would not normally write a review on something I did not finish, but I felt like putting my two cents in. The book started off pretty good. I like when the main characters share a past. But I was getting kind of antsy and skimmed thru the pages. Well I came across a sex scene and I was kind of shocked. And let me tell you it takes a lot to shock me.The scene seemed so vulgar. I hate when the guy in the book thinks he can have his way with the girl, most importantly, when it comes to sex. And I hate when the girl gives in. It seems so degrading and I was not impressed.Now, I did not finish the book or even get that far, so I guess I can't make a great review.

One of the best features about this stroller is the way it folds. I find it so easy and so much lighter than the strollers me and my husband have tried out. It also folds like an umbrella where most strollers with these features would fold in a bulky and wide way. It can fit confortably in any car and doesnt take much space. Its also freestanding!!

I wanted a light weight, sturdy and easy to maneuver stroller that didn't take up much room when folded. This stroller was the answer.My husband bought me the Peg Perego Borsa Grande Diaper Bag that matches the stroller and is made specifically for Peg Perego strollers. It attaches to the hooks that are located right under the handles.

It's also easy to fold up and to pop back out...just a flick of the wrist!My only complaints are as follows: the cupholder sucks...I use a mesh holder thing that came with my jogger stroller instead. I also get disappointed on sunny days when the cover doesn't reach all the way over the carseat that I have snapped in, so my baby gets some sun in his face (which he doesn't seem to mind, but i do!)Other than that, it's perfect.

Hopefully, when these type of juvenile comedies are no longer bankable, we'll see Ferrell hungry again and centered on making us laugh, instead of trying to hard to make us like him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a comedy","review":"I recently watched this film for some reason, even though it was not rated to higly. I should have listened to the reviews, this movie sucked beyond belief. It was full of cliches that have been used hundreds of times before and offer nothing new. The song Love Me Sexy was not even that great. Not a really a comedy at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Silly","review":"I love Will Ferrell, but apparently can only take him in small doses. His SNL skits were hilarious, but a full length movie with him as one of the main characters? Way too much. Semi-Pro has its moments. Some of the dialogue is hysterical, but to hear similar types of backyard humor over and over gets old.

But some one I trusted, told me it was better than Blades. HA! liar.THis movie is *NOT* a comedy. its a sports movie witha bunch of comedy thrown in. WIll Ferrels character seems like a side character that was maybe a small comedy relief part that was expanded or an add on role he created - he has nothing to with basketball and the central plot about basketball.Woody haroldson can be funny. but hes a straight boring a hole in this movie. Andre 3000 is known for his funky afronaught music personna - but unlike George CLinton - he's always been a sourpuss. he just adds sourness to this film.this film has moments but its not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I had high hopes and was let down.

It was a funny movie, and I can't get that song, \\"Love Me Sexy\\" out of my head. Let's face it Will Farrell was hilarious on SNL, but most of his movies are not that great. Just 10 minutes of jokes wrapped around 80 or so minutes of filler. Compared to the rest this is just as good as far as I'm concerned, (If not better.)I'd recommend it to anyone who wanted a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely One of Will Ferrell's Best Movies","review":"This movie is super funny, random, crazy and fun to watch. It includes a great cast, and you won't be disappointed if you love Will Ferrell's movie style with 80's references."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for overall entertainment...mindless entertainment","review":"With any Will Ferrell movie, don't expect to think much. With that said, this was rather enjoyable. It kinda followed in the footsteps of rags to riches sports stories like Invincible or Glory Road, only with that comedic edge to it and utter stupidity. I found it well worth the rent, possibly a purchase as Will Ferrell movies are always a good source of laughing material."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"This book, however long, was extremely tedious. The remarkable beginning gave you an assumption that this book would be excellent, while it was not, seeing to drag on and on and on. It also seemed to be completely copying off the superb Steven King books."},{"rating":"1","title":"No depth","review":"Aside from this book being a Steven King wannabe, I found that it lacked depth in both plot and character. It seemed more like a very long synopses than a complete story. Symphony jumps around way too much and hasn't the cohesiveness of a well-planned composition. I found way too many loose ends by the finale and too many sour notes throughout. I won't be reading any of the next three books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Interesting Characters In A Story Going Nowhere","review":"Another on my list of Post Apocalyptic tales, Symphony is the first book of a four part series dealing with the four horsemen of the apocalypse. While the characters are interesting, the story is filled with subplots and tangents that just go nowhere. The writer has a penchant for placing characters in interesting situation, then leaving you to assume you know what happened. Yet, at many times, you guessing, which is not good. Grant takes an interesting course with humanizing the horseman, this time War, but this was done much better in Gaimen and Pratchett's Good Omens. Here, it basically humorless. The book's ending is ambiguous at best, and while this may be OK for some series, here it just makes you want to avoid picking up the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES! Resolution!","review":"FINALLY! I've loved Grant's prose and subtle horror ever since I discovered it, but one thing that I've hard a time with: his endings. I can deal with edgy stories that are realistic and not necessarily \\"happy\\"; I have a tough time with nihilistic, \\"there is no point to anything; we're all gonna die anyway\\" endings, and so far that's all Grant's work has offered. This one, however, had characters I could really root for - especially Rev. Chilsom - and an ending I could root for, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-defined characters, suspense - great opening for sequel","review":"I enjoyed Grant's style and did not find it to be a confusing book at all. The characters are drawn clearly, remain true and seem entirely believeable. I went out and immediately hunted down In the Mood - which I found to be even better and more foreboding. I am definitely ready for the next installment. The only thing I'm confused about is that it's been referred to as a trilogy, a quartet and even a tetrology. However many volumes - I'm game. The only trilogy I am enjoying more than this is Dean Koontz's Fear Nothing, followed by Sieze the Night, both of which were excellent. The 3rd installment is yet another anxiously-awaited printing. I say - Read Charles Grant's Millenium series - it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Millennium fever.","review":"A cover blurb states that reading 'Symphony' is a lot like watching 'The X-Files.' Maybe it was the bees, but I think it more appropriate to compare it to Chris Carter's other series 'Millennium.'It's nearing the turn of the century, and millennium fever has come to a rural Pennsylvania town, heralded by four mysterious strangers in a long, pale car. 'Symphony' is confusing at times, where the exposition comes off very vague, but I like Grant's style. The story is suffused with quiet mystery and a subtle tension that comes to a head in the final chapters. It's a very good setup and opening for what will follow, and I'm looking forward to 'In the Mood.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read. Hard to follow.","review":"I enjoy fictional books that use Biblical themes as a basis. This book was written using a biblical theme but not from a biblical perspective. The lead character was far from a biblical hero. But my biggest complaint was - I wasn't sure who was speaking during the dialogue portions or who they were speaking to. Many times the characters would be in a group and the author used \\"he said\\" or \\"she said.\\" Who's speaking to whom? I dunno. I don't want to be unkind but I'm not interested in finding out what happens in the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the movie","review":"Terrible ending.

I guess the problem is the temporature sensor is not very sensitive. Weekend schedule is not really adjustable. It just drops off two middle schedules of your weekday schedule.

RTH230B is in the same price range as Robertsaw 9600 and overcomes the two problems above."},{"rating":"1","title":"U Do Get What U Pay 4","review":"Purchased two Hunter units in May 2009. One for upstairs/one for downstairs. Had no issues until Summer 2011. Downstairs thermostat stopped working. ERR message - tried everything to troubleshoot. Replaced with an old, manual thermostat (thank goodness my husband is a pack rat and won't throw anything away!) Then, last week, the upstairs unit began acting wonky. Went to a home improvement store over the weekend and that unit is now replaced with an \\"old-fashioned\\" manual thermostat. My friend's husband is an HVAC guy - he explained that this \\"just happens\\" sometimes with the programmable thermostats. Went back to examine the downstairs unit's motherboard and found a noticeable burn mark on the board. A bit gun shy so will stick with the old-style manual thermostats for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent item","review":"I bought this to replace an identical unit that I had used for several years and which had developed \\"issues\\".

The installation was fairly easy; I encountered a slight problem because the thermostat I was replacing did not have the wires labeled. Fortunately the Hunter installation manual had some wiring diagrams in the appendix and I was able to figure it out. Programming the thermostat is very easy - much easier than another \\"H-brand\\" digital thermostat that we have in our house. The one down side to the Hunter unit is the quality of the backing plate that mounts to the wall. The plate flexes more than it probably should, hence I am only rating it 4-stars. The thermostat we have from the other \\"H-brand\\" seems sturdier, but not as easy to program. Minor gripe aside, I would buy this Hunter thermostat again (and I plan to because we have one more thermostat to replace)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work....","review":"If I could give it 0 stars I would.If you have emergency heat (AUX heat) this product will not work, this should be in the product description but it is not.Very unhappy and now it is out of the box and I am not able to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and effective","review":"Very easy to install and program.

Returning this and getting a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this unit","review":"I bought this thermostat to replace an older programmable. Installation went fine and once I had it programmed it worked as advertised. But the interface left much to be desired. First of all, you are supposed to be able to take it off the wall to set it, but once it is in the bracket, it would not come off the wall no matter how hard I pushed on the release button. The override controls are not very intuitive, with some buttons on the outside and some on the inside. For instance to override the temperature, you can't just use the two outside buttons to set the new temperature. The inside buttons are labeled so small that they are very hard to read in a dark hallway. The worst thing is there is one button that if pushed reverts back to the default programming and you have to reprogram all over again. I replaced this unit with a new Honeywell that doesn't have any of these problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat this unit for the price!","review":"Read some good reviews for this programmable thermostat, and I needed to replace my old programmable thermostat which the buttons stopped working.Setup is quite easy, anyone can do it.

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonably priced programmable thermostat, that also wants lots of features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective unit","review":"I read the manual, followed all instructions, and got the unit installed in about 30 minutes. It worked great for a few days, turning on and off as programmed. Then it just went into permanent \\"fan\\" mode. I checked, double-checked and triple-checked all programming and switches, as well as trying the \\"Home today\\" setting, but nothing worked. The unit said it was in \\"Cool\\" mode but was only running the fan. I thought it might be my A/C so called a repairman, but he said the A/C was fine, the problem was the thermostat. When we uninstalled the Hunter and went to a different thermostat, sure enough, the A/C worked perfectly. I would have been open to returning the thermostat in return for a replacement, but the warranty says I'd have to pay additional shipping! So no thanks, I'm just returning it (no charge) to Amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine Lasted 7 years - failed like others","review":"All of a sudden, my fan was running continuously. I thought it was my furnace control board because a failure of the low voltage fuse results in continuous run of the indoor blower. Replaced the furnace control board and same thing. Burned up fuse, but only during call for cooling. Heat was OK. Checked control wire and contactor/coil on outside condenser and all was A-OK!. Removed thermostat from wall and operated all with a jumper wire. It's the thermostat. Sad state of affairs on a 1986 Furnace when the part that failed was the newest addition of the Hunter thermostat in 2004. I am going back to the manual thermostat because they are simpler and I never noticed any savings with the programmable feature turned on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the price","review":"No problem installing, or needing to clean any contacts as others stated earlier.

I needed to manually adjust the temperature every day and night. What a pain, and so much for having a programmable thermostat!I spent some time reviewing alternatives, and finally bit the bullet, and purchased the Nest (for $249 -- GULP!) Last night, for the first time in many months, we had stable temperature readings (and comfort levels). Wa-hoo!

I carry pictures of my family and pets with me and look at them when I am traveling and (if appropriate) even share a few with people I meet when traveling. It is amazing what happens when I look at my pictures on an airplane - the Wolverine ESP becomes the center of attention and everyone wants to see it and then buy one after they see what it is capable of.

If you hope to also use it as a portable media player be warned - it does not support .mpeg2 files which is the most common mpg format for video.It will not play videos taken on some digital cameras.The resolution is far poorer than that on digital cameras so you are best off reviewing photos on your camera.In short, if you want a spare hard drive to store your photos on, buy it. Other than it's pretty much useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to back up photos - and share them with others","review":"I bought the ESP 80 primarily so that I could back up photos while traveling, AND see they were actually saved before erasing my memory cards. However, I'm finding that it's a great way to share photos with other people, too. (It also works fine for me as an MP3 player.) It's a bit heavy to carry all the time, or I probably would.The user interface took a little getting used to (sometimes I have trouble figuring out where you have to be in order for particular commands to be available) but it seems to be pretty consistent once you get the hang of it.The biggest problem I've had is when people ask me, \\"What is it?\\" A photo magazine referred to the similar Epson device as a \\"storage viewer\\" and that's what I'm going to call it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for photo storage and review while travelling","review":"We just got back from 12 days in Costa Rica and used the Wolverine to store JPG and RAW image photos from our digital cameras.

The MP3 player works well provided your ripping is done on a machine that does not have anything else going on. Otherwise it's error correction facilities seem to not be able to resolve the issues.Many of my older MP3 files that I ripped on a busy machine and which WOULD play on dedicated MP3 players would not work on this one.The radio seems to works well enough provided you plug earphones in as I think it requires the cord to act as an antenna. I did not test the Video player and recorder and so cannot comment.So on balance an excellent flash card photo backup. Fine radio and usable MP3 player. 5 stars for the backup 3-4 starts on other features.

This is not a happy story about a charming people being charming. It's a story about passion, revenge, lust and greed. It's the kind of story that makes you feel things. Not necessarily good things. I mostly felt angry and sad. So that's why I think it was good book. A book is like art, if you feel something, then the artist has accomplished his goal. In this case the story lingered with me after I turned the last page, because of the feelings it invoked. So that's why I think it is a good book.The hero is no hero. The heroine is tragic. She has very few choices, and most of what happens to her is beyond her control. It's hard to believe any woman could love her abuser, but it happens all the time in real life.

If you like to laugh buy this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S A GIFT","review":"I have recently become a big fan of W. C.

I don't know, and I'm not going to take a chance.There are hundreds of translations of the Divine Comedy, ranging from the really terrible to the really excellent, but it's very challenging to buy any of them here on Amazon, because the cover images and previews are often for completely different translations than the ones that match the ISBN number and it's hard to be sure what you will really get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical, beautiful and (for Italian Language students) lovely with the Italian on opposite page","review":"This is a lovely, poetic translation with the text in Italian on the opposing pages.

It is disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a horrible book","review":"I had the misfortune of reading this book when i first got into Evita, after I had read Eva Peron, Alicia Dujone Orviz's biography. His propaganda was such that he made Evita to be this terrible woman, and on page after page describes her as a whore.I concur with the other reviewers-Harbinson did a minimal amount of research,he also made her out, like Mary Main, to be an inhuman monster, and that, the book focuses not enough on Evita herself, but, instead, splits it into two halves, the second being about Madonna and the musical. The musical and Madonna deserve a place in the epilogue, such as in Fraser and Navarro's book, not in the second half, where Evita's prophecy \\"I will return and I will be millions\\" is treated with hate and hostility.Once again, the below reviewers are valid-get the Fraser and Navarro biography. I also recommend the Orviz biography, which I had read before this. Both works are far more balanced than this piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"He apparently didn't like the woman.","review":"Mr. Harbinson has evidentally done only the minimum of research on his subject and in doing so developed a very negative opinion of Evita Peron. The use of derogitory terms are used through out the book - finding the same term over and over within the same paragraph or sentance.

Unlike other review materials that has about 9 chapters, this book has 20 chapters. If other materials can help you pass on just 9 chapters, why does this book has 20?

Shadowrun fans who are still obsessed with tracking down the odds and ends from Dunkelzahn's will can tie up a few more loose ends here, but for the rest of us, it's the same old \\"elves/dragons know something you don't know, nyah nyah!\\" nonsense that was already getting overripe when \\"House of the Sun\\" was published.

I've read Pekar for years, seen all the Letterman shows, heard about his relationships and knew his persona (and many of the plot points) from his writings.

The characters are very uninteresting and I never really cared about anything going on. And this guy narrating various points of his own life got really annoying!

Back then, I was disappointed that none of the BSC charges who participated in the pagent won, and thought that the judges used very bad judgment in picking their winner, as the winner was horrible.

This book doesn't even raise itself to being worthy of being read by a script kiddy, and it just endless drivel. All the reader gains from this book is material he would have downloaded for free on hundreds of websites ten years back. The material in the book is a solid ten years out of date, either the authors got stuck in a time warp, or spent a little too much time of the Federal Witness Protection Program.

But one of them is missing and something other-worldly is glimpsed in the corridors.This is without doubt a true classic, filled with memorable scenes, including the suspence-filled exploration of the base and the Doctor's well-written speech in the cryogenic chamber. If you're a fan of the series then watch this now - if not, it'll convert you."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a New Who, Tom Baker Comes Through!","review":"One of Tom Baker's best outings as the Doctor.

The chemistry between Tom Baker and Liz Sladen positively sparkles -- they're obviously having a great time, and so the viewer does, as well. The scenes where the Doctor essentially calls Sarah Jane a sissy are hilarious -- he knows how to punch all her buttons to get her to be the brave and competent companion he knows she is.

Harry is simply wonderful in this story and manages to entertain throughout, naively fumbling his way through the story, trying to get to grips with a totally new reality. This leads to some great dialogue and interaction between Dr. Sullivan and the inhabitants of the Ark. As well as having its humourous moments, this story is also quite a serious thriller in which our heroes have to take on the might of a plague of genetically modified locusts, (yes - quite literally! ) It has all the usual hallmarks of a Who classic and firmly establishes itself as an absolute all-time favourite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun story but poor video quality","review":"I enjoy most any Dr. Who with Tom Baker.

Wrong approach.","review":"The authors speak of real problems, but address them ineffectively. By peddling generalizations of the white race, they perpetuate the victim/victimizer dichotomy which divides instead of uniting. Further, the boundary between victim and victimizer is drawn rigidly along racial lines. They fail to recognize that any progress has been made in the decades since the civil war toward a more loving, color blind society. This truly dishonors the memory of those whose blood and tears watered the garden from which African Americans now harvest financial and educational opportunities as well as self worth. A better discussion, in my opinion, can be found in Joel Kovel's book by the same title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist Garbage","review":"If the Author wanted to speak out against racism, then why not speak about racism in GENERAL and overall look at racism from all races, instead of assuming that only whites have power in the entire world therefor only whites can be racist....

I'm not sure how many times this modern music (Enescu lived from 1881 to 1955, thereby making it a trifle modern) has been recorded before, but chances are the previous recordings would have a hard time living up to the color and texture which these Romanians add.Himself a Romanian, Enescu is well-regarded as the foremost composer/violinist of his country. While the quartets of Mozart and other 18th century tunesmiths may be more easily whistled, the dramatic contrasts that come about in these 73 minutes are full of rising and falling movements within movements.

Unlike other Miyazaki's works however, please bear in mind that the characters in this film is originally based on the comic manga by Monkey Punch, a great artist in his own right.Trust me on this - when it comes to action, Cagliostro is MUCH better (and funnier) than all of James Bond films combined.

It's also the most humorous Miyazaki film out there.That whole animation sequence where they're swimming through the aquaducts is amazing. The camera angles were some of the best I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"English dub not appropriate for younger children","review":"We are big Miyazki fans. Lupin III was one of the only ones we don't have. However, the dub was done more for teenage anime fans, than for family watching. In the first 4 minutes you have \\"son of a bi***\\", \\"bast***\\", \\"he**\\", and \\"sh**\\". We stopped there - I can only assume this carries on throughout the film.We watch Miyazaki films precisely to avoid this type of gratuitous language. Usually the PG/PG-13 ratings have to do with the violence intrinsic to the moral conflict of the film - which is something you can discuss with children. This language was a pointless addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"We love Miyazaki, but found Cagliostro wanting.","review":"We are a family of four, and buy DVD's for all of us to watch. The two girls, ages 4 and 7, have loved many Miyazaki films. They often have a young girl as protaganist and they identify with the character. Kiki's Delivery Service, Howl, Castle in the Sky, and Nausicaa may be their favorites.Castle of Cagliostro has more of a prototype feeling. The animation is less detailed, and more common in style. The characters are always in action, and don't stop and have the heartfelt moments that some of the later films have.All in all it seems like what it is: an animated TV show made long. Even his early movies show signs of the greatness that would come later, but I don't think we'll watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many foul words for a family movie!","review":"We got this movie for Christmas based on the great reviews I read here at Amazon. My children and I sat down to watch it with eager anticipation. The first 5 minutes had 4 or 5 swear words in it. The envelope mentions mild language, so I was not surprised to hear h... and d....

Directed by the award winning Hayao Miyazaki, the plotline is filled with action, suspense, romance and comedy, all strung together magnificently such that the story never drags. The characters look somewhat dated due to their iconic design but overall the visuals still look magnificent. The soundtrack is magnificent and complements the story well. Watch this movie and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"does miyazaki ever *not* deliver?","review":"I'm not a big fan of the Lupin III anime, but this movie was delightful.

A must have for fans of Lupin, Miyazaki, or Studio Ghibli"},{"rating":"1","title":"get the 'Manga Video' dvd release, instead","review":"Right from the get-go, this version irked me. The introduction plays stilled images versus the [original] beautifully animated sequence. English translating, while not bad, forcefully swears quite a bit. Manga Video's dubbing may not be entirely clean but it was hardly bothersome.It is unfortunate that these issues ruined what is an otherwise great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant, but only mildly Miyazaki-ish","review":"Hayao Miyazaki's very first full-length movie has some moments and set-pieces that are clearly Miyazaki-ish in retrospect, and is an exciting and always fun entry in a sturdy, audience-pleasing series. But it's clearly a formula, and not a terribly demanding one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lupin!!!","review":"This Lupin movie was pretty good. It pretty much has all the charecters in it. But it dosen't very well show how cool they can be like in the t.v. and ova series does. Overall the animation is pretty good compared to the others. The story pulls you in and is pretty entertaining as usual. There is plenty of action including car chases, shoot outs, spying etc... there is alot of comedy which makes it hallarious and of course there is alot of Lupin. Lupin is what made me fall inlove with anime. He is like a smoother japanese Austin Powers hero kind a guy to me. Very good anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miyazaki's 1st Film as a Director.","review":"This is the first movie directed by Hayao Miyazaki.

Highlights included Eric Burdon without the Animals and the Foundations. It was Peter Noone going solo who brought down the house with a spine tingling rendition of \\"There's a Kind of a Hush\\". What does all this have to with \\"Hold On!\\" you may ask? Nothing but I thought I'd say something nice before I slammed this turkey. Noone and his mates are amicable geezers but that can't save this stink bomb. The story is pure bubble gum. It's as though it was written in crayon. The songs are mediocre save \\"Leaning on a Lamp Post\\". It's as though the film was shot quickly and haphazardly designed to cash in on the band's popularity before they fell out of favor. It should come as no surprise that this enterprise was produced by Sam Katzman, teen exploitation extraordinaire. Oh, well. Better luck next time, boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional music for traditional dance","review":"Both instruments and musical style are perfect for re-creation of traditional-style Moroccan dances.

I am sure some of the Ted Nugent lovers could possibly like or love this CD/LP. I listened to every song and not a single one was re-playable. I have a lot of music, CD's, and a ecclectic selection of bands, artists, etc., but this one won't be a part of my collection for sure. If you are a major Duran Duran fan, this is an album you might want to stay clear of, but if you like mid to late 80's \\"Grungy\\" and \\"Dirty\\" style guitar, this might be your golden ticket."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is NOT Duran Duran (Thank God)","review":"While Andy Taylor was best known as the guitarist for Duran Duran, Thunder takes on a harder edge sound. I came across a single called \\"When The Rain Comes Down\\" from the Miami Vice II sound track that was just terrific. I bought the cassette \\"Thunder\\" in the 80's and played it until the writing on each side wore off.\\"Thunder\\" was released before the age of the ridiculous Hair Band Heavy Metal Era (or whatever that particular time was called).Every song on the CD is solid, filled with creative guitar licks and satisfying lyrics.Much more than you would expect from Duran Duran...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love My Little Bowls!","review":"...

When I called Amazon, they said to call Macy's since the delivery was through Macy's. When I called Macy's, they said that Amazon had made the error on their website, so it was up to Amazon to fix it.

The author does not impress by retelling stories of battle and bloodshed. Rather, this book describes the real adventure of many who served with values which are sadly disappearing from our country's landscape: values of loyalty, responsibility, comraderie, sacrifice and honor. These are the characteristics which raised up a generation of young people who were able to respond to the confusions of war.

I just want to let you know that I previously ordered this book, and I am about half way through. I do not even enjoy reading but I haven't been able to put this book down. What makes this book even greater is that fact that is is true. Also while reading it, the irony of the fact that we know that rubin carter has been set free but he doesn't even know this, as it was written while he was in jail. This book is incredible, and if I knew how good it would be before I read bought it I would probably pay what ever I had to.

And for a film to make me want to read it's extra special. 'The Sixteenth Round' is extremely well writen, because no one can write a champion's life story better than himself. The story of Rubin Carter caught my attention when I was researching into my sport's history. As a Junior Welsh Amateur Champion myself I can understand what being on top really feels like, to have to watch every little thing you do incase something can be used against you in the future. This book has inpired me to learn even more about Rubin Carter. After reading this book I felt like I knew Mr. Carter and wanted to help him somehow.

Frankly I couldn't read all of this, but wanted to compare the two so I skimmed some of it. I read extensively in the news accounts from both sides of this story and there is very compelling evidence that he did commit murder, there is a lot of made up stuff in this book as there was in the movie. Things are bad enough without a lot of lying like this to exaggerate it. This is a violent guy and the book at least does nothing to dispute that much. In an odd way it is a good read because it is so intense, but a lot of it is fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Touching","review":"Obviously no one can write his story better than Rubin himself. This story is both and inspiring story of a man who has never stopped fighting and a terrifying reality check into the American judicial system.

From the outrageously ludicrous story he creates to cover his vicious robbery as a youth that got him incarcerated until adulthood to his equally creative explanation of the night he involved himself in homicides that put him away for life, Carter provides us fascinating lies and manipulations that are textbook psychopathic behaviors. A pathological liar to the core, Carter weaves one bold fabrication after another in an attempt to convince the reader that he is a victim of racism and corrupt law enforcement. If you want to know the TRUTH about Carter, skip the other books that buy Carter's hogwash and read the \\"facts\\" straight from the mind of a master criminal. The book is fully reviewed on my site.Pat Brown/Author of \\"Killing for Sport: Inside the Minds of Serial Killers\\"/CEO/Investigative Criminal Profiler/The Sexual Homicide Exchange"},{"rating":"1","title":"The rounds go on and on...","review":"I purchased this book, after viewing the much celebrated movie, \\"The Hurricane.\\" The book is mediocre. I found it difficult to believe much of the writer's exaggerated boasting regarding his many talents. I had erroneously gathered from the movie, that this was a self-effacing, self-made man, not so. The reader is ever searching for the \\"real meat\\" of the story, however, the bulk of the story is about the author as a \\"ghetto-bad boy.\\" The last few chapters of the book are short and quickly race you through the actual murder and trial. Overall it is not well written and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"German Joe","review":"He is certainly a cool GI Joe with authentic helmet and weapons. The helmet however does not stay on his head and the shoulder strap for the rifle is not long enough for a cross body carry (shoulder only).

Each and every page is packed with information. The subject matter is impressively wide ranging.

This book is so packed you're guaranteed to find at least a handful of tips to improve your health.Dr. Pezzi also tells it like it is. He isn't marketing his own products or system.

Three case studies, from the fields of hominid palaeontology, archaeology and forensic anthropology are also included to add depth to the methods and procedures discussed.

In the Preface, line 3, there is the number 2453 (instead of 1453) and I daresay this slip-up has been reproduced in the Paperback version as well. Then, grammar-wise, I caught the following right away. In the first page of the Introduction, \\"to the two might civilizations\\" must read \\"to the two mighty civilizations\\". Line 5 of Chapter 1, \\"of stately and solemn ceremonial,\\" must read \\"of stately and solemn ceremonies,\\".Anyway, a book this highly rated disappointed me right at the start and makes me wonder if there are idiots who are just paid to parrot praises at the Wall Street Journal and the likes, since they seem to have missed what a casual reader like me picked up. Makes me wonder what factual inaccuracies plague the book, but that is the subject of another review once I am done reading the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old fashioned and trivial","review":"Perhaps the shortcomings of this book are due to the fact that it's an abridgement of a three-volume work, but I'm not so sure. I found it to be extremely tedious and very old fashioned. It is merely a catalog of events with strong doses of the salacious and a great deal of \\"looking down the nose\\" opinion.There is absolutely no analysis and no sense of what the events meant for their own time and for the future. It is firmly rooted in a very old fashioned, indeed 19th-century British, approach to history. I'm very sorry I wasted my money and enough time to decide it wasn't worth reading on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I actually read the book cover to cover for a class, and it was so bad that I am motivated enough to write a review to discourage you from purchasing this book. The author randomly skips from topic to topic, and he largely focuses on \\"elitist\\" history. In other words, prepare yourself for hundreds of names and specific dates without a narrative. Norwich thinks he can spice up his work by providing character portraits of the emperors, but these are poorly written, largely subjective, and utterly useless. Norwich still calls the Byzantine Empire the \\"Roman Empire\\" in the 13th Century, which doesn't make any real sense. He also thinks Constantine is the fourth greatest historical figure of all time, right behind Jesus, Muhammad, and Buddha. Think about that before buying this book. In closing, seriously, hit the \\"back\\" button and find yourself another volume by a different author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Byzantine Greeks were very Barbaric","review":"After reading the three volume series, I can't help but think the Byzantines were outrageously barbaric people. European ideals don't include fratricides (killing all your siblings when one becomes the king), or throwing thousands of captive people to the wild beasts for entertainment. They found the bloody slaughter highly amusing. The author complains there is not much interest in Byzantium's history. After reading his books, it is not hard to understand why."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD PRICE.","review":"VERY GOOD PRICE.

I've long been intimidated by the thought of tackling the history of the Byzantine Empire, because of its incredible mass. This book, however, has provided me a toes-in-the-water experience, an overview and context, and the courage to delve one day into other books on the subject with narrower focus and more detail -- perhaps even to include the three acclaimed volumes by the same author, comprehensive in sum but said to be rich in anecdote and colorful elaborations. Dense as this book may be, the style is very good, and Norwich manages, with due British reserve overall, to inject bits of Twain-ish wryness here and there, as when he follows description of an emperor's gruesome face by telling us that the ruler was not as pleasant as he looked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the after effects","review":"I recently tried this product to see how it compares to honey, I put honey on my pancakes and waffles as a slow glycemic alternative to syrup. The Blue Agave was posted at a lower price in the store and I wanted to give it try.After trying it, I found that I was still tasting and smelling agave the day after I used it and the following 24 hours as my body excreted the agave much like garlic is excreted. It was the strangest sensation to smell and taste it so strongly the day after using it. I can only guess they process it similar to alcohol which is also excreted from the human body. Beware of this side effect if you use it as a syrup alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potent natural product with no weight gain!","review":"I have been using Agave nectar as a sweetener in my cereal, oatmeal and coffee for almost a year now, and have seen no increase in my weight.

This book touts the long disproved belief that autism is an emotional disturbance, which is a crock. The interpretations have nothing to do with autism or the experiences of people with autism. Autism is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory processing and integration and affects communication. The condition varies among the indivuals who have it.Although interesting, do not, repeat, do not take this as gospel.

THAT couldn't be further from the truth. The energy, atmosphere and character of Billy's debut is all but absent on \\"II\\", leaving behind and in it's place over-production and spotty songwriting. If the ballad were going out of style, Billy Talent was that first to be notified, with over half of \\"II\\" being filled with just that; ballads. Aside from that, \\"worker bees\\" is probably the worst song I've ever heard in my entire life.Billy Talent are capable of better, that much is evident from their debut.

From \\"Devil In A Midnight Mass\\" to \\"Burn The evidence\\" the album never let up, even for a minute. Billy Talent have really defined their own authentic sound. It has never been more apparent to me that Billy Talent is truly a one of a kind band. The CD is step up from #1, its still the same old Billy Talent, but more bold and professional. My favourite track would be \\"Where Is The Line,\\" it really shows that Billy Talent IS a Punk band, targeting \\"Urban Hipsters\\" and conformists and asking them \\"Where is the Line?\\" Brilliantly written and executed. Much like the rest of the songs on the album. Definitely an album that will go on my top 100 CD's of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing second album from Billy Talent","review":"Billy Talent is an amazing band.. they are unique in every way, from the vocals to the instrumentals to the lyrics, it's all very different. I first heard Billy Talent while vacationing near Canada, for the band is from Toronto. I absolutely love them.. and I have been trying to get my hands on all of the music of theirs I can find. My favorite songs on this CD are Red Flag, Fallen Leaves, Surrender, and Sympathy. I think that their music hasn't changed all that much since Billy Talent (2003), so if you like the new stuff, you really should check out their older music as well. Good older songs to check out: Living in the Shadows, Try Honesty, Prisoners of Today.. but honestly, it's all good. =) I give this album five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scanner, but mine was also dusty inside!","review":"Like several other people have reported, my scanner arrived with dust inside the sealed case.

Many companies offer a 30-day free installation support but not LaserSoft. Fortunately, I found a software upgrade on the Internet but it does make one wonder about quality control.

Scott Rogo offers a thorough, balanced account of the history of research into reincarnation. He breaks the phenomenon of past-life recall into its key areas, provides extremely strong case-studies, and then examines the possible alternative explanations. With a rare ability to look objectively at all possibilities, he avoids the dogmatic error of assuming \\"all or nothing\\". This book provides a solid background for this area of study, but is also worth reading just for the strength of the collected cases. He is unafraid of presenting cases which support reincarnation, telepathy, and cryptoamnesia, and suggests that all three may be present in any case suggestive of reincarnation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Pulse Circuits","review":"Richard Blitzer was an instrutcor at RCA Institutes in New York City back in the 1960s, one of the classes he taught was \\"Pulse Circuits.\\" in the V7 Program (Elecxtronics Circuits and Systems Program), and this was the textbook that he wrote for that course.

I find that my eyes settle in a 'looking down' position when I'm falling asleep, and it's not quite as dark looking down as it is looking straight ahead.

In this short novel (140 pages or so) a retired Smiley does an old friend from his spy days a favor by looking into a murder in a small town that houses a prestigious and elite school for boys. Whodunit, of course, is the order of the day. It's brilliantly written and, more important, builds the character of Smiley himself for later, more famous, novels. We learn a little about Smiley's failed marriage, as well as a tad about his espionage work during World War II. It's a worthwhile read and really, in my opinion, an absolute must if you wish to continue on to read the later Smiley novels. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Early le carre.

I can say this because this is the first of his books I've read, and can easily see him shaping his style and point of view. Though it is occasionally intriguing, A Murder of Quality is not a great read. Le Carre seems to be trying to figure out how to fuse a complex plot with descriptive characterizations and a larger social commentary. All are sometimes apparent, but on the whole it is a stepping stone type of experience.

Full of basic flaws such as continuos flashbacks and explanations of states of mind, it still retains a good sense of story building and telling. But what kind of story are we faced with? A very depressing one, and the only way one can bear such a thing is through an amazingly good writing, which is not the case here.Halfway between horror and sf the plot is based on two wrong assumption: such a society as it is described could not care less about the sexual orientation of its members; a society owning such refined genic techniques would certainly not need to breed human-like beings to get spare organs.I am under the impression that while writing this novel Mr Brass wanted to highlight how de-humanizing our society is becoming and is likely to become even more.

Put your lips to the didgeridoo and blow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Cookbook is Inspiring and Educational","review":"I used my local library's copy of this book before buying. When I first started eating vegetarian, a lot of ingredients and ways of thinking about food seemed weird and unfamiliar - but the way you learn, is to DO. :-) Fifteen years later, as a well-seasoned vegetarian, I think this book is a wonderful complement to the vegetarian cook's library. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would have liked to see a lot more pictures; but the pictures that she *does* have in there are very helpful, showing different types of rices and grains, for instance. This book moves \\"American\\" eaters out of their comfort zones, for sure. Borrow it from the library first if you aren't sure about it, but I personally love this cookbook. The only sort of person I imagine would NOT like this cookbook is someone who really does prefer their food to be bland and boring. I also really enjoy reading the personal anecdotes she includes with a number of the recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best","review":"Hands down the best vegetarian cookbook available- and I have them all. I'm shocked at the negative review that claims these recipes have no flavor. The opposite is true. I've tried at least 60 of the recipes and only one or two lackluster. Don't miss the Classic Romesco sauce. When I make a batch I put it on everything- including pasta and omelets."},{"rating":"2","title":"....a must-have for the vegetarian cook","review":"Many easy to make and tasty recipes. I know I will be using this book on a regular basis when I have to prepare a dish for the church potluck dinner or brunch.

This book is a must-have for anyone who likes good food - not just vegetarians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the hardcover edition if you can afford it","review":"This book included many recipes from different cooks and you will be referring to this book frequently. It is thick enough for me to wish I had gotten the hardcover. I drooled reading through it. I want to get the rest of her cookbooks now. Some of her recipes may seem to be simple but I didn't mind because I get up in the middle of the night and wrap nori around salted short grain rice and sesame seeds! Although my similar improvs don't turn out to be delicious just okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland recipes...lots of them.","review":"I cooked about a dozen things from here and none of them were very good. The main reason was that they were all quite bland. This surprised me because I've done a good amount of Chinese, Thai, and Indian cooking and have three of Jaffrey's other cookbooks, all of which have a number of terrific and dynamic dishes. I suppose if I'd actually bought the book from a bookstore, rather than sight-unseen from Amazon, and really given it a good pre-purchse browsing, I might have held off purchasing it. I've cooked long enough and with enough variety to be able to read a recipe and have a good feel for how it will taste. While I've only cooked around a dozen of the recipes in the book, I've skimmed it cover to cover, and honestly, the things I cooked looked to be among the best recipes in the thing. Most of these recipes are just..meh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madhur's measurements don't mix","review":"I have tried many of these recipes again and again and again but her measurements don't add up. Either there's way too much water or too little, or she tells you to add sugar or another ingredient at strange points in the recipe that just doesn't add up to anyone who cooks a lot, and you can taste it in the end result. Something is just 'off' in these recipes, they should be absolutely delicious. I am throwing this book out altogether (that is donating or selling it). I really look for the best in everyone, but I am inspired inform you to the conspiracy of Madhur Jaffrey: She has \\"cooked\\" these recipes so that she won't reveal the real recipes to us. She doesn't want us to know them- she is selling crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best veggie books ever","review":"I bought a copy of this book in London and have been waiting for it to come out in the US to send to friends. It's one of the most extensive, easy to use and satisfying vegetarian books out there; it's quickly become a staple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still terrific, 6 yrs later","review":"I first posted a review in January 2000, shortly after I bought this book. It is still, in September 2006, one of my all-time favorite cookbooks. Madhur Jaffrey is amazingly talented in writing recipes that please. If you want a cookbook with different, but accessible recipes that are full of flavor and really tasty, this is a great choice.

This ranks with Deborah Madison's \\"Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone\\" as one of the best vegetarian cookbooks around.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Durabilty flop but great content ....Hard back please","review":"I agree with the content of this book being great. I have had fun making the recipes but shortly after opening the book the picture section after page 376 began falling out page by page. I use the book but handle it gently in hopes more pages don't separate from the spine.She uses Garam Masala and I even got Asafetida but I forget if it was in this book or Ayurvedic Healing Cuisine their real value was explained. It has a natural BeanO effect for the wind the dish can cause.

I use the remote constantly and wore the old one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than fiction...","review":"This is one of the best biographies I've read.

It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Doesn't Work For Me.","review":"I just watched \\"Faceless Killers\\" and I have to say that while it's entertaining, I've also been working my way through the second season of the Swedish version with Krister Henrikssen and Lena Endre and liked it much much more. The acting, pacing, writing and stories are more engaging and the characters much more interesting. Part of this is personal as I've traveled and worked a lot in Norway and Sweden and I prefer the Swedish series for a sense of authenticity that the BBC series lacks. It's well done and Branagh is certainly a compelling actor but I guess I'd rather go with the original. I was pleased to see some familiar faces from the Swedish version as extras and in minor roles. Just as a matter of personal bias, the original also gives me a chance to brush up on my Swedish. If you don't like subtitles, you'll probably be better off watching Mr. Branagh's Wallander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I love the books, I love Kenneth Branagh. I had high hopes for a great series. Branagh is an overwrought, over-acted Wallander. The series would have been much better if they had chosen one book and made three episodes, instead of three books three episodes. The plots suffer from a lack of time devoted to the each book, they are a bit of a mishmash. And a lot of time is spent with a brooding Wallander gazing off in the distance (Wallander is not Hamlet after all). Wallander isn't a happy guy, but he is a great detective and that is never very apparent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than any USA produced series.","review":"American producers never provide shows as good as this! Foyle's War is another excellent series. For a bit of comedy...Rosemary & Thyme is my pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, on the whole","review":"I feel it's a shame that writers' take a good series and take it too far. Gratuitous violence for the sake of shocking the viewers is unnecessary and this show was really good before that started happening. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"HMMM","review":"Great. I wish American television was this good. Enjoyed the acting. Good story lines. I have started reading the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just found Wallander","review":"Just found Wallander recently, kinda reminds me of the old, grumpy, comfy Inspector Morse. Love this series, look forward to more. Although, I would have liked to have known more about why Vanya left; she was with him for apparently 2 years (in the off-season), he obsesses over one case and she's gone! Didn't he work any cases in the previous 2 (off-season) years? BIG hole!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Wallander is wonderful.","review":"I am a huge Wallander fan, have read almost all of the books, and was thrilled with this series.Would have given five, rather than four, stars, but it is a bit pricey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping,different crime series perspective","review":"Branagh is excellent, stories imaginative, photography and place very interesting. I have recommended it to friends who enjoy exceptional crime dramas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after watching the Swedish production","review":"We watched \\"Faceless Killers\\" last night. If I'd not seen the original Swedish Wallander, I might give this three stars. I was drawn into the characters, the relationships and Swedish culture much more in the original than in this BBC version. I couldn't wait to watch the next episode and I was never disappointed. The BBC version leaves me a bit flat and although I'll probably watch the next two, I could live without them too.If you like this one, I think you'll love the orginal series."},{"rating":"1","title":"unkind.","review":"In \\"Faceless\\" Branagh again demonstrates his superb and convincing acting, but the script is so unrelentingly unkind that I began to find it tedious.

This diagram has been out of print for some time, and now people who own copies of this chart are selling them on e-bay for progressively higher prices. Rand McNally should consider publishing an updated version based on the book \\"The World is Flat\\" by Thomas L. Friedman.

The banana jacks don't seat very well, so any readings I try to make jump around wildly with the intermittent contact. I've tried plugging them in really hard with no benefit. As a consequence, these leads were pretty much a waste of money for me. They're too cheap to send back so they just sit around.

I'm not interested in returning my cables for a 6 dollar refund or for the correct cables. That's a miniscule amount of money.

Landry's strong faith and belief system helped shape the morality of many that came in contact with him. His vision on life is based on a high value system.

This is the essential book if you are interested in Tom Landry. This book is also very factual about football, as well as each of the team's seasons.Enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly weak product","review":"I found this to be a fairly weak product. It is thin and needs to use about 2X other products that I have used. It's recommended usage is 1oz/gallon which, for me, gives about four 4-gallon buckets for a whole bottle. It seems gentle enough as well, but I've used better. To me, it is really not much better than a high quality \\"bulk\\" car wash.I would say P21S Bodywork Conditioning Shampoo is vastly better (more concentrated and more gentle) and if ultimate gentleness is not a priority, then the Finish Kare 1016 is better (and cheaper) which provides some anti-static properties and polymer wax.

You might think...no strategy....how much fun can it be? But, boy - get a group of five people...get those pennies on the table and start paying into th pot every time someone JINX'S themselves. The Penny Idea is our own spin on the rules of the game. The tensions and excitement run high as the die are rolled. Will you land on yourself and have to start all over again, or will you be able to place 3 pawns in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). This is a game for all ages and all ages have fun playing. Really, you will like this one. A deceptively fun game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap","review":"This game is worth $2. It consists of only a small gameboard, a handful of cheap pawns, and 2 dice. Total manufacturing cost must be well under a dollar.It has a black die and a white die. The board has a grid with white die values on the first axis, and black die values on the other. You simply place your pawn on the grid where the die values dictate. There is no skill involved. The only possible educational benefit of this game is that kids might learn how to find spots on a grid, a sort of Battleship-trainer, if you will.My 5, 6, and 8 year-old children quickly tired of the game, and it was all I could do to finish a single round.

This game has only a few different hands, and repeats them over and over. It does not take long to memorize them and know exactly what the score will be and who will win each hand. Also, it sometimes will not let you win when you have a winning hand. For example, in one hand I had 4 10's and 8,9,J,Q&K OF the same suit. It would not allow the 10 of that suit to be played in the straight. Itstead, it kept it with the other 3 10's to make a set of 4. Therefore, the 8 & 9 were not playable when it should have been.

However, it is still sitting in the same place he unwrapped it nearly a month ago. Although the directions clearly tell you how to shoot and aim appropriately, they are a bit flawed. The gun is not \\"calibrated\\" to send the infrared beam to the can or bottle. Nothing happens when you aim for the bottle, can, or log. In order to hit the target, you must aim at the bottom edge of the log resting against the table or floor. Once you aim there, you can knock it off every time. Thus, there is nothing realistic about trying to hit the target. Once we showed him where to aim to hit the target (essentially, the floor), the game lost its magic because that makes no sense to a 5 year old. What fun is it to aim at the floor and have a can on a log fly off?

I adored what they did with the first season of HBO's Game of Thrones. The second season, however, is akin to smearing s*** on my television and making sure to get it in all the small crevices. The plodding along with Robb Stark's new relationship was boring at best. As far as the books go, Daenerys should have owned this season but somehow they found a way to make her story uninteresting as well. I give this season poop.turd stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get the hype","review":"I watched the first episode and fell asleep multiple times. its like watching lord of the rings but worse. the show is too graphic too with a lot of cussing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soon?","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer (Tpang).

Cannot wait to see the second season."},{"rating":"2","title":"season 2","review":"Despite the various deviations from the books, this show is pretty damn good. The first season managed to hold on to most of the book's main themes and the second season tries (and fails at points) to do the same. For those out there wondering if they should read the books--do it, they are great. But, reading them will make this show less enjoyable. Story flaws aside, this show and the second season has amazing scenery, decent acting, sex, battles, and enough of the original plot layers to keep anyone's attention. Can't wait for season 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!","review":"Game of thrones season 2! A billion things I can say about it but I think it's kind of obvious. I'm gonna talk about the packaging that it came in and the bonus features. The packaging is super slick looking and even better the more you open it up. Very nice. And the bonus features (just like the first season) are among some of the greatest bonus features you can ever get on a blu ray collection. Thank you. It's amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"info on whats in the box (Digital Copy + UV or Amazon Instant)","review":"this is mainly a post for the digital Copy info...or lack thereof.Besides the bluray disks & the double sided DVD's you get ONE code that works with itunes AND either Amazon Instant, Vudu, or Flixster (Ultraviolet).Note: sign up/in at Flixster/UV and then LINK your VUDU account. This allows you to get the 1080p copy onto your PS3 and still keep it stored in the cloud that is UV/Flixster.I do not keep anything in Amazon's cloud (yet) but the option is there for you.summary: Season2 is on my apple tv [iCloud](1080p/720p), and its also in the Vudu cloud (1080p) so I can watch it on my PS3.sadly, the box does not state this nice 2 way digital copy code, but its all in there, which is nice that HBO realizes that people might want to watch it on a computer, iOS device, or PS3 AND gives you this flexibility.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Bluray sets having problems.","review":"There's a lot of people out there having issues with these Bluray sets.

However this is really a drama mostly with a few action scenes and finally a battle spisode. The lack of battles in this show is due to budget restraints but the acting and plotline make up for that mostly. Still this is a show that deserves a 13 episode run and not just 10. But once again it's probably the budget restraints as the sets and customes and such are incredible. The whole show is first rate and even the low ratings are not really putting down the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 2nd Season!","review":"If you purchased Season I you must purchase this one! Has excellent cinematography and great evilish manipulation by the main characters. This season evolves around Stark's oldest son Robb who wants to free his sisters from the hands of Jeffrey Baratheon. Daenerys Targaryen travels to the City of Qarth where she finds refuge for her tribe and her dragons. During her stay at Qarth something unexpected happens and she finds herself searching for her dragons instead.The young Bran Stark is left in charge of Winterfell, but the best friend of Robb Stark (Theon Greyjoy) takes control of Winterfell and hold the younger Stark hostage.Fantasy is definitely alive and powerful, there is plenty of twists and turns that leaves you wanting more and looking forward to season 3.This HBO series is worth watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!","review":"Too bloody and violent.

The second season is well worth owning if you want to see more of the saga from the first season. If you are new to the series or haven't seen the first season in awhile I suggest you see the first season first. I watched this straight through after year since viewing the first season and found myself wishing I had went back and watched the first season before starting. This is complex story with pieces and moves like a chess game, but of course even the best layed moves can be foiled by outside forces. The addition of magic, undead, and dragons adds to the tapestry it weaves. If you enjoy complex dramas with some medieval fantasy you will probably like it.CA Luster"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great except for the playback glitches","review":"I had such high hopes for this edition - given the lush, visual goodness of the First Season on Blu-ray. This Season and the Blu-rays are indeed beautiful to behold. However, my review is mainly about the technical side of things. Buyer beware about pre-ordering the first edition on the production line. Although I am only on the 5th episode ... I am encountering glitches, freezes and skips in EVERY episode. Produced with the highest standards ...?!?! Sadly - not my copy. Hopefully, this isn't happening to to many other customers - it's a terrible shame to ruin such an incredible show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - Blu Ray Issues","review":"I would advise anyone considering purchasing this fine series to avoid the blu ray editions. Save yourself some money and a boatload of frustration by going with the dvd versions instead. The older blu ray software (powerdvd) on my home theater pc will not play these disks without purchasing an upgrade to the software which costs more than the disks themselves. This is extremely frustrating to say the least and has led me to conclude that these will be the last blu ray disks that I will ever purchase. Just as a point of information, there are hundreds of FREE Game of Thrones torrents floating around the internet. None of these copies are crippled with the drm that prevents me from watching my legally purchased version. Must I employ questionably legal actions to view the material that I legitimately obtained? Somehow, I feel like a victim of a scam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Release date?!?","review":"1) When are we finally going to get a release date for this?

I think this show is much better not having read the books since i have no idea whats coming, Im just watching it play out. ill read the books when the show is done to see whats different. but this season packed a way bigger punch than the first, the wolfs are big as hell(but id like to see them kill more), the dragons have arrived(all though very small at this point), john gos over the wall, bran has become a very interesting and most likely powerfull character, there is quit a bit of magic in this season, the special effects look great and last but not least we get our first look at the white walkers(and they dont dissapoint). so i cant wait for the third season to start and everybody go buy this one its better than any movie your going to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived on time, in great shape","review":"As always, Amazon delivers.

Probably because he was in more control then. This was the Reagan that admired Ayn Rand and put forward what was then a very pro-choice stand on abortion and signed some of the most progressive women's rights into law. At the same time he worked hard on fiscal conservatism and chopped a lot of waste.I find it interesting that a guy who never went to church would run for President like he was born-again (which of course he wasn't). I suppose you do what you must to win. Still, I liked the old Reagan best, which is why I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start to Reagan's governor years","review":"This is a good start to anyone interested in how Ronald Reagan started his run for presidency. This runs through the governor years and ends with Reagan being elected to the presidency. The writing is decent but tends to drag in some places. Overall though if you are interested in Reagan or California history this is a great start to that history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was eagerly looking forward to reading this book by Lou Cannon, as I was under the impression that it deals solely with Reagan's term as Governor of California. Well, I guess I was wrong.The book discusses, in addition to his Governorship, his formative years in Illinois, his time in Hollywood, and the years that followed his Governorship from 1976-1980, subjects that have already been written about (by Lou Cannon and others) over and over again. I don't quite understand why these areas were included in this book.The section of the book that does deal with Reagan's Sacramento years are very informative. However, I do hope someone will come along and devote a book exclusively to Reagan's Sacramento years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was good, but now....","review":"This dresser seemed like a great investment when we bought it, however, after about 1 month of LIGHT use (we only use it for PJs, shorts, PTs, and underwear - all light things), the drawers have started breaking.

Nothing could be further from the truth. This author recognizes that are as many ways to pray as there are people. She also recognizes that there are far more ways to pray than to merely petition God. She lets the reader know that one can pray when one is angry, sad, happy, or just prayerful. We are shown, through personal examples of both the author and others, that one can pray with ones body, with ones mind, and ones spirit. We are made aware of the need for prayer in every aspect of our existence.

He gets really wordy with names and the list of minor characters is immense. It got to the point where I could no longer remember one knight from another but that doesn't detract from the story. In fact I'm in awe as to how in the world he was able to keep all this stuff straight in his own mind.It's well worth reading and don't start it unless you want to get caught up in it. No sooner than you think everything is working out for some character they then fall deeper into something or they just get killed! Definitely a page turned and a grittier \\"Lord of the Rings\\" sort of book and not for the kids or young adults unless you want them to read four letter words and sexual situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and stupid","review":"There are many twists and turns in this book. Unfortunately, it is done in a boring way. The twists are generally so ridiculous that I laughed, even though they are all supposed to be grim. It's a dark novel, but its so campy and silly that I just can't take it seriously or get into as much as other authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hasn't arrived yet","review":"This item was due on December 13th, and currently it is December 30, and I am still waiting. The saddest part is that I bought this book hoping to give it as a present, but now that is no longer a possibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the most jaded reader","review":"A friend recommended this series to me, but after reading the first and second books, I will read no further and will not heed any more recommendations from that friend. This story is a brutally violent, totally unsympathetic monstrosity that I am shocked anyone would enjoy. Recommending this series to anyone who isn't completely prepared for explicit, detailed descriptions of rape, murder of childen, torture, and mutilation is like recommending \\"Debbie Does Dallas\\" to your grandparents.Without going into specifics so as not to spoil the story for anyone making the mistake of reading this book, suffice it to say that reading \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" is like staring at roadkill on the highway. If it makes you sick, you will hate this story. If you look at roadkill and snicker, then this series is perfect for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too disgusted to finish the book.","review":"This would have been a great book - if the author had allowed his talent to flourish rather than selling out to sex and profanity. I don't remember the 1st one being so vulgar, and am disappointed to find that this one was. Completely unnecessary to the plot and seriously detracted from the enjoyment. George - you just lost yet another reader. I got rid of this one, and will definitely not buy any more by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Many Characters","review":"So many characters - so little action - find a better way to spend your book dollars. This trilogy uses many pages to say nothing and what is said is so confusing that it is more a puzzle than a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read","review":"This book took me an entire 3 months to read, just because it was so boring. War, war, death, burning, war, and more war, sums up this book. If you want to read this series.. I suggest skipping this book altogether, unless you enjoy extremely long accounts of war, more war, pain, mayhem, and endless, utterly long sequences of death. The other two books in the series so far are alright, but this book is worth skipping entirely. The whole book drags badly, and I had a hard time finishing it because I honestly disliked it so much, and so little was happening except for the above. George needs to learn how to seperate a fantasy from a made-up historical novel, with all the treacheries and evils and pain of true war.. and that's what this book reads like. NOT a pretty tale at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Done! But WHAT does it do?","review":"This writer really knows how to write! The book has all the elements of a good story, however, it is depressing to read. This reminds me of a good architect designing and building a fine structure as grand as the Stark's Winterfel, which people admire, but upon looking closer, the building blocks are made of compressed garbage. For all its fine design and craftsmanship, after awhile, it starts to stink. I would plead with the author to use his considerable talent to make something uplifting, maybe even inspiring. There are sources. In real life there are heroes who are good (not perfect), and smart and flexible and selfless. Love and sacrifice are as good for a story as lust and vengance!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"Not exactly a review of the product itself (it's a review of listing problems for this item), but I don't know where else to put a note like this.Just a heads up that this is not the only listing of the book and there have been some listings marked higher than those on the other Clash of Kings hardcover entries. Trying to see if Amazon will get rid of this listing since it's basically a dual listing that only allows buyers to purchase from individual sellers rather than through Amazon, for those trying to take advantage of the free shipping. If this entry is still coming up towards the top of the search, the other can be found by limiting the search criteria in the left for hardcover after you enter the title, or by using the ISBN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing distractions","review":"Though I was transfixed by the previous book in the series, I did not make it through this one. Call me a prude, but the constant self-satisfying and obligatory sex in this book really distracted me and put me off. It seemed to me that the author had some kind of sex fetish and had to put as much of it in the book as he could. Simply put, his previous book in the series was tight. Though thick, nearly every scene and chapter moved the story. Not so with this book. Slowed by \\"extra\\" chapters detailing characters having sex, this book was not written for fantasy lovers, but for porn lovers. If you like to read such distraction, then buy the book, for the author's prose is both rich and lyrical. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a re-write of book 1","review":"This is a rewrite of the first book. nothing new here. The only thing better about the rewrite is that he spends less time talking about what they had for dinner. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book 2 goes back in time???","review":"I am completely confused. I am reading Clash of Kings after finishing Game of Thrones. But most of the characters they are talking about have already died in book 1 or at least their experiences already happened in the first book. Clash of Kings does not continue the story from Game of Thrones but instead repeats things that I have already read. Am I psychic? Am I imagining this? I cannot find anyone else's comments that reflect this. Is this a glitch in the Kindle edition?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great epic fantasy series ever","review":"One of the great epic fantasy series of all time. Up there with J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\" and Robert Jordan's \\"Wheels of Time\\". The HBO series closely follow the books, but of course the TV series has to skip important scenes or details because there's only so much you can cover in a hour show or 13 episodes. The books will suck you in just like the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED WITH THE AUDIO VERSION RENDITION","review":"Two disappointments: 1) No table of contents or indexing of what's on each of the 36 or so Audio CD's. What could be simpler than an accompanying single piece of paper with this information. 2) Disappointed with the narrated rendition. I am a BIG FAN of the King of Thrones Genre.

Written in a style that takes the reader on a journey through the individual lives of those key players who are impacted by the chaos that ensues, it is a page-turner that is very hard to put down. Well worth the read if you want to take a journey into fantasy in a world filled with danger, deceit, and treachery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vol Two is more of the same","review":"And it's pretty much as good as Game of Thrones. Martin has done something very interesting with these books I think: defying those of us who normally can't bear invented kingdoms, dragons, compound nouns with capital letters and all the rest of the tedious fantasy paraphernalia, he's crafted a compelling story about power and those who wield and want it. It's the reverse of Tolkien, who concentrated on the external features of the worlds he describes, their languages, customs, history, etc. By comparison Martin sketches all that in, uses it as background and writes in perceptive detail about human needs, desires and conflicts. There are echoes of mediaeval European history, which only serves to make the stories more authentic in human terms. Oh, and there are some great woman characters too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clash Of Kings","review":"I loved this this book. It was even better than the first which I thought was impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will not be disappointed!","review":"Awesome book. I have seen the HBO show first and started reading the books. The HBO series follows the book very closely. If you are just watching HBO show, I highly recommend reading the books too. The author goes in a lot more detail about everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galloping Good Sequel","review":"Despite the size of this mighty tome, this book is addictively readable. The writing is excellent as is the attention to detail. The transition between books I and II is seamless. This sequel allows for additional character development which makes them more dynamic and compelling while the multiple story lines remain coherent. I don't know how George R R Martin does it, but I'm glad he does. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful fantasy epic continues","review":"Yes, there are depressing moments in this book, just as in life. Good does not triumph over evil without loss, without sacrifice. This book does have its very dark moments, and, if all you want in fantasy is dancing fairies and cavorting elves, you will not be happy here. If you are looking for a beautifully written, elegantly plotted, authentically characterized book, this is it. The finest (contemporary) on-going fantasy series suffers from no \\"sophomore slump.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A 2nd victory epic in an awesome series!","review":"I just read the second installment of this new series and it is just as great if not better than the first novel. The storyline and characters are written so vivid and real-like that I know them better than I know my neighbors. I just about gave up on fantsy writers in the last few years until this new series began, and as far as i'm concerned - it ranks better or just as good as the other top-notch fantasy epics! I hope that this series continues endlessly. Thank you MR. George R.R. Martin for bringing back awesome fantasy stories and keep up the good work!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"A Clash of Kings, the second book in A Song of Ice and Fire, is very well written. Akin to the previous installment, the reader is immediately transported into Martin's eerily realistic world and is captivated until the end (after which you purchase a Storm of Swords). This book is truly a masterpiece, as it extrapolates on what made A Game of Thrones so good. A must read for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as the first two...","review":"I have been thoroughly enjoying Martin's medieval/fantasy series. I especially enjoy that the series is about the story itself, not a particular character (otherwise it would be called 'A Song of Ned Stark' or 'A Song of Robb Stark'). Martin's willingness to kill off characters that have become beloved isn't a terrible thing at all. It keeps the story fresh as the reader wonders what will happen next. The only thing that awards this chapter 4 stars is that some of the plot is a little difficult to understand as a logical sequence of events (which was so great about about the first two instalments). I think these are probably petty concerns but it detracts just a little from the story. If you have read the previous instalments - buy this one. Don't stop or you'll never find out what happens... If you haven't read the first ones, go back and read them before you start on this one. It will make things a whole lot easier to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"An excellent read, picks up right where the last book left off in all of its glory, war, political scandal, plot twists, and suspense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Minimum Maturity Level - AdultStrong violence.

Major battles are fought. Intrigue and conspiracies are afoot.My Suggestion - Highly RecommendedNot much of the story can be revealed as it would be a spoiler. This book is by far more exciting and a joy to read than is predecessor. There are times you will cheer and there will be times you'll scream \\"Why did you just write that George R.R.

And if you think this book is good, wait till you read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read; same with the series. Martin is a genius at storytelling. I can't wait to see what happens in the next volumes because the characters are so real and in-depth and eventually you start to love them. I recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy, romance, political intrigue, and action. I'd suggest reading A Game of Thrones first though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slower paced than the first...but still great!","review":"This book continues the stories of the first - and by continues, I mean in every sense of the word. Few new characters are introduced, but those are colorful, and engaging, and the women of the stories start to come into their own. While Theon's characterization in this novel came as a bit of a surprise at first, like everything else in the book, it made sense after a while. You get the sense though, reading this, that it's mostly a set up for the third (and possibly final) book. The story is so engrossing though, that you don't care. As a bonus: Sansa develops a brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have but one thing to say: AWESOME!!!","review":"Awesome is the word thar sums up the entire book. Some readers have given Clash of Kings and Game of Thrones bad reviews because of how bloody and sexually explicit they are. I have some news for those of that opinion: dark fantasies are called DARK for a reason.For those of you who enjoy arthurian legends and Tom Clancy, you will love this: this is probably what would happen if Clancy tried his skills at arthurian-type stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"great but wait","review":"best start to a fantasy series i've read. But definitely wait till they last 3 installments come out before diving it. It's no fun to wait a few years between books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Well, better than wonderful. Just what fantasy and S&S addicts long for when you first begin a series -- a great first book, a better second book and the promise of a third. My only reservation in recommending this book would be its graphic sexual and violent content -- the battles are better than DUNE and the sex is distinctly hard edged. So okay... don't let your 8th grader read it.The family saga is beautifully written and clearly told -- like Richard Adams, Martin's prose makes a movie in the mind of the reader. His pace never lags.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really Slow Clash of Kings","review":"After reading \\"A Game Of Thrones\\" (this book's predecessor) I expected much more from \\"A Clash of Kings\\". The first book truly \\"unfolded\\" before my eyes, and introduced the world and its inhabitants to me in a very intriguing way.In contrast, I found this one slow and a bit confusing through most of the book. There was so much information about such a large number of characters that it was often hard to figure out who was doing what to whom and why. It was as though I was being force-fed character development information and background info in preparation for a test the next morning. Yikes!I will still read book 3 when it is released, in hopes that it is closer to the \\"feel\\" of the first book. If you are of the same mind, you'll want to trudge through this one so you don't miss part of the story.[Update, 2005] - I did read book 3, and have found it to be much better. Just thought I'd let everyone know that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Detailed","review":"I made it through the book and it was boring even to the end.Not nearly as good as the first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fully-realized otherworld full of very worldly characters","review":"The 2nd book isn't quite as good as the first, but this is a small quibble. The wonderful structure of the book, where each chapter is taken from a certain character's perspective, continues to drive the plot and give a multi-faceted sense of realism to a fully-realized, subtly alien otherworld."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genuine clash of Kings no less","review":"This is the second time I read this book since I want to catch up with the story before I read A Dance with Dragons. If you got hooked on Game of Thrones you will get by this book in a breeze. It's full of action and suspense. You keep trying to figure out what goes on in some of the characters minds jus to be surprised by their decisions. You don't get to know much about important characters as Rob Stark and Jaime Lannister, but you get to follow Arya's adventures up close as well as Sansa's tribulations. You get to see how Daenerys is transforming into an empowered and self assured woman and Queen. And the struggle for power and the Iron Throne just gets better by the minute. It is a genuine clash of kings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Clash of Kings","review":"Great book but not what i thought i ordered. I ended up paying more for the book than i would in the store.

In the first book, there are two main forces (Starks and Lannisters), but in the second book there are 4+ main forces, and traitors within each of those forces that further break up those forces. It makes me feel like there's no hope for anyone. Can't wait to read the third book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY REMARKABLE","review":"aS YOU SEE BY NAME i DONT NORMALLY READ FANTASY BUT MY OLDER BROTHER IS AN AVID READER OF SEVERAL AUTHORS. i HAVE READ ONLY TWO SERIES BEFORE THIS ONE (JENNIFER ROBERSON IN THE EARLY 80'S AND OF COARSE WOT - ROBERT JORDAN)BUT I HAVE TO SAY SO FAR THESE TWO BOOKS HAVE KEPT ME WANTING MORE AT THE END.

GEORGE KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK AND GIVE US #3 REALLY SOON."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, adult themed, realistic fantasy","review":"Finally, somebody has managed to write an intricately plotted, realistic fantasy that isn't geared for 12 year olds. Martin's characters are wonderfully three dimensional, with actions that are driven by their own individual personalities rather than by a contrived plot. Full of surprises, deceptions, and multiple levels of betrayal, this one and its predecessor are books that will stay in the reader's mind long after the last page is turned. Because of the intricate plotting and mulitple storylines, this book is best read after you have reread A Game of Thrones.For those who don't know, the series is scheduled for a total of 6 books. There is supposed to be a five or so year break in \\"story\\" time after the third book, so the entire tale can be viewed as two related trilogies. This structure should help prevent the plot creep that has affected Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I skiped pages and pages.

Great characters, complex story, and Tyrion is absolutely fantastic in this book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"waw!","review":"A Clash of Kings really is a clash of several kings... Four kings with their bannerman fighting for the control of the 7 kingdoms.But some bannerman are almost as unreliable as the sellswords, turning their cloaks to whomever suits them best.There's a lot of betrayel, backstabbing, spying and sceeming in this book and that's what makes it so great to read. All these twists and turns of some charachters to keep on top of everything and stay ahead, stay alive... brilliant !But it's also a tale of courage and fighting for what you believe to be just, or in case of the sellswords : the one who pays you.In this second book we get to know the main characters even more and I love them all ! No matter what side they're on, you get sucked into their story and live their lives as it was your own.Tomorrow I'm starting book 3 cause I can't wait to see what will happen to all these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"New favorite series","review":"As suggested this series is a book that I can't put down.

I love how Martin can make you hate his characters in one chapter and find yourself pulling for them in the next chapter. Every fantasy fan should treat themselves to this excellent series. The only down side is that only four of the books in this series are complete so far and Mr. Martin writes VERY slowly. I must say though that his quality is worth the wait. This really deserves it's five star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"First let me start off with the fact that the book is well written. There are a couple unfortunate problems. One the author slows down the book for pages and pages of dialoge. Second and more important his books are just too depresing. People get raped it happens I get it. I am okay with a little bit of it in the book, but this author seems to believe that every twenty pages of the book someone has to be raped, and the other twenty someone is having sex with their brother. Then there is the fact that Martin seems to think that no one can be faithful to their wives. I understand some are not but that is not a universal constant there are people out there who are loyal to their wives or husbands their whole life. Finally every character seems to be a bickering, petty child. People may not be simply good or evil but not all people have a desire to conquer kill and rape like 95% of these characters did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Book Immediately!","review":"I am a fantasy series burnout. I read Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' as far as the first 5 books - looking back I wish he would have stopped writing after that 2nd one....So it was something of a joke when, on the recommendation of a friend, I picked up George R.R. Martin's 'doorstop' fantasy series. The big suprise is that these books are tremendously fun to read with great plots and characters. No plastic here, just great stories.I can't wait for the next book...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof that fantastic literature can be respectable...","review":"Martin reaffirms that fully developed characters and a well written plot will make any work of literature exceptional, no matter what garb the author cloaks his story in. Martin bestows a great gift upon the long time fantasy reader, that there is still hope for this genre. The plot lines and characters continue to develop from A Game of Thrones; the constant cycle of deception, alliance, conflict and betrayal can make one's head spin. The family index is vital to keep track of who's who and where their allegiances lie. Martin shares a quality of Tolkien's in that \\"magic\\" is not so commonplace that it becomes tiresome or predictable. Martin uses magic as a mysterious, misunderstood, and uncommon element and thereby increases the perceived reality of the story. I hope he writes another dozen."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the first one","review":"I disagree with those saying the book is in a \\"holding pattern.\\" Perhaps that's the \\"in\\" thing to say about fantasy series after Jordan's latest. But while I definitely felt that way about Jordan's, A Clash of Kings was an enthralling book. Events do happen which are extremely significant (people do die) and there is that ever-present sense of mortality. Martin does an excellent job of bringing a sense of reality to the genre. You get a great sense for the lethality of warfare compared to the typical heroes slaughtering faceless hordes.The series so far does lack a sense of fantastic grandeur or the sense of massive history that Tolkien and others bring to bear, but on the other hand it presents a grippingly ruthless and exciting adventure, as well as intricate and involving political intrigue with believable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly good fantasy novel...","review":"As a cynical, long-time fan of fantasy and sci-fi, I can honestly say that this book was a surprisingly pleasurable read. I've learned not to expect much of this genre lately, but this one is really worth your time. Even better, is the fact that it's far superior to Robert Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' series. The characters are more developed, and the story is not as predictable. I just hope that Martin brings his series to a timely completion - something that Jordan seems incapable of doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roy Dotrice does not do the book justice.","review":"Every character sounds the game, and they all sound like they're straight out of Treasure Island.

The show is nice to offer up the imagery, but the scale described in the books is immense and the thoughts of the characters provides detailed insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"What I fail to understand is how Martin keeps his writing at such an excellent level when his books are easily 700+ pages. This was an amazing, amazing novel that got better the further one got into it. The characters are made that much more real in their inmperfections and the fact that it is hard to tell good from bad is the books greatest strength. I found myself rooting for characters such as Tyrion Lannister, who would typically be made a villian in a more stock novel. The author has woven an amazing tapestry with a well thought out backstory, culture, and plot. In my opinion this is part of the best fantasy series ever and needs to be given a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"just couldn't do it...","review":"i know these books are really popular and i did get through the first one: by the end it was finally getting exciting! with the second i felt i was plunged back into this boring diatribe about who was son of so and so and cousin to such and such and who was heir to blah and blah. i really like the characters but the writing is so heavy handed i think i'll just watch the mini series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Series","review":"I have truly enjoyed this series thus far.

They are long, but the chapters fly by. Buy them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I really wanted to give this book five stars. Truly I did! However, I give it four. There is so much going on (in my opinion more than book one) that it is VERY easy to get lost. It was much harder to follow along, especially when you start reading about Dany. Martin has created such a rich and detailed world here and to be able to keep up with everything requires notes and diagrams! Maybe too much was revealed and it was too political in book two? I don't know.With all that said though, the book is awesome! There is something for everyone in these books. Action, romance, drama, espionage... it's all there.I can't wait to see what happens to our heroes and villains in the coming books and I have a feeling things really just got started."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED it!!","review":"I was a big fan of the series on HBO, so I wanted to try and read the books to see how similar they are. I LOVE THEM! Just finished the first one, and now I'm on Clash of Kings with the next book on the way. I feel like if I didn't watch the show initially, this may have been a difficult read because it throws so many characters and places at you all at once. However, after reading the first book and watching Season 1, I found it an easy and intriguing read. Some parts of the show differ from the book, but what show/movie/etc. doesn't deviate from the storyline a little, huh? Either way, George R.R. Martin is a genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Feelings","review":"I have a lot of mixed feelings about this book. To start with the writing is fantastic, but I could do without every detail being described, I don't feel the need to know what everyone is eating every single time for instance. The authors details in the book do make me feel like I am there in the story but it also bogs down the story in parts.I really enjoyed Game of Thrones a lot more then I did Clash of Kings to be honest, I was able to feel more for the story and the characters in the story and while I was anxious to read this one and I get the whole \\"bad guy\\" thing but wow this book was sort of depressing for me! It would have been nice if SOMETHING good happened.I will read the next book but going to take a break and read some other things first."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the clash of kings, martin is the ruler","review":"Martin wins again.

But i've always found books better (dispite HBO doing a GREAT job) and this was no exception. The first season followed book on pretty close, but you start seeing major differences in the second book compared to season 2.

Thank God, because though the first season was faithful to the book, I am very glad I read the second series before I began to watch the show. The book is endless amounts of suspense and fun. It begins a bit convoluted and hard to follow, but soon the plot falls into place and it is difficult to stop reading.Great character development is GRRM's strength in this series, and he proves that each character has a story and different perspectives to take into account for their behavior. Just when you think you can't hate a character any more, he throws in a twist to make you feel completely different.Can't wait to read the rest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"George Martin misses with this book.","review":"Now, I've read a lot of George R.R. Martin's work, and loved it. So, I eagerly anticipated his new series, only to be sorely disappointed. There is NO sense of fantasy or wonder, no engaging with the characters, no desire to keep on reading. The book reads like a bad, disjointed history. Give it a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought Game of Thrones was bad...","review":"I'm unemployed and bored, otherwise I don't think I would have tried to read the second book in the series. I gave the first book two stars and thought I was done. Still, with the second having been nominated for some important awards, I figured that maybe, just maybe, Martin had improved. Nope.I couldn't get far into this book without realizing that it was the same old drivel, only this time it was slower and less interesting. It just wasn't worth finishing.Instead, I went to Wikipedia and read the plot summary of this and the next couple of books. The summary, as brief as it was, still couldn't make Martin's world sound interesting. What's happened to the reading audience that this series is considered award worth? A pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clash of Kings (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 2)","review":"Love it!!!! I was hooked on it when i read \\"Book 1\\" .

You only get about 8 - 10 pages at a clip, and wait over 100 pages until you get back to them. Really crowded!!! Too many characters, and most are under the age of 13. G. R.

Some won while others lost. Victory is not always sweet when truths and betrayals stab deeper than the sharpest knives. More enemies are revealed and magic thought gone from their world roars as its strength returns.Clash of Kings; A song of Ice and Fire, Book two by George R.R. Martin is an adventure and fantasy book. It is too difficult to tell you the outline and what makes this book so good without giving the ending away. Suffice it to say that I read the book from beginning to end. I still had a problem with feeling a bond to the characters and their motivation (there wasn't much for me to grab on to), but the storyline kept me reading. The suspense and adventure was outstanding. I like it that previous characters returned for book two and that amazingly the author found ways to keep them growing. Near the end of the book, I actually felt sorry for Jaime Lannister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me remember what I liked about *early* R Jordan","review":"I cannot write a more masterly review than that of the reader from CT posted 8/25, so I'll just agree with her/him. I usually avoid fantasy and stick to sci fi, but this book and its predecessor had me reading well into the night several times. I do hope that this story can be encompassed in 3-4 books, so that it *remains* gripping, instead of drowning in all the boring, braid-tugging detail of Rand et al."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clash of Kings reins supreme in the fantasy genre","review":"This book like, it's predecessor is full of surprises, and the most fully developed characters I have read in the Fantasy Genre. In this book, no one is simply good or evil. Some characters that would seem to be allied with the book's antagonists, are some of the most likable, and vice versa. The other main strength of Martin's writing is the surprises he throws at the reader. Sometimes a hero dies, and a villain seems to triumph! That makes for great suspense and an excellent plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continues to amaze","review":"Martin continues to amaze with this second installment to the series.

Well written, good character development, twisting plot lines that make you want to shout and cheer all at the same time... and I love that the little bit of \\"fantasy\\" isn't overdone so it's believable.

The narrator Roy Dotrice does an astounding job, especially for such a massive work as A Song of Ice and Fire. He handles his characterizations steadily, he doesn't use ridiculous mincing voices for the female characters, and the more disgusting figures, ie Vargo Hoat, will make your skin crawl. The books are simply the best fantasy written in many many years. Incredibly rich and complicated storylines and character development. I love it that you never know who to trust. Martin will not let you get too comfortable with your favorite characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared for some late night reading!","review":"It just gets better and better. George RR Martin is easily the best epic fantasy writer since Tolkein. The series is long, complex and totally enthralling. Unlike too many other author's efforts, this epic nevers lets up.Just read Game of Thrones (Book 1 in the series) first. Then enjoy the action and surprises this book introduces. By the time you finish this book you'll be as addicted to this series as Martin's thousands of avid fans. Book three is even better and book four should be out this summer, so you'll still have lots to look forward to."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read.","review":"I usually don't buy hardcover books, but I couldn't wait for this to come out in paperback.Kudos to Martin for creating believable characters and a plot that will keep you guessing. I've read quite a bit in this genre and these things stick out: 1. He takes extra special care to describe (with detail) the clothing and people of his novels. 2. He's also in the habit of using italics to let the reader know what the character is thinking when in conversations with other characters. Very interesting, as it reveals some of that character's schemes. 4. A lot of gratuitous sex and violence. If I were a 13-year-old kid reading this book I'd be gleefully hiding the book under my mattress.Nonetheless, it's hard to put down. I haven't been too impressed with a lot of the fantasy I've read lately. Maybe I'm getting too old for it. But George R.R.

On the second read through I appreciated even more the build up toward the fantastic ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The saga continues","review":"The characters are truly sophisticated and even the ones who are supposed protagonists have substantial flaws. The violence is more than a little gruesome but otherwise the novel is very engrossing. Now onto book three."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 years between books--is the fault the publisher's?","review":"I guess no. Most publishers would not want more than a year to lapse between hardcover publication of a [potential] best-selling series. After reading this book, my guess is that George went through a difficult period in his life that delayed his writing this book AND changed its \\"ambience\\": this book is nasty, brutish, and crude--I will probably not finish this series. Accomplished craftsman that he is, the book works, but not with the 'feel' of Volume 1. I have no worries about George as a writer, but if my guess is correct, (I) hope he works through his personal problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I really enjoyed book, the character development is great, and I raced through it, cheering my favorite characters on. It is full of suspense, waiting to see what befalls the characters.Really good read (though you definitely need to read the first in the series, Game of Thrones, before you dive into this one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave this author for 10 years","review":"I can't give Martin an A or F for his effort- I grade him incomplete. This is another grand epic, well written, but released by the cup full when only the bucket is compelling. I am making the same pledge after Clash of Thrones as I did after reading Jordan's Path of Daggers. There are so many primary characters and they all have separate story threads, so that now instead of one story you have nine stories, which means that none of characters get resolution over the course of a 400 page book, because they are only in it for 40 or 50 pages. This wouldn't be a problem if the whole story was there on the shelf, then- I would only need to decide whether to invest all my liesure time for the next 6 months reading it- but when you get it in dribbles, it is hard to remember who any of the characters are, what trouble they are in and what they planned to do about it. I am putting this author away until his story is no longer a work in process."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment","review":"Well, A Game of Thrones was a great book. The characters were the most incredible people I've ever read, and the plot line went along amazingly smoothly, considering that there were many different people and the point of view changed from chapter to chapter.Unfortuatly, all is not well in paradise.A Clash of Kings book is heavy, boring, and cumbersome. While I could stand the sex scenes in A Game of Thrones, they became beyond disgusting in this installment, making me wonder if the author wrote them for his own personal enjoyment. The characters were excellent, but the plot line confusing; more than once did I wonder what on earth was going on.Not the greatest, but I'm sure not the worst. Let's hope that the next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Confused","review":"After watching the HBO series I bought this book because I couldn't wait.

This one and the entire series so far by Martin are wonderful exceptions. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"One of the best fantasy stories since Belgariad though it is defintely much different from it. It was exciting and I love the political intrigue. The characters in it are also not what they appear to be. There are bad guys among the good and surprisingly good guys among the bad. Of course the book doesn't have straight out heroes like most fantasy books. As the plot progresses, your perception of the characters change. All in all, a very enjoyable read. I can hardly wait for the next one. Only complaint I have( 4 stars instead of 5) is the swearing. Everyone swears but I just cannot get used to people swearing in fantasy stories. It is just weird to have a sword wielding guy in a fantasy world yell 'f@$k'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A downward spiral.","review":"I read this book while under the impression that it was the second part of a trilogy. In trilogies, it's customary for the second book to be rather dark (so that the heroes can win against all odds in the end of book three). Because of this I wasn't surprised when \\"A Clash of Kings\\" described a bloody civil war, the torture of innocent villagers, murder, dark forces closing in, and so on.Still, too little happens that actually develops the plot. Mostly, it gets more and more comlicated. Characters die, but many more are added. I read on, thinking that the first book in the series, \\"A Game of Thrones\\", was much better, and that part three would probably be better than this too.In short, I had a feeling I was watching Martin's world slowly come apart. I hoped he knew what he was doing, but even so, I didn't find this book very enjoyable but quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I liked Book 1 of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" a lot . This one was just tedious, with Ser this and Ser that. It lacked the human interest of the first one. This is reflected in the HBO series - Season 1 was much better than Season 2. However I was able to watch all of Season 2 but was unable to finish the book and put it down about two thirds of the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would reccomend","review":"These books are great, especially on the kindle.

I have not been disappointed! Took me a bit of time to get into the first book - but once the plot started to roll, it was really good. These books are well written - yet 'pulpy' enough to be a guilty little pleasure. Have to say though - hauling around any one of these will increase your upper body strength - they are weighty!With Clash of Kings - Book 2 - The story continues - in epic form - thank goodness there's a guide in the back to keep track of the characters and how they're interrelated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I love the characters and story.

A must read for the whole series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrilling Sequel","review":"This is book two in the series and it has more than just lived up to my expectations. I was completely satisfied with this sequel with its more magical storyline and intensifying family slash political drama. A Clash of Kings is indeed a clash with all the treachery and fratricide that has been happening among the factions. I love the thrill and I love the setting. I love George R.R. Martin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Strong.","review":"I enjoyed this book, but there were some minor flaws. I found the twists and turns to be extremely exciting. There were a lot of things that happened that I couldn't see coming, but were not so far fetched that I sat there thinking \\"Oh, come on.\\" I don't want to go into in real detail, because I hate reading revues that spoil the book for me.There were some parts that held this book back from being a 5 star book. I found the chapters on Bran to be tedious. I got sick of his character until the very end, when there was a giant twist. Theon was pretty interesting in this book. Lady Catelyn got tedious as well.All in all a very good book, but I found that some parts were just transitional and therefore not as exciting as the previous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Neither worse, nor better, than the first.

There is always a surprise and you find yourself routing for the direwolves."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"i know a lot of people that read the first book art nagging about how theirs almost no fighting but in a clash of kings its way more exiting and theirs way more fights so i give this book 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good","review":"Love how it keeps me on my toes by changing characters and points of view.

Good material couched within an interesting story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing, suck story","review":"How can a book keep me entertained enough to finish, while simultaneously making me hate the story that is being told? Ask George Martin. The characters never quite get there. As soon as I begin to enjoy them, they're gone.

Should you keep going? YES!This one moves at about the same pace as the first one with a bit slower of a finish. Even the big stuff doesn't feel all that grandiose (but this isn't a bad thing).There is one thing that happens in this book where I had to breathe a sigh of relief when the events didn't actually come to pass.Really the major point here is keep going because I sure am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read...","review":"Does a wonderful job telling a story from several charactor viewpoints.

I need to know what happens with the Starks. LOL. I love these books. Of course, there are always more details in the books than there ever are in tv or movies...and I love that. This story gets inside you and sets up house...you have to know about these characters and what's going to happen with him.

There is no one to root for as you never know who is going to be killed off next. Most of the remaining characters are not likable or that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor execution","review":"I'm sorry to say that I'm less than satisfied - the story is fine (so far), but the book itself leaves much to be desired (especially for such an expensive paperback). The paper is only a step above newsprint, there were pre-production top-to-bottom creases in many of the pages that disrupted the printing (and now break up the text on both sides), and the size of the type varies from line to line (this may not change the story, but it can be distracting).

And now 1600+ pages later, I'm trying to reconcile breaking my no hardcover rule and buying book three. For as much as I can't wait to see what happens, I also fear forgetting half of what and who has happened waiting for part 3 in paperback.GRR Martin belongs in very elite company, critically, for me. He is the Frank Herbert of fantasy. His talent for characterizations is unmatched....gifting us with characters that are varying shades of good and evil. His plot twists are brutal. His use of suspense dizzying. There is no clear cut hero, all are flawed. Don't get too attached to anyone. Expect anything (usually the worst) to happen. And know that who makes it all 900 pages-in tact or no-is as much a crap shoot as the first installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"You're thinking, What! A kid reading A Song of Ice and Fire! Fine. I'm 13 but so what?I picked AGoT up thinking it would be an easy read. It was probably one of the best fantasy novels ever written. I bought a CoK after I finished Book 1.This is a totally different epic. Martin brings us gray characters. You don't know who's good or who's bad until you read their POV. The Lannisters are taking control of the Iron Throne while Catelyn and Robb make the North independent. My favorite characters are Bran, Daenaerys, TYRION, Sansa, and Arya. Tyrion is just...God. The books are empty of magic, but after the last scene in A Game of Thrones.The plot is equally stunning.GO HOUSE TARGARYEN!! DRAGONS, WHOO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin gets 6 stars!","review":"George RR Martin cements himself in as one of the greatest writers with this series. It has all the depth we have come to expect in a long fantasy series. It has no filler whatsoever. This is also the only series that even as it unfolds leaves you with no idea as to what the end will be like! You don't know who will live or who will be in power....Wow. Also, his strictly POV writing is superb, I found it impossible not to identify with the characters, even those who I didn't like before getting their POV. It keeps you on the edge up until the last page and makes it impossible not to order the next book as soon as you close it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow paced, picks up at the end","review":"The second instalment of A Song of Ice and Fire is much slower paced than the first book. The story plods along with very little action and little progression in the story. The only two character stories that held my attention was that of Tyrion and Arya. Both these characters had meaningful story lines and their chapters were a welcome respite from the mundane lives of the other inhabitants. Jon Snow also had a very interesting chapters but sadly there were too few of those. After slogging through three-quarters of the book, suddenly the action picks up and the entire story becomes lively and interesting, finally climaxing with the long awaited battles, whose preparations comprised the bulk of the first 75% of the book. The final quarter is an absorbing read, reminiscent of the first book. I will continue reading the saga and hope the remainder is more in the vein of a Game of Thrones than a Clash of Kings which was tedious to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful world to lose yourself in.","review":"I don't normally read fantasy epics, but I've been a fan of Martin's since I first read Fevre Dream, the ultimate 19th century vampire novel. This series has it all. Memorable characters. A wide range of venues and adventures. Twists, turns and wolves. Winter is coming. And so are the dragons. Sign on now, read up, and get ready for the final two installments. Anything might happen. And, knowing Martin, it will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when you thought fantasy was getting boring...","review":"In a genre where you find one gem in a collection of 100 lumps of coal this diamond is sure to put the sparkle back in Fantasy. Using complex characters to weave complex plots, Martin manages to keep the reader interested in a dozen different personal intrigues while continually furthering the overall plot of the story. \\"A Clash of Kings\\" is the second of the series starting with \\"A Game of Thrones\\", and for those fans of exciting and intelligent literature in the fantasy genre, these books are a must for your collection. I'm very much looking forward to the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTERFUL!","review":"Without a doubt, this is one of the finest fantasies I have had the pleasure of reading. The characters are wonderfully developed and the plot keeps you guessing what will come next. Unlike many books of this genre, Martin does not sugar-coat his tale. There are no clear cut lines between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\", \\"black\\" and \\"white\\"-in Martin's Westeros, dynasties are founded on incest and brother plots against brother (and sister). You will find yourself alternately cheering and cursing the same characters as the story unfolds. Undoubtedly, \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" will find a place among the giants of fantasy. I anxiously await the next installment in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhilarating... Intoxicting... Addictive","review":"I think those three words just about sum up how I feel about A Clash of Kings and A Game of Thrones. A Game of Thrones is the only 700 plus page book I've ever read 4 times (and I will probably read it again even though my hardcover copy is starting to fall apart), and A Clash of Kings is catching up (read it twice so far). It's true a lot of people die in these books, but reading them makes you feel so alive! When I read them I grip the books so tight I practically leave my handprints. Best books I've ever read. I can't wait for A Storm of Swords!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent complexity","review":"Another great book in this promising series. The sheer mass of characters, all with individual personalities and motives, makes for an incredibly realistic tale. Martin maintains an excellent pace, swithcing from character to character to show how the whole story unfolds from a variety of viewpoints. Only problem with I found is that with so many characters, it's hard to jump right into the second book without rereading the first. All in all, a great fantasy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"JRR Tolkien fan from 1970; liked R. Jordan..love Martin!","review":"Being a PhD in Medieval Lit & Languages after reading Tolkien and CS Lewis as a teenager, it is rare that I fall into a fantasy world with such committment! \\"A Game of Thrones\\" kept me enthralled. Martin's characters are people we remember and wait to meet again and again and he wisely and brilliantly introduced the wonderful, loyal \\"Direwolves\\"- these creatures stole my heart before any of the Starks! Please tell me the second book is closer at hand than Spring '99!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"A continuation of book one that loses nothing in its' fascinating panorama of multiple main characters as their lives intertwine in a tale of the worst and best of human nature with realistic scene and geographic description and improbable yet gripping fantasy.....well written and gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite in the Serise","review":"I don't know I just felt it was more focused than Game of Thrones. It is also an essential book to read because if you skip this one and go to number three you will miss the most best part of the serise.I guess other than the good writting and the wonderful charecters(most of them and even than I can respect the ones I don't like)the reason I like this book so much is that everyone is preety much at the height of their power.With Robb King of the North and the TridentTyrion in King's Landing practically running the placeJohn Snow and the rest of the Night Watch going out to kick Wilding buttEven Theon Grayjoy manages to do something unexpected with kind of makes me like him in a pitying kind of way.Overall-Most of all don't forget Stannis and Renly because however you feel about this book you have to agree when Kings clash the whole land trembles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"While one reviewer writes that they don't like that bad things happen to some of the \\"main\\" characters in the book that is one of the reasons I love it! I get tired of the cookie cutter novels sometimes when you know that the heroine is going to come and save them all but I found out quickly in the first series that Martin is not afraid to shake the norm. While I am enthralled w/ the story I must admit that at times the sex/violence is a bit gratuitous and that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. The book/series is one of the better one's I've read! One thing is I wouldn't recommend it for younger readers because of the content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eh, pretty good","review":"This is certainly a well made book, the characters and the action are great. It all moves together quickly, never having the characters rest in one castle for too long. Thankfully it has expelled some of the brain damage caused by the Wheel of Time series (Jordan is a money grubbing banjo-hitter.) The problems; sometimes you want the Lannisters(generally more bad than good) to win, or you want the Starks (more good than bad) to win. ... Winter is coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Engrossing","review":"In this book, the plot really begins to heat up. The reader is left with the knowledge that he has no idea where this story will end up. This book has more action than the first and more sex, as well, so be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This was my favorite book of last year. It truly deserved the Locus Poll's top pick for fantasy. 10 times as good as Robert Jordan's Path of Daggers. The only novel to come out that was close wasRobin Hobb's Liveship Trader. A great sequel to a great first book, A game of Thrones. Fans of the series will love it and those wanting to start the series, here it is in paperback, nice and cheap for you. $9 is a very good investment. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Descent into Heart of Darkness","review":"Once again the descriptions of all the pomp and circumstance of courtly/lordly/knightly dress, banners and manners slowed down the narrative. The most likeable characters so often suffer as much or more than the bad guys makes it and the story becomes exasperating in some cases. Also, the narrative loops around in confusing timelines. And more is revealed later than sooner about some characters and events. Martin may actually believe that the heart of men/women is mostly dark and evil. Or, there may be light at the end of the tunnel he has created.

I do not plan to keep reading this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mantasy","review":"I read the first novel in this series at the urging of a friend. It was ok, a bit violent for my tastes. I did like the plot twists and style, so I started reading this. The plot twists and style were still there, but I could not finish it. Frankly, the wanton and gleeful depictions of rape and violence were too much for me. I found it deeply disturbing, enough that I felt nauseated.I guess it may be different if you are a man; I have yet to meet a woman who actually liked this book. My male friends speak enthusiastically about this series. Ugh. Even thinking about it now is making me queasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The second book lets down.","review":"The book was a weak follow up to a very promising first book. It can be summed up as much ado about nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story but tarnished...","review":"The plot to this story is immense, with many different facets. However, at every turn in the book the author would perform extreme violence or debase women in such a way that seemed to go beyond the context of the story. Perhaps the author wished to show the violent nature of people or portray a character as evil, but the nature of acts committed to women, from graphic rape to extreme violence instead brought me out of the book and made me angry at the author, not at the character committing the acts. Other talented authors have conveyed character motives and attributes in different ways, unfortunately this author did not. I will not be purchasing any future works from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pages MISSING","review":"There were more than 10 pages missing.

The reader is decisively swept up in rooting for the humanitarian code of honor that the heroes portray, in comparison to the mercenary values of the villain. One wild card in the misshapen dwarf, Tyrion, whose birth and spoken intentions gives allegiance to the antagonist royal family, but his humor and sympathetic circumstance gives an aspect of a wild cannon lose within the narrative, in that the read naturally hopes that such a likable character will cross over to the \\"good side\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different edition","review":"The book was in good condition, and is not grimy or anything.It was just a little sad when I opened the box that it was a older edition than the pictured book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Strong Series","review":"The second installment shows the first signs of sprawl. A lot is happening and there seem to be major players who needed more introduction while some plot points seem extraneous. Just when you start to enjoy one point of view, the chapter ends and you're on to something that you don't care about. Then you cycle through a bunch of characters before hopefully returning to a favorite only to be pulled away again. It's a hallmark of this series that at times annoys and at times works really well.The overall story though is strong enough to keep you going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle royale","review":"Great continuation of the introductory novel. This really fleshes out Tyrion Lannister's character. Some of the more sexual scenes -while not entirely unwelcome - read as Harlequin Romances injected with testosterone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness continues","review":"This series is fantastic. It centers on a fictional kingdom with some similarities to early Britain in terms of the structure of society. This book is as rich and well plotted as the first book. The story is so compelling, focusing in this novel on six different factions that are seeking the throne in the wake of the death of Robert Baratheon. Although the plot is riveting, for me the real appeal of the series is the intensely complex group of characters, none of whom are wholly good or wholly evil (although some come close on both sides of the spectrum). This is George R.R. Martin's Lord of the Rings, although it is wholly unique in its own right. I can't wait to see what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"The saga continued","review":"Don't buy this book if you're looking for a self-contained story, because you will be disappointed. If, however, you're looking to read a marvelously intricate, well-characterized yarn that breaks the mold of contemporary fantasy, then buy the first volume, \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" and then come back and buy \\"A Clash of Kings.\\" Follow that up with \\"A Storm of Swords,\\" and you're halfway through George R. R. Martin's epic masterwork.Martin presents a compellingly realistic world, true to its medieval flavor. It is dark without being gritty, and despite the labyrinthine plot, it never feels unbalanced. This volume has greater depth than its predecessor, a state of affairs that I doubt will change as the series progresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Series only gets better","review":"This book built upon A Game of Thrones, for a wonderful second helping. There was more of everything that made the first book so great: intrigue, humor, sacrifice, honor, duty and more dashes of magic and dragons thrown in. I didn't think it was possible to have a second book live up to the first, but I was wrong! Definitely a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as great as first one :)","review":"I am pleased to say that Martin did not let me down. Clash of Kings is just as binding and brilliant as the first book.One thing that did change though, in this book the whole magical element started to increase. Not that that's a bad thing. It's exciting, gives a fresh twist to the story and it holds a promise of more to come in the next book. I can't wait. As soon as I'm done with my exams I will finally get to read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thick plot thickens ....","review":"The hottest new series in fantasy today ..The 2nd book continues in the same dry, sparse writing style which characterised the first. This rapid movement is a pleasant change from the predictable verboseness of inferior fantasy such as Eddings and Jordan. The plot rolls along with speed and precision, and the characters continue to grow and interact with the world in a way which is intriguing and startlingly unpredictable.However I felt this book allowed some of the integral plot threads .. Arya, the trip over the wall .. to dwindle and drag out without fulfilling the promise of the first book. Also this book was so outrageously behind schedule that Martin runs the risk of losing the interest of readers in the waiting time. The series is now expected to be 6 books long incidentally .. its official :o)An engossing story though .. 800 odd pages but not one wasted .."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me more!","review":"This is the first epic fantasy novel since Terry Brooks' Shannara series that made me angry to reach the end of a book.

Accordingly, i will be brief. My problem with these two books is that there are few likable characters. The few that are charidmatic or heroic are killed and you and up reading hundreds and hundreds of pages about characters that you simply dont like. Eventually, despite the undeniably remarkable imagination of the author in creating this universe, it all feels like a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"superior","review":"I wont waste your time with a 5 paragraph critical analysis on this book. All I can tell you is that this series is superior to any other fantasy series that I have ever read. The intricate plotlines and dynamic characters is matched by no one. The style of writing is fluid and you never find yourself having to read over a boring chapter. This book will keep you busy for quite a long time but you will never get bored with it. Read this series for your own good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Test Your Endurance! Can you continue to care?!","review":"Oh, gods... I'm not sure how Martin has bagged such critical acclaim with these books. His stories progress at a glacial pace. This would not be so bad if these were enjoyable characters to follow. They arent. Or rather, the majority of them aren't (Tyrion is a pleasant exception). If he picked a single character, that might make for interesting reading. Or if the characters were dynamic, that would be alright. The characters are too often like pieces of flotsam tossed on rough seas. Life is like that sometimes. But it doesnt make for good storytelling.The books I'm reminded of most to compare these to are Brin's Galactic Civilization books. He also split the story among many characters. But he did it in cliff-hanger serials with scrappy characters you wanted to like. Martin's characters are an often luckless assorment of not very interesing or fun people with lives that manage to be somehow boring against grand spectacle."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"love these books. i was just reordering this one because my dog literally ate the first copy of it i owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clash of kings - epic","review":"A book that I would defiantly read a second time as it was such a pleasure the fist time road."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clash of Kings","review":"Overall an awesome read!

I find myself completely wrapped up in the lives of these people. I find myself cheering for the most unlikely characters and feeling sorry for some of the more wicked ones. These are definitely multi-dementional characters and the skill in which Martin shows them to the reader is amazing. I can't wait to get my hands on the the third and fourth of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"In 5 pages, I was transported inside Martin's world.","review":"I usually don't read fantasy novels. It seems that many of them are too predictable or a bit cliche. A Game of Thrones is neither of these. Martin's writing is both intelligent and exciting with surprises where you wouldn't expect them. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed the book. I'm a picky reader but I recommend this book for those who want a brilliant escape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doom and Gloom? Leave the Children alone.","review":"(Spoilers) Having watched the HBO show of the Game of Thrones, I wanted to experience the books. I thought Game of Thrones was a very good story with compelling characters. Clash of Kings is very dark book. I have a particular issue with GRRM's continued plotline of children being brutally killed. The authors descriptions of the events is quite disturbing and had to put the book down.Alot of the characters act irrationally and unbelievable as the story goes along. Particurly the fate of Jaime Lannister. Not believable at all considering his family murdered her husband and was holding her daughters hostage.This book gets compared to LOTR. I agree that LOTR was too fairly tale with all of the main characters surviving despite numerous battles. Clash of Kings goes to the extreme in the other direction. There should have been happy medium for the Good Guys to win.Also missing thoughout Clash of Kings (unlike the tv show) is Robb Stark."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just gets better and better","review":"This is one sequel where all of the books are as enthralling as the first. Martins ability to surprise the reader with the unexpected keeps you guessing at every page if what you think will happen will really happen - more often than not I was wrong - finally a fantasy series that is NOT predictable.The character development is unbelievable.

The only draw back, I think, is that there are too many people, leaving each character without enough content.

Many of the chapters barely move the action along. I was really invested in all the characters and wanted to know the outcome, but I lost patience about half way through.

One nice feature is the alligator clips can be replaced with just about anything that can be cut to fit the clamp hole (including other clips when they eventually wear out). The only downside for me is that my project is a bit bigger (doing wireframes for an art piece) so the cross bar is a bit short for that. Also I wish the bottom had a clamp so I could clamp it to the edge of the desk so it could hold more weight without tipping over.

It holds small plastic parts and large ones securely without damaging them for both painting and gluing. The magnifier comes in handy at times for both. The base of the unit is heavy for such a small foot print, and if something heavy is put on one side, you can always balance with something of similar weight on other side.

The arms are a little tough to adjust, but once you get used to it, it is not that bad. Anyway, it is seldom that I have to adjust the arms because I can usually get the wires in a useful position by changing the place at which the wires are clamped.Anyway, I think that this thing is great and it is unimaginably helpful at fixturing wires and other components; however, the clips are so strong (when they are new anyway) that the \\"teeth\\" puncture the insulation of the wires that are clipped. I found that the clips come in contact with the copper wire to a point where they begin to heatsink the wire; this made soldering a little more difficult until I decided to wrap each \\"jaw\\" of the clips with electrical tape. This mod makes the clips less aggressive and leaves them effective enough to hold wires securely."},{"rating":"1","title":"seems solid, but overall unimpressive","review":"I got this to make soldering easier, and while it helps, there's still room for improvementThe base is neither wide enough nor heavy enough, as the unit keeps falling over.The magnifying glass had some scratches on the lens when I received the product, they're small and don't really get in the way, but I think it's unacceptable to ship a product in that condition.the joints come loose very quickly after I tighten themIf you want a cheap magnifier/holder get this, but don't expect it to be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xacto X75170 X-tra Hands with Magnifier","review":"X-tra hands does a fine job in holding wires and parts during my hobby soldering jobs.

It carefully avoids explaining the concepts behind the operations, leaving the poor reader to deduce them (or, too often, guess at them). This approach makes everything five times harder to absorb than it ought to be.I found that I could often learn most effectively by glancing over a lesson to grasp its overall object, then figuring out the procedure on my own.

So, I bought this RP-HT46 Headphone. I was very disappointed to say the least. The sound is very weak compared to other heaphones and there's no bass at all. Even though they are light, it's still uncomfortable to wear them due to its tight head band. I had to return it (even though they are cheap) just to make a point. Granted they were made in China, still I cannot believe Panasonic is putting its trade mark on this junk headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent sound, poor build quality","review":"These headphones sound decent enough, and they're comfortable when everything is in working order. The folding feature is poorly executed. The metal pins have a tendency to slide out of place. If you're careful, you'll be able to re-insert them and re-assemble the headphones without bending the pins. Even if you are that lucky, the pins fall out often enough that your luck will run out eventually. You'll either bend the pins or mangle the plastic in the connector. I resorted to using a paper clip to replace the pins and making them long enough to bend them and prevent them from falling out. Not elegant or particularly ingeniuous, but a set of headphones shouldn't require any level ingenuity to make it functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome toy for little girls, fun & educational!","review":"My 4 year old daughter loves this vanity toy.

The hair on it is so \\"plastic-y\\" and cheap, that when I try to detangle it, it just stretches and breaks! I tried to order a replacement Dora head from Fisher Price, but they only sell replacement kits for the accessory pack (blow dryer, curling iron, barrettes, etc)-but no head. Alas, it sits in her room and does not get played with at all-will probably give it away to Goodwill or something to make room for something new this year.

One might think from the frequency of publication and the paucity of new material in his most recent books that the \\"Western Canon\\" is nothing more than a brand name he uses to ramp up the sales of poorly repackaged material. At best, his crusade for literature (the imperilment of which was always somewhat dubious) was endearingly quixotic. It is now rapidly degenerating into vulgar farce.Professor Bloom's early books display massive erudition, keen critical acumen and the infectious enthusiasm of a garrulous controversialist. Please do his reputation a favour - don't read the works he published after The Western Canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it a crime to Plagerize Yourself????","review":"I was disappointed by \\"Wisdom\\" as I have liked many of the author's previous works.

He seems to trust that the Gnostic Gospels and the Kabbala present a clearer picture of Judeo-Christian thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"The author does a fine job at sounding esoteric, but at the expense of the reader.

I read and review works by many authors; some are poets, some mystery writers, horror or adventure, and yes even some that probe my intellect. When I am confronted with a book such as Mr.Blooms at times perhaps it is overwhelming to me. I am not sure what he hoped the reader would take away after this read. He definitely is a man with an opinion, has great intelligence and writes with passion. In this work, sharing where wisdom maybe found, our author quotes many noble men, written works, even the Word of God.I cannot say I agree with his words, for to me wisdom is found in God,and only God, but then again I am not a Scholar, just a simple reader. I believe those who are looking for deep reading, and a thought provoking work this one is for you. It will definitely challenge you and stimulate your thought process."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book displays a complete lack of wisdom","review":"Apart from learning from personal experiences, wisdom is found in learning from the collective experiences and mistakes of mankind. This means reading history and biography. A basic science literacy is also necessary - certainly one can find important lessons from cosmology and evolution. Only after history, biography and science does literature come into the picture, and even then to confine oneself to the literature of the West, as Bloom does, is shockingly short-sighted in both senses of the term. Judging by Bloom's works, one feels that he doesn't even realize such countries as China, Japan, and Iran even exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read","review":"without a great background of classical reading, this was the most difficult of his books to read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bennis' style is chaotic and has a serious left-wing bias.","review":"I agree with Bennis' premise that there is an \\"Unconscious Conspiracy\\" which sucks the life and creativity out of would be modern leaders.

For example, he highlighted Ralph Nader as an example of a good modern leader.Throughout the book, I had trouble figuring out what Bennis was trying to convey.

Stick to Dilbert, it's more apropo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I read this several years ago, set it aside, and idly picked it up to reread recently. I had forgotten just how bad this book is. It's the cry of a frustrated 1960s liberal who found, at the end of the 1980s, that the world had refused to reshape itself in accordance with his utopian wishes. Bennis is usually pretty coherent, but this book isn't.

When I plugged it in I spend a couple of hours trying to start it, no luck. There is a yellow light on the front that just keeps blinking 3 times in sequence. Found out this is a common problem and requires that the power board mostly needs to be replaced. Of course Toshiba knows of no problem with this model. This is the first tv I have ever had that stopped working. Goggle this model for problems. KEEP AWAY, DO NOT BUY ANY TOSHIBA PRODUCTS.I finally took it to a repair person and he just updated some firm ware in the TV. Cost just $50.00. I was going to throw it a way.

I had researched TV sets for months and I really like Samsung but I found the price of them to be a little...much. Sony is nice but the models that I could afford had poor grainy pictures and there just wasn't enough for me to justify the higher end/price tag models.I had come across the Toshiba 37HL67 by accident on Tiger Direct for $699 and jumped at the deal. The picture quality on this set is amazing, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare looks really nice and Blu-ray's version of Ratatouille looks even better in High Def. My favorite thing is that there is no blurring effect (you know the one where it can't process fast moving objects).I don't have much to say about the sound though, I have it hooked to a surround sound system.This is the best set that you can buy if you are under a budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice TV, great price","review":"Got this TV about a month ago.

I got it about $150 less than Amazon's lowest price.The TV looks great in my small apartment, almost too big. The picture is great-I'm using it with DirectTv HD service. But the one thing that bothers me about the TV is the stand/base. You have to screw the base on manually. After having the TV for a few weeks the TV started to wobble. We had to take it down and tighten the screws, same thing happened a few week after that. My husband used both a hand and power screw diver to ensure a tight fit- but to no avail.

Now that it is set up the thing looks fantastic and is clearly worth more than we paid for it. Picture quality is superb, it took no time to set up, and we also have the comfort of owning a quality brand like Toshiba (between the two of us we own 3 other Toshiba TVs and they all look great and have lasted a long time)One thing that really stands out is how well it seems to handle standard def signals from satellite and DVDs, which is a real plus as he does not yet have a high def package. The picture looks great for an LCD TV, and its easy to mess around with the settings like picture size and so forth to get it the way you like it, though honestly you may not change anything right out of the box. We also tried an upconverting DVD player using HDMI, and the results, as expected, were beautiful.

It was manufactured in April, and I bought it in May. It's done everything I'd hoped for and more. Using the digital tuner, it can pick up four of the five local channels in HD without a cable box by doing a cable scan. When I purchased it, I declined the 4(3)-year extended warranty because Consumer Reports said that there are very few repairs needed in the first year or two. There wasn't one mention of dead pixels. My chance to get the extended warranty would expire in 30 days, so when I noticed 2 dead (black) pixels on the 29th day, I went out and got the extra warranty because they (UE) provide better coverage than Toshiba would. The pixels don't bother me that much, but knowing it'll be less of a hassle to get it replaced if any more show up gives me peace of mind, despite it costing a couple hundred extra."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not last long","review":"After about 3 weeks and a very good performance picture wise thevideo went out and I had no problem to return it to Amazon .Helmut Kade"},{"rating":"2","title":"SATISFIED","review":"Satisfied so far, have had it in operation for 3 weeks.

The title track, \\"Rush,\\" and \\"Innocent Child\\" are absolutely first rate songs worthy of Jones's original band, The Clash.

With this kind of service I cancelled the order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"Based on my view of the book referred to as the Living Bible (it was in fact neither living nor a Bible), I did not expect to approve of a translation carrying a variation of the same name. I was pleasantly surprised. The New Living Translation is an excellent version of the Bible and I often recommend to those who want a translation into simple, modern English. If the Contemporary English and Today's English/Good News translations appeal to you, then I would challenge you to look instead at the NLT. The translation is sound, the phrasing smooth and easily understood, and the language inclusive where appropriate. I would still place the New Revised Standard Version at the top of my list, but the New Living Translation is my second choice. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff.","review":"Very informative good book. Detailed schematics. Has a wah pedal...sweet...good examples of compression and tremolo."},{"rating":"2","title":"La casa en la playa","review":"I've read this book in spanish so i can't judge the work of the translators. In this novel Garc��a Ponce tell the story from a woman's point of view: she's the one who narrates and the facts come from her. I think the main characters, i'm thinking of the two women, are portrayed with great insight and knowledge of the female mind, or what it was in the mexican mid-sixties. This is really important since Garc��a Ponce is considered by some as a writer who portrays women only as sexual objects. One has to think if this is bad in itself but there's no doubt that the author has great taste when referring to sex and his works are the product of great art and craftsmanship. This is a very good book, it won't let you down and you'll meet an excellent mexican writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This is a 'way of life' eating instruction book that is easy to understand and doable for today's fast paced schedules. Most of us know that different types of foods trigger weight gain and water retention and other foods help with lowering cholesteral and assist with achieving the recommended vitamin and mineral intake. Jana explains all of this in language that anyone can understand, grasp and follow. Can't wait to get started."},{"rating":"2","title":"great advice","review":"I thought this was a great book. This is only my second week, but it is an easy to follow plan. It is a life plan, not just a diet. I lost 7 pounds the first week and had been on a diet previously losing 1-2 pounds a week, so I didn't expect such great results.The book is well written and easy to follow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"This is not a get thin quick scheme so if that is what you are looking for... this isn't your book.I've been doing weight watchers for 5 years now and have been on a plateau for some time (due to my own laziness). I have incorporated this book into my weight watchers routine and I am now losing weight again (about 1-2lbs a week) and, more importantly, I feel wonderful!Oh, and her marinade for grill tuna is fantastic and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative!","review":"I could not believe just how much I have learned from this book about calcium alone. I was amazed to learn that what you take it with, depends on whether or not you assimulate it. This book opened my eyes about several things diet and I thought I knew it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, practical information","review":"This book has give me more insight on how to kick start my metabolism with the protein-rich , low-carb diet similar to Atkins as well as providing useful information on the importance of getting enough sleep to regulate hormones and why calcium aids weight loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is nothing but fluff!","review":"There is very little new or useful information in this book other than an explanation of why calcium is thought to be important for weight loss. You could get the same information by just reading a milk carton! The tone of the book reads as though it was written for 3rd graders... nice title though, it suckered me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mis-leading title","review":"I was trying to buy a book on Point of Sale Systems, and this was not close. I needed a business oriented book, not one of poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A warning for collectors","review":"Volume 7 concludes the spectacular Samurai 7 tv series.It goes without saying that if you haven't seen the show from the beginning, this isn't the place to start. Go back and watch this show from the beginning. I wrote a pretty in-depth review for the first disc if you're interested.If you've been collecting the show, there's no reason not to get this disc. However, another version of this dvd exists that comes with a box to fit all 7 volumes. As a collector who likes his DVDs to look as good on the shelf as on the TV, I would strongly recommend the version with the box as opposed to the version without."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Top Ten Best Anime Series of all Times","review":"Based on the original Seven Samurai by Akira Kurosawa, this remarkable series has a great story that builds on each of the characters. Similar to the original story, the seven are hired by a poor village (with only rice for payment) to defend against barbaric forces. The people pay the barbarians their produce to keep them from destroying their village. The Samurai accept their offer but accept only the millet (rice byproduct that the villagers eat) and nobly defend their village. Everyone must see this fantastic epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End of the Journey","review":"Was a blast, im a huge fan of the series. And the end is really great. The Animation seems even more well done than most of the rest of the series and the plot ends in satisfying conclusion. Id prefer not to say any spoilers. But if your a fan at all, i mean ..come on its the end =). But the collecters box is very nice, its made pretty well its not flimsy material in anyway. Im curious what the *limited edition* offered but the box is definately worth it for collectors. Either way..buy this..right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Zombie fans, cool bonus!","review":"Love this Import of Dragula. It's great if you like to hear songs being remixed, as I do.
