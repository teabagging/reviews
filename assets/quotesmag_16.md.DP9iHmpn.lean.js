It's almost impossible to compare anything to it; it's just in a league of its own. That said, \\"Who We Are\\" does do its best to catch up to its excellent predecessor.There's not one track on this album that I dislike. The argued-over \\"The Joke\\" is the strongest, most original song on here, and the most musically interesting track I've heard in a while. It's fusion of a rock chorus and jazz-like verses give it an exotic feel, and its lyrics are, at the same time, heart-breaking and angering. They took a gamble with this song, and it pays off.The ballads, which I've missed in the last two CDs, are strong and meaningful, especially with Wade's gorgeous, \\"The Storm.\\" While many others say that the last songs on the cd seem to be indistinguishable, I think they're unique and catchy in their own way, and very lyrically different. Wade's songwriting skills never cease to amaze me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid continution and evolution for Lifehouse, good all the way through.","review":"Unfortunate that the stations in my area have just recently started to play \\"first time\\" on the air, I almost would have missed the release of this album.

In some ways it seems like the band is so defined by that song that some don't really give a full appraisal of their body of work. As much as I enjoyed the first 3 releases, in my opinion \\"Who We Are\\" is the landmark Lifehouse release. It has standout songs like \\"First Time\\" and \\"Broken\\". I also love \\"Whatever It Takes\\", \\"Disarray\\", and \\"Storm\\". Unlike the other releases which were a step down from \\"No Name Face\\", \\"Who We Are\\" is solid from beginning to end and in my opinion is their best overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quality Album","review":"Lifehouse is one of the better recent bands. This album is a very good collection.It features good vocals and instrumentation. It contains several catchy songs. The better ones include the following: Disarray, First Time, Whatever It Takes, Who We Are, Broken, and Storm. The last two songs contain a spiritual and likely Christian theme. They are very good.If you are not familiar with this group, 'Who We Are' is worth a listen.

It is NOT leather. It's made out of a very thin, easily tearable manmade fabric that REEKED of chemicals when I took it out of the packaging.Since it's so poorly made, I don't expect it to withstand much use. It definitely would not withstand the riggors of airline baggage handling for very long so if a travel bag is what you're looking for, bypass this one at all costs otherwise you'll be wasting your money.I would return mine, but it's not worth going through the hassle.

I found this book to be very funny at times and also a great testament to what is taught and learned in this school. I probably read this book 3 times before I went to Ranger School and I was a bit nervous. After I graduated Ranger School I went back and read it again and laughed at most of the stuff because I had experienced or witnessed almost everything that was written about in the book. This books is outstanding in giving a prospective Ranger a heads up on what to expect. Don't let the stories get you too nervous about the school though. It is not impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reading for Parents of Ranger Students","review":"This book gave us a real, sometimes too real, look into the physical, emotional, and mental hardships our son is currently undergoing as a Ranger school student. The editing and spelling are sometimes sloppy, but the content can hardly be improved upon, as each story is written by a Ranger student. Each story includes a lesson that each Ranger took from school into the rest of their careers. Every family with a Ranger school student should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ranger Book Ever","review":"I had the chance to meet the author at FtBragg last year and bought the book then out of boredom more than anything. I needed something to read on the plane ride home and the author was a nice (eloquent) guy so I figured the book must also be genuine. I'm glad I did. This is by far the best Ranger book that I've ever read. It's not over the top Hollywood tough guy, but lets you into the inner thoughts of a number of Rangers as they fuel their fire to keep driving on. It's not a book about killing or being the most macho, but about what drives people to volunteer to serve in this most difficult part of our Army. Reading these stories makes everyone want to just plain be better - just like these heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Earrings","review":"These earrings are small, but the color of the amethyst stone and the gold is vibrant.

If you're a fan of the Regency genre you'll recognize most of the characters in this book - the rich, handsome, rakish and inebriated duke, his foppish best friend, the pushy mama and older sister, and the intelligent, beautiful, poor-relations heroine. Yawn, right? Well, hang on to your bonnet because Kelly turns it all upside down. It's been a long time since I read a romance novel with a plot that actually surprised me and Kelly does it with such panache, such style, such joie de vive that you'll be smiling as you turn the pages. One of her best and, if you know Kelly, you know that's saying a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twist on a Regency Theme","review":"I always enjoy Carla Kelly's books.

There's the proposal from Nes for marriage, withdrawn after he realizes she's penniless. There's his less honorable proposal of mistress. There's Dr. Cook's first proposal that Libby turns down, since she wants a prince, not a gawky frog. There are Dr. Cook's proposals (almost one every time she turns her head). Finally, there's Nes' final honorable proposal of marriage. Which one will she choose?"},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfying for me","review":"*spoiler*Well I guess this book is well liked by some, but I honestly did not like it at all.I've never read a romance novel where we are made to like the 'hero' of the story (in this case, the duke...we are made to think he is the hero not only because of the little summary on the back of the book, but also because he is handsome, nice, a duke, etc.)Sooo I get most of the way through the book, happily expecting the duke and libby to be together in the end and work out their problem, but no! The author decides to pair up libby with an ugly, bumbling doctor who has no romantic charm whatsoever, and whom libby wasn't at all ever attracted to in the first place.I'm sure there are those who are happy with the way the book ended, but I just can't be one of them. I was very very dissatisfied. I did not like the Dr. as a match for Libby at all.I also took off a few stars because I just wasn't feeling the romance.

I thought this shouvel would be great help with snow, as well, as other home projects unfortunately it turned out to be a flop for me. My reasons are as followes:#1 The tuffy shouvel is way to small of a scoop for snow, The plastic shovels from the home store are much larger, as much as 35%. your get a better scoop, meaning more material is being moved much faster. meaning Done with job much quicker.#2 The lenth of the handle is way too short (mind you I'm only 5'7\\".)

Second is the angle of the head from the handle, it needs to be straighter to make it easier to push with. Like another reviewer said they have a good idea it just needs perfected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drug companies aren't the only villains","review":"Yes, it's true that pharmaceutical prices are skyrocketing and that SSRIs are among the most frequently prescribed. Yes, it's also true that SSRI's have been _associated with_ suicidal thoughts (causation has not been proved). However, from personal experience with family, friends, and patients, I can also tell you that SSRIs have saved some lives.One other reviewer points out that patients should be monitored very closely after starting a drug. That's the real problem right there. With declining reimbursements and increasing patient panels, primary care physicians are often not able to see patients within the first week or so. That's the fault of the health care system, not the drug companies.Frankly, we need a complete overhaul of the system, so that everyone can be assured of access to the standard of care that many of us enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"An interesting book and there will be much discussion as to whether David Healy is ultimately correct.However, what does concern me about David Healys work, is that it is basically negative. If he believes that S.S.R.I.sare in many cases worse than placebo, what is he advocating in their place? It is well understood that anti-depressants along with the various counselling therapies, can prove very effective.In Doctor Healys local authority however, there is a 9 month waiting list to see a psychologist. Is David Healy advocating and campaigning for more psychologists in his work-place?In the future, new drugs will have less and less relevance. It is becoming far too expensive to continue to develop and test them.

I'm at a moderate level of identification. While not the definitive identification guide (I'm partial to National Geographic Society's \\"Field Guide to the Birds of North America\\")this wonderful book tells you more about each bird than any other field guide I've seen. I always wanted to know a little more about each species I look up than just their identification, I've always been curious about their lives and habits. Each bird is given a long paragraph about it's lifestyle or other interesting pertinent information. It's fascinating to read cover to cover. Because I was so pleased with this book, I've looked for other Lone Pine Field Guides. I also recommend \\"Bugs of Northern California\\". Again, you won't find every bug listed here, but you will learn a lot. The writers of both books show great respect for the species they are describing.

I was disappointed to discover that there really is music over the sound effects which renders the cd useless to theaters. I'm still hoping someone will record a cd of just these sounds.

When I took it out of the package I could tell right away the quality was severely lacking.I picked the lock with a nail file and there was no challenge. The key little more than a key blank. I installed it anyway then when I put the key in, the entire lock cylinder came back out with it. The keeper is somewhere inside my door. Even if the key were better and the lock cylinder had stayed in the handle, a blow from any hard item would bust the outer housing in my opinion.Unless you just want it to have an extra key on your key ring I would say look for something else.

She is coupled with a very young Hank Jr. and sings circles around him. At times when allowed, they do make some nice harmonies together, but not that often. This is a Connie Francis recording all the way and it would be interesting to know what Hank thought about pairing with this veteran performer at the time. This is not to say this is a bad CD. The alternate version of \\"No Letter Today\\" and \\"Walk on By\\" Connie comes on strong and Hank even manages to hold his own against the intimitating Ms. Francis. Of all the C&W duet CDs released, this is one of the most interesting pairings and worth the purchase. It is the only one to have historical merit and the songs are all standards.

This one was alright, but considering its length, a lot of boring drivel could have been cut out, and the plot could have been more complicated.I couldn't put it down though, if that's a positive side, and I read it all in 4 hours.

What the book lacks in logical organization and strong visuals it makes up for with exceptional information.

There are many very useful drawings that show details found few other places. Many pages are devoted to the output of various well-known guideboat builders and this makes for some very interesting reading. The writing style is easy to follow, but the organization is somewhat choppy. What the book really needs is better photography.

However, the CD has its merits, and to be fair, it has quite a lot of them.The music is basically an Industrial base, augmented by Darkwave melodies. It is well structured and enjoyable, with great sonic variety.What costs Mr. Din a point is the horrendously distorted vocals, which are, quite frankly, excessively twisted and make Johan Van Roy of Suicide Commando sound like an Opera Singer.Overall, this album is above average electro album with a dark edge.

All three young women face challenges that while completely believable, are not predictable or \\"canned\\" in any way.

I bought three audio books narrated by Stockard Channing, who performs mostly fantastic voices for each of the characters and reads with great spirit, but my chief complaint is:Did it have to be so fast? Sometimes it sounds as if the producers sped up the tapes to fit all the narration onto two CDs. Sometimes Channing gulps and swallows her words, and if I didn't know the text so well, I would have no idea what she was saying. I still enjoy the recording, but it is really vexing to be unable to understand her!Otherwise, this reading is spirited, warm and brings you closer to Ramona! Cleary's depiction of a child's psyche is absolutely accurate. Kids should enjoy Ramona's rambunctious, totally rational (to her eyes) behavior, and Channing's enthusiastic (if speedy) reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a very very funny, fun, and good book","review":"The book Ramona and Her Mother was a very funy book.

Ramona gets so angry at her parents that she says that she is going to run away. So Ramona's mother comes in and says \\" Do you want me to help you pack?\\". well these are not the words Ramona expected to hear her mother say so she said \\"yes.\\" Her mother told her to pack all sorts of things.

Many people probably don't know what a hammered dulcimer is. It sounds somewhat like an autoharp, but the strings are hammered with mallets, instead of plucked. The songs are all instrumental with no voices. The dulicimer in supported by guitar, flute, piccolo, violin and harp, although not all of those instruments appear on every song. The dulcimer usually plays the melody on the songs, although sometimes the other instruments take over the lead. Joemy Wilson is obviously a great dulcimer player, but I found the album to be rather boring.

This is probably the best of the Mr. Wong series with Boris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Prints, But a Forgettable Series","review":"When Monogram recruited Boris Karloff for its \\"Mr. Wong\\" series in 1938, the studio apparently believed that the horror icon's presence would be strong enough to carry its low-budget product. They were sadly mistaken and the series folded in 1940 after six films, with Karloff appearing in only five of them. (Interestingly, Keye Luke played a younger version of the Chinese detective in the final installment.) Time has not been kind to the \\"Mr. Wong\\" series. These mysteries are deadly dull and have virtually nothing to offer except the sincerity of Karloff's performances. On the plus side, these are the best prints you are likely to find. Still, Karloff's association with Monogram was less distinguished than Bela Lugosi's run during the early 1940s. Even Bela's \\"Mysterious Mr. Wong\\" (no relation) is more entertaining than the dreary exploits of James Lee Wong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Wong is right!","review":"Great chance to see Boris Karloff as a detective rather than a monster. I have watched all six movies several times and will be returning to see them again. Karloff appears in five of them and I understand that he was not available for the sixth, but was replaced by a younger Chinese actor.

All of the cut scenes and graphics have been polished and go well together. What is even more impressive is how the game itself has some intelligence built into it. As the players heat up, the game recognizes their actions and comes up with even more intense challenges. If you want the game to stay light, it will. You have a choice of what direction you want the game to move in and the females have final decision over any action in the game. This intelligence and control is great because it makes sure that no one is pushed, everyone has a great time and it becomes more fun the more you play. Try it out for your next party, you will be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical with solid foundations","review":"Stanley and Clinton have written a very practical guide to developing mentoring relationships. By addressing several kinds of mentoring (from intentional discipleship to passive mentorship) they have digested sophisticated theory into reasonable methods. Throughout the book they also offer their own personal experiences as examples of the principles they wish to bring out, which adds a very readable flavor. At times the authors seem to treat the topic of relationships with a sterile pragmatism, which is my only complaint about the book.

This is the kind of movie the phrase \\"ahead of its time\\" was coined for. There are no heroes, no glamorous battles, no triumphant fanfare. Wilde doesn't portray one side as \\"good\\" and the other as \\"bad\\" - both the Americans and the Japanese are depicted as multi-dimensional, relatable human beings forced to kill each other by circumstance. Dismemberment. Bayoneting. A lot of quick, cold, meaningless death. Men becoming sadistic animals. This film casts a critical eye on the nature of war and makes the audience see the absurdity and tragedy of it all - a remarkable, courageous feat for a film made in 1967. This is groundbreaking, powerful stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I Missing Something Here?","review":"I read the reviews before I purchased the DVD. Most of the previous reviewers gave this a 5 star rating. I've never seen nor heard of this film, and after watching it, I can see why. It feels like a low budget, thrown together film with actors that had other jobs at the same time (notice the hair on these men?) Wilde looks like he's never held a pistol before, and those tanks...WWII vintage??The japs in the rear don't even act like they've been invaded. Drawing pictures of plants, sitting around eating rice, etc.To its credit (thus not just 1 star), some of the graphic scenes are a \\"first\\".

The battle scenes have some vigor to them, but don't make much sense. In all, the picture owes more to the Vietnam War era than WWII. Perhaps film buffs point to this film because it was one of the first WWII films to show the war in some graphic detial (bloody bullet wounds, shot-off arms and legs, etc) and it follows the travails of the foot-soldier, rather than the generals. It's like bad Sam Fuller, which means, really, really low budget. The voice-overs and flashbacks are indeed very reminiscent to Mallick's technique in THIN RED LINE, although in BEACH RED, the effect is mostly silly. In sum, the effect is mostly bogus, somehow exploitive, and impossible to watch without a fast-forward button."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shadow","review":"Just a shadow of an attempt.

Carol Higgins Clark (CHC) tends to introduce too many characters in order to confuse the reader and attempt to make the mystery more mysterious. Instead, it's a turn off and results in a sloppy attempt to resolve the mystery. I've read the other books in her series leading up to this one, particularly because the Regan Reilly character appears in the Christmas books that CHC writes with her mother. I find those books quite interesting and will continue to read them. However, I've had difficulty getting through CHC's other books, but this one might be the first one that I refuse to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"Carol Higgins Clark writes like a child who hates writing, but loves the applause at the end.

The characters are completely unpleasant, their motivations stupid (because I think it's lucky!! C'mon!) The ending is wholly unsatisfying. The main character we come to really dislike is given an undeserving reprieve at the end, while characters we had no feelings about at all are punished. Regan Reilly is a lousy detective with no personality.As a die-hard country music fan, I thought I'd like this book, but it's obvious Ms. Clark knows nothing about the industry and gave us fans nothing to like.

The main question of this book, what do the initials CT stand for, was never answered. So much emphasis was placed upon the \\"stalker\\" however, the ending was wrapped up so quickly that he was basically shuffled away.

The man just wasn't funny. The jokes were dry and his routine was just flat out boring.

As a matter of fact I turned it off about 10 minutes into his routine. Epps is quick to let the audience know that he is only working to earn back the money he'd already spent from his first films- I can't imagine that he's broke but anyway that's not why you're reading this review. A week went by and I decided to give Epps another chance... He is ignorant as HELL but hilarious. Definitely not your Rock or Chappelle kind of humor, Epps is straight 'gutter'. Perhaps that is the reason I was first turned off. When I attempted to watch the DVD again knowing what to expect I have to tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes, Epps is a bit slow at times- and this he admits- but having been forewarned I'm sure you'll too enjoy yourself (especially if you are an Epps fan).

Horribly unfunny.... lame jokes.... dry.... boring.. and NOT FUNNY WHATSOEVER. No wonder why this guy never did stand up before. If you are silly enough to pick this garbage up pay attention to the audience.. 90% of the time these guys are laughing before he says the punch lines of his boring jokes.

I read Wild Blue right after Band of Brothers and must say that I was a little disappointed in Wild Blue. I did not feel the kind of emotional bond with the \\"characters\\" in Wild Blue that I did with those in Band of Brothers.Despite that, I would still recommend reading the book. The book is a slow starter, but it picks up as soon as the crew moves to Europe - at which point the book is a serious page-turner. I found it very informative and the stories/personal-accounts very compelling. The ending in particular was the most human element of the book and I enjoyed it very much.Bottom Line: If you are interested in McGovern, the Air War in Europe then read this... if you need to choose betweem BoB and Wild Blue - choose Band of Brothers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wild Blue REVUE","review":"I was very disappointed.The book seemed to be a series of anecdotes not nicely linked, and the reading of it was choppy.It also repeated a story, about the braking parachutes, like it hadn't been told before. It seemed like a bad continuity error.I think the book was strung together quickly to take advantage of Stephen Ambrose's reputation. He is a much better writer than this book indicates.I learned very little from reading this book, and had heard many of the little \\"stories\\" and jokes before, e.g., the B-24 that lowered its landing gear and then shot down the German planes escorting it to a landing field.Very disappointing overall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Down in Flames","review":"Mr. Ambrose really misses on this effort. His handling of the topic is very superficial and must have written by his assistants. For those wanting to read the real stuff on the B-24, get a copy of \\"Log of the Liberators\\" by Steve Birdsall. Unfortunately, the author's name will sell zillions of this poor book and keep young people from reading more comprehensive books on the WW2 air war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could have been","review":"This book seems to be a lot like a B-24. It takes a long time to take off, but once it does, it's fairly interesting. I don't mind learning a little about where some of the B-24 airmen came from and the training they went through, but Ambrose throws a long list of airmen, that other than McGovern and his crew you almost never see again. I agree with other reviewers, his other books are much better. I think it would have been more interesting to go into more detail with just McGovern and his crew and avoid some of the other things that slow this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wild Blue: Interviews with B-24 Crewmen","review":"This is not Ambrose's best book. It feels rushed and incomplete. But it still covers fascinating material about the B-24 and their crews. It is more of a collection of interviews then anything else. A great book to sit down and read at your local coffee shop on a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good book","review":"It's a good book with lots of information. It is an easy read because it looks alot like a fictional story. I highly recomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wild Blue","review":"Way too many technical errors. Slow reading and, again, justtoo many mistakes. Ambrose did not live up to his reputaion on this book. Early in the book I found myself re-reading Chas Watrey's book \\"Washout\\". Chuck has passed now, I believe, but I am sure he would be upset to have his book quoted in the manner it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book read more like an advertisement for George McGovern than anything else. I understand that he is a friend of the author, but the clear favoritism and decidedly narrow focus spoiled the book. Very few characters besides McGovern were developed beyond their introduction and the time-line felt choppy, jumping between places and events without continuity or transition. I did learn some things I hadn't been aware of, but for the most part the book was well worth passing on in favor of other options.The Candy Bombers: The Untold Story of the Berlin Airlift and America's Finest Hourproved a vastly better alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soon to be on Used Bookstore Shelves Near You","review":"I was disappointed with this work, given Stephen Ambrose's previous works. I thought it would be more like \\"Band of Brothers\\", but it was more of a biography of George McGovern. It is short on the B-24, the AAF, and long on McGovern's romantic life. It also had a shocking number of typos and inaccuracies. Ambroses works are generally good historical works. I do, however, read Stephen Ambrose's books (which are relatively light reads), between more substantial authors like Martin Gilbert, John Keegan, and Lawrence James. If you really want to read this work, wait for it in the used bookstore shelves in the next year or so. There will be plenty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing flop","review":"Who would have thought that the guy who gave us \\"D-DAY\\" and \\"Citizen Soldier\\" could have cranked out a disappointment such as this? This is an autobiography of McGovern, and nothing more. Little research or effort went into this book and I actually suspect someone other than Ambrose wrote it. I've read everything else by Ambrose and this \\"ain't\\" him.For those who are looking for a good read about the Lib and the crews who flew her just check out \\"Log of the Liberators\\". There are many other good books out there on the B-24 that do the crews justice. Don't go \\"here\\" just because it's Ambrose. To be quite frank: If \\"he\\" did indeed write this book he should stop while he's ahead. Ambrose, INC. dropped the ball here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild Blue: The Men and Boys Who Flew B-24's","review":"In my opinion Mr. Ambrose wrote two masterpieces in D-Day, June 6, 1944 and the sequel, Citizen Soldier. Everything else that I have read of his since then has been down hill. Wild Blue is particularly disappointing. If the reader wants to get a sense of the air war during WWII, and the exciting details that those heros had to endure, I suggest you put Wild Blue down and go buy Gerald Astor's, The Mighty Eighth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"With Ambrose's reputation I expected great things from this book. It would seem difficult to fail to write an interesting book on the subject, especially with Ambrose's admiration for McGovern.Unfortunately, the book reads as if someone turned on a tape recorder and then transcribed with no editing. It is painful to read and terribly inconsistent. Given the volume Ambrose publishes, he has to cut corners somewhere, and this was unfortunately where he cut. I could not finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild Blue????????????????","review":"If you like Ambrose's style, you may like this book. It is a rambling, loose collection of anecdotes and interview notes, that ultimately comes across flat and uninspired. The book seems like it was prepared and researched in a rushed manner. If you want a 'quickie' read that does not require much thinking, this is it. If you want anything close to a substantive history of the 15th AF or the B-24, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I really wanted to enjoy this book. I just didn't live up to my expectations. Ambrose noted in the introduction that the book began as a biography of George McGovern and later turned into a story of \\"the men and boys who flew the B-24s over Germany.\\" I got the impression he never did decide which book he was writing. That said, the book still has its good points. For one, it presented a side of McGovern that is not widely known. The reason I read this book was that I wanted to learn more about the air war in WWII, and I did learn a few things, though not as much as I had hoped. In following McGovern's war career, Ambrose takes you through the pilot training program and gives a good picture describes the difficulty of flying the B24 and what life was like on board the plane during a mission. Unfortunately, it was all interspersed with biographical information about the other members of the flight crew, ground crew, etc. that did more to confuse things than it added to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wild Blue","review":"My objection to the book is not in Ambrose use of the scholarly work of another. My objection centers on the publisher's sloppy editing of this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambrose should stick to history, not writing","review":"At least it's not just me -- I was glad to see several other reviewers felt the same as I did. I read Band of Brothers after seeing the HBO mini-series, and was pleased to see that the characters were fleshed out in greater detail in the book. As I read it, I could not help notice what can only be characterised as mediocre writing. I was given Wild Blue as a Christmas gift, and am about to give up. The grammar and the bad prose are so annoying, I can not take it anymore. It's a shame -- the story and the people seem compelling, and the research seems to be there, but the writing would make my son's sixth grade teacher cringe. Several times I have thought to myself, \\"How on earth did the editor let this manuscript go to print?\\" As for the subject matter, it would be helpful to have included diagrams or cross sections, or a least demonstrative photos, of the B-24, to give the reader a better image of what the pilots and crew went through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, repetitive and sometimes ridiculous!","review":"Not only do I feel cheated in that I unknowingly purchased a biography of George McGovern but this work by Mr. Ambrose reminds me of junior high history class. It is repetitive, mission after mission without anything worthwhile happening. It is also ridiculous as in the effort he makes to describe the harsh climate of 50 degrees below zero but then adds that the ground crews would hide their beer on a mission bound aircraft so that it would be cooled. If skin will freeze I can assure Mr. Ambrose that the crew's beer would certainly be frozen. This will be my final purchase of Mr. Ambrose's 'churned' efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless popular history","review":"Ambrose should be ashamed of himself. The excellent author of Nixon and Eisenhower biographies now has edecided that he can get anything by the editors. This is a waste of time. It tries to show us the lives of the men who flew over Germany but ends up more of a memoir and more junky stories then actual history. Why not just publish a diary? he uncovers nothing new here and there are other books on the cubject by authors who actually studied the air war and didnt just 'feel' like writing a history because they are succesful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"Not on par with many of his past efforts. Book is mostly driven by Ambrose's adulation of former Presidential candidate George McGovern. Very little technical detail to rival other works such as \\"D Day.\\" The continuity is poor and reads more like a flight log(the reviewer states from experence,as a former combat pilot.) He praises McGovern for his efforts as a B-24 pilot flying dangerous missions over very dangerous places. Ambrose, very cavalierly,excuses his protest of American men doing the same thing, with the same sense of duty, over the skies of Vietnam. He offers no explanation for this duplicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda long winded","review":"Decent book but it seems to go on a bit too much for me...almost feels like the author dragged it out a bit to fill more pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"cant review it never showed up!!!","review":"I'm only giving this one star because amazon says I have to give something cause I dont feel they deserve even one star, I ordered this product May 4th, its now June 4th, and I still have not received my book.

This book tells individual stories and accounts about the guys that were fighting. A big part of this book I liked hearing about was the pilots getting fired upon while on a mission. Some were very lucky. Hearing this was exciting and yet upsetting because some did not survive. The reason it was given 4 stars instead of 5 was because of its sometimes rambling nature. It would get sometimes down right boring. Otherwise, Stephen Ambrose did a wonderful job with this book.

While the overall story was interesting I remember being very unimpressed by the writing style.I just pulled the book out again and went through a couple of chapters.

Similar to his last book on the transcontinental railroad. Hard to follow, not much depth. Seemed to be in a hurry to compete. Very short for such a dramatic subject. Best part was the prologue describing the B 24. This is not a book I would recommend. I had the good fortune 12 months ago to see the lone B 24 first hand in a flying display.

The process of young men from a variety of backgrounds coming together to engage in incredibly high risk activities, and getting the job done, makes for very interesting reading. It is true that the book centers upon George McGovern and his crew, but I don't see that as either a positive or negative, McGovern was just another guy from middle america when World War 2 took place.

Stephen Ambrose is a better author than this book would lead you to believe. I've read several of his other works so I mistakenly assumed that this book would be of similar caliber but it wasn't even close.If you want to learn more about George McGovern this would be a useful book.

Poor sentence structure and jumbled story line confuse the reader. Some early chapters read like his rough notes were copied verbatim. It is still an intriguing story of the extreme dangers, fears and hardships the young men of our bomber crews had to endure.If the facts of the story are true, and I believe they are, I gained a new respect for George McGovern and all the other men of the Bomber Command.

It seemed the book was written to capitalize more on Ambrose's reputation...because he did write some good books before. Maybe he wanted to write a new book to pay for a new kitchen sink. With this book, it just sealed his reputation (as far as I'm concerned) as a light-weight historian. One is best left to stick with the likes of more substantive historians like D. McCullough, R. Massie, J. Keegan, or M. Gilbert. Wasted my money on this one, and I'll sell quick as lightning, soon as I can find another sucker. (Should have no problem; there's one born every minute.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, not the best","review":"The book is more about George McGovern not the boys/men that flew.

It was ok, not totally boring and interesting at times but I have read far better WWII books."},{"rating":"1","title":"My reasons for being a bit dissapointed","review":"I abandoned ship after 76 pages, the first 76 pages I read were all about dozens of crew members lives before they joined.I wanted to read the story,... the meat,.. this was just fat,.. fill,.. All this served no purpose to me. I could have skipped the first 76 pages no problem.I will not remember all these individual mini bio's, dozens ofsmall stories.But,I went back and traded the book for the \\"Band of Brothers\\"which so far seems lots better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....","review":"Rather than what we expected, this book was too much about George McGovern and not as well written as Mr. Ambrose's previous efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Bio than Battle","review":"Mr. Ambrose wrote a unabashed tribute to George McGovern, too bad he tried to pass it off as a story about something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject - Bad writing . . .","review":"I was mightily disappointed in the quality of writing of this book. Is Ambrose one of our greatest historians? Or did he even write this book himself? It reads like a Junior High report. Every time an interesting idea is mentioned, it is left dangling and subsequently ruined by a quick left turn into a semi-related factoid. The only inference one can make is that the book became an ill-conceived training exercise for the author's son Hugh (mentioned in the introduction)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careless and thrown together","review":"This book was thrown together and it shows. It is amazing that the air war over Germany can be recounted with so little passion, tension or insight. This is a poor excuse for a book and an insult to the men won fought in the skies over Germany. One example: because George McGovern's plane never had to fight attacking fighters, there is nothing in the book about it. This despite the fact that he contends the book is not just about McGovern and his crew but the whole B-24 effort over Germany. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy.","review":"I bought Ambrose's The Wild Blue to learn about the 15th Air Force and about the B-24 bomber. I learned much about both. I also learned about the younger George McGovern, who featured in none of the blurbs. A greater concern has to do with the padding of the work. Repetitious accounts, an overly large font, innumerable notes, pages of acknowlegements and bibliography combine to reduce a 300 page publication to some 240 pages of text. I have read other books by Ambrose, D-Day, Citizen Soldiers, Nothing Like It In The World, Undaunted Courage, and been impressed by excellent writing, in-depth research, and good story telling. Not so with The Wild Blue, a book which appears to have more to do with cashing in on Ambrose's name and reputation than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely misinterprets Michael Sherry's book","review":"Stephen Ambrose consistantly sites Michael Sherry's book to support his favorable impression of the Army Air Forces actions during the Second World War. While Ambrose praises the technoncratic approach of the airmen during World War II, Sherry harshly condemns this culture. According to Sherry this made the airmen unable to formulate alternatives to strategic bombing of cities instead they measured success in the amount of damage that the bombers caused regardless of the target's military value.Ambrose does not mention the bombing Dresden in his account. Nor does Ambrose write about the disasterous raids made by the Fifteenth and Eighth airforces in 1943 when hundreds of aircrew lost their lives for targets of dubious military value. Instead we get a myopic account of George McGovern's time in the Army Air Force."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only cookbook you'll ever need.","review":"This cookbook is so wonderful that everyone that I've lent it to has to have their own copy.

Blavatsky, Theosophy, Eliphas Levi, Gnosticism, the occult scene in Paris during that era, and apparently there were a lot of non Jews in Poland that got into the Cabbalah in the 19th century also. These are some of the main topics covered in this book although other things are covered. The author is very objective and academic so he doesn't muck it up by sticking his own biases into the mix.

I'm sure Brian Slagel would NEVER sign some bible-thumping holy rollers. Anyway, this is quite majestic prog-power metal, and predictably, it soars like an eagle.The lyrics are very cerebral, touching on many diverse topics. The guitars are complex, almost reminiscent of later Iron Maiden. Despite what some people say here, the production is actually pretty good. The only thing I could complain about is that the songs could be longer and that the singer is not exactly the most original(although still enjoyable). I anticipate what this band shall offer in the future.I would recommend this to fans of Fates Warning and later Iron Maiden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't there a law against plagiarism?","review":"Last time I checked, this was called \\"Queensryche.\\" It doesn't just sound like Jacobs Dream is influenced by Queensryche, it sounds like they're actually playing Queensryche's songs. Not only does that trivialize Queensryche's creativity, but it's also intellectual rape, plain and simple. Cripes, the sonic similarities are undeniable. I guess this might be good if it hadn't been done before. Of course, it doesn't help that the vocalist is the worst Geoff Tate's impersonator I've ever heard. His operatic histrionics are horrifying, and his complete lack of control -- evidenced by ceaseless, cringe-inducing vibratos -- make me want to drive my head through a concrete wall. The musicians are competent, but I think they need to make their own music and not copy a band with genuine creative integrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This book is a great and easy read.

Not to mention that these are all repeats and can be found in ebooks. I'd like to know before I spend more than $10 whether the stories are fresh or not and whether they are complete in themselves. The first two stories were enjoyable enough but so short that I would never have purchased this book if I had known about the last one.

It's one of those indie faves where writer/director/star Jeff Thomas tries esoteric camera angles with atrocious lighting to try and create an atmosphere of terror. The acting is so terrible and the script so contrived and confusing, the movie just sits there like a ripe avocado and does nothing. The characters are so cardboard, I couldn't keep up with their names or just how they interacted. Really a bomb, avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was a negative star rating.","review":"If I could meet the actors and director, screenwriters, person who decided to market this peice of crap in real life I would slap them and ask for my 7$ back.

Did everyone see Jacob's Ladder when they were like five years old and decide to try and remake it? That's what 13 Seconds feels like, a poor man's combination of Jacob's Ladder, Angel Heart and some horrible Mexican soap opera on Telemundo. The video quality looks like it was shot on dad's old VHS recorder from 1985.Giving this movie one star is a GIFT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery Science Theater fodder","review":"My first thought as I began watching this was: MST3K--this film is unintentionally funny. Our whole family laughed ourselves hoarse, especially any time anyone opened his or her mouth. We enjoyed the redheaded girl especially. The only annoyance was that at the end of the movie, it abruptly turned into a Chick tract--well, annoying for me, anyway. I was watching what I supposed was a horror film, albeit a ridiculous one, and got blindsided by a turn or burn sermon, and I found that a bit deceitful. But then, I got annoyed when Stargate transformed mid-movie from what I supposed was an intelligent sci-fi film into a glorified Star Wars rip-off. At least anyone reading this review won't get blindsided.It gets two stars for me, but that's only for the humor value. Watch it if you want to laugh, but don't expect much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the cover.","review":"I rented this movie because the box promised to be full of gore, nudity, etc. Sounds all good & well, but once you put the movie in, you'll find a cheaply made independent film, which is about trying to sway the nonbelievers in with the Christians. If you're a Christian, though, you probably wouldn't like it anyway unless you love gory movies. I have to give it that. It's got some very gory scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst movie I have ever watched","review":"Run away, run away! You or I could do better with a video camera, a six pack and two or three buddies on a Friday night. The only reason I stayed on to watch half the movie is that the first minute is interesting. Also, I was in a state of horror - at the abyssmal quality. I did not know it was possible to make such a bad movie. It is kind of awe-inspiring in that regard."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as bad as you may read","review":"I admit the acting is pretty bad but the movie in genral is pretty damn good it has its share of bumps in the night also its share of some pretty grusome looken ghouls and demons and alot of bloody gore take my word its not that bad at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Low Budget film....has potential","review":"I must admit, I was dubious about this film as I have seen so many mixed reviews about it. I will say that the acting in the film is fairly poor and one guy is in it just because he can make a really evil laugh. BUT...at the same time, you can see really good use of special effects money with some very effective scenes with creative monsters, nice lighting effects and even a great homage to \\"Hellraiser\\" with Cenobite like beings. The storyline doesn't appear to make any sense until the last few minutes of the film when you finally realize why the film is titled, \\"13 Seconds\\". I would actually like to see someone really good get ahold of this film and turn it into a good movie.Sometimes with low budget films you have to remember what the director is trying to show and may not have had the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I got this book as a companion to what our squad calls \\"the bible\\": \\"GI Issue Collector's Guide\\" by Henri-Paul Enjames. The \\"Individual Gear\\" book covers just what it says: items that a soldier would typically have with them in camp or in the field. Topics include shaving kits, glasses, foot powder, language guides, lighters, cigarrettes, and flashlights, just to name a few. Overall the photoraphy and layout is very good. My only complaint is some of the photos of reflective items (such as watch faces) have a lot of glare on them. But that grumble is because my wife is a photographer and has taught me to look at pictures with a critical eye. The average reader will hardly notice the blips.I'd highly recommend the book for any serious collector or reenactor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Music!","review":"This CD is filled with Irish music collected by Turlough Carolan, a blind musician who traveled all over Ireland, playing for the wealthy and collecting hundreds of Celtic harp pieces.

I am soo upset, this shouldn't happen with mineral type windows. My watch might have been a fluke, but I am annoyed by it, and I am faced with wearing my nice watch insetad. The light button on the face, and the nice display is great, but it's unsightly to look at in my eyes. I won't put it on myu wrist with a huge mar on it, too thick to be a sratch.

The battery just died, which means it lasted 1/10th of the advertised life. The face has a few scratches, seems to be a very soft plastic, scratches show up white. Not worth replacing the battery when it is in this shape. I think I was pretty careful with this one, I do not do physical labor or anything.

The Timex had a plastic band that broke so I was interested in the Casio model because it has a stainless steel band. The watch works great but I am disappointed in the band. I have what I would call average sized wrists. I adjusted the band to the smallest setting by repositioning the pins only to find that the band is still too big. The only alternative is to have links removed. I recieved instructions on how to do this but find that it is not simple and I will probably have to take the watch to a jeweler to have this done.

Our bookclub read this novel and with the \\"neck roll\\", we dissed some of the characters and shed tears with the others. This is a must read. You will not want to put this one down.

What I liked about the book was that it was so real. The happenings were things that I could really see one of my girlfriends going through. What I liked most about the book is that it quotes Bible scriptures to back up the advice that's given throughout and even though this is a fictional story, the scriptures are powerful and convicting. It was a juicy storyline with lots of GOD! Two for one! The reason why I gave the book four stars instead of five was because one event was super predictable (to me) and THAT event kind of took long to actually happen and it was like just happen already!

I can see why this was a break out novel for Ms. Murray. I think we can all agree that Jasmine Larson steals the show. however, I do think the book was a bit slow in getting started and that the drama could have been amped up a bit more. I like the message that a family who prays together stays together. I also think the Brian and Alexis thing went way too fast and it seemed like a proposal stemmed because they were just anxious to 'do the do'. Regardless, this is a strong, entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As The Reviews Say","review":"I was expecting something so different. I guess the old saying is true that you can't take the words of others. You have to judge it for yourself. I didn't think this was any different than any other love story with a happy ending. If you want to read a really different love story with a christian flavor, read Promises Beyond Jordan. It's a good love story and a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Hot to hold and to cold to believe...","review":"This was a well written Christian book. I really enjoyed the scriptures that were included with the different situation that arose. Jasmine was the typical friend in life that really envies ones' happiness and because she's not happy she does not care about the next person. Kyla was a trooper more so than I would have been seeing her best friend in her bed only to turn and run from the room and leave. Jefferson on the other hand was a true man and standing up to his mistakes and choosing not to lie about it to get back in good with his wife. Alex and Brian were also true friends in doing whatever it took to try and keep their dear friends marriage together. I'm just glad Nicole didn't have to be in the middle of her parents problems like so many children do and then are forced to take sides and hold grudges against their parents. This is a must read Christian relationship book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work","review":"I have read many fiction books but this was the very first \\"christian\\" fiction book I have read. The book was inspiring and uplifting. The characters encounter real life situations and they apply godly principles.If you don't know the Lord it may be hard for you to relate to how the characters approach tough situations in their lives. However,if you truly love the Lord this book will be an inspration to you.It is refreshing to see the characters respond according to the word of God. In today's society it is sometimes hard to do what God says when the world's way is screaming so loud at us.Sometimes we think a situation is too hurtful to ever forgive someone, but this book gives very good examples on how to continue to love and forgive.This is a must read for every christian woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life, God, Test","review":"I really enjoyed Temptation. I purchased this book for a friend after I read it. She came back to me and thanked me because her marriage was similar. I was unaware of a sequel but will be purchasing it as well.

I'm not going to pull any punches on the writing - this is not great literature, but that's not its purpose or point. I suspect that it does exactly what it set out to do, which is show the reader the mechanics of a very particular form of warfare - humans hunting humans with long-range weapons. If you want to know how the US Marines went about training and using snipers in Vietnam, then this is your book. If you want psychological insight into the cost of engaging in hunting and killing your fellow man - even while harbouring reservations about the politics of the war - then it's not your book, Ward doesn't really go there.

This book did not seem to \\"candy coat\\" or glorify the Viet Nam War in any way. The uniqueness of this book is in the letters home to mom. Something more to think about. For every brave soul that has fought in any war there was also a brave soul waiting for a safe return. The author, Joseph T. Ward, has given readers a different point of view.

Churning out CD after CD since his split with Van Halen, Sammy Hagar seems content with writing the same type of music year after year. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for those who enjoy his simple lyrics and guitar-heavy music. There are some great hidden gems on his new \\"Not 4 Sale\\". \\"Halfway to Memphis,\\" \\"Things've Have Changed,\\" and \\"Not 4 Sale\\" are all songs that sound like Hagar challenged himself lyrically. The rest of the lot is Hagar like you know him - elementary school lyrics with big guitars. Hopefully Sammy will learn to take his time on future albums so more of these \\"gems\\" can be created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected from Sammy - but very interesting!!!","review":"Well - I was pretty surprised after the first couple of tracks on this CD, but as I got further into it I was pleasantly suprised. You can tell that Sammy put his heart & soul into this CD - what more can you really ask for? Stand up and Shout is a great, hard guitar track (song was in the movie \\"Rock Star)Overall I liked this CD, was a nice change from 10/13 which was a good CD but this one goes in a different direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lyrics and good mix of songs.","review":"Sammy does it again - makes another good album full of great lyrics and good beats backing it up. The album isn't a blockbuster - but it is worth buying if you are a fan of Hagar.Several of Sammy's influences are heard on this album from the Doors on \\"Hallelujah\\" to Zeplin on the Zeplin mix of Whole Lotta Love. Sammy finishs the album with his typical strong musical message.A good CD for rock and roll fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redrockin with the Ritas","review":"Not 4 Sale is a continuation of where Sammy and the Waboritas left off on 10/13. Fun rock that keeps on going song after song. From the start of 'Stand Up' through the instant Sammy classic 'Thing've Changed', Sammy and the Waboritas demonstrate that they are hitting on all cylinders and having fun doing it. The Zep remake is just that a remake. The bluesy rift 'The Big Nail' is as good, if not better than the Real Deal. Make It Alright and Not 4 Sale are those typical Sammy songs that us Redheads are use to. What can be said of The Big Square Inch.....just a cool song. Is that Lauser singing?

While Musial has been one of the great ambassadors of baseball's, personally he is a somewhat mysterious man - read this book and find out why.

Giglio's comprehensive biography of Stan Musial offers a fine life-view story of one of baseball's brightest stars.

With the depth of experience as a researcher and writer, I feel that Giglio has explored all avenues of Musial's life and has written an excellent book of the man's history, character and actions. This isn't to say that Musial was perfect; there are instances of temper, inaction and mistakes, but it make Musial no different than anyone else. As a role model, Giglio shows that Musial can fill the bill; for the book, Giglio enlightens and entertains - a very satisfying read, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musial: From Stash to Stan the Man","review":"I have read every book written about Stan Musial.

I really don't care about his personal life since I have met him many times and I don't have to have a book to tell the kind of person Stan Musial was or is. If you want to read dirt, than read Ball Four. That will keep you busy. If you want to read about a true baseball hero, I would suggest you read one of the other books about Stan Musial.

Waterman (author of JUST A SAILOR)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put this book down!","review":"I have read all of Gerritsen's novels now, but this was the first book I read. It was chilling, graphic, and filled with the small things that make a suspense novel so entertaining. I read this book at meal times and then straight through the night until, exhausted, I had finished. The characters were so real and well developed that I felt I knew them personally.If you enjoy reading suspense and/or medical thrillers (especially the medical thriller genre) you will burn through this offering from Tess Gerritsen. Her insight into the pathological mind is frightening, but I am glad for it. The Surgeon was a shining example of it's genre. Read and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Surgeon","review":"Tess Garritson is definitly is an amazing Writer.

I won't go into a long description of the book, or tell you what it's about. I will tell you, however, that if you purchase this book be prepared to read it in one sitting, bite your nails while reading, don't pick a night that your favorite tv shows are on, and tell your spouse not to talk to you while reading. Seriously - one heck of a book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was very well written and also scary.

I will continue to read the remainder of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This is the first book I've read by Tess Gerritsen.

It was a quick read with a lot of action"},{"rating":"2","title":"A total surprise, true page turner, Fast pace and brilliant.","review":"Tess really got me with \\"The Surgeon\\". Although this is her first work that I am reading, I can easily say that she has become my favourite writer among Thomas Harris (Red Dragon) and Douglas Preston (Thunder Head).This book is surely a page turner and right in the middle of the book (when most books just goes in boring uninteresting and slow details about characters and sub plots) comes the climax. Although starting this book can be a real trip to the medicine cabinet, since the beginning chapters are soaked with blood and gore, I had to put down the book for Advil and some relaxing music.A sure read for summer-thriller seekers, you won't put the book down like me until you have finished it.I started this book Saturday night and in a day and a half, Mid Monday afternoon (Labor Day) I was done with it.Talk about a quick read...Can't wait to read \\"The Apprentice\\", the follow up to \\"The Surgeon\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The surgeon","review":"This is the second time I have read this book.

Dialogues move the reader along and in __The Surgeon__ the characters are clearly and highly defined. I've read several of her books and chose this one because I'd caught a reference to it in some other thing I was reading (not by her) and that sparked my interest. It was well worth it. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me up all night...","review":"WARNING FOR THOSE WITH WEAK STOMACHS, this is not the kind of book that you should read..at all. It is a very graphic story about a killer who kills women in the most cruel way. It is quite disgusting, he gives them a hystericatamy and takes out their intestines and then slit their throats. After I read this one, I compulsively checked my windows and was weary of shadows outside. I was up for nights. Good story though, ingenious, I could not put this one down at all, I was like reading all day and didn't stop reading till I got to the end until like 1:30 or something.

Now I MUST read \\"The Apprentice\\" and other of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gruesome.","review":"It's always a shame to see a good writer use bad material. This author describes the vivisection of a woman in great detail four times before moving on to the next victim, who dies the same way and gets the same detailed descriptions. If you enjoy thoughts of hurting women, this is your thing. It isn't mine.Two stars instead of one because the author has talent. Two stars instead of five because she cops out with very cheap material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tess Gerritsen Knows What Scares Women.","review":"I've never been the victim of s sexual assault, never had a prowler come through my window at night, never been helpless in a harrowing situation-- but these are all fears that women live with every day. Gerritsen drags them into the light of day with this book. The very idea that there is a specific word to describe sexual excitation caused by stabbing a knife into flesh is creepy.On one end of the spectrum in this book is Catherine Cordell, a successful surgeon, on the other is Jane Rizzoli, a female homicide detective who is struggling for recognition in her own field. Between them is a serial killer who preys on wounded and vulnerable women.Gerritsen has put far more thought into this book than is normally done with a serial killer story. My reaction to it was rather like my reaction first to reading Red Dragon-- Scary, even repulsive at times but I couldn't put it down. She has managed to find a fresh take on an overused plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Worthwhile Read-Exciting Book!","review":"This was the first I have read of Gerritsen's books, and it was a good one!Catherine Cordell is a surgeon who is highly skilled in repairing broken people's bodies.There have been some horrendous murders taking place in the city of Boston. This killer would tear women apart by carving out their female organs, stabbing them with a scalpel, and leaving some dead, and others barely alive at the scene.With each repeated act of great violence, the monster comes closer and closer to capturing Cordell, and hurting her. The thing one, he did hurt Catherine once, and she managed to escape. But this time, she may not be so lucky. She's in this monster's obsessions all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"How long does this last??","review":"I'm into chapter 10 of my first Tess Garritsen book, \\"The Surgeon.\\" I ordered the eight-book bundle on Kindle. I'm trying, I really am, but her constant whining about men is getting on my nerves. Is she always like this? It reads like a winner in the Lesbian Book of the Month Club. Somebody tell me it gets better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misandric Garbage","review":"This whole genre has been done to death, and it was done much better by Thomas Harris. This just came across as a pretentious, poor man's Deaver style of novel.The only aspect of this that sets it apart from the other serial killer novels is the use of all the medical terminalogy. However, while the author feels the need to explain what an \\"IM\\" is, she glosses over rather intricate details that are related to the medical field."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Tess Gerritsen is one of my favorite authors. The Surgeon is one of her best works. Rizzoli and Isles are great together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and interesting","review":"I think it is a very excellent and interesting book. Every time I pick up my kindle and read, it keeps me spellbound and have to force myself to put it down again. Real value for money. You will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tess does it again!","review":"I was concerned that Tess would have a hard time topping \\"Gravity.\\" She did so, rather well, with this book. It grabbed me from the start, and the one time I put it down <smirk>, it was all I could think about. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars, was that the gore level was a bit high - what with the killer being so nasty, and the \\"down time\\" in the book being held in a trauma suite - the gore is pretty much constant. Now that I've finished \\"The Surgeon,\\" all I can think is... movie???"},{"rating":"1","title":"So predictable!","review":"Not only was this \\"novel\\" a disgusting tale of mutilation and sexual assault of women, but the story line and ending were very predictable and uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, But. . .","review":"The ending is a blatant rip-off of the climax of The Silence of the Lambs. A very well-written rip-off, but a rip-off all the same.Otherwise, I thought this was a great book, well developed characters, good backgrounds on all of them, and avoidance of most cliches. The only thing I really didn't like was the characterization of Jane Rizzoli. She's the book's other female protagonist, someone we should be empathizing with, and to me, she just came off as a grade-A, you-know-what. Defensive about everything and uber-hostile to Catherine Cordell because she's attractive, and generally in need of a good smackdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this time around","review":"As a long time fan of Ms Gerritsen, I was really looking forward toThe Surgeon, alas it was a big disappoint and ever so predictable.

I was sitting on the end of my seat until the end of the story.If you like crime storys or mystery story this is the book to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medical chills","review":"Aside from a few books by Robin Cook, I haven't delved too much into the world of medical thrillers. And to be totally honest, I'd never heard of Tess Gerritsen until I happened upon a copy of this book at a friend's house. What a fortuitous moment that was. I am now officially a fan of her work, based on this novel alone. The plotting is just so tight, but more importantly the tone is so moody and weirdly intense. Those are always things that grab my notice when reading the work of an author for the first time, and they are here in good measure. I enjoyed \\"The Surgeon\\" a lot, and will undoubtedly seek out more from the same source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"I had never heard of Tess Gerritsen before and I didn't even know that they were making a new show on TNT based off of her books until after I read this. I bought it mainly because of the low cost for a full length \\"Contemporary Romantic Suspense/Thriller\\" novel.After I read the first few chapters and had a chance to really get into the plot, I couldn't set my iPhone down until I finished. Great characters, great plot, and I liked how you got to see how the story progresses from more than just the two \\"main\\" characters. I loved it and cannot wait for the show to air to see if it will live up to the high standards I've set just from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ends very well, but 1st half drags","review":"I am glad I stuck it out and finished this book. The second half is far better and far faster than the first. Some will be put off by the slow-moving first half, its excessive wordiness, etc. Even in the second half, there is an obvious revelation in Dr. Cordell's hypnosis session that Gerritsen ignores for 100 pages. Seems to borrow from other famous novels/movies in spots, but it doesn't really detract from the effect. Interesting villain. Quite a bit of educational stuff on mythology. Excellent descriptions of emergency surgery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Bestseller!","review":"Dr. Catherine Cordell, a trauma surgeon at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, is trying to get her life back. Before coming to Boston, she was nearly killed by a junior hospital resident, Andrew Capra. Fortunately, she was able to free herself and shoot Capra before he could kill her.Now women are being murdered in the same way Andrew Capra had previously killed.The police are at a standstill until it is discovered that similiar killings happened in Savannah, Georgia.. where Dr. Cordell once lived. After questioning Cordell, detectives Rizolli and Moore begin to think that the murders have something to do with Dr. Cordell but they can't figure out why. They need to find out who is killing these women before he gets to Dr. Cordell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy good suspense!","review":"If you like crime novels, this one will surely not disappoint. From the very beginning, it's hard to put this novel down.The unexpected twists further draw you into the story line, and even when you're completely freaked out; want to put the book down because you're wondering, \\"What is that rapping on the window outside?\\", you keep going. I liked this book a lot. My only complaint was that the ending, though climactic, was a tad soft and abrupt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh lordy - couldn't sleep for nights >:-l","review":"What a fantastic book. Admittedly this is my first read of any Tess Gerritsen book, but when I heard how scary this was, I couldn't refuse to read it. I do have a morbid streak and this satisfied it a lot.Right from the first page you are hooked and freaked out. Throughout the book, you 'hear' the voice of the killer - so you know his thoughts and feelings. There is a lot of medical terminology but it's explained well and so you can understand it all easier. It's creepy and scary and horrific at times (you shouldn't be faint of heart).This is an original story and will strike fear into your heart (in the good way) because 'the surgeon' seems so real (it could be an actual real case for all we know). I really love her style of writing and the way I was captivated from beginning to end. It is such an enjoyable book, but be warned not to read it too close to bedtime or you'll never get to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for the squeamish","review":"How could I go wrong with a book that multitudes have read resulting in 4 plus stars. I downloaded it to my Kindle and began reading it on a plane trip. Garritsen goes way overboard with description after description of gore, blood and guts. If you like to read graphic images of people mutilating other people while they are alive and bound, then this is a good choice. Obviously, most of the readers enjoyed it based on the star power it got. That is somewhat frightening to me. After getting 15% into the book, I decided that it was offensive and not at all entertaining. I deleted the book from my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Wait!","review":"I too like all of the other reviewers have purchased this DVD set after purchasing \\"Jump Start Your Photography\\" and \\"Posing with Attitude\\".

I tried highlighting and copying, but couldn't highlight the appendix pages themselves. Then, I futilely attempted to do a screen capture. I have been spoiled, I suppose, by my district's web-connected reading series, which enables me to print out reproducibles.

This looked interesting so we went for it. The VLAN config is a bit odd but the switch over all easy to setup. The best part is after 2 weeks in production we had an old system start bombarding the network and we were able to detect it with this switch and take it off line so it paid for itself quickly.

I decided to return this book in one day after I receive it. Someone said in the review \\"I would recommend it to someone who'd never even seen HTML\\".

After getting through the book, I now know quite a bit about Ultradev, but that's only because I had many opportunities to get into the code editor and fix the mistakes in the book! Very hard to follow and the author presumes that you know remember how to do some obscure coding from 7 chapters ago! I suppose you could learn Ultradev in 21 days - if you spend 8 hours on each chapter every day. I fully do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides a good core text, solid examples.","review":"This book does what the author set out to do - whether or not that's what you want depends on your goals. The author obviously wanted to cover as much ground as possible related to web and database development. I haven't seen another book that took the time to talk about database normalization and used real SQL to build the applications. It's not meant to be a \\"one topic after another\\" reference. The chapters go through the available tools in DreamWeaver, then introduce database design, dynamic data, and finally it concludes with seven mini-project pages that hold a great deal of information. Even the more negative reviews have stated that the author knows what he's talking about. I guess it just comes down to if you like the approach to the topic and the writing style. I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't guide you thru building a dynamic site","review":"Examples on the book are tough to follow and are not step by step. The CD doesn't give examples for all the chapters. I found this problem in other Sam's books.

I am not a beginner at Dreamweaver and I knew that if Day 1 and 2 were a little bit confusting for me, the real advanced stuff would be beyond comprehension. I got half way through with Day 2 and am already looking online for a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No code until Chapter 15 of 21","review":"There are several problems with this book. The author fails to give step by step instuctions for his examples instead he expects you to follow along from previos chapters and string the examples along. Also he uses MySQL as the example database. I and many other people use MS Access for development and this makes it tougher for the begginer to get started. Third there is no source code or sample databases for the reader to try out along with the book until chapter 15 and then still no database examples. Its very hard to follow along unless the code is provided. The CD that came with the book is basically useless and I don't know why he included some worthless graphics in it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because his writing style is OK and does contain some usefull info about Ultradev but it fails as a learning tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm never buying another SAMS book again!","review":"I didn't realize that I was going to have a lesson in MySQL. I think that this book should have been written based on what you are likely to have in a production environment (i.e., Access or SQL server). I think Access would have been a better database for this book not only because it is more popular but the data could already be created instead of generating the table and all the data from scratch. Maybe it's just me but I'm very dissapointed with the Teach Yourself books. I will never buy a book online without physically reviewing it again. I was just anxious to get more information on Ultradev and this book was one of the first that came out on this applicaiton."},{"rating":"2","title":"**** Techies - get me! ****","review":"Hehhehe... Borrowed this book from a friend who was finding it alittle bit above the learning curve he was looking for, but I loved the heck out of it. I guess it should be aimed at a higher level reader.

Now, I have nothing against remixes, but this generic dance re-working of the Elvis tune is shameful. A blatant obvious gimmick that's meant to tie in to the 25th anniversary of Presley's death. This shot straight to No. 1 in the UK. The British usually get it right when it comes to taste, but not this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis is back!","review":"This remix was made for a soccer commercial that was shown In England, and once it released as a single in England it went straight to the top of the charts. With this release, Elvis has now tied the Beatles for the most #1 Singles in England. I have to admit that I have a little bit of a soft spot for some Elvis songs, but I urge anyone who can get their hands on it to listen to this song. You won't be dissapointed. It reminds me a little bit of Moby or FaT Boy Slim and managed to become my new favorite song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extended Mix of a cool song! Kicks ...!!!","review":"I think that this CD single rocks! Elvis really blends into the synth backdrop... I want to thank the folks at Graceland for giving ths song a chance to shine again. You hear 2 remixed and expanded versons of this song and then the original song itself.I think that we get a lot more Elvis in the remix... The original song is 1;39. This reminds me of what The Beatles did with Real Love and Free as a Bird...This CD single is for those that are willing to give it a go.. I think that Elvis would love it! this is proof enough to show why Elvis will always be THE KING OF ROCK & ROLL... Besides-- the CD format gives you all the time you can so that you can shake your bootie! Be sure your CD player or computer drive as a repeat function on it... :-)ROCK ON ELVIS!!!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaningless","review":"I read with great interest the reviews posted before me. First, I'd like to mention to the reviewer Kennedy19, that electronic dance music is MUCH more than a 'computerized dance beat'. Making comments on genres of music you know nothing about would imply foolishness and ignorance on your part.Now, the single to my ears is pretty dull and ultimately meaningless. Is this the same JXL who worked with Sasha on ADD? If so, he hides his talent rather well.To me, a remix of a song would be a means for the remixer to add his or her own flavor to the original song, while at the same time maintaining the essence of the song. I did not find anything I liked in this re-hash of the Elvis song.For those who did, good for you.But thats also probably because I have become very selective in the music I like, which cannot by any means be described as mainstream (and yes, mainstream includes trance as well)0 stars to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis, brought to you by Nike","review":"It's worth pointing out how this song suddenly (re)surfaced into mainstream pop culture. As international football (soccer) fans will know, NIKE used it to promote its advertizing during the World Cup in June, with heavy television rotation and a marketing campaign that has been estimated at well over $50M USD. Not quite the sudden emergence of a cult hit that has been reported, but another instance of the astonishing marketing power of a large corporation. Think of that when you drive past the neighboorhood club featuring local bands as you are listening to this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will glad you pay Tuesday.....","review":"This was a great set of cartoons.

Toss out the glossy color images, reduce the oversized font, sift it down to the actual useful information, and this book could be printed on two pages. If the author indeed asked himself why an entire book should be devoted to HTML: Frames, perhaps he could have spared us all his answer and just produced a pamphlet. The sophomoric quasi-historical segment at the beginning of the book was perhaps added merely to meet some minimal weight requirement. Ziff-Davis Press sinks to new lows. One wonders at the propriety of using this as a required text in a web based course offered by... Ziff-Davis! This is one you will definitely want to throw away.

Despite what another reviewer said, mine has a very quiet pump--I really can't hear it at all. Another strong plus is that the water does not splash, either while you're filling it or while it is running. I have it in my office, and patients find it very attractive and relaxing (I do too). I've had it since April of this year, and I run it daily when I'm in the office (4 days/week).

I love it, it is beautiful and quiet. It looks 10X better than in the photo. The \\"difficult\\" part is putting it together so if you aren't very mechanical, just get someone to help you. If the little metal piece where the water flows from at the top isn't flush to the slate the water will not fall along the slate, it is easy to just push that piece against the slate and the water trickles down the slate beautifully. Once put together I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I do.

They seem so simple to operate, so I assume there isn't a trick to getting them going. But it is strange that Flotec would try to sell something that so obviously is non-functional.

This item would be helpful for transferring small amounts of liquid from one container to another, but for anything over a couple of gallons, it is insufficient to the task. I tried to use it to transfer 15 gallons of water, and after ten gallons had been pumped, I carried the rest of it in 1/8th the time it took to pump the ten gallons. It takes time to rig it with the hoses and the drill motor, and by the time that is done, you could have done all that it can do with a large sponge.

I would have been better off with a plastic tube, and some capillary effect - this thing didn't take a single drop through it. The only benefit from this device, if you want to call it that, is the guy that manufacturers it, and the companies that buy it for 25 Cents, and resell it for way more than it's worth are sitting pretty with the profits while we get frustrated.

So I tried it again, but tried my cordless drill that does 1500rpm and all I got was smoke - no water again.At best I could say this item is not durable.

Wendy Lindstrom is a good author and storyteller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good second book in the series","review":"Overall this book is well-written, with characters that are interesting and complex. It took me a few chapters to get into this sequel to Shades of Honor, as book one ended with a reconciliation between all four brothers in which they would all work in the sawmill, and book two opens with Kyle thinking about the different career paths his brothers have taken. However, the love story is interesting, the plot tension is at the \\"just right\\" level, and the ending is very satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good book in this series","review":"I enjoyed this book just as much as the first one.

He seemed like such a hardnosed unfeeling man at first but the lonely spirited Amelia discovers the soft hearted man Kyle is trying so hard to hide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story with a few writing flaws","review":"This was an even more charming story than the first in the series. I found myself laughing outloud at the charming attempts of this couple, who didn't know each other, trying to make their marriage work. Was this book perfect, NO. It could have done a better job tying up loose ends at the finish. The villian walked off like a hero with no repercussions for his actions, kind of like modern day villians. The story and dialogue between the main characters in this book is worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Disappointing","review":"The characters of Amelia and Kyle had great potential but they were mostly unrealized and the ending of this story was terrible. It didn't appear to be well thought out at all. After all the horrible things Richard had done, he sure became quite contrite REALLY FAST. I started to get really ticked off at Amelia toward the end. Kyle did come across as a much more well-rounded character but I never really saw what he fell in love with in Amelia.

It had absoulutely no reference to the period in which it was set. I felt as if I were reading a contemporary novel because of the way that people spoke. The dialogue just wasn't written the way people spoke and thought in 1871. The jacket told of a charming story about Kyle and Amelia. If only that story had followed through into the book. For instance, the best friend from law school and the brother and the mother and the best friend's stepmother who slept with the main character(blah, blah, blah) had way too much time on the pages.I bought the book because Ms. Lindstrom was compared to LaVyrle Spencer - believe me, there's no comparison. I will give Shades of Honor a shot because that is her book that had so many good reviews, but I will look for it at the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended **","review":"This is another great read in the Grayson Brother's series. I truly enjoyed the interaction between Kyle and Amelia. After what Kyle went through in the last book, it was only fitting that his story be next. The events that led these to people to marry each other were great. There are plenty of people that have married for stranger reasons. And plenty of marriages that probably start out with some unanswered questions. It's what you make of it and what you do to fix the problem that matters.

I have to agree with the other viewers that Season four is not as good in DVD production as the first three seasons. I found three or four episodes which appear to have jerkiness, missing several frames, or show old film artifacts - common to all TV shows and movies when they have been in storage too long. The other three seasons does not have any of these defects. On the plus side, season four is the best yet. I found myself laughing at the dialogue between Chet and Johnny, Dr. Early's hiccups being cured by a boy's suggestion of drinking soda, and the action sequences are more realistic including a falling power line and a woman sitting in a cactus patch.

By the time season four aired, I had moved onto the Six Million Dollar Man, and beyond.Watching the 21 episodes of this ground breaking series for the first time, I realized why I do not appreciate the graphic medical effects of todays' productions. The real stars of the show are not the special effects team, but rather Gage, DeSoto, Nurse McCall, and their developed skills. That is the way a show should be.Build a following based on good scripts, a good cast, and competent set design.

He starts up one idea, (ie: Jakie Chan plays very similar characters in all his movies.) and then proceeds to do a stereotypical Asian accent where he states what he is doing as he plays Jakie Chan. And it goes on, and on, and on, and on for like 15 min +. What he is doing is not funny, original, fresh or new, and he simply assumes if he moves more, and yells louder it will become funny. BTW, this is his whole act. The majority of his jokes make fun of Asian people. Now I don't want it to seem like I did not think it was funny because I was offended. I love controversial humor....

See, all I been told was that it was a couple of guys who played music with interesting instruments, including the digeridoo. Their music is so much more than that, and this c.d. is proof. There is a certain mood which only they are able to create. It brings your mind back to all the beautiful things in life that one tends to forget in the busy lifestyle we lead. There is an undercurrent of peace that flows through the music to you, the priveledged listener. As you listen to this c.d., it will remind you that each and every one of us are able to change the world. Thankyou RiverTribe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Love the dish.

I would personally compare it to much of what Explosions in the Sky is doing. It does have times where it rocks out. For me though, I like a bit softer moodier sounds when I listen to music with no vocals. If you like this album, I would highly recommend \\"Confines of Heat\\", an album that Maserati made with The Mercury Program.

Could not make it through the over the top purple prose. Obviously the author read a Tom Clancy thriller and tried to write... A Tom Clancy thriller- which is good news for Tom Clancy. Why? Because this attempt proves that writing a credible story is NOT easy.Ridiculous scenes, set ups and unbelievable card board characters make this one of the crummiest books I have picked up. Granted after page 30 it might have improved- but I would rather drill a hole in my head than try to find out.To bad Amazon does not have negative ratings- say a \\"black hole\\" rather than a star.With regards to the other \\"glowing reviews\\" these HAVE To be schills for the author.

This photos are erotic and show a tender romanticism. These photographs are a welcome relief from the overdeveloped and overposed male models of some other photographers.

Now, Portland is a great city, but you'll find Seattle, New York, Los Angeles, Boston and San Francisco all down below the obscure places. The bottom line is that everyone has different things they are looking for and a city slicker like myself would never, ever be truly happy in a city under a certain size or in a highly 'red' political climate.

The copy sold by Amazon has no subtitles, so the plot, such as it is, appears to involve Alain Delon as an older, former dancer with a limp who is the artistic director of a dance company. There is a lot of intrigue involving the new, younger choreographer who is bit of a narcissistic, dancing autocrat. He browbeats women dancers, and Delon frowns a lot and frankly looks like he regretted producing this turkey! The worst part is that the dance sequences are way too long and resemble Solid Gold knockoffs! (See your 1980's reference guide!) Do yourself a favor - DO NOT BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, but a decade out of time...","review":"The movie opens with a dance sequence to the fabulous 'supernature'. The plot is ridiculous and some scenes are a laughable (like the dancing to death scene on the roundabout). The lack of subtitles limits the film a bit but not too much as its fairly easy to follow the plot. The film doesn't take its self too seriously as demonstrated by the central cop character who drives an old Russian Lada and talks to his minor bird all evening. It does however feel like its a bit out of time having obviously been made a decade after disco.All in all, I found it entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable Book","review":"This little book, Praying With Mary is a valuable resourse for those moments when we need to know we are not alone in our dreams, difficulties or triumphs.

It is difficult to believe that this is a first novel from this gifted writer. Wisdom and insight like that found in \\"Dancing Naked\\" are uncommon in a first novel. Rather they come after many novels which were merely preludes to a masterpiece. VanWagoner has hit the ground running. Rarely does an author capture the power of despair and the temperment of true love like VanWagoner does. I have never seen the world through another person's eyes quite like I did when reading this book. I was amazed at the disturbing images it evoked and thrilled with the subtle beauty that came simply from words on a page. The symbolism runs deep in \\"Dancing Naked.\\" This book will stay with me for a very long time and I have a feeling that I will revisit it often, gaining new insights each time I dare to explore its pages.

This one now has its place on my shelf next to \\"Bird by Bird\\" by Anne Lamott and \\"Wild Mind\\" by Natalie Goldberg. I'm looking forward to Ms. Berg's next book due out in July.

She covers everything, from the business side to writing classes and writing groups, including her opinions on the \\"myths\\" of being a writer. One wants to do the \\"homework\\" she gives you. Best of all, Elizabeth Berg continually encourages the reader to be the writer that he/she wants to be, nothing less, nothing more.

Duh!Since she has nothing of value to offer an aspiring author and had a certain number of pages to fill, she wraps up this volume with a \\"true confession\\" of a friend she alienated, and FOOD RECIPES, for God's sake!Spend you money on any book by Martin Cruz Smith, Nelson DeMille, Lawrence Block, James Lee Burke, Andrew Klavin or James Hall.

This book presented the refreshing message that writing need not be an excruciating experience. Sometimes, writing comes naturally. I am in the middle of writing a novel, and I have thoroughly enjoyed the writing process so far. I agree with Elizabeth--if writing is torture for you, try doing something else!Among other things, the book discusses how to deal with rejection, and success. The author points out that success may divide people because it invokes the old green monster: jealousy. Elizabeth Berg included a fabulous piece of writing created by her best friend who described the jealousy she experienced when E.B. became a famous, published author.Overall, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The recipes in the back are a wonderful bonus.

The plastic ones crack and break at the tip where the prongs come out.I bought this one as a spare for $3 and change including shipping through Amazon.

Then somehow I forgot about subscribing or buying the latest issue off the newsstand until a couple months ago, I found this listing here on Amazon. I immediately subscribed and have since received three issues. I can say that Conde Nast is far and away the ONLY decent travel magazine on the market today.

This quickly became the soundtrack to my vacation, which I played constantly as I drove across country.I would highly recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of \\"original\\" Celtic music.

Also, the way the hero/heroine kept gazing at each other but shying away before any connection was made throughout most of the book became quite boring.

I was so interested in reading the perspective of a victim's brother, and felt priveleged to read such a private topic. I certainly respect Ken's pain and appreciate his bravery in facing his feelings. However, the book is just not that interesting. It starts out with a gripping account of Ken and his Dad hearing the devastating news, and Ken's trip to Lockerbie was fascinating. After that, I really lost interest because there is just way too much detail given to David's rambling journal writings and Ken's wandering life. I would have loved to read a book about the tragedy, and a more concentrated, edited story about rebuilding one's life after such a terrible loss.

Yet the real tragedy of David Dornstein is not his death on Pan Am 103, but the years of agony he endured with untreated manic depression.The cyclic unraveling of a life is painful to witness. If you find that fascinating, read this book. I am left wondering why David went undiagnosed and untreated. Were there no interventions, or was everyone lured into the myth that only tortured souls can produce great art?We can only wonder what a functioning David might have contributed to the world. Might he have worked in a soup kitchen or tutored someone in English? Instead we are left with another set of narcissistic ramblings from the young and grandiose. Is there a real parent in this book? What a tragic reminder of the mindless price untreated mental illness exacts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really good story in there somewhere...","review":"The premise of this book is very compelling, containing the makings of an intriguing and haunting memoir/biography. Indeed, the early chapters are well written and quite promising.But the story gets lost, bogging down under the author's self-absorbed meanderings, and his heavy reliance on rambling, not-so-brilliant excerpts from David's notebooks.The book falls short because Dornstein fails to examine what's at the center of all this: his own fixation with his charismatic and deeply troubled older brother.There is a universally true story in here, tragic and quirky and surprising, but Ken Dornstein may have been too close to be the one to write it. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer looses himself in search of brother...","review":"This book begins wonderfully, and somewhere around the middle gets totally off track. He just gets bogged down in things that aren't all that interesting. I understand that he's coping with the loss of his brother, but it seems he did it in a really long, weird, and unhealthy way. I had to really buckle down to finish this one, and just wanted to tear my hair out over the last 35 pages. If this had be about 50 pages shorter it could have been sooooo much better.P.S. I think his brother was probably mentally disturbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure narcissism","review":"For those who enjoy rambling, narcissistic screed. In an unintentionally amusing chapter, the author Biblically rationalizes his attempts at shtupping both of his deceased brother's girlfriends, which is truly an innovative way of coping with grief. The brothers shared narcissism as a trait, but at least the deceased one had an undiagnosed mental illness (bipolar) as the potential cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not music","review":"I bought this album because he was part of a great latin jazz ensemble and I felt like some good music. Boy was I wrong! This album is full of rambling through the keys, jumping off the melody to perform excentricities, to then come back to a tired song.It is exasperating having to wait for him to finish his showing so you can listen to the music. I bought it based on the sample bit and my gosh can he play with emotion but after he gets bored with what is in the sheet he just leaves you hangingto go play.He literally decomposes the music to then bring it back together. It is dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"sammym@mediaone.net","review":"Chucho demonstrates his magnificent talent on ivory thoughout the entire album.

There is none of the haunting lyricism which he displayed in \\"Claudia\\" with Arturo Sandoval. There is none of the genuine Cuban beauty as in \\"Cenizas\\" with Omara Portuondo.

What this means is that the edge puts a lot of pressure on the top part of your foot/ankle as you invert.To keep you foot from hurting too much you have to flex your foot, which is counterintuitive to inversion therapy. To properly relieve tension in your back your whole body needs to be relaxed and that is hard to do with these boots.Also, unless you are in a college dorm like I am and are limited by space, get an inversion table.

The exercises are excellent tools and guides for therapeutic interventions with a population of clients for which there is a scarcity of methods available. More importantly, the autobiographical narratives of Samuel were emotionally touching and would certainly captivate a borderline audience.

However, the authors do not rely on any research to support the methods described in the book. Instead of relying on current research, the book seems to be based on principals of psychology that are outdated by a half a century.Given the enormous advances in neuroscience in the last twenty years, one has to wonder why anyone would buy a book that ignores recent developments in the science of the brain.It appears that the intent of this book is to attract the reader to the author's exorbitantly priced residential treatment center, since he suggests that you contact him there at both the beginning and end of the book.In short, if you are looking for help with mental illness, you would be better served to find a book that discusses methods that have been proven to be effective in scientific studies instead of the nonsense contained in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Use This Book In My Professional Practice","review":"As a mental health therapist, I use this book for one of my groups for Borderline Personality Disorder.

This is an accurate and vivid account of the day to day and year to year activities associated with the early American fur trade era. Pick up any book on this subject and you will find that this book is used as a reference. Larpenteur spent much of his time at the Fort Union trading post in present day Montana where the Yellowstone River empties into the Missouri. This is his story of how the actual trading was carried on, relationships with the Indians and resulting battles that oftentimes would occur, along with the inner relationships amongst the fur companies and military, the hardships which had to be overcome, etc. He shouldered heavy responsibilities and it is apparent that at times he would get somewhat down on himself for not accomplishing or meeting his goals. If he were alive today, he would see that his journal would erase all those self doubts and misconceptions that he had of himself. A great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mountain man, fur trader and keen observer","review":"Charles Larpenteur's capabilities as a writer, his presence in the American wilderness at a time when many were not literate, his submersion in the fur trade in positions of responsibility, all make him a unique, worthy read.The reader is removed from the adventure fantasies and romance, carried into the day-to-day details of the life of a man who became a mountain man early in life and remained one until the trade was no longer a viable institution. A mountain man worrying about profit and loss far more than fights with wild tribesmen, a man who knows white men and studiously avoids being tricked or ruined by their wiles and their competition for trade with the Indians.Larpenteur has been used as a reference by almost every work written about the fur trade, but his own work needs no references.Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"Diaries or personal narratives, such as this one are not only very rare they are very interesting for the historical reader wanting to read a primary source who was there and experienced it. For another book offering a good view is Chardon's Journal At Fort Clark 1834-1839.Books such as these written mid or late in the mountain man era offer us a view into both the times and events of the life. Day-to-day existence, some days exciting, most others hum-drum. We can read of the majesty and heroics of the mountain man-fur trade era but as these diaries show much could also be just a day-to-day existence.All excellent for the interested reader.

The pen part is a soft and thin plastic. This proves to be a very bad combination! When my daughter squeezed the pen the entire thing exploded in her face! :( She had blue paint in her eyes, mouth, hair, etc. and was horrified. Awful. My husband inspected another pen and had a hard time removing the plug. The slight pressure he had placed on the pen part caused the paint to squirt out all over him once he got the plug out. Ugh!

The idea of using a mouse as a pen is good, but it does have a lot of problems, some with the design.It is too small.The buttons should be in the side, not in the front. It is not a natural position. clicking does not feel natural, it puts strain on your fingers.My finger is normal size, but it sits right in between the scroll wheel and both buttons. It is weird. I usually end up clicking the right-click button. Also, I can't rest my finger anywhere. The space is too small. There should be a rest for your index finger between the scroll wheel and the buttons.This works a little better if I swith my computer to a left-handed mouse, that way I use the top button as the main mouse clicker.

The protaginist Tim Underhill held little interest to me. The e-mails from beyond were an extremely silly gimmick.

I'm an alarm technician and use the switch several times a week, either at the office or in the field, to set up POE IP cameras. Being in the field this little switch has seen some abuse, but despite being dropped, stepped on, rained on, etc, it still works great.I bought a second one for a customer to power their 4 POE cameras in a warehouse. Has ran 24/7 for about a year and a half now with no complaints from the customer.

It was worth the wait. Lots of forensic detail, much humour and a protagonist who is down-to-earth. The story-line is a tad fantastic (when will authors realise that we do not always want werewolves and cults - so much as a good honest serial killer (or two), lots of bodies, creative killing methods or ways of disguising them and a good plot and likeable hero/heroine). Having said that, Fatal voyage was a very pleaseant way to while away a chilly weekend. And Reichs is at the top of the pile, ABOVE Cornwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb look into the world of forensics!","review":"Kathy Reichs has penned a true winner in FATAL VOYAGE. As the author of Strike Hard, I am intrigued by the manner with which other authors manage to captivate and hold their reader's attention. Kathy Reichs has done just that, creating a story that kept me turning page after page in an effort to finish the story without stopping.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense/thrillers, or has any type of interest in Forensic Science. If you fall into either of these categories, you will NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm ready for the next one, Ms. Reichs!","review":"After plowing through this book, I've decided it's my new favorite Tempe Brennan adventure. (Death Du Jour was my prevoius favorite.) The detail on the crash investigation was very interesting and added to the overall effect of the story. Kathy Reichs explains the science used by her characters, rather than just making a general statement like \\"she looked into it.\\" The reader gains an understanding of what really goes on in police/forensic investigations.After his virtual absence in Deadly Decisions, Ryan is back in full wisecracking force. While I spent most of the book wishing Tempe would just stop her dancing around and make some sort of decision about him, she seems to lean toward that in the end, but I've taken that bait before. So, when does the next book come out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"hoc est corpus meum","review":"with kathy reichs, you are definitely in situ. this time, it's an intelligently delivered crash course on airplane disasters. a grizzly parallel storyline adds gratuitous gore, an almost omnipresent ingredient in contemporary fiction. with so many characters, mostly of the mortuaried majority, this work nearly requires an index of names, a passenger list of sorts for the voyage."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book gets completly repetitive and boring","review":"This book is interesting to say the least, but i just couldn't take it, she repeats everything a million times, and the scenery just becomes so mundane, and thats when she creates an unplausible incohesive plotline that sounds completley ridiculous, the characters are all 2 dimensional, she continually details scenes of her partner smoking as to add emotional emphasis but that's just a waste of ink and paper, The Forensic stuff about air crahes is very interesting, but you could read about that by doing a search on the internet, or buy a book about that, i felt that the author was rushing towards a deadline and had to have atleast 363 pages, it could have been squeezed into an easy 100-150 page read(or into an hour episode of CSI), but this just wasn't up to par"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the deal??","review":"Reichs' politically correct agenda really shows up in this one like never before, and it's not pretty.Her obvious dislike of religion, conservatives and small mountain communities is written so smugly and condesendingly that I almost put the book away several times in disgust.

The wilderness of North Carolina is the scene of a plane crash in which Tempe's expertise is needed. However, this job becomes personal when some possibly career ending accusations are brought against her. Out to clear her name, and help solve a mystery involving a foot that does not seem to belong to any of the plane crash victims, Tempe pours herself into her own investigation.I very much enjoyed this book, as I have all of Reichs novels. They are fast reading, well written and they keep me coming back for more. The only critism I have of Fatal Voyage is that the relationship between Tempe and Andrew Ryan did not seem to pick up where Reichs left it off in the last book. Ryan also seemed quite different to me in this book, however, that could be the circumstances he was placed in. I will certainly be reading the next in the series and eagerly look forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer read!","review":"This is one in a series of forensic thrillers featuring Kathy Reichs' character, Dr. Temperance Brennan, a forensic anthropologist.

Make sure when you pick this one up that you have time to read the whole book because you won't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can always depend on Kathy Reichs for a good read.","review":"Reichs reminds me of Patricia Cornwell in her forensic-scientific background. She weaves her education and experience into her novels. Her heroine, Temperance Brennan, is a forensic anthropologist who ends up investigating a plane crash which leads her to several old murders. There is never a lull in any of Reichs' books, and this is no exception. Temperance investigates her way through many clues, most of which no one else has picked up on, eventually solving the murders. If you like good murder mysteries and thrillers, and are interested in learning about forensic anthropology, coroner's and police procedures, you'll like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Kathy Reichs","review":"I have read and enjoyed many of Kathy Reichs' books, and this one was by far my favorite. It was one of many books that I got for Christmas some years ago, and my intention was to read a few pages in each of them and then decide which one I wanted to read first. When I started Fatal Voyage, I wound up reading 60 pages without stopping for air. I knew I wanted to finish this one before I looked at any of the others, and I was not disappointed. The story involves a major plane crash in the mountains of North Carolina. Tempe Brennan was asked to assist in recovering and identifying remains, and she found a body part which did not belong to anyone who was supposed to be on the plane. There were three apparent possibilities: an unauthorized person was on the plane; body parts were on the plane; or body parts having nothing to do with the crash were on the scene. Tempe's investigation makes mesmerizing reading for any mystery fan. Five stars aren't enough for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fatal Voyage","review":"Fatal Voyage is an installment in the series of forensic thrillers featuring Temperance Brennan. This novel sees Temperance sent to North Carolina after a plane crash to assist with the identifying and sorting out remains of the passengers. She soon finds evidence that sees her kicked off the investigation team and banned from the sight. She continues to investigate despite the obstacles and uncovers truths no one was meant to discover, and worries that her life may be in danger.As with the other novels by Kathy Reichs, this one keeps the reader guessing right until the end and is a highly entertaining read! The scientific aspects and explanations are also very interesting....maybe not recommended for an airplane journey though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do Not Try to Read This Book with Dinner","review":"I knew better, oh, I knew better, I had read the first two Temperance Brennan books and I knew that the author did not pull any punches with her descriptions of what a forensic anthropologist will run into (and I would not have it any other way, believe me, EXCEPT, when I pick a book to take to a restaurant.)Temperance begins this story by responding to a call about a downed plane. The plane was carrying mostly college students. The crash site is horrific. The demands, physical, mental and emotional on the crash site investigators is horrendous. Then she finds a body part that belongs to no one in the crash, and discovers that there is someone who wants her off the case permanently.I'm not sure I buy all of the details of the conclusion, but that was an afterthough.

For die-hard McKennit fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah humbug","review":"Trust me, \\"this album will turn Scrooge into a fan of the season\\" was written by someone who likes to sleep a great deal. And they certainly don't know Scrooge. It took 3 ghosts all night to convince me that Christmas is a time for celebrating the birth of Christ, a time for acts of kindness and a time for good will to all. Besides making me drowsy, this CD makes me want to strangle the singer with the wires from her harp. It makes me want to sue for ruining my Christmas spirit. Since that Ghost gang bang, I try not to sleep at all. So I gave this CD to Tiny Tim.So, if your 2 year old is banging his head off of walls while you are trying to sleep, and 2 doses of Nyquil hasn't slowed him down, put this CD on.

Anyway, this is an atmospheric cd, having the feeling of hearing music in an open hard wood environment, which is pretty much as it was recorded. It has a sharp quality to it, but I've liked that characteristic of the recording ever since hearing it, and of course tone controls can taylor it to your liking and room environment. This is a recording that(my perspective) can be enjoyed during not only the Christmas season, but during the dark, dreary cold days of winter. It has a classic quality to it that doesn't meet any conventional descriptions, with Lorenna's sharp, rich voice and the open chamber quality of the recording making it unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"ha ha ha","review":"this dude is nutts on the mic, can't say I knew much about him prior to this album.

A lot of people might find it tasteless and disrespectful, but the content is so obviously aggerated one should be able to laugh at it. Skits are almost always a low point for me, but this album has some outstanding skits. The one where he's dreaming the Devil was talking to him and telling him \\"you're album's not coming out!\\" kills me. It's so rediclious and stupid! Lyrically Majik is much like his homie Celph Titled, and always saying something unexpected. The talk of Russian Mafia dudes on ski's shooting at them is beyond explination. Him & Celph get busy togeather over the same beat Dre & Ren flipped over almost 20 years ago. There's not any real touching moments, no songs about his mom, love or whatever.

Nonetheless, I was looking for a text that would help me to assess further the entire body of Pasolini's cinema, to see the common denominators in all the films and augment my critical eye. Rohdie's book is useless to me and mostly unreadable. The sentences are very long and pedantic. You keep waiting for facts or ideas that will enhance your appreciation of Pasolini's life and work but they never arrive. It appears to be a text that was written to impress academic colleagues or an editor.

The effort centered around the effort to eliminate Kimathi, who was at the center of the Mau-Mau and who was holed up near Mount Kenya with a small but hard-core group of terrorists. The process of getting Kimathi involved thoughtful and long-term planning to get to this elusive and clever foe and it makes for good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Performance/Hideous Sound","review":"I bought this CD purely for the Richter Scriabin recordings, especially the 6th sonata, which is the most thrilling and exciting interpretation I have ever heard of this work.

If you grabbed someone and made them listen to and describe what they were hearing without telling them what it is, they might answer, \\"An amazing virtuoso pianist has kindly condescended to give a recital in a tuberculosis clinic.\\" This CD was still worth it to me because of my love of Richter and the 6th sonata, but a more casual fan might not think so. For what it's worth, the sound on the other recordings on this CD is considerably better--no coughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best volume","review":"I bought this for a NYE party after seeing it in a Honolulu bar several times.

Further, I'm a compulsive biography reader and would have been mystified by this life story if the unpleasant and sordid parts had been omitted. I was especially interested in the picture Milford drew of Millay's genious and how it manifested. It was also fascinating to read how the husband cared for her and seemed to understand what she needed to keep her talent alive. Alcohol and drug addiction have plagued many writers and artists of her generation and she was no exception. I think it's wise to remember that society knew very little about these illnesses then; once in their grip, Millay was probably doomed because she would have had little help available to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, beautiful Edna","review":"If you actually read this book, and devote all of your attention to it as you read, you will find it is totally, incredibly good.

This is one book I will be very sad to finish. The one problem for me was that the book was written with the help of Norma Millay, Vincent's sister, and I think she still withheld a lot of letters and photos and it's a shame we can't see it all.

Why the apparent indifference (other than in her poetry) to spiritual questions? Etc.Millay's charm is evident in her letters and her talent is illustrated by the poetry that is quoted. But Milford never seems interested in asking why this woman behaved so unconventionally for her time and her class. Even when Millay mentions her \\"philsophy\\" Milford doesn't bother to discuss what that philosophy was and how it was revealed in her poetry and/or other writing.As other reviewers have noted -- the book documents a lot of her sexual behavior -- but never tries to provide shed any light on the sources of that behavior.

In March 2009, a NC Judge even ruled that a woman could not homeschool her children based on the mother's involvement with this author and his church.

'The Bible' then takes over and with three times as many pages goes into a great deal more detail on the wealth of features that are contained in the new version of AutoCAD.'For Dummies' is written more as a tutorial. It is of the do this and then do that variety. 'The Bible' is more of a reference book where you tend to look up what you want to do and get specific information.You might consider that 'For Dummies' is the first few pages of 'The Bible' but expanded into a full book format.

This movie was so bad (how bad was it Bob???) it gets the Holy Cow award for badness. The protagonists (or should I say, hedonists) are completely unsympathetic--and completely boneheaded for taking their eyes off of a suspicious character they pick up from the sea who proceeds to regain consciousness in the middle of the night, go completely coo-coo and run the yacht aground. And if this doesn't make you say Holy Cow, just you watch those last 30 minutes of the film.

In terms of presenting the introductory information I think the authors have done a great job. I admire the excellent design layout and the numerous visuals.

Just as on any of Loreena McKennitt's albums, her lovely vocals and gorgeous instruments make the CD a listening joy and pleasure beyond that of many other artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parallel dreams","review":"There is just something about Loreena Mckennitt's music that always touches the heart- I enjoyed this compilation of songs just as much, or more as the previous cd's I bought of this musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as her others (AWESOME!)","review":"I bought Mask & Mirror, The Visit, and Book of Secrets all at once, and was content with those for a while. After about two months, I looked up Parallel Dreams and listened to the music samples. Standing Stones was so good, I rushed out and bought it imidiatly... I'm glad I did! I love it. I find Standing Stones, Annachie Gordon, Dickens' Dublin, and The Fire Dance to be the best songs, but I like them all. This is a must for LM fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring To Be Different","review":"There are two songs in here that I still rank among my McKennitt favorites, and I have all her CDs. These songs demonstrate how Loreena is unafraid of new territory, to try something a little different. In both cases here, she comes across superbly with unforgettable numbers.The most different, of course, is \\"Dickens' Dublin\\" in which she alternates singing about a homeless person while a young Irish girl narrates her unique look at the birth of Christ. This might be the most interesting \\"Christmas song\\" I've come across.Then there is \\"Ancient Pines,\\" perhaps the greatest example ever of McKennit's clear and haunting voice. There are no words, just her voice. It is one of the \\"prettiest\\" songs I've ever heard. Who needs vocals when you can sing like this?These two songs alone, along with Celtic favorites like \\"Annachie Gordon,\\" make this a CD to treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deam a Parallel Dream","review":"Parallel Dreams by Loreena McKennitt is another exceptional piece of her work for those her enjoy her style, and celtic flair. I have found pieces that I use to warm up with and cool down to when I dance. I have even found some music that I use when I bellydance. Quite a different take on the dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some outstanding songs and some I didnt care for....","review":"I enjoy Loreena McKennit's cds and have everyone but the Winter one. Samain Night and Moon Cradle are wonderful songs giving that sense of mystical storytelling. Huron \\"Beltane\\" Fire Dance is a wonderful song to dance to as well as meditate to!! Annachie Gordon is another song, such as \\"The Bonny Swans\\", in which it tells a tale. My favorite song of all (besides the fire one) is Standing Stones. Once again it is another storytelling song, but she gives it a very ghosty, errie feeling that will send chills down your spine!! I agree that Dicken's Dublin seems as though it is struggling to work between the childs voice and the music. Overall, this is definately a cd worth having!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Celtic joy!","review":"I am a longtime fan of McKennit, and I found that this was her finest album of all. It is surely the most Celtic of her albums--the instrumental arrangements were a thrill to behold! A beautiful mixture of soft, haunting ballads (Samhain Night, Moon Cradle, Ancient Pines, Breaking the Silence), blissful tear-jerkers(Dicken's Dublin, Annachie Gordon), and fantastic upbeat Celtic-flavoured 'dances' (Huron Beltane Fire Dance,Standing Stones), it will be a great addition to any Celtic music collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loreena at her best!","review":"I have all of Loreena McKennitt's albums and I would rate this one the best. Although \\"The Visit\\" is a close second, this album has quite a few unique musical features (I am not a \\"musician\\" as such but to me some of the sounds and styles seem unique). It has thus scored a permanent place within the Cd-rack in my car. There are three tracks which I just adore (The Huron Fire Dance, Annachie Gordon and Dickens' Dublin). I enjoy music with a \\"Celtic\\" flavour and if you are into that sort of thing, then this album is a must for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really can't give an honest opinion because the whole cd was sratched from start to finish","review":"Well I gave it a rating just so I could post my review. I know I could have returned it but its just such a big hassle.I guess I could go to my account and find out who the sender was. Then I have to talk to the knucklehead people who sent out a CD in such HORRIBLE condition and I said any company who would send out such a product would just be a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute and soft","review":"I was afraid that these wouldn't look as good in person, but they are super cute and very soft. I got them as much as decoration as anything (my son's nursery is Neverland...Peter Pan), but my son seems to enjoy them. My only complaint is that they aren't really age appropriate for my baby (not yet 1 year old) and I'm afraid to leave it in the crib to cuddle because of it (he still bites his blankets and stuffed animals)...I can't really fault the product for that though."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding Practical Resource","review":"This book is an extremely helpful resource for anyone interested in establishing or working for a new business.I made practical use of several chapters within days of reading them.Its easy-to-read style does not compromise useful depth.I highly recommend it to anybody starting, thinking of starting, or considering working for a new enterprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"THIS is the information i've been struggling to find in so many different places.

Judy Davis and Jamey Sheridan played their parts with great enthusiasm. Lauren Hewett, a fine young actress who played the part of Lara convincingly.

They produce reasonable, but not exceptional-quality prints when they are new (there is faint visible banding, text is clear but not razor-sharp, photos are passable, but the color is a bit weak and details aren't as sharp as the original file). The real problem, though, is that the cartridges fail quickly. We print about every week or two, and after only a few uses, the printouts become faded and banded. No amount of printer-head cleaning and test-page printing solves the problem, even though ink levels are well above half. With all the cartridges we've used, the problem continues to get worse until there is almost no ink at all being deposited on the paper. We use standard, average-quality, white paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost expire!!","review":"It is a brand new item but it is only good for 2 month for the expire.

Ensuing is a tale of love, friendship, deceit, and heroism with classic scenes and lines that will warm your heart.I really enjoyed this movie. There were times when it felt a bit slow, but Mary's lines are so off the wall it kept me watching.

Her character is not so far off the mark as some might allude to... I understand her frank verbosity as a break from normalcy, as well as a bridge away from intimacy. There are people out there that use words as a way to fill the spaces... many, unfortunately \\"diagnosed\\" with aspergers syndrome. Bullock's portrayal as a woman so enthused with love, yet so removed from social norms, isn't that far fetched. Many of us have no idea what to do, and when to do it when it comes to matters of the heart. Understandably, her character is perhaps considered as eccentric in comparison to most, however that is what makes this movie so fun loving. Her character has a certain naivety that many people lose when adapting to quote, un-quote, social norms. The best part of it is that the end focuses on real true love, with herself, which is so much more important than landing the guy.I think it is definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Razzy Award...

So, I'm not going to provide a synopsis of the movie here (I don't understand why people do that). Here is what appealed to me. Sandra embodied this character wonderfully. An argument can be made that this was a typical movie for her, but not a typical character. I thought this movie was quite charming and entertaining. She definitely makes the movie for me. It kept my interest and there were some definite laugh-out-loud scenes. Mostly, I enjoyed watching Sandra play this character... someone who may, at first, seem strange, nerdy, ditzy, but is just someone very real without any pretense whatsoever. Well, the laugh-out-loud scenes were a high point too. So, before the razzie this was a 3.5 star rating for me... after the razzie, a solid 4 stars.

(IMO)Steve is likeable, kind of, but yeah.Blah.Worth it for sandra bullock or if you like the guy who plays steve but a bit of a fail as a romantic comedy in my opinion overall.

Sandra Bullock was terrific as a talkative crossword puzzler writer and Thomas Haden Church was great as the self-centered news anchor.

I am all for comedy but was she trying to make fun of a woman with mental problems? Her role character was simply to hard to accept and the people surrounding her equally hard to buy.

All About Steve is not one of them. It's simply awful from beginning to end. Bullock's portrayal of a neurotic crossword puzzle author is painfully obnoxious. There's really nothing redeeming about the character she plays. We're avid movie watchers, and we rarely encounter a movie that loses our attention to the point of either stopping the movie or engaging in other activities while watching.

Mary has a lot to offer the world, the world just needs to accept her as she is. And this movie has a lot to offer, if only the critics could see past their own egos. How anyone could or would not find amusement and entertainment in this movie is beyond me. To those so-called Critics who razzed Sandra for her portrayal of Mary a quadruple Raspberry right back at you.I definitely have a new found respect for Sandra Bullock's excellent acting skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny!!!","review":"I gave this to my parents as a Christmas present, and we all thought it was hilarious!

Every time Mary gets close, Steve tells her that he doesn't want her, but she still doesn't believe him.

I once had very thick hair, but it has been thinning on top for the past year. It started about a month after I began using this product. I assumed it was another bout of telogen effluvium (something I experienced after losing 50 pounds), but it had continually gotten worse. I did some research, and discovered that St. John's Wort has been shown to cause hair loss. Sadly, my hair is an absolute mess compared to what it used to be.

The ghost of Achilles had appeared and demanded a sacrifice over his tomb before the Greeks can set sail for home. They vote to sacrifice Polyxena, Hecuba's young daughter, despite the tears and entreaties of Hecuba. After Polyxena's noble death, Hecuba learns that her last child Polydorus had been murdered by the King of Thrace, Polymestor, to whom Polydorus had been sent for safe keeping. This finally drives Hecuba mad and she seeks vengence for Polydorus's death.

It runs quietly and smoothly. The pump seems solid and well made, and the on/off switch right on the side is a nice feature. I had no trouble priming the pump. I agree with the reviewer who said if you are having trouble priming the pump you probably don't understand how to prime a pump correctly.

I've also devoted a lot of time to the study of Relativity, in all it's mathematical splendor, and believe I've reached a level of a competent 1st year Physics grad student.With regard to this book: Mr. Gibilisco explains things better than he understands them, and this book was obviously not proofed by a competent Physicist.

If you aren't going to go further in this subject, his errors probably won't hurt anything, but if you are still deciding which book to buy... keep on looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion unlimited","review":"This book is sadly misguided. The author not only does not understand relativity, but actually promulgates common misunderstandings as fact. For example: he says that even mathematically defined points, such as the point of intersection of moving straight lines, cannot exceed the speed of light. They can. Even worse, he says that there is no such thing as simultaneity in a distributed frame of reference. There is. He says the lack of simultaneity is due to the propagation delay of light. It is not. All these things are covered in any introductory text on Special Relativity. Reading this book will only mislead you. It was clearly never reviewed by a relativity physicist.

Fortunately, the orchestra under Carl St. Clair plays very well and most singers, particularly the three leads, are very good (many of the secondary singers are not up to par).

Not only that, it doesn't even bother to use the equations in the same format that NCEES provides them. I found the key to passing the FE was being intimately familiar with NCEES reference material, so that formulas can be QUICKLY located on exam day. This book does not facilitate the process.

Drivel passing as insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Balanced Report","review":"Jeff Greenfield has written a sobering, reflective, and politically neutral account of the recent Presidential election. Starting with the political campaigns, the general election, and the virtual dead heat in Florida, Jeff offers an in-depth review of the strategies and counter-strategies employed by the candidates and their party committees. What worked, what didn't, from the stump to the dabates, including the chaos that followed in the vote count. The author also gives us an inside look at the networks' failed machinery and chaos which added to the confusion and flip flop of who won Florida. This is a must read for those who follow politics and the media (who in turn follow the candidates). Jeff holds nothing back in the critical assessment of his network, the voting process in Florida, and the choosing and marketing of the candidates themselves. I read this book in two sittings and was fascinated by our political process. You will be too."},{"rating":"2","title":"very relevant, wonderfully funny, full of great insights","review":"great fun to be reading this book at the start of the 2004 campaign -- so many of its insights about the personalities, the parties, the processes that shaped the 2000 election seem as pertinent today as they did when first written a few years ago. Greenfield is a peerless writer with extraodinarily dry wit and a priceless ability to find just the right concise anecdote to summarize what others might take long chapters to chronicle. He appers even-handed -- a partisan for only intelligence and common sense, in his coverage of the respective campaigns, election night, and the 37-day aftermath. No one interested in politics will fail to find enlightenment and entertainment in this charming, timeless volume. Although I have become addicted to the 'blogosphere' and rarely look to tv for news and commentary, Jeff Greenfield's appearances on the tube would provide a rare excuse for me to turn on the tv again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining look at the election","review":"Greenfield writes very well and uses humour to make good points. He provides some sound insights from the point of view of the media on the inside.About the only place where I thought he went astray was the lengthy and detailed (tortourous?) passage on how the moon and stars lined up and led to the bad calls on Florida. Besides using this explanation as a \\"devil made us do it\\" defense; he also points out that all of the available studies indicate that media calls do not influence subsequent voter action. Greenfield is much too intelligent to believe either of these points.Overall, well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"An very nearly Excellent Resource","review":"I highly recommend this if you are serious about learning the language -- or one of the other languages in the series.The series is expensive since it must be ordered-shipped from Europe. -MINUS ONE STARCaveat: The Arabic version uses not only transliteration but one of the WORST transliteration schemes ever devised (e.g., treating d-D, h-H, t-T, ain-hemza, th-TH, s-S as one letter each).

Excellent beginners board.","review":"This is a decent little Go board, but it isn't anything special. The board is durably constructed, but the painted on lines may eventually fade over time if the board is used extensively. The trays on either side are adequate for holding the pieces (which were included with the board).My only real complaint about this board is the pieces are functional but they are pretty cheap, but for the price I really shouldn't be complaining. It would have been nice if the trays had latches to keep them shut during transport.The true Go aficionado will probably turn his/her nose down at this product (some Go boards are nothing short of being considered works of art), but if you are a casual player or are just starting the hobby this is an excellent buy to get you started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I purchased this GO board with high hopes, but when I opened it I immediately decided I needed to return it.I found that the picture of the board is misleading. It does not clearly show that the top of the board is a 1/8\\" applied top. Instead the pictures make the board look solid. Ok, that in itself was not a deal breaker.The worst part was that a significant number of the lines on the board were smudged. Not just a few, but most. This factor alone made the board ugly, while a GO board needs to be beautiful and pleasing to the eye. Also, all four corners of the top were slightly damaged.I was very disappointed.The good thing is that Amazon makes the return process extremely easy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsuitable","review":"A go board that is unusable is not a good deal at any price.First of all, the merchants clearly don't care about the game. The stones should be placed on the lines, not the spaces in between as in the photo. This shows a complete lack of clue about the game of GO. A major clue that you don't want this.Second, Go stones for a board of this size are hard to use over the course of a long game. Kids will give up in frustration. I have several go-bans at this size, and I can attest they are unsuitable for over the board play.You can buy a roll-up board and stones kit with regulation 8mm stones for about this same price. Your fingers will thank you. Kids will actually use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Board","review":"One thing everyone should know before buying this board is the is is SMALLER than a normal board. It follows that the board will have smaller pieces so buying fancier pieces to replace the plastic ones will be a waste of money. The dimensions are in the description. The sliding drawers do not have any type of seal, but if you absolutely need one, I'm sure your local hobby shop or hardware store will have something to fix that. With that being said, I really like this board. I play for fun and have little money for extra things like this so this works well. It is easy to transport in its box. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I had no problem with lines rubbing off during shipping. Mine came in a larger box with many plastic air bags for cushioning and had no damage what so ever. The durability rating has no basis as I have yet to do anything damaging to it. From how it feels, dropping the board from waist height could possibly break it. I, however, do not plan on testing my theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This Go set (aka Weiqi) is of rather poor quality. The wood used is low-quality, which results in a lot of imperfections on the surface. The drawers are small and wiggle a lot and cannot be opened or closed easily due to poor construction. The chess pieces are a joke, really small and so flat on both sides that they're difficult to pick up! The single instruction sheet also erroneously states the game originated in Japan (it actually originated in China at least 3,000 years ago). I cannot recommend this set. You might have better luck at a local sporting goods or educational goods store."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Deals Ever","review":"They must be selling this GO board and stones at a loss to get people interested in the game.

Not here -- the bookend movements are as maniacal, pulsing and driving as the best of John Coltrane or Prokofiev.

It produces large files that stand a more than even chance of being unreadable by software 10+ years down the road. Exporting to a .jpg does appear to recompress the image and strip off non-viewable information text that some programs (and cameras) append to the file that better describe the photo.

You can add special effects to your photos as well as changing the background, creating cards and calendars, and exporting them into different formats.

It can take JPEG (and many other file formats) as input, but then saves in the photodeluxe format, which was 20X larger than JPEG format.

There was an export option to JPEG but I believe this was recompressing the picture, which can not be good for image quality.Also could not change where the program wanted to store pictures. I want to put pictures in a subfolder under my documents so I can do easier backups. But Photodeluxe doesn't have an option (that I could find) for using a directory other than the default of the program directory.Finally, the tools provided get to be a little tedious.

The vacuum itself works well, but the brush roll has to be replaced every 6 months to a year. We went to a vacuum store and spoke with a man about it and he said it's typical of this model. The first two brush rolls we replaced just stopped spinning and wouldn't turn at all, even by hand. The third started making a loud vibration and eventually melted the side of the brush roll completely. Replacing it is at least $20 each time. They also recommend replacing the belt when you replace the brush roll, since it stretches the belt a bit when you take the brush roll on and off.Also the turbo brush didn't work for me. It's supposed to spin automatically when you use it with the hose, but the brush roll on it would only spin intermittently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of it breaking","review":"This vacuum does a really good job of picking up dust and pet hair but the rollerbrush is garbage.

As such, you spend as much time reading about policing and customs duty as maneuvering against the French along the Main. Soldiers stationed in Germany back \\"in the day\\" will be familiar with some of the locales. I enjoyed the book as a casual read, but am not likely to purchase the rest of the series.

In the meantime, I went to the local Buy Buy Baby to test drive last year's Ingelsina Swift, which they have on sale right now. I really liked the Swift, but still hoped I would like the Zooper Salsa when it showed it. It is an OK stroller, but it just didn't measure up after seeing the Swift. Smaller seat, strange removable seat padding, recline is done by unsnapping a few snaps near the hood and is hardly worth doing anyway and a it has a flimsy mesh basket.

The study of witchcraft persecutions has very little to do with black magic or demoic arts as this video does point out. On the whole the video is a lesson in unintentional or intentional propaganda. It is hard to tell how the authors of this tape were able to gain the evidence to back up their claims. The number of people they cite as being executed seems inflated and inaccurate. Buy the book \\"Witches and Neighbors\\". This is a scholarly account of the hunts and puts them into perspective.

You can add text description boxes but have no control over the font or sizing -- and they don't resize either.We highlighted our specific region but the software doesn't let you print just that region (called 'territory.) We searched the help files and their word 'territory' is not even listed.You cannot save your map graphics in any standard graphics format, e.g. JPEG, PDF or ai.

It will only print what you see on your screen. If you want to print your whole map, you literally have to save your screen view into a graphic file, scroll to the next area, save it as well and repeat until you have saved your entire territory.

This is complex and adds an unnecessary step to the process if you like to print blank checks then fill them out. You have to load your MICR toner EVERY time you print checks.

The music is rich and textured with incredible harmonies and consuming sounds of a variety of elements. \\"Lavinia\\" is the richest of these songs, leading the listener into a pleasing earful of piano, guitar, and background voices.

Pre-Rockford TV heroes typically swaggered and talked tough and never failed. Supporting characters were shallow \\"yes men/women\\" who were present to make their hero look good. Rockford, however, is surrounded by much more richly drawn and quirky characters--some true and loyal, all of them very human and many with questionable ethics and hidden agendas. Human weakness is often an important part of the plot and, occasionally, our hero fails. Clients lie, don't pay their bill and sometimes don't appreciate Jim's (clever and fruitful) efforts. In other words, Jiim's life can be just a little bit like ours--and we relate to him because of it.

It is clearer in this book that he is just smearing psychotherapy than in the former book, where his smears are better hidden amongst erudite references to twentieth-century philosophy and other confusing stuff. That's why this book, although better written, isn't as brilliant as the former, in my opinion. Psychotherapy has posed an enormous threat to people who don't want their ego-compensations exposed. The power of the backlash against the discoveries of Freud should not be underestimated, and this would account for the enormous market for the works of Thomas Szasz, which are just pure anti-psych propaganda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the time to listen to these tunes.","review":"I was looking for music to send to a friend who is in the hospital having a bone marrow transplant.

You'll be disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promised source code not available","review":"The book is well written and succinct. Unfortunately, as of August 5th, 2000, neither the publisher nor the author have seen fit to provide the source code that was promised in the preface to the book.The source code link at the publishers, SAMS, points to the source code for another book by the same author. I emailed them about this about three weeks ago, but they haven't bothered to get back to me or to fix the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"all code no explanation","review":"I only skimmed the book but the impression I was left with was, that the book is all code and no overview explanation. No indepth details just a bit of how to handle forms, how to send a mail with javamail, how to get startet on JDBC - stuff you easily can extract from the Java API.All the interesting stuff as how to structure taglibs, servlets etc. was by far left out (I can't recollect ever seeing anything about taglibs at all in the \\"book\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"I couldn't wait to try out the three mile workout as soon as it arrived in the mail today. There are lots of new moves and Leslie, as always, is a great instructor and makes the time go by quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this workout","review":"This workout combines low and high impact moves at a brisk but manageable pace. It can be broken down into 1, 2 , or three miles per workout.. It also combines toning/sculpting while you walk. Anyone of any age can do this! the beat is easy to follow with the music.It was worth the purchase price. It is so much fun it does not even feel like exercising. I look forward to walking with Leslie. I have also lost weight without even trying! I would recommend this to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally New Moves","review":"I have numerous Leslie DVD's. Finally one with new moves. This will entertain me for a while. This finally mixes it up a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong 3 Mile Walk With Strength Training","review":"Leslie's newest DVD is a nice strong 3 mile walk. The workout incorporates some new moves and Leslie incorporates the resistance band (included with the DVD) during miles 2 and 3 to provide strength training. There are enough new moves to make the miles go by quickly and Leslie incorporates more arm movements with the walking to keep your heart rate up. The resistance band work is also done while still walking so that you don't cool down too much while doing the strength training. I liked the pace of this workout --Miles 1 and 3 are 14 minutes each, while Mile 2 comes in at 12 minutes. A short cool down and stretch finishes off the workout. Leslie does miles 1 and 2 with a group and is alone for the last mile. The music isn't too exciting but the set is nice and light. Overall, a nice addition to add some variety to my walking workout library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Mega Miles -- a big disappointment!","review":"I own almost every walking DVD that Leslie Sansone has sold and she missed it on this one!! You can't hear the music, therefore you can't even hear the beat to walk to! She changes moves so quickly that you miss the next moves and her own steps were off quite a few times. This DVD was a big disappointment for me because I am a HUGE fan of Leslie's and this is the only DVD that was a waste of money for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed with 3 Mega Miles","review":"First, I have been disappointed in most of Leslie's newer workouts. I feel like she is forgetting her core fan base and pushing them aside while trying to cater to the younger, already fit crowd. I liked seeing a variety of ages, body types, and fitness levels, not a group of young, fit, overenthusiastic girls with a token man or overweight person. The new workouts are just too \\"bouncy\\" for me (and I love the boosted jogging in earlier DVDs) but can't do the bouncing without severe pain. More importantly, the music is sooo low that you can't hear it but Leslie is soooo loud that you can't turn it up.I don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I was excited to see a new WATP, but this one misses big time. The moves are too quick. The cast is so-so. Do not buy this if you enjoy Leslie's WATP DVD's because it is not like the others. Would be OK for a serious exercise routine, not for walking. Have an love many of her other DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Workout!","review":"I have at least a dozen of Leslie's DVDs and use them several times a week. I bought this one because it has the \\"stretchy band\\" (although she just calls it the band this time around). I did note that the band is thicker, as reviewer K. Richardson stated, and so far I've been using one of my other bands -- will work up to the thicker band.There are new moves I've never seen before both with and without the band. You get a good workout with a lot of variety and an upbeat group. As always, she provides alternatives for more advanced/higher-impact moves.This may become my favorite stretchy band video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go leslie","review":"she keeps you motivated, her talking makes the workout go by fast which is Great:) always been a fan:) the only thing I wish she would change up the basics.but she's a great instructor . Her dvds great for begginers also"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"In my oppinion, this is by far the best album of the punk era. Every song pulses with such intense energy, you will feel your blood start to boil with the frenzy. Forget about Damaged. Chavo was 100 times the singer that Rollins was, and the sound of this album is much better. If you don't own this album, you can't call yourself punk!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EP that (punk) rocks","review":"Jealous Again is an EP that contains only five songs, all of which are under two minutes. Vocals are provided by Chavo Pederast. All of the songs are very short with a fast tempo. Typical punk-like songs. The best songs are Jealous Again, White Minority, No Values and You Bet We've Got Something Against You!This is an extremely short record, even for an EP, but is nonetheless entertaining. My copy of this EP was included on my Damaged CD. It's a Damaged/Jealous Again combo. I don't think it's available in this form anymore, although I believe this EP is available on the album The First Four Years.

I was very disappointed with the lack of color pictures. There were a few but not nearly enough. Still I am glad I bought the book. I can learn a lot from it. The author is as enthusiastic about the Australian Shepherd dog breed as I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE book on Australian shepherds","review":"If you want to know anything about Aussies, this is it. There are numerous books out there, but Mrs. Hartnagle-Taylor's is the book to have. While it is a little pricey, it contains everything you'll need. Grooming tips, first-aid, training, genetics, disease information, aussie specifics, chapters on aging, children, if you want to know it, AAA can tell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best complete Australian Shepherd book ever written.","review":"I've read a number of books regarding the Australian Shepherd, but this is the one and only book the covers the Aussie from A to Z. Their newest addition even includes a section on the smaller aussie that many people have been breeding for over 50 years. Thank you, for not ignoring these wonderful dogs of all sizes. It's about time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner!","review":"This is the second book I've ordered for my father based on the reviews, and I have another winner!

It's invaluable."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Information","review":"I was disappointed to see a foundation Aussie enthusiast separate this breed into miniatures, standards, and giants. What??????? No such thing as the Aussie breed standard has no size disqualification and no \\"varieties\\". Very misleading to someone trying to learn about the breed. Thank goodness I know better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sticks to breed specifics; want more color photos","review":"This book was recommended highly, and I was not disappointed! The information coverage is all that I expected and more. So many dog books digress into information that applies to all dogs, but this one sticks to breed specifics.There is only one thing I would improve in future editions: more photos in color. However, knowing that many of the historical photos were originally in black & white, I would not edit them out... the idea is merely to add more full-color recent photos, especially showing the full range of Aussie activities, trials, games, etc. One can never see too many beautiful Aussies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Aussie Book I've Read","review":"This is the most complete book on Australian Shepherds I have ever read. Anyone thinking about getting an Aussie needs to read this book and keep it for reference before purchasing the animal. Anyone already owning an Aussie should read it to learn more about the breed and how to care for their dog. I bought two other Aussie books in the same order. Big mistake. This one was all I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"All About Aussie; The Australian Shepherd from A to Z","review":"I am very pleased with the book.

This book covers it all, from breeding to when to begin training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck with Support!!!","review":"I used to think this software was great...then I updated my OS to Windows XP, and now it crashes constantly. Oh well, I guess that's to be expected. But what I didn't expect was the complete lack of support. Sierra's site doesn't have any mention of Complete Home, or of Home Architect Version 3 or higher. It looks like they abandoned their site five years ago. There are still support files that talk about Windows 3.1, and no mention of W95, W98, NT, ME or XP. So, I can't recommend this product at all. As far as I'm concerned they abandoned me and I'll have to buy another product from a different company... a company that is not named Sierra."},{"rating":"1","title":"constantly crashes on windows XP","review":"Like another reviewer, I also liked this product, especially its ease of use, and the speed with which you could change your floorplan. But when I got an XP it crashed all the time. To add to the frustration, there is no support from their website for this product. I couldn't even find the product on the site. So I can only recommend it if you have an, apparently older computer. It worked fine using windows 98, but got slower and slower as my plans got more complicated. When I went to windows XP which I though would help, it became useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Brothers Capone","review":"This one of the better mob movies I think because it shows the other side of the coin. One of the Capone brothers didn't want to be seen in the same light as his mobster brothers so he runs away to the midwest and takes on an alias and becomes a federal marshall. This movie tells the story of how he went up against Al Capone (his brother) in the days of prohibition and how his brother tried to have him killed because he didn't realize who he was. This movie was based on a true story, and is one of my favorite movies of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Capone","review":"I purchased this dvd awhile ago to add to my rather large collection of Mafia movies. Although Capone did have a brother who in real life died at the end of a gun for his criminal activities he did not have one who was a US Marshall. Al kept his siblings out of the lime light except for the one brother who was just as involved as he was. I recalled his sister saying after Al's death that he was a good man and he wasn't the man that the media made him out to be ( i guess she was in denial). I found this dvd a rather interesting whatif.

He displays a gutbucket, bar room blues wail on \\"Bolo Blues\\", a boppish flair on \\"Crash Program\\", and a soulful vibrato on the slow numbers \\"I've Got A Right To Cry\\" and \\"Yesterdays\\". Backed by Joe Zawinul on piano, Tommy Potter on bass, and Clarence Johnston on drums, Forrest cuts a straightahead blowing session that is a pleasant mix of soulful slow numbers and uptempo material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost nails it","review":"This is a great album. The only flaws it has, if you could call them that, is that it stays too close to the original \\"OK Computer\\". There are a lot of points in which they could have deviated a bit more into Jamaican territories than to go with the soul/R&B/rock feel that this album is laced with. But the production is fantastic and the performances are very tight, as expected out of this crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"One of the greatest cover albums ever!!!....tough it is raggae music artists sucessfully left radioheads spirits in the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite cover album","review":"Every Easy Star All-Stars album astounds me. Reggae is always a good genre, but when you take the best of reggae and use it to re-create already amazing songs, you can't go wrong. Out of all the Easy Star All-Stars albums, this one is my favorite. In this album, just as in all their others, I prefer the Easy Star All-Stars version to the original. I would love a chance to see them live. Check out their tour dates now and see them for yourself - I'm going to see them at Hangout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Like many other people, I really liked Dub Side of the Moon. Besides being a refreshing take on the Floyd classic, the album was simply packed with great dub - throbbing baselines, massive amounts of reverb, cracking snare hits, smoky grooves.So why does Radiodread disappoint so much? First of all, we should make one thing straight - this isn't a \\"re-imagining\\" of anything. It's a note-for-note cover of OK Computer with guitar chords on 2 + 4 and no h's pronounced - and that's about all that's different. What made Dub Side so great was where it took the material in new directions - the jungle breakbeat on \\"On the Run,\\" the tricked-out dub rendition of \\"Great Gig,\\" the toast rap in the middle of \\"Money.\\" None of that can be found here. Instead, we're left with straight-ahead clones of familiar songs that don't have nearly the depth and replayability that Dub Side does. It's a novelty record with a heaping portion of wasted potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone Will LIKE This... Anyone.","review":"Damn, why are you guys so amazing??? I will be honest.. I usually hate covers; these are barely covers... Sure, they take the lyrics and the basic tune, but that's as far as it goes. The dub background is completely unique; a creative endeavor only Easy Star All Stars could tackle. I mean, how perfect is this?? And what great choices of albums to cover in dub style; Pink Floyd, Radiohead... man, these guys know music! The layering of instruments, the sound effects, reverb, bass.. incredible. Easy Star All Stars is brilliant. I wonder which album they will go for next..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what tributes can","review":"Boy, this really nails it. It's impossible not to judge it in relation to the original album, and of course some of the hard work of songwriting was done for them (hence 4 stars), but this does everything cover/tribute albums can, staying faithful to the mood and content of the original works while giving PLENTY of reggae to them. The songs seem like they could have been reggae to begin with, and that's a big compliment.Electioneering, in particular, gave me goosebumps. Good stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as \\"Dub Side of the Moon\\"","review":"After hearing \\"Dub Side of the Moon\\" I had great hopes for this as well.Alas, it left me disappointed.

I cannot imagine anyone enjoying major Bon Jovi rock numbers played on spanish guitar.

It's a series of nature footage shot around Oregon in no particular order. It's NOT a travel-log of what Oregon has to offer. There is no narration; mostly music with beautiful scenes of some of Oregon's great outdoors. It does show the occasional requisite shots of Crater Lake, Mt. Hood, and Haceta Head Lighthouse, but most of this video is of sweeping vistas of mountains and plains. There is a lot of wind noise in the soundtrack making Oregon seem like a windswept, desolate state. SOME of the footage is crystal clear, but there is a fair amount of footage that is so unclear that it looks like it was filmed with a consumer type camcorder. Lots of pixilation in certain shots. I would have expected better quality from PBS. It was fun to watch once, but I don't think I would send it to any of my out of state friends to entice them to come visit.

Over 3 hours of excruciating boredom. The slowest moving movie I've ever seen. If this movie is supposed to be about the meaning of life, any kind of life, good or bad, then it teaches me nothing except the fact that people like to look at each other and stare for long periods of time without saying anything meaningful. Stanley Kubrick, you should be embarrassed. If you want to see a good Kubrick film, watch Dr. Stangelove."},{"rating":"2","title":"PREETY AS A PICTURE","review":"Stanley Kubricks's long picturesque saga of an Irish rogue in 18th Century Europe is certainly the most entertaining costume drama ever made. Each frame of the film is filled with visual splendor as meticulous as a classic painting. Panoramic battle scenes and richly detailed costume and set designs come alive as from an artist's palette. Ryan O'Neal's bogus Irish accent is easily forgiven as he seems merely a prop in the center of Kubrick's vision of European aristocracy in conflict with an Irishman's independence. The pistol dueling scenes are outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly... very good.","review":"Although a die-hard fan of Stanley Kubrick cinema, I was a little worried about 'Barry Lyndon'. I had read various reviews that complained about the length and the slow pace. Add that to my general dislike of period pieces, and its easy to see why 'Barry Lyndon' was intimidating.Thankfully, my fears were unfounded. While the 3 hour running time is staggering when read, I was pleased by how smoothly and swiftly the time passed while watching the film. It felt like Tape 1 was done in 5 minutes.The imagery in the film is truly beautiful - but if you've seen any other Kubrick film, this is a given.All in all, I'd say this is a great film with great performances by a great Director that pleasantly surpised me. Certainly not for everyone, but art-film fans will find plenty to rave about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This is a brilliant film misunderstood by those who wanted it to be something else. Kubrick's visual style is magnificient, as always. There are many bits of Kubrick's dark sense of humor, particualrly in the opening dueling sequence. One theme that seems to be pervasive: Man is often ugly, but what he creates is often beautiful. I miss him alreadyTony Tsendeas"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a question that might stump Einstein...","review":"They managed to 16x9 enhance 2 full frame films of Kubrick- yet 2 films shot 1:66 were not enhanced- and not included in a KUBRICK MASTERPIECE BOX!-LOLITA and BARRY LYNDON-LYNDON would have been given a little bit more rez, and lose that awful square TV shape.

I have no idea how much, if any, the novel differs from the film but the film is just beautiful, and the blu-ray is so much better than the standard issue dvd I bought years ago. This is the way I remember it when it was in the theater in what? 1976? It is so sharp and clear and there are no black bars top, bottom, or sides of the screen. I don't know about aspect ratios or any of that, but I have a widescreen tv and it fills the screen completely.I love the narration, and the lovely landscapes are indeed like paintings. Terrific music. I would highly recommend adding this to your collection. I go back and forth between this and The Godfather for my favorite film, somedays it's one, somedays it's the other and somedays it's a tie."},{"rating":"1","title":"LET THE BUYER BEWARE","review":"By reading the other reviews, I appear not to be the first consumer who fell prey to the new box cover. Despite the new artwork that says \\"Newly Restored and Remastered\\", this is the same master as the previous versions. I had previously purchased the earlier version (letterboxed and poor quality). I had been waiting for a newly mastered version, and when I saw this new artwork (and that all of the other Warner Kubrick titles had been remastered for enhanced 16X9 viewing), I figured that BARRY LYNDON had also been. My big mistake and my great disappointment. So much for truth in packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic period film","review":"Watching this movie was like going back in time 230 years. Kubrick's cinematography is superb; his use of natural lighting and stunningly beautiful European settings are quite impressive. Critics of the film will invariably point out the flatness of the characters, slow pace of the film, and the length (3 hours). There is some truth to these criticisms, but the total experience is well worth the investment of time. There are so many mediocre films put out nowadays, you might as well watch something intelligent, well-made, and historically instructive versus the same predictable movie template that is made 10 times per year. Watching this film feels like reading a great classic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ENHANCED> FIRST CUSTOMER COMMENT WAS WRONG","review":"Bought this dvd based on a review below which stated the dvd will be 16 x 9 enhanced.

No real special features, but at least it's not one of those crappy snap cases.Anyway, cinematography is A+, as well as the acting. This is one of the greater films from Stanley Kubrick because of its incredible story telling. It's long, but it's all good content. Watch this if you wanna see somethin' good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece rendered with horrible quality BluRay","review":"Since this release of Kubrick's masterpiece was so recent, I expected that the poor quality of earlier releases on DVD would have been addressed. After all, who at the studios would in their right minds release a BluRay of this timeless and visually fantastic work with poor quality?Well, my trust in the good sense (and art appreciation) of the studios was terribly misplaced. The BluRay quality of this release (Amazon Exclusive - 11 May 2011) is atrocious! It looks more like a VHS version transferred directly to BluRay. It is not even DVD quality! Why bother?? It is an insult to Kubrick and his meticulous filmmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what WE are expecting!","review":"Oh, C'mon! We don't deserve this. We don't need a simple transfer for BD. Barry Lyndon is one of of the few films you really feel experiencing being in the past. There must be lots of material of the production and design of the film. This is THE Stanley Kubrick film that deserves the better treatment. A TWO-DISC SPECIAL EDITION! DVD or BD.I think I am speaking for the whole Kubrick's Lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see.","review":"I've justed watched this VHS amid the glorious kitsch bathos of Brazilian carnival, during a sweltering hot evening, and had the impression of receiving a much needed cold shower. Simply brilliant in coldness, irony, aristocratic distancing, and very true to the XVIIIth. century spirit. Also there was the opportunity to see the 1970s beauty Marisa Berenson in the best role of her life as a giant cameo of frozen beauty that surpasses any of Hitchkock blondies. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remembering the past","review":"There's always been something of a fuddle about this movie. It was not received well by the critics when it was initially released. The main complaint has been that it's too long and too slow. But that may have more to do with the time it depicts than the film itself.Anyone who's read European literature from the mid-18th century, or tried to imagine what it might have been like to live back then, could only love this movie. Things didn't move so fast in the mid-1700s. Some complain about the 1% on top now, then it was .25% and very few had the chance to get there. Many who tried were charlatans like the star in this movie.So do yourself a favor. Read Simplicisumus and Vanity Fair before you watch this. You'll get an idea of what life was like in Europe almost 300 years ago, and you'll be able to savor the gem this movie is. It's an excellent time machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"a generation later, we in the public have caught up to kubricks \\"flop\\"","review":"i hadnt seen this since its initial release 30 years back, and at the time i was among the many who expressed disappointment. now, it has grown considerably in my estimation. while the acting of ryan o'neal still leaves something toi be desired, everything else about the movie stands out: a subtle script, fine performances, and of course magnificent to look at. the battle sequences are harrowing, but the infighting and backstabbing of the various court intrigues (not to mention the parallel intrigues among the rural set) are whats really harrowing. kubrick made so many dark movies, and this one was so misunderstood. it doesnt rank in my own list with his 4 great science fiction films (strangelove, 2001, clockwork, eyes), but thats more a matter of personal preference. a masterpiece -- even if we are only recognizing it as such a generation later."},{"rating":"2","title":"An 18th Century Painting Come to Life","review":"Maximum Kubrick moments abound as this 18th century painting comes to life. Title character is 18th century Irish rogue eventually finding his way into aristocratic English society. He is a stranger in a strange land(at one point dons Prussian Army officers uniform that leads to one of my favorite scenes with Hardy Kruger), and once Lyndon finds himself in new setting he must figure out what is the \\"right\\" behaviour. The story is actually a tragedy. All glory is fleeting applies here.DVD transfer is as beautiful as the costumes, camerawork, music, and lighting(famous indoor candle-lit scenes are amazing).Stanley Kubrick wanted originally to make a period film about Napoleon, but when \\"Waterloo\\" failed at the box office he abandoned it. Lyndon, I guess, became his period piece gem. He would not make another film until 5 years later with 1980's The Shining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Horrible Warner Film Transfer to DVD","review":"This is not an enhanced 16/9 widescreen. This is a horrible letterbox format. No excuse as the film was produced wide-screen. Just another sloppy and thoughtless Warner transfer of film to DVD in the US. Warner has a history of sloppy transfers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Kubrick's version of the 18th century through the Seven Years War to roughly the American Revolution is beautiful and worth seeing.

I have seen this movie over the years and several scenes are missing in this version. I would like relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is very philosophical. I loved it. I almost cried.","review":"This is truly a spectacular film, but not for the reasons typically mentioned--such as the great cinematography or fantastic directing (although both are splendid). What makes this film particularly good is the abstract story that is told. This story is about the central principle that you are in control of your own life. Even if you start with humble beginnings, you have the opportunity to rise through the ranks and be someone significant. (And in this case, it has to do with entering into nobility--no easy task!) The second half of the movie has to do with Lyndon's downfalls. This shows that even a person who rises through the ranks and is popular and wealthy can have a serious of setbacks. Once you are at the top, there is no guarantee that you will always remain there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not play on my LG BD300 Blu-Ray Player","review":"This disc will not play on my LG BD300 Blu-Ray player.

The disc plays fine on my Sherwood BDP-5004 BR player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Barry Lyndon does indeed have some visual appeal, but this hardly makes up for the excruciatingly slow pace and a lead character who seems curiously disconnected from well, everything. This is movie isn't even worth renting, much less buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I REMEMBERED","review":"After about 30 years and several years of telling family members that Barry Lyndon was a really good movie, I finally purchased it. Well, the movie isn't what I remembered it to be. Nicely directed, good cinematography, but it is only a 70s movie and probably should stay there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ryan O'Neal Sucks","review":"I rated this a one star entry hoping to catch someone's eye. This is absolutely Stanley Kubrick's best movie. If you had lived back then (the 1750s), this is what it would have looked like. The battle scenes are great, the music is beyond great, and Ryan O'Neal (the worst actor of his generation) doesn't ruin the film.Remember: \\"Money well timed and properly applied can accomplish anything.\\" Thackery/KubrickJust ask John Kerry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The all-time insomnia cure!","review":"After seeing this, it will surprise no one to learn that Stanley Kubrick was once a professional stills photographer. He must also be a professional hypnotist to have so many sheep under his power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Yet another example of poor film given high marks simply because of the brand name behind it. If you want to watch are far more lush and interesting period piece, check out Dangerous Liasons. Barry Lyndon is a made for TV miniseries if I ever saw one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE STAR ON A GOOD DAY!","review":"This is not only Kubrick's worst film, but possibly one of the worst films of all time. Boring does not begin to describe it. The movie would be much better off in an hour and a half version. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"amazzzzzing","review":"So here's someone who's supposed to be a great director and he has such subject matter as love, war, duels, adultery, espionage, dissipation and corruption of youth, and any number of other themes to work with. And what does he do? Makes it into a monumental three-hour BORE! The actors just walk on, say a few lines, walk off. Ryan O'Neal stands around with his mouth hanging open for most of the movie. Hardly says a word. I guess they didn't want it known that he couldn't do an Irish accent very well (or much of anything else except look pretty in his pretty clothes). It's as if Kubrick did all he could to underplay and downplay everything. Well, very subtle, very dull. This and 2001 almost put him in the same category of over-rated directors as Hitchcock, though at least Kubrick has Lolita and Dr. Strangelove to his credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Disappointment","review":"This package promising a \\"New Digital Master\\" widescreen DVD turned out to be an old, washed out fullscreen pan and scan.

Although his directorial presence is still very much active in the cinematography and style of the work, the entertainment value to be found is nonexistent. The way I would describe this film is, Gone With the Wind without any of the interesting bits. A boring film about Irish aristocracy, the only people who could possibly enjoy this movie are cinematographers and history buffs. Do not be enticed by the intriguing DVD cover, for even the most die-hard Kubrick fan this movie isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dammit Amazon, Seperate Your Product Reviews Already!","review":"First off; I have not purchased THIS PARTICULAR version of this all-time great film, however, I do want to purchase it for a friend who has bluray. The problem with this particular release is that the bluray version seems to be a terrible transfer. My real issue here aside from the fact that Warner Brothers continues to foist garbage transfers on an unsuspecting public is that ONCE AGAIN, Amazon.com refuses to separate it's product reviews, so it is simply IMPOSSIBLE for me to ascertain the quality of the DVD RELEASE vs. the BLURAY RELEASE.AMAZON.COM, if you are going to continue to provide customer reviews, PLEASE STOP mixing reviews for separate products together; The QUALITY OF INDIVIDUAL RELEASES IS DIFFERENT AND AFFECTS THE CUSTOMER'S DECISION TO BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This release is NOT 16x9 enhanced!","review":"I just received this exact DVD from Amazon. Although the package art now carries a 2007 date, the disc inside is the same as the 2001 release. It is NOT anamorphically enhanced. In fact, the files on the DVD are dated 2001, so it literally is the exact DVD release in 2001 - the menu is the same as well. The only difference is this comes in a keep case rather than a snapper case. Such a shame that WB won't do better by this overlooked masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"they are all equal now","review":"without the amazing cinematography, serene settings, masterful costuming, and revolutionary approach to lighting, Barry Lyndon would still be a very good movie. It is a beautiful stylized act of fictional biography more like a novel than any film of its genre. It should be metnioned however that the length and pacing of the film (which attributed to its popular failure upon release) can be a strong deturant to those of a nervous disposition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie! Lousy film transfer on DVD.","review":"The actual film version is breathtaking. Warner has done a terrible job with the transfer to DVD. The image (viewed on a a Sony DVD player) is very jittery and lacks proper contrast and color balance. One of the worst DVD presentations I've seen. Apparently they digitized it at a low bit rate to cram the long film into one disk. I can't explain why. Try \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" or \\"Lolita\\" for better (though not great) transfers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of movie for its time, very lush in appearance","review":"Wow, I was blown away by the quality of the picture in this blu ray.This movie was filmed 30 some-odd years ago.

Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kubrick's Greatest Film","review":"Barry Lyndon, released in 1975, a 3 hour costume drama based on an obscure Thackeray novel about an Irish rogue, comes as close to perfection as any Stanley Kubrick film. Beautifully filmed and with a score featuring Schubert's piano trio in E flat and Vivaldi's cello concerto in E minor, the film is slowly paced to reflect the pace of life of the era depicted.Until the blu-ray version of Barry Lyndon is released, we will have to be satisfied with the 2007 DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL FILM!","review":"This is one of the most well made films I have ever seen! Kubrick really is a genius filmaker. The cinematography is gorgeous, the acting is very good, and the story is well done. Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barry Lyndon","review":"This is a wonderful movie -- cinematograpy is excellent. It is about 3 hours long and as Lyndon's life is going down hill, the pace of the film slows.

I actually liked the taste of the punkin seeds and combined with the sunflower seeds , it added a rich flavor base. The dried papia is the strongest flavor. The papia and dried apples make the mixture sweet. None of the dried fruit seems to be coated with sugar. The cranberry gives the mix a tart flavor. At first, I thought the mixture was going to be too sweet for my liking, however, the sweetness is not annoying. The package says Cashews cuts are included, but the portions are lacking.I believe that mixture would have had a much more rich and appetizing hearty flavor, if the producers included whole cashews. The oils from the cashew would be more appealing and the the texture inviting. If your on the trail and need a quick snack, cashews are not likely to make a difference. However, if you snacking and savoring the flavors, the missing portion of cashews is noticible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Especially nice fruits and even the seeds are good.

This mix is one of the best tasting I have ever tasted. The fruits all taste fruity and have a very nice texture. The seeds are more enjoyable than those provided in most mixes with a really nice texture and flavor. There are some nuts, but they are not the dominant flavor or texture.Very much recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Ever had the experience of hearing a song you liked on the radio, buying the album, and feeling like you were tricked? Based on hearing Track 11 on the local jazz station I assumed the rest of the record would be a similarly joyful homage to Bird and his transcendent music. Uh, no. I never thought it would be possible for an album allegedly inspired by Bird to be so depressing, leaden and boring. Maybe there's a market for this sort of \\"music\\" and there's no accounting for taste, but only buy this CD if you like muddy machine-like noise. Bird does not live in these tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I'm sure this is great stuff for the right demographic, and I'm glad if it turns people on to Charlie Parker.

Maybe a Charlie Parker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bird Lives - But not here.....","review":"I tend to agree with the 'why bother' reviewers. Bird's wonderful melodies are lost, as are the rhythms....it's all a little to self-congratulatory really. I was hoping for something more in the line of the Verve ReMix stuff, something that adds to the original rather than taking it to pieces and trying to construct something new. Some of it is barely listen-able and some seems to have no relation to Bird's music other than small sound bites thrown into add colour to a very uninspired creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemy","review":"I listen to a lot of different kinds of music, but jazz is my favorite. Bird also happens to be my favorite jazz musician. I own about 30 Bird CDs and love every note he plays. But this Bird Up Cd, if this is going to be how people find out about Bird, well...that's just sad. If that's the case, Bird's wings have been cut, and he's going down.

I am an art historian and work at an art museum so my brother thought the book was particularly appropriate for me.

The \\"cliffhanger\\" ending was really unnessary though. But overall a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown and overpriced...","review":"I was not very impressed with some aspects of this book. The authors seem to believe that every Luftwaffe experte was the perfect specimen of a man. In their efforts to romanticise these people, I believe they do the pilots and themselves an injustice. They have left many gaping holes in their research (which in one case they were silly enough to highlight) and although much of the book covers some rarely-seen aspects, I found it less-than satisfying. Whilst I accept that the authors knew some of the characters involved, I would have appreciated a rather more frank discussion. That makes it less than good value for money and not as much fun as Mike Spick's book on the same subject (though his is, of course, far less detailed and much cheaper)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guide","review":"This book is a great guide for analyzing and determining strategies to take against the government. It's great not to have to reinvent the wheel by using the checklists and deposition questions and form complaints etc that are provided in this book as a guide. It is a book I refer to regularly in my practice and I have given it to new associates in our trial training program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guide","review":"I bought this book when I was involved in a tax clinic & law school class two years ago and now that I'm out in my own practice I find that it is one of the few books I can actually use in my practice. It has forms, pleadings and advice concerning IRS and DOJ practice and procedures that have saved me from spinning my wheels. I recommend this for others who represent clients during audits, appeals with the IRS and handle refund suits involving the Justice Department."},{"rating":"2","title":"Student's view","review":"I had to purchase this book for class at law school, and have found it to be one of the only law books worth the price. On the whole it is well written and easy to follow. You do not need an accounting degree to understand it, and it explains the I.R.S. operation in a practical manner so that it is actually helpful when you have to use it against an auditor or collection thug at the I.R.S.I would recommend it to any lawyer (new or old) who has to take on the I.R.S. and hasn't a clue where to start. The book takes you from the filing of a return, audit, collection, appeals, settlement negotiations and filing a suit in court."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent suspenseful romantica","review":"When I picked up Shelby Morgen's REDEMPTION and opened the book, I wasn't sure what I would find. Oh, I knew the story would be good, because everything Ms. Morgan writes is. What I didn't know was that Drew and Charlie would burrow under my skin and stay there. REDEMPTION is a powerful suspense erotic romance that keeps you squirming in your seat, panting for breath in some parts, and puzzled in others. This is a hot story and one you shouldn't miss out on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"I had the exact same experience as the first reviewer. Only one tag showed up in the order.

This book is giving our children an unreal view of how the consequences of their actions can be avoided. Curious George rates highly on the literature scale, but when reading this book to our children, they need to understand that the adventures George gets himself into are fictional. They need to understand that we need to be responsible for our actions, and consequences are needed to develop their moral character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bday present for 30 year old wife","review":"Want a super present for an older child (like 30) who has fond memories of her childhood books?

As well as being detailed and interesting, this book is also rich in photos of the royal family.

I finished it in two days and had a thing like working not gotten in the way, I would have been done in one! I read both Something Borrowed and Something Blue and Ethan (from Blue) plays a very small cameo which actually helps the main character make a decision. Someone disagreed with the ending saying they spotted it halfway through. I disagree. I don't want to give anything away, but I am perfectly happy with the ending, and would love to see a follow-up book on these characters. I love Giffin's writing style. She gave just the right amount of background. And never wrote anything that might have required an explanation without giving one. I highly recommend this book.

For example, if someone had a nickmame, she would provide a 2 page explanation about how that person got their nickname.2) The main character Claudia went through a life changing experience only to the end the book feeling the same way she did at the beginning of the book. It felt like a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I couldn't put this book down and finished it within two days. The style that this author writes in really appeals to me. I got immersed in this book and the characters lives. The topic wasn't something I could relate to, but the story of these people still interested me. There were a few funny moments, and a few poignant moments as well. I can relate to the authors references of certain products or experiences in growing up--and I think most 30 somethings will relate. I have read two other books by this author:Something BorrowedandSomething Blue. I like that the author included the truth that decisions that are right for some people, are not right for others in certain situations, thats how real life is....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Plan - Almost","review":"Claudia and Ben are the perfect couple. Successful and happily married they have decided that they don't wish to have children. Things go awry when one of this happy twosome realizes that maybe they do want children after all.What happens to a couple who make a commitment to each other and one has a change of heart makes for an interesting look at the changes we are and aren't willing to make for love. Without getting too sentimental or strident on either side of the question, Giffen presents a funny, poignant and believable look at what makes us choose our paths, and how we rationalize our choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"This book kept me guessing.

I believe that she has character development confused with peppering her story with random musings and observations from her own life, thinking that this creates unique people within her story. Instead, it just showcases her laziness. I also take issue with her brand of \\"strong woman,\\" which is actually just an irritating, selfish, caricature of a Manhattan professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Loved Something Blue and Something Borrowed. Did not like this book @ all. Read the whole thing hoping it would get better.

I was looking for something that was a step beyond the light hearted \\"chick lit\\" as were her other books. However, what I found was a rather depressing novel about a very selfish woman. I could not continue with the book after the 4th chapter or so. Complete disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enjoy a good chick-lit novel now and then, but this one was disappointing. The plot was thin and predictable, held no surprises, and the artificial happy ending was obvious and almost insulting. We were given no real reason for the character's change of heart.

There's better chick-lit out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was excited about this book- loved Something Borrowed & Something Blue. It was one of two books I bought for vacation. It is so SLOW & BORING. The main character is a almost annoying me & I was reading it thinking when is something going to actually happen? I made it to the part about her going through their CD's which was so immature & then after the part about picking a for her \\"last dinner\\" with Ben I started scanning pages instead of reading which led to skipping pages to see if anything started to happen cause everything is so drawn out and boring...

This book is so slow and boring. The main character is a pathetic immature woman who can't make up her mind. I did not realize the whole book was going to be about her sex capades and empty life, always wondering if the grass was greener on the other side. Seriously immature and Jess is equally pathetic. She haphazardly takes birth control pills and has a pregnancy scare but it was stupid and shows her ignorance. I keep skipping pages to further this thing along. The characters are so shallow. I may not be able to finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Summer Read","review":"Fabulously entertaining book that hooks you before the end of the first page.

Out of all the other books that I've read this book is soo my favorite. I love how this book is and how it was written. Not only if you've read all of emily giffin's other book she does touch upon others that you know from the other books but you also read stuff in a different way other than her first 2 books.This book is about a woman not wanting to have kids and what she'll do to defend her rights not to have a kid and how it's her choice to do what she believes it right and be the woman that she is. A definate read for those women whom are like me that don't want kids and feels like society is trying to make us make decisions based on what they want and not what we want. Because kids are not for everyone nor should they be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different than the others by griffin","review":"\\"Baby Proof\\" was so different than the other 3 by Emily Griffin.

Typically, in Giffin's other books her characters and stories, both, are very interesting, and keep the reader entertained. This story is about a woman who does not want kids. She gets married, and still doesn't want kids. The story goes on and on and on about her not wanting kids. All of a sudden her husband, does want kids. What to do now? More chapters about Claudia, the wife, not wanting kids. Every character in the story has some connection to wanting, or trying to have children. But, Claudia doesn't want children, as the author reminds us (over and over). Did I mention she doesn't want kids? It gets redundent. None of the characters in this story are interesting. I found myself not really caring about what happens. I found the ending to be predictable. It was a strain to finish the book.So unlike her first 2 books. Save your money on this one.

This is a must read and I think all will enjoy it---I was totally misled by its title, I really thought it was going to be about having babies or raising babies but it was about a womans choice whether to have them or not, and even though I am a mother and love being one, the story line did a great job in detailing a womans(as well as a mans) choice in deciding to have them or not--- an excellent book...I read it so quickly because I couldn't put it down!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Like a lot of people I have read all of Emily Giffin's books and wholeheartedly recommend all of them.

Husband decides he does,Woman stands her ground, while Husband becomes an absolute dick, completely unwavering.They divorce FAST.....too fast!Woman tries to move on, yaddayaddayadda, comes to the conclusion that 35 is \\"too old to start over\\", so she begins to mentally convince herself that she would be willing to have a baby to win Husband back.What started off as refreshing thoughts, with moments that had me cheering this couple on...became yet another cowardly cop out that gave in to the cultural norms."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"While I really enjoyed this author's first two books, I found this one to be an utter disappointment. The main character was difficult to sympathize with given her self-involvement and conceit. At one point I was hoping the plot wasn't going where I knew it was headed because I was actually rooting against her. It is worth noting that I did not dislike her because of her desire to remain childfree. This is a decision I have a lot of respect for because it goes against social norms and the fact that overpopulation is tied to many of the world's current woes. Put simply, Claudia wasn't someone you would want to spend an evening with in real life, so why spend several of them reading about her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable","review":"Baby Proof had a predictable and lack luster ending, as well as annoying characters.

So I was looking forward to this book as I have heard nothign but good things about Giffin's books, however I was unable to get past the terrible narrator. She has a weird, uppity, rebotic way of speaking (like a lady imitating Thurston Howell)making it impossible to relate to the character. Considering Claudia's stance on children, which I have no problem relating to, it turns the main character into a completely unlikeable person and impossible for me to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly redundant and boring","review":"I absolutely loved Emily Giffins first two novels, with Something borrowed being the favourite. But I absolutely disliked this book. I found it to be over analyzed, too much description of the same thing over and over again, unrealistic and predictable. I wish that the author had actually taken more time producing a great like the other two than producing something mediocre for fact that she might have wanted to publish a book right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another fun book by Emily.","review":"I enjoyed \\"Something Borrowed\\" and \\"Something Blue\\" by Giffin and \\"Baby Proof\\" was also a delight. Very light, easy, fast reading. Her books are similar to the \\"Sex in the City\\" series. Young, hip, pretty in New York City, struggling with committments. Maybe not quite as raunchy as the TV series but very similar in content, entertaining good writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful, Emotional and Intelligent, and not a fairy tale.","review":"Once again, I read one of Ms. Giffen's intelligent, thoughtful, and emotional tales, and I was completely taken in with the vivid characters and the wonderfully complex and realistic relationships. I think that this is a great book for discussion among women who like to talk about love, relationships, and children. I don't want to say any more, or I fear I will give away too much of the plot. But the premise alone should trigger a pretty interesting conversation -- there are so, so many people who can't relate to or understand a woman who does not want to have children.

However, I was wrong! I thought it was a wonderful story, and like Emily Giffin's other books, I could relate to the characters and found it very realistic. I especially loved the little cameo made by the characters in Something Blue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I loved \\"Something Borrowed\\" and \\"Something Blue\\" so I had high hopes for this book. I really had to force myself to get through this book. I thought too much of the focus was put on the secondary characters and by the end of the book I didn't really care about what happened to Claudia and Ben. Jess was the best character and it seemed like she should have been the focus of the story. I think it would have been more interesting had Claudia actually gotten pregnant in the book and reading about how she went through all the pregnancy milestones as someone not naturally wanting to be a mom. The book was a real disappointment. I had to force myself to get through it. I never leave a book unfinished, but this one was close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointed...","review":"I've read Emily Giffin's two other novels (Something Borrowed/Something Blue) and I have to say that this one was not as enticing compared to the other two. The book didn't keep my attention like the other novels, I think because the ending was too predictable. In the middle of the book I already knew the outcome and I felt like I was forcing myself to finish the book to the no surprise ending.Maybe this book was dull because her other books referenced to each other, however this one really had no reference to her previous books. I'm going to try her last novel... I hope the next one is better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Proof","review":"The book started off good then became the worst book I have ever read.

Perfect for your book club!","review":"I love being surprised by novels, and I found myself pleasantly surprised a few times during my two-day, couldn't-put-it-down read of this book. This one is a great book to read at the same time as your girlfriends, or as the choice for your bookclub, because you're surely going to want to chat not just about that VERY generous gift by Richard and about your suspicions of Tucker, but about the big themes of when to have a baby, why to have a baby, matching your timing and expectations with your partner. Loved, loved, loved this book and will delve happily into Giffin's other novels soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Halloween","review":"October is my favorite month. I love apple picking, the chill in the air...oh, and scary stories!! I am always on the hunt for a good spooky tale but too often I get stuck with gory books or stories that fall flat. When I saw this book at my local library, I thought that I would take a shot (even if the book is older than I am!). I am SO glad that I picked up this book because it was the perfect combination of scary, eerie, and chilling. Better yet, there are no dead bodies or bloody corpses.The author has compiled a beautiful collection of stories that was born out of an oral history project. Perhaps this is the reason why the different tales come together so well, because she is not writing for the sheer scream factor. Additionally, she allows the people to speak for themselves without ever making them sound crazy or delusional. Due to this, the book is spine-chilling and perfect for the season!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"I bought the LP version of Geneva in a record store in la rue des Etuves whose name I ahve forgotten.

I was never told they were out of the green plates, if I had, I never would have placed the order.I called right away to receive a credit for the order including the shipping cost. They appologized and said they would send a shipping label in the the next week for returning the substituted salad plates. That was a month ago, nothing has happened...I still have the white Winterberry dishes in a box ready to be sent back.In my opinion this company has poor customer service.

But not only are the Borodin Quartet recordings cheap, they are the best. The Borodins give an unshakably consistent reading of every quartet (and Shostakovich fires no blanks!). They even throw in the Piano Quintet and the two String Octet movements. Each performance is among the best ever recorded and some ARE the best ever recorded, especially the immensely convincing and coherent readings of the middle-late dodecaphonic quartets (12, 13) and the late 'introverted' quartets (14, 15). Even the over-recorded 8th quartet sounds amazingly fresh here. I can't recommend this set enough.

I appreciate the author's effort, but this book is a failure!This book TRIED to be a political AND intimate biography but it just didn't work. The reader is overwhelmed with minor details about the politics of Victoria's reign without getting the big picture. All the details are wonderful, but the author writes in such a confuzing manner that it's hard to follow everything. In the end, we are left with a vague idea about the events of her reign.There was an alarmingly small amount of information on Victoria's personal relationships. I don't know what else to say because I honestly can't recall learning anything new! Stanley ignored Victoria's family and it makes for horrible reading.Honestly, this book is a very boring read. Do not waste your time even trying to consume and understand this \\"intimate\\" biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Paper","review":"I'm not sure why anyone would bother to publish this.

I also had no complaints from those I called, who couldn't tell I was on a bluetooth device...It also charges in about 90 minutes, or about 30 minutes less than is listed in the instruction booklet....I am so pleased with the price and performance of this headset, that I plan to buy a number to give away as gifts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset :-(","review":"I think the headset itself is great, but the battery life for this unit is horrible.

First the rubber ear padding started tearing, so I finally just popped the whole thing off (they don't sell replacement parts for this, unlike other brands). Then I started noticing it was losing signal to the phone if it wasn't fully charged all the time. It doesn't allow you to move 30 feet away from the phone like it says it does, it's more like 10-15 feet. It's progressively gotten worse with dropping calls and falling apart, now the microphone on it isn't working at all. Workmanship is horrible.

The Motorola HS850 hooks around your ear and when in use is suspended outside of your ear channel. Any ambient noise makes it extremely difficult to hear the caller. While the sound quality is great when you are listening to a caller while in a quiet environment (like a library), the fact that this unit is suspended outside of your ear makes it useless in a moving vehicle - especially when there is other traffic around you.

All of my cell phones have been Motorola. So, naturally, I bought a Motorola headset when I decided to get a Bluetooth headset.There were several things I didn't like about this headset. First, it changed the ring on my PEBL to the annoying ring you get when you plug the phone in for charging. I had the phone on vibrate but when I bonded with the headset it made the phone ring and not vibrate.The other thing I really disliked was how it felt on my ear. It always felt like it was about to fall off at any momment.

I've never lost the connection with my phone, but my phone is always either on my person or in my purse when I'm using the headset, so I can't really comment on the distance specs.I'm pretty picky by nature but, for my purposes, this headset was the perfect solution. I don't use it in noisy environments or anything. I bought it to use when I'm in the car, outside gardening, or just around the house doing things that I don't want to stop doing just because somebody calls me. For those things, it's the perfect solution for me. No complaints at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Bluetooth SUCKS!","review":"Had this product for a couple of years now. First of all it's bulky, and it doesn't hug your ear, unless you don't have big ears. Also picks up background noises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product....Not What I expected","review":"The shipment was expedited, so I am thankfull for that. However, the product itself is not what I expected to be. The volume on the bluetooth is not good at all. You can hardly hear anything. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this item at all. It's an absolute waste of money. However, I would recommend the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst bluetooth device I've owned yet.","review":"I am not pleased with this earpiece at all. While it is compact, light, and able to switch between ears, the sound quality on this earpiece is terrible. I had one of a similar model that I loved. I ran over it with my car and it still worked! (but it didn't survive spending the night in a mud puddle- oops) I bought this one expecting the same quality and am sorely disappointed. I have to cut it off within the first few seconds of every conversation because it distorts the sound so badly. I've also had people on the other end tell me that it muffles my voice as well. If you can't hear on it, then what's the point? Try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mot HS850 Bluetooth Headset opinion","review":"I found the Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset did not meet my expectations. The link below identifies the device.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007WWAGI/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThe product had a shroud on it which I found annoying and after having used the Motorola HS700 Bluetooth Headset for years prior to the purchase of this product I found the power adapter and car adapter lack of compatibility with USB connectors very inconvenient. More and more I find the USB mini-connector charging system is becoming a ubiquitous standard and lack of this compatibility, when I have many other devices using this system makes it cumbersome at best to have to carry around additional car adapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sometimes, horrible others","review":"I've been using the 850 daily for about a month now and I'm taking it back. When conditions are ideal (I'm within 10 feet of the phone, I have excellent service coverage, and my ear with the 850 on it is toward the phone, no wind, no background noise) it works really well. When any combination of the parenthetical above occurs say goodbye to the clarity on both ends. I'm tiring of my friends saying take that stupid headset off, I'm getting every other syllable. I had high hopes, but the technology's just not there yet. At least not with this headset. I think the long boom headsets are bound to be better. That's what I'm going to try now. Fair warning on this headset. Looks cool, but who cares if it doesn't hold its own?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst handset i have ever used","review":"I bought this item from Amazon this month, April 2006. This is the worst handset i have ever used. When the call gets connected, i can hear a jarred voice of the person on the other end talking. The other person can hardly hear me. Moreover, i have Motorola Razr v3 and verizon service(i always had full signal) What a ripoff!! Luckily, i returned the product within a week and i got full refund from the third party seller of Amazon. But i almost lost $12 in shipping costs. I wouldnot recommend this product to even my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just does not get loud enough","review":"This headset works well in indoor, but its volume just does not get loud enough to be useful while driving in highway.

I'm very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery life ~40 mins for mine","review":"I probably got a defective HS850, but its battery life is really short. It needs to be recharged even when off (after about 3 days sitting there it's flat), and the talk time is 40 minutes tops. After what I paid for this when it just came out (August '06), I expected far more from a Motorola product. Sound quality and connectivity to my LG CU500 is fine, though. I wish it had a mute button---I'm replacing the headset, and it's one feature I will be looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"audio too muffled","review":"Audio too muffled by design. Mic presses into face and causes speech to sound muffled. Had to play with ear placement too much. Two family members had same problem with both models we bought.

However, when a friend recommended this specific model, I figured I'd give it the benefit of the doubt. Boy was I wrong! As everyone else will tell you, this headset is absolutely HORRIBLE if there is any noise around you (IE: road noise while driving). Therefore, it completely defeats the purpose in my opinion.

At times it was dialing out even when the boom was folded away. It just seemed to have a mind of its own. However once the connection was made the calls were clear and people at the other end could hear me clearly. Motorola needs to have an on/off switch for this device. I returned the headset. It came in a bulk package(ziplock bag) so maybe because it was refurbished it was not working properly. Either way I ended up returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to use","review":"I found this product easy to use. Since I'm a grandmother, and not techno savvy, ease of use is the biggest factor in my determination of satisfaction.

I wanted to switch the ear hook from right side to left side. When I did, the earhook at the bottom broke off.

I would think twice before purchasing this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorola hands free device by far the best for the price.","review":"I have owned only a few bluetooth devices but this one by far is the best for the price. The best thing about the device is that it automatically connects to your phone by simply unfolding the boom mike. The reception is clear also. The only draw back is sometimes it cannot understand your commands u n l e s s y o u s p e a k l i k e t h i s. Otherwise its a great little product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would have to be better to be awful","review":"Horrible. I own ten different bluetooth headsets, and this one is so bad that it now has a permanent home in the junk drawer. It can't connect in a timely manner; the sound transmission is tin can and string quality; and it hangs up on callers at a random time that it determines. The connection issue is just inexcusable. It takes a very long time to connect to my phone-upwards of 20 seconds-and by then, the caller has abandonded the call. I have paired it multiple times to no avail. It is useless as a headset. The cheaper H500 has been great however, so more money doesn't necessarily mean a better headset from Motorola. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just works","review":"I have been using the HS850 for the better part of 2008 and have found it to be a competent little unit. It pairs quite nicely with my Motorola i880 that was assigned by my employer. I find the volume level to be good, though not outstanding. I can hear the other party quite clearly and have had no complaints going in the other direction.The HS850 that I got from Amazon came with a charger and minimal instructions, but I had no issues. After being plugged in for one overnight cycle it was ready to go. The fact that the mike boom also acts as an on/off switch is great, as it tends to conserve battery life. Are there better units on the market ? Most likely.

Two months down the road of very low usage, the main button went bad. Anytime I wanted to start using it, it would redial the same exact number, no matter which number I dialed last. I sent for replacement, got my third one and had same problem with volume. Decided to sell it on eBay. Got myself a brand new model of Jabra - BT500 and love it.

Unfortunately, it was sent by Amazon in a small ziplock bag that was inside a larger ziplock bag containing the charger. The bluetooth headset, which was completely unprotected, must have continually \\"banged\\" against the charger during shipping. By the time I got it, the headset was scratched and looked used...like something I had found on the sidewalk. Also, when I shook the headset, something inside rattled. I returned the headset to Amazon for a refund and then bought the same model from a local discount store for 20% more.This was the first time that I have had to return anything to Amazon...too bad that Amazon did not \\"bubble wrap\\" the headset itself to protect it during shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume low","review":"Everything seemed to work on this headset except the volume is too low to hear well.

I also got a bluetooth ready phone. The headset worked for a week, then I could not get it to connect with my phone. Couple of calls to customer service and for a couple of days it worked. Then it happened again, so we tried the same thigs again, and it worked again. In the end they decided to replace it for me. Thank you. I found my self pressing the head set to my ear to hear the conversations. I would put the phone in my pocket and would get static. The range is suppose to be 50 feet. The final straw was when I went to put it on and a piece broke of so now there is no way to put the thing on my ear unless I hold it. Not satisfied at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't be my first choice, bearly usable, Slightly better than my HS820","review":"I bought this headset to replace my HS820. I previously used both the Motorola HS850 and the HS820 and had the same two problems with each.- Insecure attachment to my ear.- Insuffcient volumeWhenever I moved, the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel as if they were about to fall off. They never did but it was still annoying.The volume problem was in part related to this. The contact with my ear wasn't very firm and the ambient noise that the headsets let in coupled with a relatively low volume meant that I had to press the headset to my ear to hear clearly.I gave it 2 stars rather than one because of the GREAT battery life.I finally bought a Plantronics 510 and have been very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Headset...

I think the phone/headset combo is a factor as well as user experience, obviously. The packaging allows for it to be 'tried' and resold. Oh yeah, It seemed as if one of them was already used or at least tried. Kind of creepy for something like this if you ask me.

The H3 ear piece is redesigned. Both work equal, however the boom of the 850 was a nice feature to turn off and on.The rubber tearing is a design flaw, until MOTOROLA redesigns the ear piece I do not recommend this headset.I have a JABRA 250 my wife uses, no problems there either."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't get it to pair up with my Sony Ericsson phone!!!!

I figured since I liked my HS850, I would \\"upgrade\\" to the H700. What a mistake!! I gave that one away and bought myself a 2nd HS850.

Well, when it came, it looked used and after I plugged it in, it didn't do a thing. I had it plugged in to charge for a half hour - nothing. So, giving Amazon the benefit of the doubt, I asked for a replacement and sent the first one back. The second unit came and it looked worse and also didn't do anything when it was plugged in. So, I'm not sure if they're aware they're selling used junk or what but they really need to pull these off their \\"shelf\\". They're garbage. They're even too light to make decent paperweights!

Oddly, they do not work or sound the same. The first may have been a counterfeit, but it sounded better and gave more feedback on signals from the phone, it was also more comfortable.This one is bulk branded for Verizon. The earpiece (behind the ear) is very hard and uncomfortable. It does not signal when you turn it on (the old one had a tone from the handset).

Just as others have mentioned, the headset doesn't fit well for all people. I felt I had to barely hang it on my ear to get the speaker low enough to be able to hear the caller. Even then, you can't get the volume loud enough to comfortably listen to the caller while driving. If you are using this headset in a car, you'll find that the volume is never loud enough and the fit is so loose that your afraid your going to fling the headset off if you turn around to change lanes.

I did not notice this feature on my end of the line nor could my customers, as they could hear road noises.Thirdly, and a very important feature, I could not increase the volume enough to hear when driving!! I am now looking to replace this unit with one that fits IN the ear, rather than on top. My counterparts with this headset also agree, and are looking for new ones that fit in the ear a bit more.My opinion, and I hope you value it, is that you could save some money, and buy one of the other designs that fit in the ear rather than just on top, which should help hearing your conversation when you travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Volume, Uncomfortable Fit","review":"After reading great reviews on this headset, I went ahead and made the purchase.

Today, I discovered that the mic \\"boom\\" is broken, making it unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but is very obviously used","review":"I thought that this was a new item, just packaged in bulk, however, this is very clearly used as evidenced by scratches on the boom, the power button and makeup in the rubber spot on the mic. I don't appreciate having to disenfect my items before using them and I don't mind buying used, so long as I know it is used when purchasing. So just be forewarned that you are buying a USED product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I have not found this item to be as good as I have read about it.You are supposed to be able to open the boom and it will connect, mine will not. I have to go through the menu on my phone and then it will connect. If I close the boom after the phone call, it disconnects and I must either keep the boom open or if I close it, then reconnect through the phones menu......It consistently drops connection with the phone, even though the phone is in my shirt pocket and the headset is on my ear.. By consistently, I mean approximately 3 to 4 times a week.The earpiece fits way too loose, letting the headset flop around and occasionally fall off my ear...I have had this headset for 10 months and today all the sounds coming through were fuzzy and any caller on the other end said they heard clanking sounds until I switched to my phone without the headset.That was the end for me, I will toss it out and buy something else today...My recomendation is not to buy this particular headset....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile and Low Volume","review":"This was my first experience with a bluetooth device so I didn't have a lot to compare to. I found the volume on this headset to be somewhat low most of the time. I mostly used the headset outdoors and any wind or other noise causes a lot of problems. After having the headset for about two months it caught on my seat belt as I was getting out of my car and broke at the point where the mic boom swings out. I've since tried several other headsets and this is the last one I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than my old one!","review":"This Bluetooth is MUCH MORE comfortable than my old one. People that I talk to can't even tell that I'm on the device. The only reason that I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's a little bulky, but you can't beat the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Headset","review":"Very nice and compact headset. Works really well and likes up automaticly with your phone when the boom is opened. Fits much nicer than others we have had. I was pleasantly surprised to have a charger with it. I didnt realize it came with one, however, the type of charger I assumed would be like the Motorola chargers for the Razr phones. Unfortunately, it was the very delicate pinch style plug which breaks easily and isnt compatible with anything else we use so we have to carry around 2 different type chargers. Overall, product great, Charger kinsda sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not pair - cannot use","review":"The headset paired with my phone quickly and worked for one day only. Volume was only fair but I liked the way it worked. Day two, mid-call, it lost its blue-tooth connection with my phone. Since then, I have been unable to get the headset to emit the steady signal to allow it to be paired again. The headset blinks but will not send the steady, pairing signal.This was a brand new item and came with a useless little instruction manual with no troubleshooting. I thought I might try taking out the battery but can't figure out how to open the unit without damaging it.I am not happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look at Other Options","review":"I bought this headset after many reviews I'd had read about how great it is. The sounds quality is great but it is the most uncomfortable bluetooth headset I've had. It's so bad you find that you have it off more times than you have it on. Which defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset all together. The Motorola H500 or HS820 are much lighter and much more comfortable. Look at these first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Better than it Works!","review":"Very slick design, however, 8 out of 10 times I used it the person I was talking to complained about not being able to hear me. Very frustrating. Would have to take headset off and use handset, which defeats the purpose. I replaced it with a Plantronics Voyager 510 and people have commented on how well they can now hear me. Not as cool looking on my ear, but worth the good reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke already","review":"I was very excited when I received this. The look was exactly what I wanted (the blue light and all), it seemed to hold onto my ear, and the unfolding to activate it made perfect sense to me. One day it fell of onto the concrete when I bent over to pick something up. After impact, it has never worked correctly. When it is closed, it still acts as if it were open, allowing it to drain all day - which makes it useless in the evening. It also won't stay connected very long. Of course, it would seem like I should be a bit more careful, but it shouldn't have fallen off my ear in the first place! The sound quality was good when it worked, however, I found myself always holding it closer to my ear when there was background noise, even with the volume turned all the way up. Shouldn't it be 'hands-free'?! I will be looking for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Bluetooth head set for V195","review":"I have a motorola V195 phone. This headset paired easily with it and has worked just fine for me.It isn't the snuggest fit to my ear, but I don't wear it all day and have it primarily to use while driving.It does reset your phone's ring tone to the default when paired, but I don't care about stuff like that.However it looks like the same company are selling the exactly the same headset for cheaper at this amazon pagehttp://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Bluetooth-HS850-Headset/dp/B00187WXMM/ref=pd_cp_cps_3?pf_rd_p=413863801&pf;_rd_s=center-41&pf;_rd_t=201&pf;_rd_i=B000ETYDU0&pf;_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf;_rd_r=08XQ07W4A855JA84AKVVso why pay 3 dollars more here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with the equipment","review":"This item does not work very well .

It is clear and there is never any static and it is comfortable on my ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Headset","review":"This Product is very good i love it i just think the volume should be a little louder cause its very difficult to here in loud surroundings such as the bus in the car or even the train!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this bluetooth headset","review":"I bought this bluetooth device because it was rated highly by Consumer Reports but found the reception to be terrible. Whoever I was talking to could hear themselves echo and it was so distracting they asked me to turn it off. I sent the first one back thinking it was faulty but it happened again with the second one. I think bluetooth has a way to go before it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK if you have good hearing","review":"It's functional, inexpensive, and easy to use, but the volume control is inadequate...at least for me who has less than average hearing. The earpiece doesn't penetrate the ear far enough to be heard with average road noise, so I have to press on it and hold it in, which defeats the hands-free purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Star for this Product","review":"I had to return this headset twice. First one was defective and second one was used one, not mint used but was used so heavily that it was full of dust. IMPORTANT ALERT: THIS HEADSETS ARE NOT NEW.

Tried it on a couple of receptacles and got the same thing. Wondering about Moto QA on these units. Also the casing feels cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery can NOT be changed","review":"I just learned from Motorola that if the battery in your HS850 Bluetooth dies in one year - they will replace the unit free. IF however the battery dies after the year - you just throw the entire unit away. So end result is you lost your purchase price. Bummer. But if and when it dies I will split it open to see how it works and if I can modify it to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price at ALL!","review":"This is my first bluetooth headset, and at first it was fine - setup was simple, the design is nice and it fit comfortably on my ear. However, the battery life is horrible - I don't talk on the phone that much and it needs to be charged after about 2 hours of use. Additionally, the reception is sometimes very bad - MUCH worse than when I use my phone's receiver. I have had my headset for about a month, and it just keeps getting worse - it drops calls all the time so it is impossible to have a conversation with it, and now it only works for a few seconds at a time and then completely shuts off. I played with the settings and the phone's connection setup, but to no avail. I will be calling Motorola for a replacement very soon. I am sorely disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't hear you!!!","review":"Like many who have reviewed this headset, I was initially very pleased with the ease of setup and the apparent ease of use. None of that mattered, though, the first time I tried to use it in my car. The hand I would normally have used to hold a phone to my ear is now occupied trying to press this Motorola headset against my ear tightly enough to have any chance of hearing the call. I would absolutely not recommend this headset for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor battery life on this headset","review":"This headset's battery life is very poor. I notice that even after a full recharge, if I don't use the headset for a couple of days, by the time I try to use it, the battery has been completely discharged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not acceptable for business use - Used with Motorola E815","review":"Comfortable to wear but static is noticable on both ends of conversation. I expected excellent performance when used with a Motorola phone but that was not th case. People kept asking me to repeat myself and told me I kept cutting in and out. I used the headset in and out of the car with no change in performance.In addition, the volume is not loud enough unless you are in a quiet enviroment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I'm very pleased that I held out for this unit over the HS820. Battery life is excellent, as is the sound quality. People I talk to don't seem to have any problem hearing me.The only minor negative is that it doesn't fit my ear perfectly. I have to pull my ear back slightly to get it to pop in. However, once in it is very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compact but hardly usable","review":"Goods:Small, lang-lasting battery, very easy to put on, comfortable to wear, easy to install... in other words it could've been a great device if not all these...Bads:I could hear people at the other and of the line well only provided it was quite around. Standing on a busy and therefore noisy street made me upset because I could only guess what my friend just said. So, if you plan to use it in the car and it's sound proof then it's a great thing, otherwise... disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really Great Headset, but so badly built","review":"It worked really well, easy to pair with multiple devices, went on quickly, reconnected itself to my blackberry quickly when a call came in. However, I had to return it three times for a replacement, as the folding boom snapped off twice, and one time it just stopped charging. Finally, I gave up trying and bought the more basic \\"boomless\\" motorola, but the volume on that is impossibly low. I'm looking for a better alternative right now, I may go back to Jabra, since Moto just don't seem to be able to get it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound","review":"I used to have a sony-ericsson headset, but this one is much better.

I've had both a Nokia (forget the model number) and now an LG-CU500, and neither will recognize it. It is incredibly frustrating.I have nothing against the product itself...my OLD Motorola phone still recognizes it immediately, but the fact that it is incompatible with other phones is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent buy","review":"I like this bluetooth headset alot. It's nice, basic, no nonsense, and perfect for anyone who wants it strictly for driving. The earpiece is comfortable, and while it feels loose, it doesn't fall off. I can hear just fine, and whoever I'm talking to can hear me without a problem. Driving on the freeway doesn't interfere with the sound quality. I'd recommend this for anyone who wants a basic bluetooth for minimal use, like only when driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice headset","review":"This headset works well, It sets up easily, charges quickly (about an hour or so) and lasts about 5-6 hours. The sound quality is also very good. My only complaint is the part that wraps around your ear is not very adjustable and it can be a little uncomfortable after wearing it for a while. Also, I believe it is for the right ear only and not switchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift","review":"It was a mother's day gift as California law now dictates that holding a cellphone while driving is illegal. It fit into her right ear, which she does not consider her \\"CELL PHONE EAR\\", but was able to figure out how to use it with her left ear.

Everyone I call complains about the sound quality. They say it sounds like i'm in a tunnel or it's an echo. Also the other thing is there is no battery running low warning, it just dies.

Someone asked me if all these issues are \\"user error\\", it's not, i've read the instructions front to back and use it as directed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"This is the first Bluetooth headset I've ever purchased.

For the money ($25) you can't go wrong with this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good value but poor quality","review":"I do not want to invest too much on a Bluetooth headset since I tend to loose it or put in the washer. The price is good and easy to pair with my Blackberry. My biggest problem is the quality. Too much noise, hissy sound and the person on the other line always complain that there are too much static sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Motorola should be ashamed of themselves for making such a poor product. My wife and I both mistakingly bought them. You would be better off with two tin cans connected by a string. The background noise is terrible. Callers get frustrated listening to you. The listening volume is too low. One has to drive while holding the earpiece snug against your ear to barely hear the other person talking. After one month we both switched to another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"HS700 is better","review":"This headset works fine re quality of sound, but is quite large.

I drive a Honda CRV, and while it's not as whisper-quiet as a luxury sedan it's not all that noisy a vehicle.

I do have people that can tell I'm not on the normal phone. THe biggest problem is that it doesn't have enough volume to really be used in my car (which is a pretty quiet car). I will be shopping for another headset. The \\"bulk packaging\\" really leaves you feeling like your missing something as well.

I hear a small amount of static coming through the headset which my previous headset never did (Jabra BT800). The one feature that I do really like is the flip mic boom. It really helps save the battery since you can simple open the boom to answer a call. While the boom is closed no batter is being used. It also feels more comfortable then the Jabra BT800.

Beyond that, I cannot recommend the HS850 to anyone. The rubber seal that is suppose to reduce noice for the wearer does not work well and after 60 days, it fell off! Motorola does not offer replacements and even if they did, the design does not allow for re-installation. Eventually this unit failed to re-charge. For a company that prides itself in being a Six Sigma company, they sure have a crappy product.

I was very happy for about 15 minutes until it started acting strange, like the battery had died. I repeated this process several times and came to the conclusion that the battery would only hold a full charge for ~15 minutes.Motorola's return/replacement process is a pain, I had to make 2 calls to customer service to get an RMA #, had to send the product to their returns center at my own cost, and still waiting for a replacement.During the few minutes that it worked, it seemed to work well, but this is not a great first impression!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"After receiving the headset I plugged it in to charge and no lights came on.

I returned it via Amazon and received a replacement, which actually did charge. The problem is, when i disconnected it from the charger for the first time to use it, the headset simply split apart in two halves and the guts of the electronics spilled out.Don't bother with this, get the Motorola H700 which is excellent (cheaper on Newegg than Amazon)."},{"rating":"1","title":"bluetooth headset","review":"The main problem I have with this item is that a lot of times when I'm talking on the phone it gets garbled and I can't understand what the other person is saying so I have to turn off the headset and just use the phone itself, which can be a real pain when driving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Device does not working","review":"I bought this product from CCMACCESSORIES.

Callers can barely hear me. The over the ear style headset doesnt seem to fight tight enough, and if you happen to jerk or move your head very fast, the headset almost flies off. I do also get a little bit of \\"bluetooth static\\" MY BIGGEST PROBLEM, is that for some reason this thing randomly places call, when I dont even touch the headset. I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason. IT constantly did it, and became annoying as I could not shut off the call with the headset, and had to fidget and try and get my cell phone out of my pocket to end the call. I replaced it with a Jabra 250v and absolutely love it.

A small pin does this. After using it for a while, it eats away the coating and the device does not sensed by the cell phone.- the soft rubber aroung the speaker portion comes breaks away.Overall, this device may look, work good initially but not durable over 2 - 3 months depending on usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"best bluetooth?","review":"I researched exstensively and found that the motorola HS850 had been rated the highest by other consumers and people who'd received them for free at trade shows or something. So, I was very excited to get mine and start using it. I was very impressed with the size and look of the headset. I paired it with my phone and started to use it. I was very dissapointed with the feel and the sound quality that came with the headset. I tried everything to adjust the volume and use it on the other ear, to no avail. I also found that with natural movement, it felt like it was going to fall off several times, though it didn't. It was fine if I was sitting in a quiet room, but as soon as I tried to go about business around the house or garage I had a very hard time hearing the other person. Driving was even more difficult. Additionally, the other person heard an echo of themselves. I would not recommend this headset to anyone who is looking for functionality more than looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexy design, but short on function","review":"The design of this headset is quite nice. But, I found that it was impossible to hear my phone conversations over ambient sound given the over ear design of the HS850 and it's limit on maximum volume.

If I could get all of the functionalty of a cell phone embedded in this form factor, I'd be thrilled.

From word of mouth I heard that the HS850 was a pretty nice bluetooth headset. After buying it I was impressed with the small size, light weight, and flip open mic. It configured easy with my blackberry 7130e phone too. However, after having it for a few days I quickly found out that it severly lacked proper amplification. It was very hard to hear people on the other end and I found myself pushing the headset against my ear just to make it louder. Just to give you an idea, the volume at high was about 1/4 of the volume if I was just listening to my phone without the headset.In the end I returned the headset and got a plantronics 320 which was about half the cost, but with much better volume control.

Granted, I have smaller ears than most people but come on, it shouldn't be that difficult to place against my ear. If I could give it a negative rating for the sound quality, I would.

I use it with a Motorola RAZR V3.My last Bluetooth headset was a Jabra, and it broke after just a few months -- the power button quit working, so it was always on until the battery drained.I love the HS850 since it has no power button! Instead, you just flip it open or closed. It gets great battery life, since it's so easy to put it in standby by flipping it closed.I have also used this headset successfully with Skype on both Windows and Mac. The only catch is that it can only be active with one device at a time, so you have to disconnect/release it from your cell phone, before you can successfully use it with Windows or Mac. This makes switching back and forth between your PC and phone a bit cumbersome. Of course, it took a couple of hours to get it working under Windows, but it worked first try on the Mac ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average review is right on - low volume","review":"Just packed up the unit for return.

Just like most reviews said!Motorola just came out with a \\"stereo\\" bluetooth headset, and it better be an improvment on this thing. The 850 works ok, but again...volume is everything.

I carried it around in my pocket all the time. After about a month, the 1-touch button started flaking out a bit. (i.e. I had to press it several times in order for the button-press to register.)

The audio level is too low to hear, even at the highest volume setting. This must have been known by Motorola, but their solution was to add a little rubber gasket around the speaker.

Busy mall, school hallway, restaurant? Forget it. I've used this with my UTStarcom 6700 for a month now and I'll never buy Motorola again. Your maximum volume should be just a little too loud - not half as loud as necessary to function.The microphone isn't very sensitive either - without AGC no one can hear you, with AGC the distortion is so bad that you get the same thing.Learn from my mistake and stay away - I payed $150 CAN for mine and already they've dropped to under $100 - presumably due to constant bad reviews.If you're smart and doing some research my review won't be a shocker - everyone else is saying the same thing.Thanks Motorola - that's $150 I'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes you sound muffled, hard for you to hear","review":"I like the look of this headset, and I really like the fact that flipping the boom turns it on and off instantly.However, the Motorola HS850 performs much worse than my much older Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset.

My one dislike would be that perhaps because of my hair type while I'm washing it, it's kind of hard to run my hands through my hair but I'll probably just get the conditioner along with it next time,i strongly recommend you try this out you'll love it but if you have hair like mine do get the conditioner along with it and you'll never want to use another shampoo again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shampoo!","review":"My hair has always been dry, not anymore. This stuff is great! It not only washes the hair but conditions the scalp and hair. My hair feels great and I am not bathing in harsh toxic shampoo anymore.

I HIGHLY recommend you give this one a try, I doubt you will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great for my hair","review":"I wanted so badly for this product to do great things for my somewhat fine, straight tresses. Unfortunately, within a few days, my hair was seriously dried out, even with the use of the conditioner in the same line. Also, I tend to have an allergic reaction to many organic or natural hair care products, and this was no exception. Within a few hours of my shower, my scalp and hair line were itchy and full of little bumps. I tried for 3 or 4 days but finally conceded that this product wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves my hair full and soft","review":"I have thin, fine, straight hair and this product gives my hair lots of body.

With all the chemicals we are exposing ourselves and the environment to, it was nice to find a shampoo that leaves everyone healthier. It has a great smell and leaves my hair shiny and clean. It does suds up but not as fluffy as other shampoos and some people may expect lots of suds. Since my only concern is clean hair without chemicals it didn't bother me. I highly recommend this product and feel safe using it on my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mattes your hair","review":"I ordered this shampoo for my natural 4b type hair.

I would not recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Lathers nicely and leaves hair nice and clean. I bought it solely for the non toxic aspect of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Shampoo EVER","review":"I paid over $10 for this stuff and it is an absolute nightmare. The shampoo is like trying to work glue through your hair. You have to use SOOOO much and your hair ends up feeling like it has sludge in it. You cant even get your fingers thru it (and I have soft water!!). The conditioner is fine but the shampoo is terrible. My hair still ended up turning green in the pool and this shampoo did nothing to prevent it nor get the green out. What a waste of money! I'm going back to the health food store and demanding my money back. I posted a similar review on Aubrey Organic's website, I doubt they'll even post it. This product may be ok as a simple shampoo for little boys with no hair but if you have blonde hair or any hair at all--this shampoo will tear the crap out of your hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Automatic and Hassle Free Protection!","review":"I love this product! The backup occurs in the background. I can select the files I want and when to have it backed up...incrementally at every 30 minutes (or 40 or 50) or during idle or at a set time!

It is nothing but a dumb switch.Makes me wonder what the purpose of this is.This company uses a call center outside the US, presumably in India.

You plug one port into the rest of your network, everything else into the other ports. Plug in the power cord. At this point, quality switches will function properly and unobtrusively. Junk won't. If the switch draws your attention at all, it isn't good.Once I connected everything, I was able to forget about this thing, and that's what you want. I use mine in a home theater application, so the ethernet jacks around the back of the unit provide an aesthetic benefit over those that have the jacks on the unit's face. If you're trying to connect a bunch of entertainment equipment, this is definitely a unit you should consider, but it will also excel in any 10/100 ethernet application as well.What more is there to say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality switch for home or SOHO needs","review":"This is my third purchase of the D-Link \\"Green\\" series switches.

I hooked this up in the Family room and connected the two boxes to the switch. That was it. Nothing to set up or configure, it just worked. Both units have Internet access and work great.

It does exactly what a switch is supposed to do. If you don't know what a switch does, you probably don't want this. The reason I bought this (and a D-Link DGS-1008G) was to replace another DES-1105 and DGS-1008G that both failed due to a power surge. Not too surprising since the surge also knocked out quite a few other devices. Unfortunately these BOTH failed about three weeks later during another storm, but this time nothing else was affected.

In this book of just 150 pages, he does a good job of adequately covering a very extensive history of one of the world's great religions.However, I don't think what the author set out to do can really be adequately accomplished in such a brief book.

Pitchers, quarterbacks, and point guards all lose their extraordinary skills, or at least have bad days, so why not writers? Any \\"Rockford Files\\" script gives us a better exasperated L.A. anti-hero than this Mickey Murphy stereotype. The minor characters in _Violent Ward_ are almost as cartoonish. (And what's with the title? It's pretty bad when the blurb has to try to explain it.)Deighton's over-detailed descriptions of clothing remind me of a Nancy Drew novel. But the worst part of reading _Ward_ is the feeling I get that this is a British writer pretending he's a lifelong American. Britishisms such as \\"rang off\\" instead of hung up and \\"ramp\\" instead of driveway reinforce this irritating dent to the story's credibility.Other critics ask, Well, what's a spy novelist to do now that the Cold War is over?

I believe if you couple this book with Collins'How The Mighty Fall: And Why Some Companies Never Give In, you can see the undoings of many of the major airlines, Lehman Brothers, Enron, Healthsouth, and many others interwoven between the texts.

While the title is Made in Italy, the book really could have been Made on Google.

You can go to any local supermarket in Italy or the US. This book might be helpful to someone who has NEVER been to Italy as an overview of each region.

With guys self injecting [at home] today once a week, or twice a week or even every other day, the problems cited by the author do not exist.The book, lacks information* on how to find a TRT/HRT competent doctor and what to ask for. Sadly, one can easily know more about these things than most doctors. Finding a good TRT/HRT doctor is close to impossible for many.* This seems to be common fault with Doctor written TRT related books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I loved this book.

Hence people do not like them and do not wear them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-comfortable","review":"I already had the older version and thought that these would be better because of the higher Db rating. It seems that for some reason ZEM redesigned the head-band as well and the new head-band is shorter than the old one. It might work OK for someone with a small head or a woman or a child but for an adult male it is just too short to go over my head without being too tight. Kind of boggled my mind why they would even change the head-band, the older version works well and I still use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted!","review":"Although I had no prior experience with ZEM hearing protection all of the reviews on this type of protection indicated that it would that care of my needs very well.

Normal voice-level sound is muffled, making speech hard to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Really Work","review":"My hearing is really sensitive. I got these to wear to Spinning Class -- could not bear the loud music. The Zems work so well -- takes the edge off the boom boom boom but you can still hear the instructor perfectly. At home I use them when the neighbors are mowing or weed-wacking, or when my husband is running equipment in his basement wood shop.

They are very lightweight in comparison to the muff type and they are comfortable enough for the job they do, considering that they do need to fit tight enough to keep out a firearms report. I only used them once, but so far I am satisfied with my Zim product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"I wasn't sure how well they would work but a little research online prompted me to take a chance. They are comfy, take a couple of minutes to get used too, and for them to form to your ears, but after that they fit great! Light weight too! They fold up and fit in your pocket! The nice thing about them is they don't actually go into your ear canal like plugs or other bands do, they seal the opening to the canal, so they are not itchy or uncomfortable!! Highly recommend! Price could be better, but not much to save your hearing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great guide!","review":"These cards are a small reminder of Linda Goodman's Star Signs.

Take for instance the WTC attack. This happened on the 11th day and if you read what the number means you will see that this world's energy runs on an orderly method and these cards hit close to home.

I avoid sugar as much as possible and these biscuits actually taste good without being sweet. You can actually taste the turkey and stuffing flavors. Another thing is wheat is very difficult for dogs to properly digest. Dogs are carnivores. Grains are not good for dogs. I like the fact that they're wheat-free and human-grade organic treats. They're a little on the expensive side as cookies go, but most healthy foods (whether for dogs or humans) are expensive.

Donald Crews gives a childs-eye view of the fair, capturing well the sense of noisy excitement and fun that pervades the event. His bright colors, flashing against a darkened sky, show the rides and games up well, and it's almost possible to hear the hawkers inviting visitors to try out the games. In this fair there are no animals competing for prizes, only games, food, and rides; but there is an enjoyable self-portrait of the author on page seven. As always, Crews captures the mood of a complex social phenomenon with what looks like effortless skill.This book, with its bright colors, minimal text, and easy-to-understand pictures, and general sense of excitement, is a good choice for preschoolers who will soon attend (or who wish to relive) a local fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice ring, but....","review":"My husband picked this ring out because he thought it was cool that titanium is so strong.

Although the idea is not new, he presents it through an interesting framework called the Knowledge Life Cycle. Thats great.On the other hand, since the book is a compilation of previous papers from the author, I feel that he repeats the same ideas over and over again. I couldn't find explicit evidence of the aplication of these ideas on the day to day work. I also see a contradiction in the sense that he says that the new KM is more about creating new knowledge, but it seems to me that he is trying to create new knowledge through the re-frasing and re-naming of other author's ideas.

How did something that should have started as a gulag get so powerful?Instead we get an action story. That in itself is not bad, but there's not much character exposition so I couldn't tell much difference between the Psi-Corp telepaths and the underground telepaths.A wasted opportunity that could have been much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good solid read for B5 fans, or even those who aren't.","review":"Keyes has written an excellent B5 novel with none of the B5 characters in it. This first novel of a trilogy sets the tone, and lays down the groundwork for the novels to follow. B5 fans will enjoy the plot, and the references to ancestors to some of the B5 characters we know already. Readers new to the B5 universe can enjoy the story apart from the rest of the arc, without really missing anything. A good read, and I'm looking forward to the other books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was great!","review":"I thought this was a great book!

It was a little confusing on the timing, expecially the Alexander ladies, but if one is into B5, and other authors that do this (McCaffrey is one), it's not hard. The correlation of ancestors to show characters is awesome, and I can't wait until the other 2 in this series, and the Centauri Prime trilogy come out - they will fill in blanks from the show nicely!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"insight into Psi Corps","review":"I was intrigued and disappointed by the telepaths in the Babylong Five television series -- too much about the normals! I snatched up this book as soon as I found it. I was not disappointed. The characters seem believable and the action fast paced. Leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for fans of the series....","review":"\\"Dark Genesis\\" gives a concise history of the origins of the Psi Corps, and some of the hidden forces and secret agendas that made it what it was during the time covered by the show. Possibly the most interesting aspect of the book is the moral ambiguity; it is not at all clear that the Corps is bad and the resistance good. The Corps, in the beginning, is a tool of the Vorlons, while the resistance fighters, whether they know it or not, advance the ideology of the Shadows. From the viewpoint of normal humans, both are potentially dangerous enemies. It was also interesting to see the histories of the bloodlines that will ultimately give rise to the final leaders of the two factions, Alfred Bester and Lyta Alexander. All in all, a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to do too much.","review":"I went into this book looking forward to learning more of the history of the Psi Corp, the group I loved to hate from the Babylon 5 TV show. I was disappointed, however. This book covers the birth of the Psi Corp after the discovery of Telepaths on earth. It also covers the resistance movement during the early years. However, it tries to cover too much territory. The action takes place over 100 years and includes a couple generations of characters. As a result, it doesn't appear to be really focused on anything or anyone. It comes across as more of a history then a novel.This book is interesting reading for the Babylon 5 fan, but not an engrossing novel. The other two books in this trilogy do focus the characters and action more, so I hope that when I get a chance to read them I will like them better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries and falls flat","review":"Babylon 5 is one of my all-time favorite shows. I decided that I wanted to see what else was offered in JMS's amazing universe and happened across this book first. I thought that learning the origins of the Psi Corps and the station's favorite telepath would be fun. Instead, I dragged myself through page after page of dull accounts and rapidly cycling characters and political dullness. I'm hoping that the books about Londo Molari are more interesting than this one was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much, too quick, too sloppy","review":"As a bigtime Babylon 5 fan, I was eagerly awaiting this book. Guess I shouldn't be surprised that it feel victim to Sturgeon's law, that 90% of all media SF is crud.The major problem with the book is that it hops through time, with no consideration towards the readers. It would be nice to be told the date, instead of just having a character suddenly get really old.Major events are skipped over, characters switch names so as to make it impossible to keep track of them. There's little description, so keeping minor characters set is next to impossible. Major characters are just hard to keep track of. I mean, who the hell can keep track when you've got Blodo and Larry and Ms. Alexander and Monkey and Mick Foley and Dude Love alll over the place.Put basically, it staggers like an epilectic who just suffered a severe electric shock. I look forward to B5 books that maintain the great storytelling quality that the show is renowned for. I just won't hold my breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent Babylon 5 adventure","review":"Based on notes made by Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski, J. Gregory Keyes has created a novel that covers a pivotal event in the B5 universe, the birth of the Psi Corps. The story consistently entertains as it spans the better part of the 22nd century while exploring the individuals, events and reasons behind the formation the infamous telepath organization. Besides the great storyline, Keyes also delivers very believable characters and great action sequences that add to the enjoyment of the novel. By balancing these critical elements, J. Gregory Keyes has created a novel that enriches the Babylon 5 universe and leaves the reader eagerly awaiting the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping start.","review":"An in-depth look at how Telepaths came to \\"appear\\" on Earth and a somewhat controversial background on the development and rise of the Psi Corps. The book lacked the development of some of the characters, but it was necessary to move the story along. There were a few hidden agendas ala Bester, I might add. Overall, this is a wonderfully, well-written book. The one thing that was not covered was the method used to rate the telepaths. It would have been interesting to see where they drew the line in telepathic abilities to classify the 'P' rating (P1 - P12 or higher). It didn't stop me from reading the trilogy twice so far, and I have begun reading this book a third time. This is an interesting and engaging Trilogy. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written and Uninteresting","review":"After reading the Technomage and Centauri trilogies, this the first book of the Bester trilogy was very disappointing. It seems to be poorly written, unentertaining, and understandable only by the most hard core of fans. Those other authors managed to write stories that almost stand on their own, even if you haven't seen Babylon 5 TV series you could get into their plot arcs, care about the characters and be entertained. Even worse it seems this novel entirely lacks the Straczynski-esque tone and humor of those other trilogies that really made Babylon 5 an epic story.This novel may be worthwhile to read only if you are a big fan of the series and you want to learn more canon background information.

As a matter of fact when I saw this in theatre, there was a person who commented the movie most the time saying \\"this is boring\\" etc.I recommend this movie to people who wants to see something different...if you have seen it, watch it again...maybe it's better on the second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Cinematography","review":"Too many people are going to be drawn to this film because they think it is supposed to be overly \\"sexy.\\" The most beautiful parts of the movie will be lost on those people. The lighting and cinematography are first rate (as you would expect) and the secondary characters are beautiful in their own human way. The two prostitutes, while representing the beginning and ending of the \\"career\\" are still sweet, caring women. Nicole Kidman gives an Oscar-worthy performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"Eyes Wide Shut was creatively filmed but the story was unsettling.

If there was, it was lost on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It felt like a waste of time","review":"I watched this film with a friend and we were both becoming irritated with the slow build up and the initial lack of direction. However, as the intrigue and the atmosphere of the film built up (particularly the music in the \\"House\\" scenes), it felt like we were going to be rewarded with a crunching finale with mind-blowing twists. It wasn't to be: the sense of being cheated by the film's abrupt and anticlimatic ending felt like a violent slap to the face. Having said this, I haven't stopped thinking about the film and what it was trying to say (if anything). Perhaps this was Kubricks intention. We will never now. I will certainly watch it again, but I won't hold my breath...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment!","review":"I was looking forward to watching this movie with great anticipation, being a long-time Kubrick fan. What a huge disappointment! In brief, the movie was overly long, the plot disjointed and I never really felt much for Cruise or Kidman. It's too bad Kubrick's final movie had to be this one.

Screws Up Kubrick DVD, Again!","review":"A great film vandalised by a stupid decision. Why in the world would Warner Bros. fail to release the DVD edition of this last of Kubrick's great films in standadrd 1:33 format? What is the point of DVD if not to provide home viewers with the highest quality version of its theatrical release print? Why not at least give customers the choice of either format, as so many studios do on their discs?

This Movie was a MESS and So Poorly Done that It is hard to believe that it came from the Great Stanley Kubrick! The Only excuse I can think for this Travesty of a Film is that Mr Kubrick must have been Sick while he was Working on it. Where was all this Hot Sex that was supposed to be taking place between Tom and Nicole. This Film was So SEXLESS that it should have been Rated PG! I actually FELL ASLEEP for a few moments while watching this film, that is how Boring it was! There was No Plot and the Film to me seemed Unedited, even though the official word was that Kubrick had completed the film before he passed away! I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ACADEMY FOR NOT GIVING THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE ANY OSCAR NOMINATIONS! I am shocked that so many of the reviewer's here are raving about this film, they must be relatives of Tom and Nicole!

If the director's original intent was to show explicit SEX during the film's central set piece, WHY can't WE as Americans who are blessed with \\"FREE SPEECH\\" be allowed make up our own minds?This is why the MPAA is totally OUT OF TOUCH with today's culture and sensiblities - they should definitely re-release this on DVD so at least we can finally see the \\"naughty bits\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ludricrous, Stifling Bore","review":"I won't attempt to add much to the conversation, other than to say than to say that I admire Kubrick, but don't admire anything about this film... the scenes with the masks, the dialog when cruise is asked to remove his clothes, is only one example of how poor this thing really is, and if it wasn't a Kubrick film I would have stopped watching right there....save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing mess","review":"As a fan of Stanley Kubrick, I had been eagerly anticipating this film. I can now say how disappointed I am. While Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, and the rest of this cast are all solid, the story, and especially the way it is delivered both takes forever to develop and frustrates.The dialogue takes forever for the actors to say, and I often felt like if I made hand gestures, it might help to speed up the story out of their mouths.Certain aspects of the story, characters, and entire scenes serve no purpose at all in this film, other than to elongate it.However, as for the now-famous orgy scene, it is certainly one of the most fascinating and bizarre sequences in recent film.I can't help but feel sorry for the cast and crew, who, while they put forth such a strong effort, end up in such a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"This is NOT a date movie. Except for the awesome sex scene and Nicole writhing around, there was not much to keep a man busy. My wife was so turned off I couldn't convince her to get romantic, even after all of the chocolate we had. The story telling was long and drawn out. Nicole does a horrible job portraying this woman; the worst acting I've seen from her.

Unfortunately, the Blu-Ray does not upgrade/enhance the picture quality significantly over the DVD version. Using a Panasonic Blu-Ray player with a 50-inch Panasonic plasma screen TV, the quality of the picture was mediocre if not poor. There was visible pixelation and the colors did not 'pop'. This stands in contrast with the other Blu-Ray movies I have purchased and my OTA HD TV signal. Overall, disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Was it real? Was it a dream? what the heck? All the people who gave it 4 or 5 stars seem to think they are deep thinkers. I saw the movie and i think you are all reading way to much into it. I mean really the movie is about a bunch of rich people who have orgys in secret places. This movie was painfully long and very perverse. To be honest if it wern't for Kudro or whatever his name is I dont think anyone would like it. I think some people force themselves to like it because they think there impressng somebody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"No plot....too much of Nicole loving her body....no storyline whatsoever.

Thank god I didn't waste my time to go see it atthe theater and instead waited for it to come out on video because I surely would have been upset having had spent 3 hours in a theater watching this.There were so many unanswered questions and conversations seemed to take hours instead of seconds. There was no real purpose to this film I thought. It just dragged on and on and on. There were a few things that took me by surprise, but nothing really worthwhile. And the annoying piano music which was also evident in his film 'The Shining' was like listening to fingernails on a blackboard. It was neither \\"thought provoking\\" nor a \\"masterpiece,\\" but rather a very overrated attempt at film making. Why people are calling this brilliant and Kubrick's finest film ever I'll never understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful ...just awful","review":"This movie was utter nonsense and I really don't understand why people feel they have to make excuses for this kind of crap as if its \\"art\\" ..or there's some deeper meaning.

At times, the movie progressed soooo slow that even someone with an attention deficit disorder wouldn't have missed anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eyes Wide Shut","review":"They say Kubrick died so that he wouldn't have to see this film. I can only hope this is the case. If you are mired in middle class virtues and have never ventured far from home, you may find this enlightening. Otherwise, this is an ode to the non-adventurous, the non-artistic, and will confirm you in all your beliefs that what you have settled for in life is fine and good. Unless you are very young, or have learned very little in the course of your life, you will learn nothing from this film. As a great fan of Dr. Strangelove, 2001, and A Clockwork Orange, I can only say that we are all allowed mediocrities in our lives, some earlier, some later. I adore Kubrick's classic earlier work. Unfortunately, this film takes no risks, and therefore does not exist, even remotely, in the same class. Don't waste your time. Remember his greatness...and forget this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent, don't buy. In fact, don't rent!","review":"Many of these reviews are very in depth in their analysis and critique but I will be very brief and blunt. This movie was terrible, it did sound intriguing in the theatrical trailer because they didn't tell you much of the plot, which was only partially promising. The film dragged on for so long in some parts that you wondered if you'd missed something very important. I don't even think that shortening the running time would have made it easier to digest. It's sad to see that this was the end of an engaging and succesful career (Kubrick's) and definitely not Cruise's or Kidman's best work together or separately. Do not waste your money in any way on this movie (I'm still upset that I spent 8 bucks on it in the theaters)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy, Rent, or Watch This","review":"I should have followed the advice of the title of this movie and kept MY EYES SHUT for this movie. This movie made \\"Howard the Duck\\" look like a classic.If you are a wanna be upper east side, art loving, $8 coffee drinking, 35 year old, pierced nose person and want to discuss Stanley Kubrick's incredible direction and flow of the movie, buy this movie.But if you want to be entertained, run from this movie. It's not thought provoking, I think this is Kubrick's practical joke to the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eyes Wide Shut","review":"One of Kubrick's best. Superb performances by Cruise and Kidman.The story slowly draws you into the minds of the characters, especially Cruise's character who finds himself suddenly overtaken by emotions of jealousy and desire to be followed by fear and finally guilt. Kidman as his wife delivers one of most memorable dialogs with absolute perfection. Note Sydney Pollack who appears in the movie. Sydney is an actor, director and producer of many hit movies, his acting is natural and smooth, a true perfessional for sure. This was Kubrick's last movie and his final masterpiece and he kept it true to the Kubrick tradition of the highest quality of motion picture making in cast, crew, and script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film, but a disappointing DVD","review":"I just picked this up because I saw the film over the summer and was stunned by it. The DVD, however, contains that CGI changes that forced the film into an R rating. In addition, it isn't even widescreen. It seems like Warner Brothers has decided to go ahead and create the worst DVD possible. It's quite a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, the film's incredible, and I look forward to watchining it over and over to catch the different layers of complexity that hide behind its disturbing story. Cruise and Kidman are at the height of their acting skills (they both should have been nominated for academy awards) and the story, with the repetitions of each scene during the night and during the day, is eerie and fascinating. It also says a lot about experience and adultery and the problems they can cause in modern society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"Kubrick's final film is a lasting work of art, funneling touches of Bunuel surrealism through the authoritative tracking shots of the late director. Kubrick seems to be making an homage to himself, with the deliberateness of \\"Barry Lyndon\\" and the austerity of \\"The Shining.\\" In all, a fitting triumph for Kubrick, on par with the late works of Welles, Kurosawa, or Bergman. When he died, America lost its greatest film director at the moment, a man who took the medium up to his level, creating one icy and cryptic masterpiece after another. Other than Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen, no other American comes close."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film as enigmatic as its director...","review":"Kubrick's final film is a fitting tribute to its visionary director. I have watched it several times and each time it leaves me with different ideas, questions, and theories. The acting is incredible (including a surpisingly good performance by director Sidney Lumet), and the cinematography and photography reveal Kubrick at his best since \\"Barry Lyndon\\". \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" will please Kubrick fans, however it may purplex and bore mainstream viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong wrong wrong","review":"You folks are nuts. Sorry, I adore Kubrick myself, but this film is just terrible and in Ameria the most beautiful photographed scene is exasperatingly mauled.I've no doubt it might have turned out better had Kubrick had more time to tinker but in its present form, aside from his ever skillful camera direction, the film is utterly mediocre. Several scenes make the teeth grind. The acting is abominable - Nicole Kidman acting \\"stoned\\" is eerily like William Shatner.Alas, if only the orgy were intact it might be worth a look but as is, your money is better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"View it on video before buying this one","review":"I'm giving this movie only one star and it pains me to do that. This movie was so awful and boring I could not stick with it. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's acting are very stiff and forced and that stupid one-tone-key piano playing throught out the movie just drove me crazy. Before the movie was released all any entertainment magazines and/or shows talked about its strong sexual conent. There wasn't a good enough story so the director through in a lot of sex. It sounds just like \\"Showgirls\\" to be. All that hype and then nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't misunderstand","review":"I think movie gives great insight to how a married relationship can be, I just think that some of the scenes, however symbolic they are, can be very inaccurate and inappropriate.Tom Cruise plays the part of a devastated husband who found out that his wife \\"almost\\" had an affair with another man. When he finds out he takes the approach, rather than talk with his wife, we decides to try and give it right back to her by having an affair with another woman. Now some men might have that reaction and immediatley would go to that route, however it takes him to places where sex in meaningless, to the point where everyone wears masks to hide their identity. This may have proven symbolic to what Cruise's charecter was looking for, but not a very good stereotype/generalization.The story is good, the plot completley unbelievable. That is why the rating is so low. Some say it's misunderstood, I think it was mis-represented."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I wish I had read Mr. Mylott's review prior to seeing this film, it could've saved me the three tortuous hours, and he says it all perfectly. I love everything else Kubrick has done, and was set to love this film. Sadly, this is a waste of good actors and beautiful sets, and a poor end to Kubrick's brilliant career. Remember him for his masterpieces--Full Metal Jacket, and \\"2001\\" for the greatest opening sequence in film ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex lives of the living dead...","review":"Amazing that anyone would find anything redeeming about this sad debacle. It's Stanley Kubrick doing (serious) Woody Allen, right down to the Sydney Pollack cameo. Stultifyingly paced, it's the best sleep inducer I've ever experienced. This is the kind of vehicle that mainstream hollywood would have cast Michael Douglas & Kathleen Turner in, & that might have given it some humor & punch. The plot is laughable. It worked fine as a period fantasy, but it sure creaks & flops in a contemporary context, not that this movie has any kind of context at all. It's strangely a-contextual. There's not anything resembling a real live 3-d human being anywhere on the screen. Even all those nude women (no nude men) look like products of a corporate committee. How sad. I'll remember Kubrick for Dr. Strangelove, The Killing & Barry Lyndon, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stanley Kubrick never disappoints","review":"Only Kubrick can have me watch Tom Cruise without cringing through the entire movie. This movie showcases Tom's talent in a way where the watcher forgets the utter ridiculousness of his real/personal life that involves Scientology. Of course Kidman is a sight for sore eyes while she leaves the viewer in awe of her unique strength and vulnerability."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is the best of the decade","review":"This is by far the best movie of the decade. And thats all there is to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You think you're smart...","review":"Well then this is the movie for you. Go have a ball withit...it'll keep you talking for hours about how powerful it was, howmoving, how thought provoking... Then, once you've reasoned it out, rationalized in your mind why the film deserves to have taken up so much celluloid that would have served us better as \\"Con Air\\" sequels, explain to the world, or why you are giving it five stars.Here's what I say this film is about, and why I give it 1 star (for technical brilliance alone).A happy couple decides that they despise each other, want an affair, then love each other and want to work things out (or rather, f---) all in 24 hours.Just because Kubrick made 2001 and Barry Lyndon doesn't mean he's flawless, and just because you went to film school doesn't make you a critic. In the end, this movie will be forever remembered as a mindless, juvenile sex romp and, I am deighted to say, will never rank among the classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really bad film!","review":"How could anyone make a boring movie involving murder and sex? Well, Stanley Kubrick has! This film trudges along at such a slow pace that even the most devote film enthusiast will be fighting to stay awake. At 2 1/2 hours, the film is vastly overlong and this is evident from the first scene that involves a party that never seems to end. The acting is okay although Nicole Kidman's character is annoying. Fortunately, her scenes are minimal. Photography and set decoration is excellent with rich saturated colors and impressive houses and decor. This is the film's only redeeming quality. The whole feel of the film can be summarized by Nicole Kidman's final line. Stanley Kubrick has made some of our most memorable films and it is sad that this had to be his swan song. And how wasteful that the actors involved in took so much time out of their lives. Truly one of the worst films I have seen in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a nightmare!","review":"The music, nerve jangling. The movie, absolutely one of the WORST pieces of trash I have ever seen. It is beyond my comprehension how people could like this movie. It moved at a snails-pace and the actors looked as if they were sleepwalking through the entire film. I didn't like or feel empathy for any character in the film. It was just too weird with too much going on! I've liked some of Kubricks films, but not this one. People are just making a big fuss over it because he's dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment!","review":"I've enjoyed all of his other films. But this one is a sure cure for insomnia.

I'd rent this one before buying it, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD FILM","review":"This is a very bad movie. The acting is poor, the script trite, and editing less than decent, and the plot has more holes than swiss cheese. This movie was entirely bland and Nicole and Tom had no chemistry to speak of. The beginning of the movie was embarrassing and foolish. This movie gets two thumbs down, and all ten toes for that matter!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it so you can say you saw it -- but that's all","review":"Plan 9 From Outer Space had a more comprehensible plot, and held my attention better, too.Tom Cruise seemed very concerned about something through much of the movie -- probably that it took 2 years to shoot this baffling, meandering mess. Oh, I suppose the intelligentsia can sip double decaf espressos and ponder the deeper meaning of it all, but I'll take a Top Gun over this snoozer any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"terrible!! boring as hell. baaaaaad choice. wasted our time. we heard someone mentioned it and said it was a mind opener. trust me that is a mind closer, if you know what i mean. i prefer much more eventful mind opener movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I purchased this DVD for my husband.

It's full of vulgarity and one of the most nonsensical story lines ever created. As a result, I will never watch another movie with Cruise or Kidman in it. It was a total waste of so-called talent. Cruise seemed to think that everything was funny, with the stupid grin on his face, almost through the entire movie and Kidman didn't have any qualms about using the F-word, no matter how many moviegoers she might be offending. This has to be one of the worst movies Stanley Kubrick ever directed and it's a black mark on his movie-making career."},{"rating":"1","title":"eyes wide shut","review":"The title says it all keep your eyes wide open because you will get bored so quickly they will slam shut.

Sorry guys you completely lost the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid like the plague","review":"This movie should be avoided at all costs. I started watching it and I turned to stone. It was as enjoyable as watching Medusa. Please, stay away! Tom and Nicole are still in therapy over this thing.

It is strange and ....!"},{"rating":"1","title":"how can i rate crap?","review":"Okay I know that some people like movies this lame but to me this movie just out right sucked! I am not a fan of Kubrick's the only reason I saw this was because my brother said the movie was good, and come on! I was generally apalled at the poor excuse to make an edited porn for people too watch that wasn't rated NC17 or XXX...it was just stupid, and very sad. I mean this movie had no real plot. It is about a Doctor who gets involded with hookers and cheating on his wife, (not like it doesn't happen everyday) evntually finding out about gatherings that this group of maniacal party goers, who have big orgies. This is the basic plot, the music is diturbing only because it's got a shallow repetition, and the acting was terrible. Now the direction i don't even want to go there, come on Kubrick...I mean geez...Anyway, the basic sum of this evil is that it sucks, you shouldn't waste your money watching a damn three hour movie of crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"About 30 years too late","review":"You'll love this movie if: 1) The fact that women have sexual fantasies is a huge revelation to you. 2) You think that women swearing are shocking. 3) You are really turned on by imagery of the feudal church.If not, skip this pretentious attempt at shock art. Kubrick is attempting to upset sexual mores that were shattered over 30 years ago. -yawn-"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pointless movie","review":"This movie has the most juvenile plot that I've encountered since 'Swordfish'. I can just imagine a bunch of 16 year old boys commenting on the cool T&A. I love quirky movies. I enjoy leisurely pacing. This movie is just dumb. And Nicole Kidman can't act (Tom is not much better)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Plot?","review":"This Boring movie goes nowhere; it has no plot and I could barely sit through it. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidmans worst role ever! Maybe this movie hit a little to close to home for the both of them. Too bad Stanley Kubrick couldnt have made a better movie before he died. The whole movie is about fantasy and desire and sex with other partners and them thinking about cheating on eachother. This movie was degrading and a waste of my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AHHHHHHHHHHHHH","review":"[...], I would. My friend forced me to watch this movie and I can understand why he likes it: it's nothing but naked women, naked women, and more naked women. Nicole Kidman was so melodramatic, Tom Cruise wasn't much better - the characters had no redeeming qualities...I really didn't care about what happened to any of them. And I never did figure out the point of the movie. This movie is basically a cleaned up porno, but I daresay that even a porn would have a more interesting plotline..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good thing about the movie is ....","review":"Nicole Kidman nude. She has a very firm and toned butt, a flat stomach, and a beautiful body. There are some other sexy nude women in the movie too. That's the only reason it deserves two stars -- for the erotic element.But there are too many negative things about the movie: no plot, no reasonable ending for the suspense generated, scenes hanging loose without explanation...you get the idea. The entire movie is surrrealistic. Be warned: if you watch the movie expecting a sexy thriller, you WILL be disappointed. It's way too long (2Hrs:39Mins) to waste.I can compare it to \\"Random hearts\\" as one of the worst mainstream movies ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"More worth renting than buying...","review":"I found myself minimally entertained, though mostly annoyed while watching \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\". Though the plot was provokative and thought-stirring, the way each character seemed to speak in the same repetitive manner got under my skin after the first 10 minutes. For example, someone would say, \\"I think you life's in danger.\\" And the other person would reply, \\"You think my life's in danger?\\" This echoing went on in every dialogue exchange. It was nice to see Tom and Nicole together, but the roles didn't seem to bring out the best in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, so Kubrick didn't save his best for last...","review":"This was still an excellent film in many ways! And certain parts of it were really surprisingly erotic! I thought Tom & Nicole were well-cast, and even though I left the theater somewhat mystified as to what-the-heck-was-that-all-about, I still enjoyed it, and was (as always) impressed with Kubrick's unique style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eyes Wide Shut","review":"This could very well be the hallmark of Kubrick's work. This is his last film and in my opinion one that will match 2001 and The Shining. It has overtones of both of these masterpieces and I was riveted to the intensity of the story.I waited some time before seeing it because of word of mouth....not good. Well it is and it should be seen, but perhaps not ever clearly understood."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Stan smoking?","review":"\\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" makes no sense whatsoever. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it somehow managed to make more sense than \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\"From beginning to end this film just meandered around. It seemed like the actors were just being placed into scenes, rather than being compelled or driven by a story or cause.I don't know where else to go with this review. Not that I am enthralled by either, but Tom and Kim were wasted on this story. Not Kubrick's greatest. See \\"2001\\", \\"Full Metal Jacket\\", or \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" if you want a good Kubric movie.If curiosity has the best of you, fight it, or do no more than rent it to see the madness for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ban this DVD!","review":"Not only does this movie NOT contain the original version as filmed by Kubrick--it is FULL SCREEN! Can you imagine not having a widescreen version of this film? Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good film from the hands of a master","review":"I watched it recently with an open mind and found it to be verygood--beautifully shot, well-acted, lovingly created. While Kubrickhas certainly had better stories to work with in the past, this story held my interest throughout. And the visuals alone make it worth a rental. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in the unique, enduring vision of Kubrick or to anyone interested in an off-beat, non-Hollywoodish evening of provocative entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"eyes wide shut","review":"kubrick is the real star of the film. notice the colors, the complex characters, and the dream like world they choose to live in. kubrick ends his career with a profound look at trust, introspection, and curiosity. if you think this is going to be some cheap skin flick like \\"basic instinct\\", you are better off renting \\"color of night\\" or \\"jade\\". this movie is not one of those, it stands alone. it's hypnotic and dreamlike. it's unique and incomparable. it's kubrick and you need'nt say more. watch in a quiet enviroment and keep and open mind. you'll see what i mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delight For Eye And Mind","review":"Aesthetically, this is the most beautiful film I have experienced till now. Eyes Wide Shut is simply a delight for your eye - but as much for your mind. 'Cause the story comes around every dark corner of the human sexuality, without ever becoming moralizing flattening or going into klichés.Tom Cruise was criticized for his acting in the film, and Nicole Kidman was highly praised. Strange. 'Cause Cruise plays the only real leading act - we follow him through nearly the entire film - and he does it brilliantly.A beautiful, marvellous film. One of the very best in years!!The short story that inspired the film, A Dream Novel by Arthur Schnitzler, as well as the soundtrack are highly recommendable as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order the DVD from Europe/ get Zone 2 player","review":"This version was corrupted in Zone 1 by US Censors actaing against the vision of the Director. Unfortunately, having died he wasn't around to rectify the problem in a \\"Director's Cut\\". The closest to that would be a European version that is uncut -- unfortunately even the European version isn't full screen. Note that you must have a modern, zone-selectable DVD player to play alternately Zone'd movies. Make sure the zone is manually \\"lockable\\" as some movies won't play in multi-auto-zone players.

This is a waste of time and money on transfer from DVD to HD-DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated film","review":"I don't know what's the big deal about this movie that it's one of the best sellers. It's dragging and pointless. The best part is the conversation (arguement)between Cruise and kidman in the bedroom. Other than that, everything else is just very dry and plain. If you like the combination of Cruise and Kidman, then you've gotta watch Far and Away. Now, that's a quality movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointment","review":"The fact that the set design and cinematography were the best parts of this film proves that Kubrik finished his career with his worst film. The score had to be the most monotonous thing that I have ever heard, and this is one of the many places where Kubrik's films usually shine. Add to that awkward dialogue and a poor performance by Nicole Kidman, and you have a movie that I wish was never released, for Kubrik's sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and uninspiring","review":"This was a BAD movie. Not only was it boring, it also gave you no emotional connection to its characters. The main revelation seems to be that, (NEWS FLASH!) women think about sex, too. I was especially saddened that the conclusions the couple reached after their mutual mistakes were that 1) the word \\"forever\\" made the wife nervous and 2) they needed to go home right away and ...s. And this in the midst of a crowded department store while taking their young daughter Christmas shopping. Wow! That's romantic! Talk about the love of a lifetime! I'm sorry that Tom and Nicole wasted so much time and effort for so little reward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Well, I was warned about this film, but I had to waste my money at Blockbuster. If you are the type of viewer who enjoys films that make no sense, go no where, and every incident dipicted is never referred to and means absoulutely nothing to the ending, this is the film for you. This film will provoke your thoughts alright, WONDERING WHAT IN THE WORLD YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THAT YOU ACTUALLY SPENT MONEY ON! Reviewers who claim that one needs to view the film several times in order to understand it, need to get a life. If you just want to view a good film that leaves you satisfied with the reason why certain things happened, you must go elsewhere. The only good thing I saw in this film was Nicole Kidman's dainty back side, and that only lasts a few seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Maybe if the director had lived long enough to edit his movie then it would have been better. Unfortunately the result is just a horrible filmThe casting of Cruise was a mistake. When I saw this in the theatre, the audience started screaming at the screen half way through the film. It was so horrible and being a long film it was just torture. Many people asked for a refund from the movie theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated, distended, and lurid as an over-sated royal corpse.","review":"Even the superfluity of formal nicety can't redeem this pretentious movie by one of cinema's most over-rated directors. What of it is being celebrated as psycho-sexual insight is simply platitudinous. Kubricks's despotic and fatuous self-assurance is oppressively evident in its merciless length, its arbitrarily long pauses in the midst of vacuous speech, its gratutiously voyeuristic nudity, and in the directorially enforced blandness (and, on occasion, freakishness) of the acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"I felt like this was a movie I \\"should\\" watch so I could be in-the-know with everyone who talks about it. Because I was about 10 years old when it came out, I obviously wasn't allowed to watch it at the time. Anyway, I thought it was really boring and weird. It wasn't what I was expecting at all. I didn't mind the sex/nudity, just the plot was really strange. I don't know, I can't describe it. I definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone. :/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent story, but poorly done.","review":"I was curious so I had to watch this movie. I did not understand any of this movie other than it seemed like Nicole's character expressed concerns about their sex life and then Tom's character explores an explicit sex realm. It's like a couple hour hardcore porn with a story is how I saw it. I honestly did not like this movie as I saw no point to it. It's good for in-depth thinkers but terrible as entertainment!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsmurfy...","review":"My wife and I did not enjoy this unsmurfalicious film. It was so not up to par with the rest of Kubrick's films. I'd rather sit and watch Gargamail sing happy songs to butterflies than have to sit through this junk again. This was one smurfed up film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Swan Song!","review":"Stanley Kubrick will always be my favorite movie director, right up there with Hitchcock and Scorsese. But this film is not one of my favorites. The story line is confusing. There are some scenes that are unnecessary (i.e. the doctor with the prostitute). And the length of the movie was brutal. The film could have been chopped off by an hour. As for the sexual content, I thought they could have used more of it. It was a let down. This swan song was a sad ending to a brilliant career."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"This film is apparently not lacking reviews. Here's my $0.02: I don't only go to the movies for action or drama; I find many artsy movies to be entertaining and enjoyable. But with any 'art', appreciation is entirely subjective. To me, this was a painting you'd find in a modern art museum. The one that looked like a monkey splattered the canvas with paint. Beautiful? Maybe to some. Call me the kid that says the emperor's naked, but this film failed to touch me on any level. I could write paragraphs like most of the other reviewers, but there's really no need. I do not recommend this movie not because it's art that I don't appreciate, but because in my opinion I don't believe that it's art at all. Obviously, though, there are others who disagree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eyes Wide Shut (R-Rated Edition) (1999)","review":"Too bad that it was not playable of some scenes-only by scimming-over some scenes could I enjoy this wonderful movie based on a Schnitzler-tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie but not worth all the hype","review":"I thought the movie was good as it dealt with subjects rarely touched on without titilation - Cruise and Kidman do pretty good in all this and the movie is worth watching but unless you are the biggest Kubrick fan this movie is only average. I think it got all its hype because Kubrick died before the movie was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time, waste of film","review":"Did they edit this movie? It goes on and on.

This is a video NO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste Of My Time","review":"So much controversy flew around this film that I thought it had to be worth checking out. The critics didn't like it, so that was another reason to give it a chance. When the end credits began to roll I knew that I had finally found \\"The One\\". I had found what I whole-heartedly call the worst movie of my entire life. Ummm what was the plot? The only reason it's worth 1 start is because Kidman and Cruise obviously did their best to make something of this waste of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Yourself a Favor: Rent before you buy!","review":"I didn't see it onscreen and daringly bought it in DVD format. However, my SIXTH SENSE (subtle promo here) said, \\"Rent it before you open it.\\" I'm glad I did. I expected a picture with eroticism, kinky behavior and, well, soft pornographic filming. It was a little erotic, the impression of kinkiness was attempted, but I've seen harder porn in a Disney movie.I'm the type that likes plot with my erotic filming. I'm not into anything which earns the XXX rating. But I thought this movie would be a little more \\"open.\\" The moment you think you will see something, clever camera angles cover the \\"good stuff\\". I found \\"Basic Instinct\\" and \\"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down\\" a bit more sensual. Neither are pornographic, but can get you going.This is only my opinion. However, I strongly suggest you rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two great actors in a really bad film!","review":"He was outstanding in TopGun and she is brilliant in anything... but this film was a complete waste of effort and a total waste of anyones time watching!

This movie was horrible. Firstly, it was WAY too long, and the horrendous music only intensified the pain of this very slow movie. It was agonizing. I have never heard complete silence in a theatre. All you could hear was people shifting in their seats as they suffered. The acting was awful. The story was stupid. The \\"secret society\\" was ridiculous. I would only recommend this film as torture. And not the good kind.

I have seen basically all of Stanley Kubricks films, and unfortunatly his last was his worst. The story was just so wierd and twisted I didn't even want to finish watching the movie. With all the hype this movie generated, and the actors in the movie, i thought this would be great. Just turned out to be a stinker.Hopefully Steven Spielberg can do Kubricks other project AI some justice in the future, but its unfortunate that this movie had to be so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"This is an utterly rediculous movie. The movie could have been great, had it not been for such an awful ending. The problem, and this is a life lesson for all those reading, is that the whole movie is a build up to nothing, absolutely nothing. I was conned into seeing it by all the hype, but it was a complete catastrophe. If you must see it, though, make sure you stop it before the end. Possibly, just possibly, it will not be ruined for you then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"Probably the single biggest theatrical disappointment of my life. This movie is the only film I have ever seen that I just couldn't bear to sit through. The characters were thin, the plot went no where, and the acting could be likened to a 4th grade christmas pagent. The interaction in the film felt like a crappy sequel to Catcher in the Rye, that is to say all the relationships were one dimentional and felt like they were writen by some psychotic hermit.What made this movie worse than other movies I hated like Battlefield Earth and The Skulls was the great lengths they seemed to go to try to make it \\"artistic\\". Well, that and films like Dr. Strangelove getting my hopes up.If you are the kind of person that likes to try and find deeper meaning in everything so you can feel sophisticated you might like it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated garbage","review":"\\"A Masterpiece,\\" \\"Stunning!\\" These are the words that were used to describe Kubrick's misfire Eyes Wide Shut back in 1999. I remember seeing this at the theater in Houston, waiting for something to happen. About 2 hours into the film, I turned to my friend and said, \\"Where the hell is this going?\\" Sadly, I never found out. This turgid, long, dull and s-l-o-w-l-y paced piece of crap thinks it's making a statement on monogamy and fidelity. Vanilla Sky did it much better, and was far creepier and more interesting. Why does Nicole Kidman speak like she's running out of batteries? Why does nothing happen for 3 hours? Why is the pacing so goddamn awful? This \\"film\\" only goes to show that Kubrick lost his relevance shortly after The Shining. This is the work of a pretentious, crazy hack--hell, it might as well have been made by George Lucas. There's another director who, sadly, thinks he still \\"has something to say.\\" Tragic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!","review":"One word sums this movie. STUPID.

Pathetic","review":"This movie was one of the worst I've seen in 10 years. I will admit that there was a point for about 10 minutes where it the movie became slightly intense, but otherwise the movie was terrible. Tom Cruise played his typical role (overcomes some great odd, gets the chick, the end). The concept of the movie was fairly decent, but the final product was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst, most boring movie I've ever seen.","review":"I knew I was in trouble when after 2 hours I was still waiting for this movie to become interesting.

That is the question. Unlike other reviews, this is not one where the reviewer liked the film. I am still waiting for the point of the movie to be made. Where is the rest? So much ado about nothing. This movie is not misunderstood. It's just not finished. Large portions are missing, like plot, substance and cohesiveness. There were many rambling conversations reminiscent of Woody Allen but not half as good. Dark and eerie - yes. Thought provoking - no. Lots of questions - but few answers. Up till the end I was wondering how Cruise and Kidman could star in this cinematic, clearly expensive, excuse of a B movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kubrick's worst film","review":"I just wasted 2.5 hours+ on this nothing film. What a shame. I love Kubrick's other films and was very surprised by how bad and dull this film is. There's is almost no story, no humor, not much drama, no action, and a lot of stuff unexplained. After this movie I felt empty, like this film. Was Kubrick senile is his final years, as this movie is real garbage and his previous works were masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic...now and forever","review":"Few films have been so misunderstood. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is riveting filmmaking, from start to finish. This may be the only film I have experienced that lingers on in the mind for days!Rich color, potent music and deep layers of psychology make up Kubrick's study of the sexual subconscious.

Films such as 'Days of thunder' and 'Far and away', were top notch performances by the two actors. 'Eyes wide shut', was just utter trash. Dont be deceived by the rumours floating around that this is a number 1 hit. The whole movie was a mess and its hard to keep your EYES WIDE OPEN during this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Nicole Kidding?","review":"I thought this was the worst movie I have seen so far this year.

Tom C. was mis-cast, Nicole K. was typically brilliant. Annoying minimalist piano sound track, putrid script, agonizing, purpose-less scenes. Will anyone dare say this is Kubrick's worst work, as it was sadly his last? Don't be fooled into believing this is an artsy, intriguing movie by a controversial director. It really stunk! If you like Cruise and Kidman together get Far and Away or even Days of Thunder instead. Yes, Eyes Wide Shut was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"blue ray waiste","review":"buy this on dvd.

My husband loves the movie, and I have no idea why. I like wacky, psychological thrillers, but this movie seems bent on shocking the viewer, without telling much of a story. So, a wife says she's fantasized about someone else, and her husband goes off the deep end, like now he is somehow justified in cheating on her. This isn't enough to drive a feature film. I love Kubrick, but how disappointing that this was his last film. Also, that piano music gets annoying really fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Movie frustrates the viewer","review":"I was very disappointed in this film. I was really excited to see it to begin with but it didn't live up to its admittedly alluring advertising. The problem with the movie is that it leaves TOO MANY LOOSE ENDS! I also found the abundant nudity (which in typical sexist style was only female) to be a major turn off. Over all the film is a total waste of time. Go Rent Donald Sutherland's Don't look now, or Basic Instinct if you want a sexy mysterious movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinkin Mans Movie Made By a Thinkin Man","review":"Well, Now I'm no professional but let's face it, the acting in this movie is no less then perfect. This is in my opinion tom cruise's best movie(close call with rainman). I could not turn this movie off due to the seriousness it took with everyone of its actors. Kubrick is an absolute genius. To this day I will never understand whats goin on in that costume store with the owner, the daughter(or whoever that was), and those oriental guys dressed in drag, but that was one of my favorite scenes in the enitire movie. In my opinion anyone could have played kidman's part, just as well, even though at the time she was \\"the wife\\". I will keep this short and sweet. If you like Kubrick's dark, but beautiful work behind the camera and a soft spoken but very strong tom cruise, please check this flick out. 3 words to sum up my review. Strange, Weird, Unbelievable. Rent it, Buy it, Don't pass on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best, but most don't get it.....","review":"This is Kubrick at his best. Everything in this movie is great,the acting, the direction, the music, the details & thestory. Kubrick masterfully leads us slowly from reality into dreams & dreams into reality; & in the process, we can't tell what's real & what's unreal. But whatever it is, Kubrick presents us with a stunning visual & memsmerising movie of the century. We miss you, Stanley. You are the greatest director on earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Haunting","review":"Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut, is by far the year's best. It is a chilling last testament of a director who happened to be a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential DVD for any Kubrick fan...","review":"After having seen the film twice in theatres, I was anxious for the DVD to become available. As all Kubrick fans know - multiple viewings are essential to become aware of all of the craft that he built into each project.Amazon.com supplied the DVD at the right price, and shipped it very quickly. I have already had the chance to enjoy the film again - and I would recommend Eyes Wide Shut to anyone who has ever enjoyed a previous Kubrick film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look at the dark side...","review":"Although not a huge fan of Cruise, but fond of Kidman, I was buying this for the Kubrick factor. Good choice, both actors are perfect in their roles...the chemisty is there. Very rich and loamy film, made my skin crawl at the depiction of the underworld that Cruise discovers. Great exploration of the complex nature of connection vs otherness in a marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Movie for Adults","review":"This is an interesting, intriguing movie.It is not meant for chidren, not so much for its language, nudity or exotic (and sometimes bizarre) sex scenes, rather it is an adult film that stars adults, concerns itself with adult situations and problems, and is meant for adults.As such, I recommend it for adults looking for an adult experience at the movie theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Kubrick's best, but worth a go","review":"The big theme of this movie is the ever-present tension in the human personality between desire and repression, and overall Kubrick portrays that tension pretty effectively. The early temptation scenes are convincing enough, and so is the reconciliation between the doctor and his wife at the end. The problem is the middle section, namely, all those cavorting naked bodies in masks and the \\"warning\\" to the doctor. This bit was, unintentionally no doubt, as ludicrous as when Vincent Price used to ham it up in the old days. At least we knew Price was doing it partly tongue in cheek. Even a more accomplished actor than Cruise would have had trouble carrying it off with dialogue of this abysmal quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent Before You Buy","review":"The movie begins earnestly enough, with the story of a marriage in serious trouble. Doctor Tom Cruise flirts shamelessly with two young models while wife Nicole Kidman exchanges innuendo with a suave older gentleman at a swanky dinner party. What follows over the next two plus hours is a movie which takes a surreal look at the decay of a relationship and the drives of the man and woman involved.While not without it's entertaining moments, \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is a meandering film which loses it's audience as quickly as it intrigues it.Ultimately, the movie's slow pacing lingers far too long on an extended subplot involving a bizarre, ritualistic sex cult.Unfortunately, director Stanley Kubrick passed away prior to the completion of this film. What remained of his final vision for this movie is debatable, but for the casual viewer, \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" will likely prove to be a confusing piece with marginal entertainment value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gasp","review":"This was a breath-taking cinematic masterpeice.

The DVD version looks just as good on a very good DVD player. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendously horrible movie!","review":"I'm sad this was Kubrick's last movie. He was one of the greatest directors of all time. It's sad that his last movie was worse than both Ishtar and Battlefield Earth! I would give it negative five stars if I could! The piano keys alone repeating over and over again make this stinker one of the worst movie experiences any human has ever had!

This is not a case of misunderstanding on my part (man, women, birth, life, death, infinity) but rather bordom with the intellectual complacency for anything bizaar. The nudity...come on now anyone who has made it through puberty should be over the giggly \\"Oh look they are is naked\\" by now. This is nether art nor good taste, but it is what they (the film industry)tell us we want. The movie as a whole has to much of everything that says \\"you need to be really intellectual to understand it\\"...my feeling is the movie is naked...and this director and those who bought it could not see. Try Dr.Strangelove which is strange, and the characters are strange, but the issues (like the film) are black and white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"A catchy theme-tune does not a good film make. It didn't workfor Mission Impossible and it wasn't enough to make this filmwatchable.

END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Titillation and Sensationalism...","review":"...are cheap and easy ways to get a response from an audience.Did anyone stop to think about the fact that Kubrick chose TOM CRUISE (Risky Business?) and NICOLE KIDMAN, known more for their looks than for their acting ability, to play in his \\"intellectual\\" film about sexual intrigue?!? Does anyone really DENY that they had hoped/expected some hot sex scenes between Cruise and Kidman, and that they were given that expectation by the trailers?If Kubrick had really wanted to emphasize the sexual psychology in this flick, he would have chosen lesser-known, non-heart throb actors for the roles. To me, it is clear that Kubrick was pandering to his audience. And it is precisely because he underestimated the intelligence of his audience that the film was unsuccessful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing my eyes were doing was fighting to stay open","review":"I and the entire row of people that saw this movie were bored out of our minds. I actually fell asleep at one point. The charactors were unlikeable. The plot was unfathomable. The \\"point\\" was missing. And, the story was plain, old boring. I agree with some of the other reviews - rent before you buy or you might be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be...","review":"Now, im usually a very open person. I like to try and enjoy every movie I see. This isn't the case. What we have here is a masterpiece gone terribly wrong. The movies 159 minutes is the first thing to yell about. I was so bored with most of the conversations that I fast foward through the whole movie just about. Themovie has no moral, nothing exciting and, excuse me, there was almost no sex. There was more nude girls than there was sex. Now I can see why this movie was so terribly screwed up, Old Stan must have been messed up. Now I loved 2001 and The Shining, but this is one that I will not be adding to my video collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A Waste of Time, Money and Talent\\"","review":"It's pitiful that a couple as \\"capable\\" as Nicole and Tom would stoop to such a disgusting and odd script.

I actually fell asleep in the middle and woke up for the last 30 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly one of the worst movies I've seen.","review":"Is there any way I can get back the last three hours of my life? In the beginning, this movie had promise of being filled with intrigue and mystery with the brushing of the more taboo life of the secret yearning of human sexuality. While I can appreciate the story, it left little to fulfill any of the promises. Unless all you want is to see the naked forms of Kidman and Cruise...I'd suggest either picking up a book or a different movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective dvd","review":"As a warning: the bluray is defective that I bought. It stops midway through the film. The picture quality is awful. Don't think that just because it is a bluray, that it will hidef -it is no better than a standard dvd. Very dissappointing. Hope this helps. As for the film, well, very slow. Not sure the point of this, long pauses in dialog. Otherwise, interesting pornographic look at jealousy and it's effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Average","review":"Most agree that this film was directed wonderfully, and I find it to be quite artistic. Everyone interested in film should see this movie just for the images.The story had great potential, but the ending was almost an anti-climax. This movie has much in common with Magnolia; both look great, both are anti-climactic. This story is slightly better than Magnolia, and is obviously directed better. If you've seen Magnolia and you like it, you'll probably like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The censored for dumb Americans version","review":"I'd hoped that the DVD would be the international cut, or (better yet) would take advantage of the ability of the DVD format to allow the user to select alternate edits. That way we could see the film as Kubrick intended. But no, apparently we just get the same censored version that played in US theaters, while the rest of the world gets Kubrick's original version.So despite it being a great film, I can't really give the US release of the DVD (or VHS) a great rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kubrick's 2nd best...","review":"...after Barry Lyndon. Exegesis could be endless on this much misunderstood film, so I'll keep it short: this is the finest movie about marriage EVER MADE. And the truest. From a male perspective, at least.

Although still slow, at least things happened. It's about a black magic cult with which the couple separately rubbed shoulders. All that you can take from it is the existence, power and evil of such practitioners, and know why teachers warn to avoid them. That's it.I raise my rating to a two. It could have been made exciting and enjoyable. It definitely has a French flair, if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring.....","review":"There just 3 words: TOO MUCH BORING.

The dialogues were extremely long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not widescreen?","review":"I could not understand why this was an edited, standard format DVD. One of the major attractions of DVD are the choice to watch the version you want to watch. I guess the studio want to make more money when they release the collectors edition. Wait until then to see this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter...","review":"Let me first state that I highly enjoy movies with an intellectual stimulus and that actually make you think beyond the roll of the credits.This is not what this movie is.What it is, is garbage. There's no intellectual quest, emotional investment, or discovery of character. It's an excuse to produce a film of nothing but people walking around naked in highly-unbelievable sadomasochitic bliss. If this version is Kubrick's actual intent, then shame on him. Tom Cruise is at his worst. There's nothing enjoyable or even redeemable about his character. He's just trite and boring. Kidman fares somewhat better, given the material. Ironic that after their divorce, her movies get better (bordering on brilliance) and his get worse.\\"The difference between pornography and erotica is lighting,\\" said Gloria Leonard. This movie is neither. It's lining for the litter box."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was All The Hoopla About?","review":"I had heard that Eyes Wide Shut wasn't any good, but I went ahead and rented it to see what all the \\"talk\\" was about. What a terrible dissapointment! This movie was like a soft core porno flick. The only plot this movie had was sex. Cruise and Kidman didn't do too good a job acting either. Eyes Wide Shut was a bad movie from the get go. I would advise not renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY PITIFUL!","review":"this complete waste of celluloid was nothing more than a wat-too-long episode of \\"red shoe diaries\\"! please! why is it every time an artist dies, we're supposed to think of his or her posthumos works as \\"sooo amazing\\"! this is the kind of movie that people THINK is so \\"mind-bending\\" and \\"powerful\\", but when you get down to it, is nothing more than mindless hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time . . . .","review":"It's a good thing Kubrick isn't around anymore to waste celluloid like this. What's up with this guy? Does he have to be so artsy-fartsy as to think you don't have to have a plot, you can get away with obvious or misleading red-herrings and you can introduce characters willy-nilly without using them later or have a reason in the first place for having them there? Tom and Nicole did a fabulous job acting to a sub-standard script. Both quality actors, I felt embarrased for them that they fell for this dog. It seemed as if Kubrick wanted to make a porn movie but didn't have the guts."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH??PLEASE HELP!!...","review":"OK, maybe because i am 18 is the reason why i dont understand the movie. But, i have watched this movie at least 4 times i STILL DONT GET IT.. please someone explain the plot and the whole point of the movie because all it looks like to me is a movie with alot of naked girls in it.....Why is it that at the end of the movie Nicole Kidman told Tom Cruise that they had one more thing to do ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kubrick's Legacy!","review":"So who doesn't get it from this film? Tom thinks he's straight because of Scientology. More than anything, this film exhibits how our thought's about things distort our image about ourselves. It's no mystery that Tom and Nicole divorced after making this movie. Leave it to Stanley to sneak one in on Tom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long slow journey to nowhere","review":"Eyes Wide Shut is a long, slow journey that leads... nowhere. While there are some attention-grabbing scenes such as the one in Victor Ziegler's pool room, too much of the film has the feeling that they are trying to fill out time. Nicole Kidman gives a good performance and Sydney Pollack is very good, but Tom Cruise is, well, the same old cocky, one-dimensional Tom Cruise. Unknown, bit actors kept showing him up in scene after scene; it got a little embarrasing. If he wasn't good looking, he would have a hard time getting work.I guess if you have 2.5 hours to kill and don't mind a movie that takes you nowhere, you might enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"what did i just watch?","review":"The title says it all. it was crap on top of crap...I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, ever.

Surprised at the caliber of film stars who were in it... As expensive and the long production time as it took to make this film... it should have been far better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eyes Completely Shut","review":"I don't know what I was expecting when I saw this movie, but whatever it was I don't think I got it. This movie wasn't pornography by any means, although sex is clearly a central theme. Tom Cruise's character always seems to be on the verge of having sex or exploring different sexual practices. That much I enjoyed, but my God this movie dragged. Painfully slow in most scenes, Eyes Wide Shut had me looking at the timer on my DVD player most of the time. This is no slight on the acting performances by Cruise and Kidman who are both quite good, it's more the creative aspect. The writing is dull; the music adds no drama or suspense but lulls you to sleep; and the scenery is overly stuffy. Maybe I was expecting something much greater since this was a Kubrick film, but no matter who directed it there is no excuse for a movie that nearly puts someone to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this DVD.","review":"What can I say? The beginning of the movie went just fine and started to build questions and expectations as to how everything was going to resolve at the end. Tom Cruise gets involved in a very complex situation that would probably require some creative solution.And what happened at the end? The end of the movie really sucks. They do nothing at the end. All the interest that you have build during the movie brings you frustration at the end.Maybe Stanley Kubrick didn't get a chance to finish the movie himself and someone else got to do the end of the movie. If this was the case, then it makes sense why end of the movie stinks.My suggestion: Don't buy this DVD. If you are really curious just rent it and you'll see what I'm talking about.PS: I don't know if I should dump this DVD in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eyes Wide Shut","review":"I mistakenly got a Blu-Ray version of this movie and have not been able to get it replaced yet.

Hopefully, I can get a replacement sincethis was one my daughter especially wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auteurist stigma","review":"The sad thing about Stanley Kubric's career was the importance placed on absolutely every frame of every film he ever made. As this was his final opus many wanted to see the closing chapter in a perplexing drama about an auteur who never sold out. Eyes Wide Shut wasn't that film, in fact the direction is heavy handed, the acting stilted and false, and the script was loathsome and terrible at it's absolute best. For those who didn't get it, or don't understand the film, where were you? Eyes Wide Shut is so heavy handed from start to finish that it is just plain boring. There are some beautiful sequences, some thought provoking concepts, some nice imagery, definately, but why is everyone so afraid to say that it just wasn't that good? I have to point out how stupid it is to release on DVD a censored version of the film (at least we saw the real one here in Australia)! And not in widescreen either. How rediculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your precious time!","review":"An agonizingly slow, slow movie that goes nowhere. What a terrible disappointment.

Also, rather unrealistic-- a doctor with a fabulous condo overlooking Central Park West, a Range Rover, extensive art collection, and high end office and he only has 2 patients scheduled in an afternoon? Must be some kind of expensive house calls he makes. See this movie if you enjoy having a root canal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold the popcorn","review":"We actually paid money to see this movie in a theater. We sat through the entire thing waiting for it to have some socially redeeming value. We left not only disappointed, but angry. Outraged.Yes, I know what it was about. Of course, I didn't know that going in, that would have been nice. And I couldn't believe the arrogance and the audacity of celebrating a culture of elitism that thrives upon decadence and depravity. Why are we watching this? And WHY ARE WE PAYING FOR IT?It is even more obvious, a handful of years later, that Tom Cruise is \\"not OK.\\" That Nicole Kidman has her own brand of dark drama going on, a drama that is not that far removed from Britney Spears and Anna Nicole Smith. It's larger than life and darker than insanity. We should do something about it. I wish I knew what. But I don't want it with my popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open and shut","review":"An overrated movie from an overpraised director. Still, it's sad that the man behind Dr. Strangelove finished his life and career on this low note. What is the point of this movie? Is Kubrick exploring the psycho-social ramifications of orgiastic sex? Is it a statement on the subterranean mores of cosmopolitan wives? Is it a warning that a dangerous cabal controls the sexual topography? Is Kubrick enjoying a private joke at the expense of Tom and Nicole's acting abilities? Even the film's ardent admirers can't say. But why should we fault them? Kubrick himself seemed confused. If you are someone who likes to see some examination of virtue (as well as decent acting) in a drama, you will find very little of value in Eyes Wide Shut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Stupid, Garbage film","review":"I can't believe this was Kubrick!The visual style is true Kubrick, but this is a garbage piece of film from the mastermind that gave us Dr. Strangeglove, 2001, Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket(ALL OF THESE FILMS ARE 5 STAR!!!)

It escapes me. Shock value? Lost on me, because it wasn't pertinant to the movie. I found the discussion that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman about fidelity, the male and female version the only riveting portion of this movie. I found it heart rending when she went on about the naval officer. It was cruel & meant to be. The later scene with an adoring patient's daughter was an very interesting insight.Tom Cruise's reaction was so typical however. A bit of a dissappointment. The movie rambled on from that point never really explaining the \\"orgy society group\\" and it's larger vision.I think Stanley Kubrick would have polished this more had he lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big letdown","review":"Being a lover of the majority of Kubrick's previous outings I was extremely dissapointed by this.

Definitely a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so shocking","review":"When I saw this movie in the theater, I had high hopes for it. From the reviews I heard, it was supposed to shock me. But, sadly, it didn't. This story could have easily been told in an hour 1/2. If you want to be shocked, you're better off renting/buying Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, or 9 1/2 weeks... Rent it first then buy it if you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Kubrick film ever! No the worst film ever!","review":"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen!

The sexuality in it is not sexy, it is wierd. The ending is utterly unsatisfactory. I'm not a Stanley Kubrick fan. I think he is pretty bad. The actors talk too slow. It's all part of the pseudo wierdness that is going on in this inferior movie. They built us a complicated structure, and I'm standing on the sidelines pointing out that the emperor has no clothes on, and his underwear is funny looking. And what is that stupid ending anyway? And does the Tom Cruise character have a mind? Or is he a suit of clothes with a balloon inside, being led around by the nose by every other character in the movie? Would it be too much to ask to have Nicole Kidman's character have her head screwed on straight instead of being whatever the hell she is here? This flick was made in Jonathan Swift's Laputa, land in the sky. Hey - let's get down to earth a little. A little reality please, in the characters, their reactions, something?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drink plenty of coffee before watching this one.","review":"Words cannot describe how BAD this film is.

As open-minded as I am, I could not find any redeeming qualities in this film...saw no purpose for it. And to be fair, as much as people have complained about the show of \\"sex\\" and nudity, I didn't care for the obvious lack of male nudity...if they're going to go so far with females, at least make it balanced (especially in the strange and dorky orgy scene).

Over and over again, AND people complying with whatever he wants because \\"HE'S A DOCTOR!\\". And what was the point of Nicole Kidman's gratitious nudity? - enough already.

Imagine you find out your loving wife and mother of your daughter admits her lust for another man. Not only that she also tells you she would have left you for a chance at that man. This film takes into one mans quest at finding absolution for his mind. Sounds like an interesting story right? Wrong! The movie spends unimaginable amounts of time with conversations that should have took seconds. There was a noble attempt to give you those meaningful pauses for dramatic effect. Unfortunately there were to many. As far as skin, there is plenty but most(excluding the orgy) takes place in the first half hour to try to get the average horndog hooked. The MPAA made them alter the only scenes that could have saved this film. The only way I would buy this DVD is if the International version was released. Rent it don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"This movie really didn't have much going for it. Nichole Kidman and particularly Tom Cruise aren't very talented actors. This is made worse by bland and unrealistic dialogue. The plot can be summarized in a sentence. And by the advertising campaign, you think there would at least be some vicarious thrill of seeing a weird-sex-party - which was a whole lot of nothing.Dull dull dull. A fourth of the theatre walked out. I was surprised at reading the Amazon reviews - I would think this (and the equally dreadful A.I.) would convince Kubrick fans that the emperor has no clothes. Instead, I see reviews which toute the negatives as positives, and criticize naysayers as lacking the true insite they possess. Don't believe the lies! I think such reviewers have adopted the cynical outlook that a movie being boring, emotionally detached, and occasionally vague means it *must* be a work of art. I really don't see another reason anyone would give this more than a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"EYES WIDE BORED","review":"Watching this movie was like a bad dream. Nicole Kidman acted and talked like she had been sniffing glue, and Tom Cruise was a bad fit in his doctor role.I kept telling myself something is going to happen, it's gonna pick up. Never did. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mezmerizing, Provoking, Kubrickian!","review":"I herad a lot of negative reactions to this film before I saw it, most noteably from a good friend who is a huge Kubrick fan. I feared the worst as I rented this film and sat down to watch it.What I got that night was an awesomely engaging and mezmerizing film to which I was completely drawn for the rather lengthy running time. Masterfully done, in a style very reminicent of 2001: A Space Odyssey, this film has an erotic and egmatic feel to it that makes it quite an experience. Cruise and Kidman are electrifying together on the screen.I will admit that the film is slow and deliberate, but if you allow yourself to be drawn into the plot and the characters, this only adds to the suspensful experience. I recommend it to fans of this type of work, but I don't think it will satisfy the everyday moviegoer.See for yourself..."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the last well made movie of the old century","review":"In the dream that eyes wide shut is, one could only hope for a happy ending,the story is this.

I like them because they are so original, but this album is getting more into a mainstream style, where you can't tell that it is distinctively Siverstein, but nevertheless this CD is still AMAZING. You should definitely buy it.

This is a silly little record from a silly little band. One positive note: the musicianship is solid. Here's the rest of it. The songs are unimaginative, the lyrics cliche and silly, the vocals whiny and grating. Now, I do not typically like this style of post punk kid-style speak singing anyway, but the vocals are particularly bad here. In terms of the songwrituing, this sounds like a bunch of leftovers from previous better efforts. It sounds like very little effort went into this album here and the band simply takes their new found success for granted. Its a shame. I also agree with the High School Band analogy, but would add that there are many high school bands more talented and hungrier than these guys.

Gone is the sound of a quiet sentence silenced in it's half, vanishing on the dusty horizon of the heart. Gone is their ability to make me say such things. Apparently motivated by their previous collaboration with Sam Beam yet lacking his actual vision what remains is your regular old sadness, like listening to a friend talk about some inconvenience that happened to them over coffee or on the cell phone. If you, like me, thought \\"quattro\\" represented a sort of pinnacle of the band's ability to express images and emotion through music and sound, you were right, as there's nothing like it here.In short, or rather shorter, they have managed to extract iron & wine's peculiar (and self-controversial) radio friendliness, leaving out what makes it self-controversial, it's artistic essence and vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abbreviated versions","review":"All the performances on this disc either fade into the song while it's already in progress or fade out prematurely, most of the time right in the middle of a solo.

All of the equations involving men were either completely wrong about me, or were inapplicable, since I have no plans to cheat on my wife. The female related ones actually did seem to be milder and more 'truthful' which leads me to believe this is just a book to plant seeds of doubt in the minds of easily led astray women involving their own relationships. If a man isn't cheating on you right now, he will be in the future, or already has?

The text focuses on the visceral experience of the ocean through a child's eyes, though much of the text is poetic and will contain some unfamiliar words for smaller listeners. I first discovered this book at a children's exhibit at a science museum, and it is a great book for both learning about the experience of going to the ocean and discussing how a child experiences the world through five different senses.I like that this book has an educational aspect, but it is fairly subtle: the text and illustrations are beautiful, in their own right, and it is simply enjoyable to read.

There are also several animals that produce appropriate sounds and music plays when the animals are placed in the correct area in the barn. The variety of activities, with motion and music, keeps him happily occupied for long periods of time.We did have one problem.

However, I have to recommend director Adrian Lyne's version, with Jeremy Irons, Melanie Griffith, and the controversial debut of Dominique Swain as Lolita, over Kubrick's. This version reminds me of a Leave it to Beaver episode, no pun intended. For me, it had neither the poetic passion of Nabokov's novel or the sense of nervous guilt that Jeremy Iron's so perfectly displays in Lyne's version. Irons was perfect for the part of Humbert Humbert, you get the sense that he was obsessed by a true love for Lo. Humbert Humbert may be an anti-hero of sorts, but many people misinterpret the theme of Nabokov's novel and I can't really say that Kubrick's version did it any justice. I found it flat and dated. Nevertheless, it is worth a watch. However, I think true conesuers of Nabokov's work will find Lyne's version to be no less faithful and far more empathetic to Nabokov's vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great movie, but it won't play","review":"Lolita (Amazon Exclusive) [Blu-ray] In my opinion, the original Lolita is one of the best movies ever made.

Unfortunatly, I have very few good things to say about the film adaptation. I was wholly disappointed with this film, especially since Nabokov wrote the screen treatment. I'm not a big Kubrick fan, but I have enjoyed most of his movies. This one, I'm afraid, is not worth bothering with. The direction is rather sketchy with odd black-outs denoting chapters or segments of the film. The sudden naration of Humbert's diary is ill-conceived and the acting is over the top too often.The characters are mere skeletons of what they were in the novel. What made the book so paralyzing was taken out. One is made to sympathize with Humbert rather than hate him. Lolita, on the other hand, is shawn to be a temptress and not as a child who is forced into Humberts cruel world.Unless one has read the book or is a die-hard Kubrick fan, stay away from this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you haven't read the book before","review":"It's a Kubrick movie, so it just cant be a bad one. Nonetheless, Lolita-Sue Lyon- is supposed to be twelve and looks at least eighteen. Sellers is completly out of place. The most unapealling thing about this movie is that it has, basically, nothing to do with the book itself. And you just don't read Nabokov's Lolita. You LIVE it. So it's kinda desappointing. However, apart from that, Mason's excellent, Sue Lyon even more and Winters extraordinary.

There is little rapport with any of the characters, including Sam McCall.

The environmental issues are reduced to the not-so-burning-question of 'will the yellow-backed minnow survive as a species', and the obvious answer is, \\"who cares?\\". The motive for murder is revealed by artifice: a newspaper story quoted in the last chapter. And the prose is not deathless, but dead--and filled with needless typographical errors. Consider, for instance, this quote: \\"Without even a moment's hesitation, I raised my fun (sic) and fired.\\" (p. 243)Even on a snowy and boring Saturday afternoon, this is a novel to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money!","review":"This book was required reading for a Doula Certification course I am taking and I was horrified by some of the author's statements.

And when you purchase hardware which will supposedly satisfy the program's requirements, Voyetra tells you it won't work.

I just ordered the 2-pack from amazon (since none of my local retailers carry it). I had ordered from amazon before and was very pleased. Unfortunately, it appears that All has changed the formula and now it smells truly awful - that horrible \\"baby powder\\" scent that they put in so many baby products but which we avoid like the plague.

It will even tell you so in the liner notes of the re-issue. Fact of the matter is it's horrible. The Meat Puppets NEVER played these songs live after they recorded their next album because......that's right, it's horrible. The lyrics(which you'll have to read because you can't understand them) are nonsense.

If you've heard any of their albums after this one, you are not prepared for the seemingly PCP-induced banshee shrieking which is at the center of this album and its bonus cuts. Even covers of songs like Niel Young's \\"I Am a Child\\" and the G. Dead's \\"Franklin's Tower\\" are just so manic it sounds like a huge mess. There's actually some good music going on underneath it, but the singing just can't be taken seriously. The Puppets totally reformed their sound for their second album and its successors, and it's a damn good thing. Instead of continuing to make this senseless music for crackheads, they made some of the most outstanding albums in Modern Rock.

All I know is that they make me laugh. I have often thought that the singer could have benefited from Hooked on Phonics; he's all but unintelligible. Just when I think that they could not be called musicians, they throw \\" Dolphin Field\\" at you. They are an enigma; that's what makes them so appealing, I guess.This album was one of my first punk albums as a teenager, back in the early eighties. I just had to buy it, not so long ago - much to my wife's dismay. I still need to be in the mood to enjoy it, but, when the mood hits, there is no other band that could possible fill that void.I feel awkward recommending this album to anyone. You'll either love it or hate it. There is absolutely no middle ground here. There is no band to compare them to.

I was always under the impression that in order to challenge your muscles and continue to get results you just had to keep increasing the weight. I love using the lighter weights with more reps in these dvds. Yes it is taxing, but Jari's cuing is excellent and it makes it so easy to use good form and proper technique with her excellent timing, and just when you think you can't do one more rep the segment ends. I also like that there are 4 different people to \\"follow\\" - so this will work for everyone. I usually stay with Jari who doesn't do the ultra-difficult sets herself but still gives you an advanced but doable workout. There is still an easier version to follow or a tougher one if you don't feel challenged. Don't hesitate to get these workouts - If you like to do free weights at home and feel challenged, these dvd's are right up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"An amazing workout.

Overall, a good beginner video, with the opportunity to advance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Weight Training Workout","review":"I have purchased numerous weight training DVDs in the last decade or so and this is the BEST I've tried thus far.

It's great for guys as well. My husband tried it with me and he avers that it works. NOTE: The program does not include warm up section, so it would be best to do your own warm up before beginning the DVD. It does include short stretching at the end of each workout section, which is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this DVD","review":"I'm a beginner to intermediate exerciser. I just started using this DVD about two weeks ago. I love it. I don't like to exercise, but I have to admit that this is the first exercise DVD that I don't dread doing. The warm up is short and then you get right into it. The time flies by pretty quickly with this one. You can work with light weights or heavy weights, depending on your fitness level. On some of the exercises, I've had to drop the amount of weight because of the high number of reps she does. The shoulders section is a killer for me. I really feel like I've gotten an excellent workout when I'm done with this one. She encourages you, but without all the fake cheerful banter. That's exactly why I like her--she gets to work and doesn't waste time. I've purchased two more of Jari's DVDs and can't wait to try them as well. I would definitely recommend this DVD to someone who is at my same fitness level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recomended.","review":"I love her video... the only thing I would have like her to do differently is in her warm-up section.

It would be good for beginners to weightlifting, but as an experienced weightlifter who is trying to build an at home routine, the DVD is really easy. Just to give an example, I think the routine includes maybe 8 push ups and 12 lunges on each leg. The DVD is well intentioned, but Jeri Love lacks enthusiasm, giving a few weird winks and smiles once in awhile. Oh, and even as a fan of techno music, the background beats in this video are really dull, bordering on annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Granted, Jari looks great and she isn't the perky, annoying fitness instructor one often gets on a workout DVD. But, that being said, she's too slow & boring for me.The exercises itself might indeed work great and get you 'ripped' over time, but I find myself rather watching 'normal' tv 1 hour while lifting weights than popping in this DVD. To me, working out must be fun and I clearly don't enjoy this one! (Actually none of her workouts work for me, personally.

These sisters were the mold of modern day society seekers of today. Babe Paley, Minnie Astor, Betsy Roosevelt Whitney, were women of a certain drive that lead them to start trends, create style to always be associated with them that was replicated by Jackie O. From Truman Capote to the royals, these girls shook things up. Its a history lesson with a haute coutre fashions in between.This is a must read, for the summer,winter or fall. You will not be disappointed, it is a who's who of the thirties and up to the 70's. I have reread it found things that peek my interest such as other books and artist I have forgotten, so buy it you will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"story was weak","review":"I tend to agree with reviewer, Margaret Ogilvie, about this book. I was interested in learning more about style icon, Babe Paley, and her family and although the author did tell the interesting story of her upbringing (father was famous brain surgeon, Henry Cushing) and subsequent marriages of the 3 sisters, I found the story lacked substance. I didn't really feel I left the book knowing anything more about Babe Paley or her sisters. I learned, for instance, that Betsy married to FDR's son and they had a troubled marriage but it (Grafton's story) seemed like distant heresay. I've read great biographies and this was not one - I felt I was, as Margaret Ogilvie said, reading a compilation of newsclippings. I read through this book, unimpressed and rather disappointed. I'm hoping there are other books available about the Cushing sisters, specifically Babe Paley."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great topic - too bad another author didn't tackle it!","review":"The only good thing about this book is that it has no grammatical errors or typos. This is the shallowist of biographies, probably gleaned from newspaper clippings. There are lists of who wore what at each sister's wedding as well as who attended and, later, lists of who was left exactly which items when the sisters died. In between is a vast nothingness, punctuated only with the barest details of the sisters' lives. We never do find out what they themselves are like - surely the whole point of a biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"The book is a well written account of these three sisters and it is easy to understand why they dominated in the social and fashion circles of their time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Not worth the paper that it's printed on!Obviously, this author had no access whatsoever.A total outsider's account.Save your time and money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad for a first time listener","review":"I really liked this CD because it combined most of Black Flag's songs onto one CD.

Word of advice, don't buy this book if you're looking for some serious self help on marriage (though I might disagree on that too)...Through witty humor, and even more funnier experiences, Jenny explores her newfound status as a wife. Even though I'm not married there are times when I find myself wondering about the mysteries of my significant other (read the Car Karma chapter). Like the previous poster she chooses humor to touch base on the deeper emotions: understanding, sharing and compromising. She is not shallow, she just has oddities like any other woman.After reading this book it left me with a big smile and a whole new perspective on relationships.PS: Read it with your significant other..I bet he's going to laugh and say \\"oh yeah, you do that too...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I'd hoped for...","review":"The cover was enticing, and I was hoping for some real advice from a newlywed when I was about to get married. I didn't realize this book was really more satire than anything. You get lots of anecdotes from the author on her married life - many of which I can't really relate to. Omigod! We have to learn how to pay the bills!(Huh?). There is a lot of \\"why do men do what they do\\" that can be really entertaining - some parts are definitely cute and funny, and the writer has a great voice. However overall the author comes across as just a bit naive for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ!","review":"I actually bought this book only a few days ago and finished quickly b/c I couldn't put down.

YOU'RE SPOILING HIM!\\" when Lee's traditional mother brings her new son-in-law his favorite drink (lemon-lime Gatorade - just like my own husband!) on a silver tray with a crystal highball glass filled with ice.

Her hialrious anecdotes and sage advice, marinated in good humor, are thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Train Wreck of a Book","review":"I couldn't stop reading this book because it was so bad and I couldn't imagine it getting worse - and it did!! As a newlywed (and a New Yorker) myself, this book immediately caught my eye in the bookstore, but I was painfully bothered by the trite and superficial \\"story\\" that the author told. Who is Jenny Lee anyway and why does she think we want to hear what she has to say? I thought her anecdotal stories were irrelevant (if even true) and her insight was insulting. She portrayed herself as an immature (unemployed) whiner who happened to snag a hunky doctor for a husband. I mean really who reduces their happiness to proximity to Bergdorf Goodman??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-out loud funny!","review":"This book isn't a guide to marriage any more than Paul Reiser's \\"Couplehood\\" is; rather, it's a humorous memoir about one woman's experiences as a newlywed. The book contains many themes universal to all domestic partnerships (not just marriage), including the endless debate of \\"what's for dinner?,\\" arguments that drag on for days (dubbed here \\"The Perfect Fight\\" a la \\"The Perfect Storm\\"), and the challenges of trying to be a good mate when the perfect \\"suburn legend\\" wife is living next door (she even makes her own onion dip--WITHOUT using Lipton's soup mix). Yes, Lee can come off a bit spoiled and bratty at times--few people will be able to relate to her single, Sex in the City NYC lifestyle of parties and Prada--but overall, she is candid, funny, and willing to be self-effacing. A fun read for anyone struggling to acheive domestic bliss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious, Cruel Book","review":"I thought her book was insensitive and terrible, especially the chapter she dedicates to \\"playing poor\\" with her husband (trying to make it through the weekend without going to Starbucks too often). And then she has the nerve to complain when her husband (who earns the family income) uses her $100+ bottle of shampoo. Please! She should be sent to the third world, where she can learn about how much REAL women struggle to feed their families and survive a world that does not respect them. This book is not about marriage and unconditional love for another - it's about selfish, ridiculous behavior that only spoiled first worlders could imagine."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was excited to read this, but was very disappointed. Being a newlywed myself, married to a doctor and being korean-american, I thought there would be a lot to relate to. For most of the book she drones on about what a cool New Yorker she was and her endless self-satisfied stories (which are not that funny but take forever to tell). She doesn't share any enlightened information, and reveals almost nothing about herself (i.e. what she does, etc.) What is her job anyway? Hope writing isn't her day job. She says she's so busy, but doing what? It was a waste of time--the only reason I kept reading was in hopes that there was a point to all this. There isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Enough for TV!","review":"I picked up this book when I read in the trades that it had been optioned by Kate Hudson (who I adore!)for a TV sitcom! Well, after reading it I now understand what the appeal is as this book is hysterically funny and already reads like a sitcom! Jenny Lee has such a unique voice and her comic timing is impeccable-- she really just tells you exactly how she's feeling no matter how it makes her look.I've noticed that some of her critics are hissing over the fact that she seems a little clueless when it comes to modern day matrimony, but I say duh, what do you think the \\"Now What?!\\" part of the title implied?? I think it's the very fact that she's so clueless (and able to admit to it) that makes her such an endearing (I LOVE LUCY) type of character.I'm looking forward to her new TV show and her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"vintage jenny lee - where's my contract?","review":"Um, we should all listen to Jenny because she's shmart, funny, married to a doctor (and you're not!) but it gets a bit dull by the middle..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I read this book on a plane, trapped with no other reading, and wished I'd brought more options. it is entertaining enough, with observations on newly married life, but every observation has been made before in much the same way. I am a newlywed, too, but Lee seems very proud of herself for being a newlywed and thnking about marriage a bit, and chapters like, \\"who cooks dinner?\\" just don't do it for me. Plus, her repeated comments about wanting to be a thin bride, wanting to be a thin wife, and how to not tell the truth to your husband because he may not \\"like\\" you if you do, disappoint the semi-liberated reader. This book feels like a throwback disguised as contemporary, and treats marriage like a manipulative game of deceit-and not in a funny, wry way, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I thought it would be...","review":"This is a funny book, but didn't deliver on some of the cover promises, like help on finding other couples to double date with. I like anecdotes and stories as much as the next person, but most of her stories go on and on. There is some helpful advice for brides-to-be, though you have to really dig for it. If you want to read a book that may be more helpful to you, try \\"What No One Tells the Bride\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!!","review":"Excellent book - perfect to ease the nerves of a soon-to-be bride and definitely comforts the newly wed who thinks she is all alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, not helpful","review":"My wife picked this up at a garage sale. Even though the seller said she didn't like it, my wife thought it might be funny. She put it down after a few chapters, saying it was stupid. I took a look at it, thinking I might learn something about the female mind. I don't know about the dude that said he liked it, but I can't name one guy who'd enjoy this book. There's just not a lot there. I disagree with the reviewer from L.A. who keeps writing glowing reviews about it.

As always, Veblen tends toward the verbose, but here your effort is rarely rewarded with the wit that pervades Veblen's earlier works such as \\"A Plea for Cannibalism\\" and \\"An Apology for a Toper\\". It's quite a bit into the book before Veblen suggests his remedy for bloated American universities: simply fire everyone who works in the administrations, because all of their work is superfluous anyway. While this suggestion struck a sympathetic chord with me-as my own frustrating experiences with the multi-layers of bureaucracy at the University of Chicago probably mirror Veblen's own-this aside came too late in the book to relieve my overall boredom with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ten Days","review":"That is how long this exerciser lasted.The plastic part where you screw the pedals into wore out, thus leaving the machine unusable.Go for the extra money and buy yourself a regular exercise bike, or go cheaper and buy the little aluminum ones for fifteen or twenty dollars; it won't hurt as much when they break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This book was very disappointing because I was hoping to get a new perspective on economic thought. However, what I read was nothing of the sort. It was nothing more than a silly over-hyped (on this website) novel featuring unrealistic and dislikable characters. There was little action in the realm of reality. The whole premise of the book is absolute nonsense, however perhaps it could have basic principles of econ that may be useful in the classroom.

This modern day novel is a wonderful way to meet Adam Smith, the economist, philosopher, and believer in people finding happieness.

On this, their 1984 four-sided epic opus, the Minutemen (D.

The album meshes quite a variety of musical styles: punk, funk, spoken bits, jazzy instrumentation, folk, and even polka!The MINUTEMEN accomplish this masterpiece album because of its three outstanding musicians - D. BOON (vox, guitar), MIKE WATT (bass, vox), and GEORGE HURLEY (drums, percussion), as well as other guest musicians.Key tracks include: VIETNAM, POLITICAL SONG FOR MICHAEL JACKSON TO SING, CORONA (*note: The theme music for \\"JACKASS\\"), HISTORY LESSON PT. 2, JESUS & TEQUILA, DO YOU WANT NEW WAVE OR DO YOU WANT THE TRUTH?, MAYBE PARTYING WILL HELP.If you stack this album up against any/all of today's weak & soggy music (i.e. video/pop hits), then you'll discover an album that stands head-and-shoulders above this unfortunate lull in current musical trends...This album more than makes up for today's lack of creativity in most forms of music. Buy it - try it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Partying Will Help...","review":"Revolutionary, political, raw and mostly clocking in at a minute each. This is as funky and chaotic as anything else released by the trio. Watt, Hurley, and Boon have perfected their chemistry on this outing and it shows with the 74 magical minutes this release offers. This is actually a good place to start for those unfamiliar with the trio as it keeps your attention throughout. I might also recommend \\"Introducing the Minutemen\\" as a starter. Then again, you may find yourself spending a small fortune once you check this one out, in which case the \\"Post Mersh Volumes 1-3\\" would make an excellent anthology."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly unique sounds","review":"for the uninitiated, this double album squeezes 43 songs into 74 minutes. and they're all classics...except for the few that are obviously filler. an essential underground album of the 80's.after living with it for a few years, the thing that continues to amaze and impress me is how organic the songs sound. no over-blown guitar chords or feedback, no stadium-sized drums. just fast and loose and bright. i love to listen to this record when i'm trying to motivate myself to exercise...it's especially valuable when i'm driving to mountain biking destinations. go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible inspiration","review":"When I first heard this CD, I thought my music career was all over: they created the sound I had in my head for years but couldn't quite nail down. To tell the truth, I don't find the lyrics all that remarkable, although I completely respect those who do. For me, the amazing part is the tightness of the drums and bass, this is one of the most amazing rock rhythm sections ever recorded. Listen to these two lock into each other, play off each other, and provide a foundataion for the guitar and vocals, and you'll understand what it's all about. That they were largely self trained makes it even more amazing.I can't recommend this CD strongly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy this","review":"Unfortunately, when people talk about Double Nickels these days, they try and put it into some sort of Rock timeline. Like how it compares to God Save The Queen. Who cares. This is different. Don't compare this album to dinosaur rock. It is still completely relevant.Truly one of the better albums ever made. So much going on. Listen to Jesus and Tequilla. You'll love it. You'll love it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands the Test of Time","review":"Double Nickels is one of those albums that still sounds as fresh and as new as it did on the day it was released. Funk, Metal, Punk Rock and who knows what else are mixed together to form one hell of a fine record. History Lesson Pt. II pretty much says it all: \\"Our Band could be your Life.\\" That was the standard the Minutemen reached for. Too bad about D.

I have a problem with this CD. Why, SST, isn't the great song \\"Mr. Robot's Holy Orders\\" included on this? \\"Force fed, sifted, tin can, turn-handled, pop it. Pull toyyyyyy.\\" It's a really rocking song, and it's much more essential that the conga jam that opens side 2.They also took out a great cover of \\"Ain't Talkin' About Love\\" that you can hear their other take of on \\"Post Mersh vol. 3\\".Still, you should definitely, definitely get this. Trade in your Beastie Boys CDs and get a real rock n' roll album that matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Punk Rock Group Ever!!!","review":"I have to say that Double Nickels is damn good.Too bad D died before his time.But,he did a great job on this album and I'm headbanging and playing my air guitar all the way.It's good because it's pure rock.It doesn't have all the \\"sell-out\\" qualities that most other bands now a-days do.So,if you like rock,you'll love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly Overrated","review":"This album contains 4 \\"songs\\" which consist of nothing more than the band members starting their car engines. I don't know about you, but this certainly does not qualify as worthwhile music to my ears.Numerous accolades aside, Double Nickels, for the most part, is self indulgent and lacking cohesion. The lyrics are so pedestrian, would you even guess that \\"This Ain't No Picnic\\" deals with racism?Meat Puppets II, Murmur, and Zen Arcade all blow this one away."},{"rating":"1","title":"PUNK?","review":"OK I JUST WANT 2 NO HOW THIS MUSIC IS SUPOSED 2 BE PUNK CUZ IT AINT.

Some tracks seem like little more than loose jam sessions, but this album is a treasure trove of 2 minute gems. It would take too long here to go into detail about every song, but there are some lively covers (\\"Dr. Wu\\") as well as some dead-on political jabs (\\"Viet Nam,\\" \\"Untitled Song for Latin America\\" to name a couple). Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"timeless classic of punk rock, without one punk song on it","review":"True originals, as most of the reviews on here seem to get. This is their 'famous' record, a double lp seemingly made in response to Husker Du's Zen Arcade. Both bands would diverge from 'punk rock' and define it by creating their own sound.The minutemen were jazz inflected, a 3 part outrage. Each musician was so unique and seemed to carve their own song into the music. I am privileged to have seen them and 1-2 years later 'Firehose' without D Boon.'History lesson' is the story of the minutemen from D Boons eyes. Such a sad sweet song about loving their band and how their lives have turned out because of punk rock, made heartbreaking by D Boon's death. He could not have written a more perfect coda to his music and life, if had written this one from beyond the grave.It is not possible to listen to Storm in my House loud enough, I have tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of post-Damaged Black Flag","review":"Of course, there was no way Black Flag could top Damaged, my personal favorite album of all time, but this one comes close. Greg's guitar is insane (listen to You're Not Evil or My Ghetto) and Rollins is just about as angry as he was on Damaged, not as talky as he gets on some of the later albums. If you ONLY listen to punk, then go listen to Exploited or Casualties, because you are stupid. However, if you really \\"get\\" the whole thing, and clench your fists in anger at just about everything from time to time, then you can't go wrong with the sheer power of Slip It In."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Ok... This is a pretty awesome album, but there are a couple songs are boring. My ghetto, Rats eyes, youre not evil are worth buying this CD for. Get Damaged too. By the way I bought this Cd at an indie record store for like under 9 bucks, so i'd hold out from buyin it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, alienated...","review":"\\"Slip it In\\" was an important album for me. In 1984 I sat on my friend's front lawn in Cowtown, California blasting this album from a tape deck. Needless to say the neighbors called the police who showed up and gave us a stern dressing down for playing punk rock music. Now, 21 years later I listen with the same enthusiasm I had all those years ago. Ginn's guitar work is just amazing. The solos are obviously based on his listening knowledge of free jazz, blues, and 70s hard rock. They are so skewed, so unique, that on every listen I strain to get my head around that flurry of discordant notes. Rollins is in top form, especially on \\"Black Coffee\\" (my fave) and \\"Wound Up.\\" Stevenson's and Kira's rhythm section works as a heavy, driving anchor to Ginn's spasmodic playing and Rollin's shrieks of pain, alienation, and sexual darkness. This is a great album. I like everything Black Flag recorded up to this album. Keith Morris, Chavo, and Dez-era Flag cannot be ignored as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their last Great Album","review":"Slip it In I would consider Flag's last really really really good album they released. I found Loose Nut and In My Head (get it? Slip it in - that loose nut thats \\"In my head\\"?) to be good, but too slick and unfocused. They veered way too closely to a generic \\"metal\\" sound (not that metal is bad but it just seemed to be a fake thrash style that was almost poppy) and just didnt have the craziness of earlier efforts like this one. It starts with Slip it In and concludes with \\"You're Not Evil\\" and is filled with crazy, almost semi prog sometimes in 3/4 thrash punk doom metal free jazz sludge! (quite a mouthful that one). All the instruments sound equal in volume (and that includes ol' Hank who had a problem being heard on the following two) and the crash and burn zaniness of this album is- here it is folks- TIMELESS. Buy it, its awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"From hardcore to HEAVY rock.","review":"Not the same Black Flag on Damaged, First Four Years, or even My War. The band has found a great mid-ground between 70's rock and hardcore. For example Black Coffee is steady driving with your buddy banging on the top of the cab and the guy in the back seat is swinging a chain out the window. Makes you wanna cruise in your firebird with you and some of your buddies and start a fight with some bozo out on the street. My Ghetto is a hardcore punk panic attack nightmare. Rollins is really flipant yelling and growling in a dellusional mania. You can feel your heart palpitate to Greg's kick drum. This albums only instrumental, Obliteration has lumbering heaviness of doom metal, Ginn does some really wild solos on this one. This is a real keeper if you are into Flag, It's has quite a range in musical style and doesn't have a dull moment except for Rats Eyes (a slow dirge of a ditty.) For Flag fans whom like the 'rock' as well as the 'punk.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"slip this one in","review":"this was my second flag album i bought after \\"damaged\\" and was impressed with how they went in a differant direction. \\"slip it in\\" is the best song here (as well as being one of the best flag songs), and \\"wound up\\", \\"black coffee\\", and \\"you're not evil\\" are strong pieces of work from the band.my only problem is that,unlike other flag albums, this one doesent have as many great songs back to back.there are no bad songs, but there are some weak ones, such as \\"my ghetto\\".the sound however is awesome.you can actually feel the guitars and hear the screw ups. this is what punk is all about in my eyes. no rules, except your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst Black Flag ever","review":"All these reviews with four to five stars? Get real, this is the worst that Black Flag ever did and wasn't worth the vinyl it was pressed on.

'Slip It In' is the band's third effort that was originally released in 1984. Tunes I found myself playing a lot off here were the title track \\"Slip It In\\", the in-your-ugly-*ss-mug \\"Black Coffee\\", \\"Rat's Eyes\\", \\"The Bars\\" and the body slammin' classic \\"My Ghetto\\". This is the sort of music that lures you to drive around at 3am and smash up every mail box (the ones they have by the end of the driveway) within a two mile radius. Line-up: Henry Rollins-vocals, Greg Ginn-guitar, Kira Roessler-bass and Bill Stevenson-drums. Should appeal to most fans of Misfits, the Germs, Minor Threat and Dead Kennedys. Believe I saw guitarist Greg Ginn's post-Black Flag trio, Gone play an actual in-store appearance. Wasn't just a three song mini-set, it was like a 45 minute show that had nearby tenants calling the police. You KNOW you've had a great time when that happens. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a great album!","review":"Black Flag was always trying new things! They were experimenting but sure they were rockin'! On Slip It in, they mix hard-rock/heavy metal sounds with they powerful punk sound! The result is really good! There is awesome tracks on this CD the best example is probably for me The Bars! But Slip It in, Black Coffee & My Gettho are also really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ADHD--Authoritative,Clear and Simple","review":"This is a concise,readable, and comprehensive book about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

The cover art perfectly captures what words are so useless as...reminders of a sensation, namely a memory, embedded into the consciousness with the gravity of an experience. To me, this album is a consolotary expression of the consciousness of oneself while slowly losing a sense of childhood. As the raspariousness of adulthood emerges...The Mobius Band have crafted a unique vision that is truly, dare i say, autumnmal in its vasage. A snow covered expanse that is peering into summer, \\"3\\" is as simple and stripped of pretentiousness, catapulting the listener into pure transitory emotion. A must listen...in its entirety.

I wish there was more of this stuff. The version of TV Party is exclusive to this single as are the 2 songs on the flip - some of the best they ever did.I also wish these songs were included on the CD version of Damaged (where they belong), but what are you gonna do? The entire SST catalog desparately needs remastering but it's probably not gonna happen. A live record from this era (with either Biscuits or Emil on drums) is also long overdue but is also wishful thinking.

I know that English and Spanish don't translate very exactly but I've read some beautiful translations (100 years of solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, for example and Aunt Julia and the Script Writer ).

Definately reccommend"},{"rating":"1","title":"Achievement Unlocked - best thing in TMNT","review":"TMNT is a passable action/adventure game geared more towards kids and inexperienced gamers. The main content of the game has you as the members of the Turtles performing ninja acrobatics to cross the city of New York to get to a rare fight with a couple baddies or a boss. There is really no risk of failure in the game since whether you fall off a building whilst attempting acrobatics or you come up short in a fight with an enemy, your Turtle just springs back to life. There is no depth in gameplay as everything can be accomplished with ease.The best thing about TMNT is that you will achieve at least 900 gamerscore, and with only a little extra effort you will gather the full 1000 gamerscore. It took me five hours of gametime to get the 1k. If you want to boost your gamerscore by 1000 and pay budget price for a game, this is the one to get. The five hours are fun enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came up WAY short","review":"I loved some of the older TMNT games, but this one is really sad. The graphics are alright, but that's the only good thing to say about it. There is no multiplayer or co-op of any kind, which is unforgiveable. The really sad thing about this game is the near absence of fighting! Yes, its true. You spend most of your time climbing around and navigating the level, and occasionally--VERY occasionally-you get in a fight. But the fights are seriously lame. I just can't believe they released this game, there really isnt' anything to it. 15 levels of basically running around and beating up the occasional batch of punks. Easy achievements if that's important to you, but otherwise don't waste your time--or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few nights of fun - Rent this one","review":"The graphics of this one are worthy of the next generation platforms that it was designed for. It roughly follows the movie and is entertaining while you are playing it. There is little to no replay value on this one though and many of the later levels feel like you've already played them. This is a great game if you want to stack your achievement points and is definitely fun for a night or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"tmnt xbox 360 game","review":"I had to return this game because it did not play, had to say I was a little disappointed and on the game it stated that the game was only $7.99 and they charged me $44.80 talk about highway robbery"},{"rating":"2","title":"TMNT fans will love this game","review":"This game is easy and fun and entertaining.

The achievements are pretty easy to obtain as well so whether your looking to increase your gamer score or just have fun playing a video game of your favorite cartoon as a kid you will enjoy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Alright, I'll admit it right up front. I bought this game for the 1,000 gamerscore and no other reason. I knew it wasn't a very good game, but I also heard it wasn't complete crap. This is true, there are a couple fun sections, and some of the one liners are pretty great, but over all, you're not going to have much fun with this unless A) you're under 12, B) you absolutely love the turtles, C) you accidentally play some other game thinking it's this one. Technically, it works fine, the controls are pretty much fine, and graphically it doesn't look bad. So there's that.Basically, if you aren't buying it for a child, don't expect much. If you're in it for the gamerscore, devote an afternoon to it. The achievements are super easy so it won't take more than one playthrough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Voice - Incredibly Diverse","review":"I love this CD!

The author was a Scottish Presbyterian who prepared this for his own benefit as he was facing examination for ordination, and it was published after his death. What he has done is to take the Westminster Shorter Catechism and open it up to produce a small but clear and concise theology that is faithful to the Westminster Standards. Those who hold to the Westminster Standards (for example, persons in the OPC and the PCA) will find this book very much to their liking. I have shown this book to the pastor and the elders of my church and they were very impressed. Our church library will be getting a copy. The reprint has a great advantage over the 19th century editions (besides the issue of availability at a reasonable price) - the print size is much larger, making it easier to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"celebrity hacking at a real art-form","review":"There is nothing redeeming about Ms. Cadenet's photography, except as a document of the people she slept with. and its an impressive litany of boy stars that she has serviced...unfortunately, the camera skills she utilizes are not as impressive as her personal offerings....by a long shot. taking the lead paved by Hiromix and Terry Richardson, the premise behind her attempts, are the 'snapshot' window into her volatile, star powered life. but most of these badly lit, movie star and rock star 'moments' feel staged, superficial and lacking the unseen touches and bold reality that carved out a niche for Hiromix and Terry.I don't believe Amanda ever achieved a celebrity status indepedent of the boy stars she was servicing, and for the most part they all seem aware and weary of the photographer's presence. time to go home Amanda."},{"rating":"2","title":"must-have punk rock classic.","review":"first off, let's thank modern technology for this album. talented as these 3 young lads were, despite their vision, they could not have made this music with lutes and harpsichords. no sir. walls of beserk electric guitar were just the ticket to get their creativity across. a pure adrenaline rush assaults the listener, making one wonder \\"how much strong coffee were they drinking in the studio?\\" it actually took about 4 listens before the brilliance of this record sunk into my heart and skull, and i will insist that listening on headphones is the best way to experience this beast of a cd ( there are many nuances and subtleties within this onslaught of aggression and anger that are picked up easier through headphones. and bob mould's incredible guitar mayhem placed straight into your head is a blast!). a classic punk album. angst, alienation, cathartic wailing, all swirling within a rush of mighty sound. must-have music for all rock and roll collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"The first time I heard this album it changed my life.

That's just a fact because we in a house in the city. This is the weirdest cd I have ever heard. It doesn't really stop her from crying but it does sometimes put her in this weird daze. It does not help her sleep, in fact, it keeps her from sleeping and after a while, she is agitated until I turn it off. I'd say if you don't normally play music for your baby she or she may fall for this. I'd recommend just playing any CD that you currently own on repeat mode during naps. The point of playing music is so that when a baby re-enters the light sleep phase, normal sounds in the home don't startle and awaken her. If you feel that you must buy something specifically for your baby to hear, I recommend Woody Guthrie \\"Nursery Days\\" for your baby. It has become the soundtrack of our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I received this CD when my twins where about 4 months old and have used it every day since!

I mean, as far as having a prevailing theme and feel, \\"Damaged\\" was the best but to me Keith Morris was the best singer. Need an example? Compare \\"Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie.\\" Henry's version was good. The actual intrumentals were better, but Keith's version is fantastic. This guy sings like a lunatic. In another song, \\"I Don't Care,\\" he's laughing, jumbling words, starting too late...I don't know if this was drunkness or genious but this guy's amazing. His version of \\"Depression\\" is better too. The rest of this album covers Dez and Chavo, so in all fairness, if you prefer those guys, they've got unrealeased versions of songs they sing. I'm not exactly a fan of them, but everybody's different. Like \\"The First Four Years,\\" this is a good way to learn the history before \\"Damaged.\\" A definite must-get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Black Flag era","review":"Don't take that the wrong way, I dig the Rollins stuff as well, but these tend to be my favorite versions of these songs.

Again, dont get me wrong, I love Rollins era stuff, especially the albums My War, Loose Nut, and Black Coffee, but thats a diff't sound to me; a completely different, more progressive Black Flag.Anyhoo, check this out, listen to the difft vocal styles they went through. Dez Cadenas \\"Depression\\" slays all others. If you like this release, then chances are you'll also like \\"The First Four Years\\" which is more killer Pre-Rollins material. \\"Everything went Black\\" is more a Demo release, while \\"First four..\\" is a A-side/B-side/comp track Collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"henry- less black flag! yay!","review":"got this when it came out....its a must. a primer. if you said\\" ok i want punk....im gonna get 4 things to listen to\\"..this would be one of them. short jabbing terse shocks to the system....angry for the right reasons and truly persecuted, unlike those SUV driving mallrat pseudorappers clogging the brainwaves of everone under 21....hear BLACK FLAG when theyd get beat up for playing punk. they didnt have a hot topic to put eyeliner on in...not recommended to those under 21....let them have KORN..."},{"rating":"2","title":"...and here's the same song with Dez singing instead...","review":"Not the essential album by this band since these are the demos. And many of these tracks are featured here in 3 variations with three different singers. Some of these songs you don't find on THE EARLY YEARS or are different versions. The early flag stuff is gold and Chavo's versions here give the songs a more snotty adolescent fit. I like. A bit different from the out your gourd psycho streak heard from Rollins on DAMAGED (essential!)

Jealous Again-era songs are done as best as they would be done (although Chavo's vocals aren't really great; he's better on the Jealous Again EP).

Starring Ellen Barkin, Howard Hesseman and Howie Mandel, it tells a bland story with worn-out humor that is old the first time one hears it.An extremely serious king, played by Hesseman, has forbidden laughter in his kingdom and condemns his daughter to constant study. The kingdom's comical rebel, affectionately known as 'Weinerhead' Waldo, goes on his silly way oblivious of the king's disapproval. Frankly, though, the jokes Howie Mandel tells are so cheesy that it's hard to see where he's breaking any rules. Through an unlikely and dull series of events, Mandel's Waldo ends up plying his shtick for the king and princess, played nicely by Ellen Barkin.It pains me to write this review because I do appreciate much of the other work produced featuring Hesseman, Barkin, and Mandel but this Faerie Tale Theatre episode should have never seen the light of day."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 3/4\\"","review":"To properly install these, drill a hole with a 1 3/4\\" circular hole drillfits fairly perfectly into the hole and then you have the speaker properly flush mountedas soon as i get them, i will be installing these with a passive crossover, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BFQWPM/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00along with some power acoustik 6.5\\" midranges, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PKMCEW/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00Will leave an updated review with my thoughts, if it doesnt sound right they sell 1 and 2 microfarad non-polarized caps @ radioshack that will effectively block any lows/mids"},{"rating":"1","title":"RobertR","review":"Well after two weeks at 40 watts (usually less then 40) these were blown.

What I want to quickly take issue with though is not the book but the comments in the review \\"Islamophobia.\\" It is ridiculous and frankly, offensive, to suggest that any writings about Islam and its adherents by Jews would be automatically biased simply because of the religion of the writers. Similarly, it is just plain incorrect to assume that no German writer could ever compose an insightful piece about Jews. Not all Germans are Nazis and not all Jews hate Islam. Now, if you feel that the content is unfarily critical that's a whole different story, but you would never know that unless you bothered to pick up the book and read it and not just make prejudicial assumptions based on nothing but ignorance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"David Frum promises an insider's look at the White House, but he doesn't seem to have had the access (or perhaps the time) to deliver. His stories are often about his own star-struck reactions to Bush and the inner power circle. Of course, he was only speechwriter for a year, and the personality he seems to be most familiar with is Karen Hughes. That would make sense, since Hughes vetted all of Bush's speeches during that period. She would have been an almost impregnable wall between Frum and Bush.Although he doesn't have many real stories to tell, Frum pads the book with personal, and partisan, observations. He decides that 9/11 elevated Bush's presidency by giving Bush a higher purpose, but he doesn't provide anecdotes to support his thesis that Bush is courageous, honest, or decent. The reader either accepts this view from the start (and most buyers of this book will probably already agree with it), or kicks himself for having paid good money for an insider's account that isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"is the author selectively blind?","review":"All you have to do is look at the shape this country is in to know that the author has not been honest in his appraisal of this president."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst.

Davie - but only if you're interested in a balanced, insightful and analytical look at the world's most powerful individual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Democracy, not theocracy","review":"When Bush the Elder began talking of the \\"New World Order\\", I was filled with dread for the future. Now, when I read of national policymakers holding White House bible study sessions, I join the ranks of the terrorized. Professor Paul R. Henggeler's just-published article on this book at least gives me some sorely needed comfort. Past presidents have made similar mistakes, and yet America survives. I do continue to wonder though how such esteemed policy advisors could be so timid as to submit to group bible study with their colleagues. The more the world sees, rightly or wrongly, an administration driven by religious beliefs, the more difficult our position in the world will become. War has everything to do with man and his weaknesses and nothing to do with anyone's God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the juicy stuff?","review":"If you're looking for an insider account, wait for the next book. Surely there must be someone in this administration who has more and better anecdotes. This book is pretty thin stuff.I give Frum a star, however, for pointing out a few negatives that most people aren't aware of: Bush is thin-skinned and has a hard time controlling his temper. He's used to getting his way, and he doesn't like to be contradicted. He really doesn't have much interest in what he's doing. He's most alive and happy when he's on the campaign trail, but the day-by-day dealings of the presidency irritate him."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Right Man? AN EDUCATED VIEW","review":"THIS IS A A QUICK REVIEW FOR A BOOK THAT CARRIES NO WATER!!i thought the author- david frum- ignored all the complications and ill business choices that were ignored during bush's run for govenor of texas in the 1990's. also, mr. frum's inability to present the 'other side' of bush when he ran for the presidency; his rocky past with business affairs as well as his inexperience in foreign affairs- these matters have come back to haunt us today, by both economic and diplomatic areas .overall, this book is very one-sided, it left me asking more questions than ever about our president: is he the right man for the job? could we (the american people) have picked a better person for the most important position in the free world?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comment of \\"Objective & Accurate\\" reviewer.","review":"The review written by Kyle ...should not be used as a deciding factor when purchasing this book. The Junto Society claims to be \\"a place where you can depend on learning the facts, not the political spin on the issues\\" however the website is so ultra-conservative in content that there is nothing left but spin. They \\"encourage you to sign the petitions that we support on this site, and to email your representatives regarding upcoming votes\\". How is that a place where you can depend on learning the facts without political spin when only one viewpoint is given?As for the book, I don't think anyone will come away with the notion that George Jr. is anything more than they thought he was before reading the book. It's not an in-depth study of the man or the office. How can anyone decide that Jr. is \\"The Right Man\\" based on this book? Simple. They can't. This book would be more useful on your coffee table as a coaster instead of reading material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Islamphobic","review":"I read the book and found it, especially in the chapter \\"religion of peace\\", to be full of Islamophobia. There is a difference between being conservative and islamophobic, which is equivalent to anti-Semitism. But, then one should not forget this is a book written by the coiner of the \\"Axis of Evil\\" phrase. Also I frankly doubt the credibility of Jewish writers wanting to tell us about Islam and Moslems, because if i wanted to learn more about the Jews I wont pick a German writer! Especially if a German writer is telling us about all the wrong things with Jews and their culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unflinching Portrait of a Great Man","review":"The thing that impresses me most about this book is the way David Frum doesn't shy away from telling about the unpleasant things that happened during Bush's first six months in the White House. Looking back now, it is hard to remember a time when Bush appeared weak and somewhat powerless, but during the first part of his presidency, that's where he seemed to be. Tragic as they were, the 9/11 events are what turned around Bush's presidency and where he found his definition as a true leader--the first President to be a real leader since the '80s!Reading this book has helped me to appreciate our President even more than I did before. He is a real human who makes real mistakes (like all of us) and isn't afraid to own up to them and try to come out a better person for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a 0 star?","review":"I can't believe that an average person who doesn't know the danger of Idealism can be elected to being the President of this country in the first place. It is even more surprising to see an author to mix up religious issues with political issues in a country which is supposedly having the most educated people on earth. Why would an author become so demagogic and take much advantage from pubilc ignorance and linguistic embellishment to praise this President who only cares about tax cut that would benefit the rich people? Aren't these problems obvious enough? Is he the right man? Definitely yes for rich people. Is the author blind, or does he think that the readers are blind? I can't believe that so many sheeps think that it is a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Much New...Skip It","review":"This book was a dissappointment: the recipe seems to be one part rehash of news events during the first 2 years of Bush's presidency plus one part bland observations of a White House insider plus just a dash of insightful rationale to support the title. Regretfully the book's most interesting parts (such as they are) are the author's first hand accounts about himself: his being asked to be a speechwriter, what happened to him on 9/11, his departure from the White House inaccurately reported by one of the cable networks. One might forgive the author for spending so much time discussing himself rather than the title character if only he had provided some genuine insight into the inner workings of the White House, but what few tidbits that are provided are few and far between. If you want to revisit the headlines during Bush's first 2 years, this book provides a decent summary otherwise its an unfulfilling appetizer without an entree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right for what? Armageddon?","review":"What a joke! It is almost laughable if it weren't for the fact that this country is going down the tubes led by the so-called \\"patriots.\\" Bush has always been a failure in every endeavour he has undertaken. From school to the oil business to managing a ball team to Governor. The man cannot even address the nation with bumbling his words and making little to no sense, yet this makes him 'right'? Ha! The only right thing he has done is finally coming forth and admitting that iraq had nothing to do with 9/11."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRAP - Good Read for those with Ambiguous Personalities!","review":"This is the best photograph a reader can have of GWB. Frum has done a good job with this book, with great amounts of detail, and with inside views of the current presidency.GWB is the sort of person one can admire or not, difficult to find a middle ground due to his strongly defined personality. He is a man that knows what execution means, and the implicit costs that taking action carries.At the end, you can determine the quality of a person by the caliber of his/her enemies. As with many other good presidents, in the US and other countries, we will see the very good results of this presidency in the long run.For a great counterpoint / parallel treat, I recommend that you read COCKPIT CONFESSIONS OF AN AIRLINE PILOT, by Keshner... read it at the same time.

Bush took us into Iraq because he said that Saddam had tons of illegal weapons and lots of uranium. Rumsfeld said there was overwhelming evidence. Bush was wrong. Now Iraq is in a horrible state of affairs, with looting, rapes, and complete instability. More GIs are dying by the day. And Bush goes and yells \\"Bring em on!\\". This is NOT a 50s Western.

Coupled with other dated or inaccurate information, it appears that the authors actually visited and researched few of the locations that were off the beaten track.

The information is sometimes wrong (unfortunately at the most inconvenient of times). In addition the book is hardly a \\"guide\\". The walking tours, for example, give you little information and simply plop you at a site. This is more of a handbook to accommpany a map. The book seems to inspire the kind of tourism where one looks, but does not realy try to understand the culture around you. The worst part about this book is that it is not arranged well. Each area you visit is arranged by \\"activity\\" like accommodation or food. This is particularly annoying in the Bangkok section, where one has to constantly flip from section to section in order to figure out anything about where you are in the area of town you are visiting.

Sure you are going to see a lot of other people with the same book in places it talks about but that is called success not a point of derision?If you want bang up to date information such as no book can provide then the web is the place to be. inchiangmai.com is a great site about Chiangmai:-)Whichever way enjoy Thailand.DW"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"I guess I must have gotten a bad one, but for the price I was totally disgusted with this. It was a tiny piece of nothing and if there was any catnip on this it wore off a long time ago. I could not even get my cats to look at this, what a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Laser is Great","review":"I just got mine and pointed it after dark out into the woods.. easy to put a dot on a tree a few hundred feet away. This is a very good laser Going to try some prisms with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice feel","review":"I like this pointer because it has a heavy and sturdy feel to it, unlike most of the $5.99 red pointers. It has survived several months of being toted around in my work bag inside its case. It also takes AAA alkaline batteries so they will be easy to replace when that becomes necessary.The downside to this product is not really a downside to the product itself. It comes in a carrying case which is difficult to open. The pointer can also get loose inside the case and rattle around."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book now available online for free.","review":"This book is now available online for free at the author's web site, since it is out of print.

I should have realized the size would be smaller since it is listed as a plate, not a platter. It is really a nice piece, but it is more suited to using as an individual serving plate rather than a platter, unless you are only using it for a smaller serving amount (perhaps 6 or 8 cookies, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Cha Wish This CD would get banned","review":"Ok, OK maybe not banned, but this certaintly won't be in the kiddie section. I being young myself of course did NOT buy this CD. Why? Cause it's discgracefully inappropriate! 'Don't Cha' is basically about a girl teasing a guy cause his girlfriend ain't 'hot' like her. It's a rediculous song and yet EVERYONE loves it. Why? I guess because they are all bad like that. The ONLY song worth listening to is stickwitu which is the ONLY song that is decent from them!! Other than that i would have giving this album 0 stars if i could. So in other words, this is NOT a album for Kids! And would you know they tried to make dalls for the Pussycat Dolls? HAHAHAHA, but the parents were like NOOO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PUSSYCAT DOLLS ROCK","review":"THEY ROCK MY FAVORITE SONG BY THE PUSSYCAT DOLLS IS DON'CHA BUY THIS CD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY ROCK"},{"rating":"1","title":"AKR, you are forgiven","review":"In fact, we both give this one star, and that's all that really matters, as long as no one s**ts on my opinion.

In case you didn't know, the Pussycat Dolls are American Idol contestants rejected off the show. Why? Because they can't sing and they have no charisma. So, these chicks decided to get together and form a stupid group called the Pussycat Dolls. Their idea of being charismatic is to prance around half naked and sing about being freakier than thou. You know, that might've worked with Vanity 6 back in the day, but now it's boring and played out. Maybe if they actually dressed in cat costumes they'd be a little more interesting. Anway, this CD sucks and I can't believe how they had the audacity to butcher Soft Cell's \\"Tainted Love\\" and and Donna Summers \\"Hot Stuff.\\" Skip this garbage and get EnVogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do people really think these chicks are empowering????","review":"Seriously? Come on. For real? People have actually given this piece of garbage of an album 5 stars? And they truly believe these skanks are empowering? What has happened in our culture that crap like this passes as music? In one breath, they're trying to steal a man away from another woman, convincing the guy that they're \\"hot\\" and \\"raw\\" and in another breath they're saying how they wanna stick with the guy they're with forever. I just don't get it. How can you be a total man stealing whore one minute (and completely full of yourself while doing it I might add) and then the next you want to be the loving faithful girlfriend who wants a long lasting relationship? Their singing abilities are average at best, and if they weren't half naked all the time, bending over chairs, thrashing around like wild animals, and singing about how sexy and hot they were, nobody would be paying attention to this garbage. This is the epidomy of why sex sells."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun - Love PCD!","review":"PCD rocks it! This CD is sexy, fun, empowering and upbeat. I want to dance as soon as I turn it on. I love it and turn it on especially when I'm feeling like a \\"dead mommy.\\" It transports me for a moment, keeps me young and makes me smile. If you like PCD, you'll love this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pop Effort","review":"...not the most deep or thought-provoking lyrics, but definitely entertaining and catchy tunes. I give it an A for effort and appeal..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like just the radio hits, dont buy the CD","review":"I liked the 3 songs that have been played on the radio \\"don't cha\\" \\"beep\\" and \\"buttons\\", enough to buy the CD via Amazon of course and was dissapointed in the CD after those songs played and the Cd continued onto it's less than average fare. I wanted to cry and say my god, I bought this trash. I will only play at the most 4 songs on the CD and skip all the other ones. The point of my rant is if you like the songs playing on the radio and every where else, dont expect more of the same once you buy the CD it's a let down. I bought the CD b/c I wanted fast music, not boring remakes of '50s ballads. The last what seems like 5 songs come from a different decade, so you could tell they were short on material. Sad shame they used others music and acted like they could sing it better. If I wanted 50's music trust me...i'd buy it elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"So I will keep this short and sweet. I like this cd. I was not expecting to like it as much as I do. I figured \\"Hey, it has two good songs(Dont Cha and Stickwitu) that I will just repeat over and over and ignore the rest of the album\\". But after listening to it, those initial songs are not even my favs. I have to say the best songs are \\"Buttons\\", \\"Bite The Dust\\", \\"Beep\\", \\"Feelin Good\\" and \\"Wait A Minute\\"...and the remake of \\"Tainted Love\\" aint so bad either. I would suggest that anyone who likes good pop tunes gives this album a try. Its definately something good to listen to when you are getting ready to go out and PARTY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"i bought the cd after hearing PCD's perform 'sway', & wasn't dissapointed with any of the other tracks. Being an 'oldie' that still loves their music 'n' dancing, this is the most refreshing cd i've heard in some time. Hard to choose a favourite track, perhaps 'buttons' for it's drum beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"Is this what the music industry has come to. I mean honestly this is just awful. Thier best talent is being hot, and really that isn't much to be proud of. Although in todays soceity i guess it is. Sad isn't it.I've only heard 3 or 4 songs form this album (forced to at my mates place by his sister) and I was disgusted. That stupid 'don't cha' song is just shocking, the lyrics are awful, it might aswell just be 'don't cha wish your girlfriend was a sl*t like me'.And if you actually enjoy this music (shame on you) then think about this, do u think this kind of sh*t would be popular if it weren't for music videos. The answer is no, it wouldn't because hot girls are hard to market through thier awful voices.I give this excuse for music 0 stars and I also wish everyone would wake up and relise what the music business is becoming because of awful sl*ts like these wh*ores."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak album, don't buy it","review":"weak album, don't buy it. From the first track to the last you feel there's a lot missing to make this an o.k. album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"I like all of the songs on this CD. All of their popular hits that you hear on the radio are here. They also do some interesting cover versions of older songs.Realize this is pop music, not fine art. If you are looking for music to shake your booty to, this is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"PCD is a little played out.","review":"I used to like this album, when it first came out. But know its just so boring, and the lead vocalist Nicole's voice is so annoying. I only like \\"Right Now\\", \\"Bite the Dust\\", and \\"Feelin' Good\\". The Pussycat Dolls are a little boring now, and they cannot perform live good."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY SHOULD STOP!","review":"I dont like any of these songs except \\"Stickwitu\\"It's very pretty and actually has nice lyrics. I'm not putting them down like hatred but these girls are 30 yr old woman trying to sound like 20 and 18 year old.This should be there last album they make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak music for ignorant tools","review":"To call this music, is an insult to anybody to ever call themselves a musican (and to actually be one!) so i'm sorry for o ffending you all (and myself) by calling this music. Or maybe it is music and its just me (No it isn't) but after you listen to the riff in Vital Remains \\"Devoured Elysium\\" at about 1 mintues and 30 secodns into it and watching Cannibal Corpse perform \\"Hammer Smashed Face\\" live, there is just no way you could call this music. This is music for people who like fitting in a crowd and are afraid of having revolation of self."},{"rating":"1","title":"singing models who can't sing","review":"Just because they're hot, doesn't mean their farts don't stink. They do, and I'm primarily talking about musical farts. Because that's what this is. To borrow from a definition from a well known on-line encyclopedia, here are twelve stinky, noisy \\"releases of a mixture\\" of a sort of waste product, produced and \\"released under pressure\\" by the entertainment industry \\"with a characteristic sound and unsavory odor\\" (Wikipedia). Farts may amuse, they may entertain, but once one reaches adulthood, farts become, most of the time, just rude, crude, and embarrassing events.If you enjoy paying for musical farts, be my guest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don'cha wish they'd just go away?","review":"Oh boy! Here we go! The Pussycrap Dolls try for respectability in the music business! NO WAY WILL THESE \\"GRRLZZ\\" EVER BE RESPECTABLE IN ANY BUSINESS EXCEPT BEING HIGH-PAID PROSTITUTES! You blew your wad on your first single, and you will now go down in video history as a one-hit wonder (although I don't know how much of a hit it was). I say again, \\"POP MUSIC SUCKS these days, and anyone who buys into this crap doesn't deserve ears. Now please, just fade away, or get pregnant, or whatever. Just don't tell me you're anywhere near me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get in the kitchen and fix me a turkey pot pie b*tch","review":"Unless these dunces do some porn, there's nothing fearless (the lead singer claims they are) about them. Don't I wish my girlfriend was hot like them? The world is filled with countless brainless hot girls who can't be bothered in every stinking town... You can't swing a dead cat without hitting one. There's nothing special about these idiots. Empowerment (also claimed by their singer)? Whatever. They are offensive to men and women alike, as well as the gods and goddesses of music and good taste. What they need to do, is close their collective pie holes and open up their legs for porn. Then we'll see how much of a freak they are...until then, shut up and go fix me a sandwich."},{"rating":"1","title":"People give this 5 stars? Why?","review":"I think that if you are going to use a drum machine it would be a good idea to learn to use the tempo key. The first eight songs all played at the same speed making it seem like I was listening to one really long boring song with lame lyrics. I'm sure the videos must be better as this group must rely on the T and A factor. It is also a shame to remake songs worse then they originally were as this group does on several occassions. But there must always be a plus side for every action so here is my attempt for wasting the $14.00. The disc does make a good drink coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do the words 'Burlesque Act' ring any bells?","review":"Not only can these bimbos NOT sing, but they are hoes. Come on - these idiots have been prancing around half-naked in Vegas for longer than they've been a group. Plus, they do absolutely nothing for women's rights, and 'Tainted Love' is too great a song to be molested by these twits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just download the good songs","review":"I heard most of the songs and believe me they are not good, some sound like broadway and just blah. The only good songs on there is the ones that are singles other than that they suck. I think PCD should stick to dancing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pussycat dolls","review":"Well, this CD is okay but unfortunately the two tunes that they released on the radio are probably the best on the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the \\"Poles\\" to the Studio!!!","review":"The Pussycat Dolls basicly took the world by strom overnight. Before their hit Don't Cha, they we're not known as artists of this type! Once they releaced their hit record though, they became singing superstars!PCD, the first album from the Pussycat Dolls, is actually a very good cd. The smash hit Don't Cha, was and still is being played on the radio like crazy, and has made the Pussycat Dolls a name that many people want to hear. The hit was just one of those things that made people want to dance because of it's great beat!Then came their now biggest hit, Stickwitchu. This hit has made shocks over the airwaves, and is taking the Pussycat Dolls to a whole nother level of superstar fame!Although they have mainly dancing girls, the Pussycat Dolls are a force to be reconded with because of their catchy songs and great dance moves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawt!","review":"100% times hotter than the Spice Girls. Are they the bestband ever? NO but they sound good and are fun to watch. Juding from many reviews we have lots of guys who could never score with chicks like this, and women who wish they looked liek the Dolls. Take the haterism out of your game yall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!","review":"Wait, I can't stop laughing.....This cd is total crap! Nice drum machine, did they break out the old pink Casio keyboard for it? One girl does most of the annoying singing and the rest just shake their behinds. This is a joke right? this can't be considered a real group?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This is the kind of thing that when you become an adult, your too embarrassed to own it, so it goes in the trash. You won't even see it at garage sales. I'm even embarrassed writing a review. I was just looking at reviews of those who discriminate against class acts, in a crass and useless manner, and came across this rubbish. A couple of listenable songs, but that is because of the guy at the dials. As for lyrics, who writes that stuff, beyond trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUBBISH","review":"Piss on this trash, \\"Don't Cha\\" is the stupidest song to hit top 40 radio this decade which is REALLY saying something considering the absolute BS that is modern music. And to think,10-15 years ago musical inspiration had reached a zenith with bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Oasis, Blur, Pulp, Stone Temple Pilots, Sublime, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, The Verve, Radiohead, R.E.M, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More, Janes Addiction and many, many more...god how i miss those times"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A LET DOWN!!","review":"I can't believe I wasted the 9.99 on this cd. After listening to the album twice I decided to check out the reviews because it is soooo horrible. After reading the reviews I though maybe I missed something because it got high praises from quite a few people. So, I listened one more time just to be certain. I am certain...this cd sucks!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"* 0 stars PCD= short for partially correct dump","review":"I wrote a review earlier but this one is what I really meant. These 6 stripper hoes don't know how to sing. The only pretty ones are Jessica, Ashley and Melody. But you don't know who they are because Nicole's ugly ass is all up in the camera. Carmit is butt ugly with her red hair"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with all the covers?!?!?","review":"Catchy tunes, but what's with all the covers??? And tainted love? Man that just doesn't sound right!!! The lyrics seem very shallow from what I've heard, especially don't cha (or however they spell it :s ) lol, anyway, if ya just lookin for a couple of fun tunes to dance to this seems ok :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM!","review":"WHAT A FUN ALBUM THIS IS! I LIKED EVERY SONG ON IT THE FIRST TIME THROUGH, WHICH IS RARE FOR ME."},{"rating":"2","title":"At first","review":"When i listened to the first song \\"Don't Cha\\". I wasnt really feeling PCD at all. Its still not one of my favorite songs by them even with Busta on the record. But after hearing \\"Stickwitu\\". I was like okay, maybe i should give them a chance. Then came \\"Beep\\" i was feeling the song from the outset and the video is on point as well. Especially the beat. Then \\"Buttons\\" with Snoop Dogg after that. I was like i'll go ahead and take the plunge. I really like the cd overall. There are a couple other songs that i like on the CD. Including \\"Wait a Minute\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't cha wish that they would stop?","review":"I am a 12-year old and yes, everyone listens to this record in my age. But I think the Pussycat Dolls have no talent. All they can do is showing of their bodys and doing Sex-Songs. I mean, just listen to the text: \\"I don't give a 'beep'/ Keep looking at my 'beep'/Cause it won't mean a thing if you're looking at my 'Beep'\\" or this one: \\"Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me\\" This is just really gross! I don't understand how you can give THIS 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"COME ON!!","review":"This music right here is a perfect example of showing just how far down music has gone in the past few years. Stickwitu you have got to be kidding me!!\\"stickwitu\\" not even a word and when I first heard it I was utterly disgusted and said to myself because teenagers are just used to this crap they call music these days this will be a hit. Absolutely atrocious!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...this is awful","review":"If you are dumb enough to buy this crap then you probably are not smart enough to read and comprehend the English language. Therefore writing a review that captures how awful this is, is most likely a waste of time. But here it goes. Given the state of low quality, overproduced crap that currently litters the airwaves, this is at the bottom of the barrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is anyone suprised?","review":"Sex sells - this is a fact in American culture. But why is everyone so suprised that a lack of talent has made its way into the music industry? This has been going on for ages. Recall Milli Vanilli - their good looks marketed music that they weren't singing. Apparently, it was thought that the original singer wasn't handsome enough to sell the music.As far as a lack of talent goes, this applies for many artists in the hip hop and pop industries. With today's technology, an artist needn't be able to carry a tune or sing in harmony - the machines will do it for them. As long as the background beat is catchy, Americans will buy.Still appalled? Boycott bad singers and don't buy their albums. Let's start with The Pussycat Dolls and Britany Spears."},{"rating":"1","title":"HA!!!! And most people actually think they are GOOD!!!!","review":"Really, after reading all the reviews favoring this album, I had a good laugh over the fact that the public is amazingly and disgustingly BLINDED. Please, so what if the PussyCat Dolls are somewhat \\"hot\\"? Any bunch of girls would look sexy if they were to show up half-naked at every public appearance and can dance their booties off, simply because sex sells in this industry. Man, I pity all those who admit to loving this lifeless noise made up of superficial, shameless and self-indulgent lyrics, cringe-worthy tempos, corny melodies and mindless club beats masquerading as \\"DANCE-POP\\". As if Britney isn't enough.PS.If you REALLY REALLY want to listen to music from faux-artists, then listen to t.A.T.u. At least their music is enjoyable (and definitely deeper) despite the lesbian image used as a marketing ploy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans can never be objective...","review":"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...Girls who gave up spice for a bit of milk...Pussycat's are not a new manufactured idea, and at times they are a wee bit o' fun. But a whole album it doesn't make."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"This album fits the bill for it's genre- pop. I am lukewarm to pop music but I loved the Dont-cha single A LOT. I liked Hot Stuff for something to dance to in front of the mirror at home, and Beep a little bit, but the only song I would listen to repeatedly on the album is Don't cha.On an aside: if you actually hate the music in a particular genre, you should not write reviews within it because your opinions will not be useful to the audience of the genre. So if you hate pop music, go write a review about something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I don't understand why every body loves to hate The Pussycat Dolls, just because there sexy and talented (Well the one who sings). The album is full of hits , my favourites behind : \\"Don't Cha\\" , \\"Beep!\\" And \\"Tainted Love/Where Did Our Love Go\\". The only two tracks which I didn't really like where \\"Right Now\\" and \\"How Many Times, How Many Lies\\" and even those where at least 3 stars. There's something for everybody on this album, pop, dance, r&b even a bit of electro. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY MUSIC LOVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"radio pop","review":"The album contains their biggest hits, it's the kind of music you can listen to when you're doing housework or to have on as background music when surfing the net."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful girls...Horrible music...","review":"Ok, i dare any one in the world to listen to this non sense nulity without the really beautiful and sexy girls in the front.....It's impossible!!!!It's absolutely hollow ,and besides the fact that the girls are gorgeous, the fake sexy feeling and the complete lack of talent of 5 in the 6 girls makes all the stuff really unbeliavable!!!

Who doesn't? Enjoy many of their greatest hits right here on one CD that is sure to go double platinum if it hasn't already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Nicole Scherzinger And the Songs!!!!!!","review":"The reason why I like Nicole Scherzinger is that she sings well and she is pretty and hot and sexy and when I watched their music video buttons and it made me blush a lot why because it is a very sexy song and I love that song!Here are the 3 songs I saved on my computer,don't cha,buttons and that song is very outstanding sexy,and stickwitu was a verysad song but it was good and read reviews about people saying that Nicole Scherzinger is very sexy and hot because she does a lot of sex dancing and that the fact that I am in love with her because she is pretty and sexy.I wanted to buy the cd but it is just gonna be a waste of money but I saved their 3 songs I like and when I wake up at 5:30 and I always want to watch their video buttons because I am in love with that song and thank you pussycat dolls for creating this song and I really loved it and Nicole Scherzinger,I love you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spicier","review":"I am a dancer and my teacher listens to this CD all the time. It sounds cool and everyone had this CD. It is spicier and hotter than ever. PCD is going to be a big hit on the charts forever. It's hip, young, and funky and they are not stupid unlike some reviews I hear from my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance Floor Super Album, Anyone?","review":"Ah, yes... resurrecting the old 90's pop success formula again. Hot girls + little clothing + surprsingly addictive, well-trained, hard-to-admit-but-you-really-like-it vocals = happy music execs and rich girly-girls. Now we're left with their album. It's good, addictive at times so much so that you may find yourself getting up in front of your friends, despite how white you may be, and dancing your little heart out. Though the album is very good (a solid 4 star, no more and no less), I failed to see the \\"dolls\\" through the \\"doll\\"... the lead singer, Nicole, lets loose on the album, but where are the Pussycat DollS? It turns out the other five girls are backup girls, even more so... they're back up to Nicole's back up. Either way, the doll (singular) leaves us with a decent dance-pop record..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for a first timer!","review":"This is pretty great. I love Don't Cha because it is so upbeat and can get you in a great mood especially if you like someone or just broke up with someone. Another great song is Stickwitu because it is all about being in love. Another great song is Beep because it's also upbeat and one you'll want to sing to just like Don't cha. THis is a great cd and would make a great present for anyone of any age.Trust me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"Do not and I mean do NOT support this so called group. What happened to the days where women wrote deep down, emotional feelings in their songs and didn't use MTV to sell their music? So don't be surprised when all these girls are found working at a strip club soon in your town. Who in the hell told them they can sing in the first place? So avoid like Britney Spears, J. Lo,Trina, Lil Kim, and so on. If you want a female artist(s) who writes great music and don't use crap a** lyrics, get Aretha, Chaka, Diana Ross, Mary J. Blige, Toni Braxton, Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, or Janet's Velvet Rope album (though it's sad how she uses her image more...but it's still a great album)"},{"rating":"2","title":"PCD is very good.","review":"i Am 10 years old and I really like the pussycat dolls's new album. I really want it for christmas!I would definatly buy this product if I could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album","review":"Every on as heard Don't Cha on the radio and if you liked that you won't be disapointed by the PCD album. The vocals are great and so is the beat. I'm not a huge fan of the original tainted love song, but I do love the PCD's version. The album is all about fun and the girl's realy can sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophisticated fun","review":"Probably everyone has heard their hit single \\"Don't Cha\\" - one of the catchiest songs of this year. But most of the people who haven't heard their album, perceive The Pussycat Dolls as some fancy-clad chicks showing off their bodies (\\"Don't Cha\\" video) and having fun. Yes, Pussycat Dolls are about fun, but there's also so much more to their music! Great vocals, brilliant production and some really well written songs. Unlike Destiny's Child or many other r'n'b performers, The Pussycat Dolls are unpretentional, still being able to deliver truly soulful music. The best description of their style is \\"sophisticated fun\\". The lead single, \\"Don't Cha\\" doesn't even give a hint of brilliance of the rest of the album. Don't let yourself be misled and give those girls a credit to check how unexpectedly surprised you may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Special","review":"The Pussycat Dolls are a wonderful talent and PCD has numerous hits for your listening pleasure. It's one of my favorite CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey! Not bad Pussycat Dolls...not bad at all!","review":"Well I gotta say, after hearing \\"Don't Cha\\", I was hooked (that, and the fact that the lead singer is HOT)...interesting fact: Nicole Scherzinger is actually from that Popstars group \\"Eden's Crush\\" (ugh). Hopefully her next gig in the PCD will last longer!Well back to the album...unfortunately no track really holds up the way Don't Cha did (which is a GREAT song btw), but many of the tracks are DEFINITELY worth listening to, including (in this order):-Hot Stuff-Wait a Minute-Beep-How Many Times, How Many Lies-Right NowI was expecting a pretty crappy album, but I was actually quite surprised of how funky so many of the songs are. If I were to guess, I'd say \\"Wait a Minute\\" would be their next single.Anyways, don't hesitate to get this fun, upbeat album.

One of them sounds exactly like Christina Aguilera. Although much of what they've done are remakes, they have a good sound. Don't Cha isn't as good as the original but I still like it nevertheless. I like their vocals and their look. I don't know if they have major staying power or are only hot at the moment, but with some of the songs here, they could have a few more top 10 songs to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? Why are we subjected to this dreck?","review":"Not the group you want young girls emulating - unless you want them believing that dressing like a stripper (ha-ha) and acting like a ...well...is the way to \\"empower\\" oneself as a girl/woman. I'm not entirely certain any of them can actually sing (the lead singer's croonings barely count as such).

Looking at the Pussycat Dolls, you wouldn't think that they could actually turn out something this good. I loved \\"Don't Cha\\" but was hesitant cause I didn't think they could do anything as good but I was very wrong. The album starts off with the summers best single \\"Don't Cha\\" and gets better. \\"Beep\\" is a very clever and original song, could easily be the next single. There is only one song that I'm not really that crazy about which is \\"Hot Stuff\\". The cover of \\"Tainted Love\\" I really enjoyed. Even though my review is somewhat scattered, this album is worth the money, it can keep you easily entertained everytime you listen to it. Great Album from the Pussycat Dolls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spice Girls With No Spice.","review":"\\"PCD\\" may stand for Pussycat Dolls, but for all I know, it could also stand for Pretty Crappy Drivel. Jeez, how much lower can the music industry stoop? Now, don't get me wrong. I like guilty pleasure pop as much as the next Spice Girls or Justin Timberlake fan, but \\"PCD\\" is guilty pleasure pop that's high on guilt and low on pleasure. \\"Don't Cha\\" is passable radio-fluff; imagine a filtered-down Destiny's Child with just a fraction of Beyonce's sass. \\"Stickwitchu\\" and \\"Waitaminute\\" go in one ear and right out the other, and they have the unmitigated gall to ruin \\"Tainted Love,\\" a old tune Soft Cell made famous back in 1982. Would anyone old enough to remember Soft Cell's version appreciate the Pussycat Dolls' version? Highly unlikely. \\"PCD\\" gets the dubious honor for making a great argument in favor of copy-protected CDs. That's because no kind person should rip and burn music this bad for his/her friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"even you can make millions!","review":"It's really not the Pussycat Dolls or their songs that bother me.

I knew there were tons of gullbile idiots out there but I didn't think they'd fall for this again!! cheers!\\" (clink sound of champagne glasses)I mean I'd call them marketing geniuses but really it's so obvious you wouldn't think it would work these days.

The other songs are fairly respectable, even though the same beats and lyrics that we are probably used to....but for some reason, the PCD makes it work, and I applaude that.

Only tiny letters in the back cover tell you it's just a compilation, but who reads those in the store?

She evens demonstates an obvious hostility towards dogs. What information she does present is so skewed and reworked to justify her intense dislike for a great many entities in the world that it does little to promote any of her socalled nautral healing.

The problem with this booklet is the last chapter in which it becomes obvious that it has been published by an anti-christian organisaton. They believe if you worship on the Lord's Day (1st day of week) instead of the Jewish Sabbath (7th day of week) that you have the mark of the beast.

They rocked, and , more importantly, they stood up for those less fortunate than middle America. Than I head the song 'Daughter' and I learned that Eddie didn't have sympathy for at least one disadvantaged group in America: The mentally handicapped. On that track he cruelly and heartlessly mocks the vocal affectations of those with mental disabilities, just to get a cheap laugh. I'll admit it, his impression is dead on: He totally sounds like a 'tard.

Only the heartless are not hoping even in the face of this tragedy that Hannibal will win through and not be defeated. Also because the author is not writing what is to be a scholarly work he speculates in a manner which is very enjoyable making the book more readable. If you have never read anything about Hannibal but have always been interested I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannibal; Enemy Of Rome","review":"I think that Leonard Cottrell does a very well job of depicting Hannibal's march on Rome, with 90,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry, and 37 elephants. I also loved reading about Cottrell's opinion and what his thoughts of the battles were. I loved how he described Hannibal's strategies, tactics, and especially Hannibal's traps. The traps Hannibal set for the Romans were amazing. He showed that Hannibal was witty. My favorite part was when Cottrell was depicting the battle of Cannae. He did a real job of depicting the scene like he had first hand experience. It really gave me and idea when Cottrell would compare the battle with previous American wars, or when he compared the Cannae battle field to Central park with 70,000 dead Roman soldiers in it. So in my opinion, I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal: Enemy of Rome","review":"Have you ever had someone try to explain something, and you don't understand it? Well, in the book, Hannibal: Enemy of Rome, has a very similar situation. The book sort of gives you two different stories.The author goes through the same adventure as Hannibal when he was a live. That can make the story very confusing because you have a mind set of reading about Hannibal instead of reading what the author went through. The book was very interesting when I read about what Hannibal and his men went through during the war. Also, the author uses very difficult vocabulary, and was very difficult for me because vocabulary is not my strong suit.Over all, the book wouldn't have been that bad if the author didn't write some much about what he went through. I think that if he wrote my about Hannibal that there be more interest in the reading the book. In my opinion, Hannibal would have been an awesome book, if it followed the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Man is the strangest Black Flag album ever.","review":"Family Man is a musical copmilation way different from any other Black Flag album.

This is spoken word and instrumental. Yep, I missed that on the cover when I purchased the album and regretted it.The spoken word might have a few nuggets of gold in it, but not enough to buy the album or continually listen. The instrumentals aren't good enough to stand alone. Plus, I believe in the immortal words of MC5: \\"Kick out the Jams,...\\" Punk was the answer to self serving instrumental pieces like the ones that fill the last half of this album. This album reaffirms my belief that artists shouldn't break boundaries just to break them. It usually results in mediocre art.For the die hard Black Flag fans, embrace this album. I'm not trying to stop you. For music fans, avoid this album. It's pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Punkers who wear sandles...","review":"With probably the best artwork Raymond Pettibon has ever produced for Black Flag, this album/CD appears good...purely on artwork.

Really the beginning of what many see Henry Rollins being today; a know-it-all who has an opinion on everything! After hearing the first cut, then skipping to the next tracks...reality sets in!Family Man clearly is for a certain type of Black Flag fan, maybe the one's who are into veggie burritos and play the bongos.

FAMILY MAN gives you something your lame EXPLOITED albums never could... the balls and ability to leave their audience scratching their head."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album that broke the \\"punk\\" barrier.","review":"In 1982-1984 Black Flag would begin to make several very controversial moves. One would be growing their hair long, as it was a reaction to the dogmas of punk as much as confessions for their love of 70's hard rock and metal. Another was to incorporate a very \\"metal\\" and jazz influence into their music. Yet another was this controversial release, Family Man. Family Man is a weird album, made up of half Henry Rollins' spoken word/whacked out beatnik \\"poems\\", the other half Flag instrumentals. I found the instrumental portion to be far better than their \\"Process of Weeding Out\\" ep, and the poems are good- even if they're all very twisted (like for example \\"Salt on a Slug\\"). Both approaches meet in the middle with \\"Armageddon Man\\" which is both Rollins' spoken word with Flags music. An interesting concept, if not always a great album. Definitely P--ed off some punkers at the time, if not now.

I made a point of showing it to my four oldest grandchildren, ages 11, 9 and 7, who were all excited about a book I brought for them on money. I know that it made them feel not grown up, but also motivated them to read Smart- Money Moves for Kids for ideas that they can use themselves. As a former teacher I believe that one of the biggest mistakes parents make about their children is that they disregard the fact that children are quite capable if we allow them to be. It's important that the adults in their lives not only treat them with respect by soliciting their ideas, but also provide guidance for them as they learn about making important decisions about finances.Smart-Money Moves for Kids is always a great gift for children as well as for their parents.

Intrigued, I bought it immediately and went on to become a huge Meat Puppets fan. The Puppets blew away any vestiges of punk-rock dogma that then remained with their acid-drenched cowpunk soundscapes. Kurt Cobain obviously knew a good thing when he heard it, and covered two songs from this record on Nirvana's MTV Unplugged show. Recent similar acts like the Supersuckers and Rev. Horton Heat sound mediocre when compared with the inventiveness and originality of the Puppets.

Through my older sister I actually listened to MTV Unplugged album, which although dire like the rest of their music, covers 3 or 4 songs by the Meat Puppets. Intrigued and a fan of hardcore I thought it about time to introduce some meat into my diet. This is a truely beautiful album, which ranges from Hardcore punk, to blues, to country to bluegrass. Even the mellower moments are hard! The Meat Puppets were never a band afraid to experiment and this album gets all the just and deservered praise it so truely earns. Spilt myself in two is probably one of the best punk songs I've heard next to Black Flag's Police Story. Other bands I would reccomend in a similar vein are Husker Du, The Minutemen, and The Replacements. It's just a shame it took Nirvana for kids to discover this great band.The record industry truely sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.....","review":"After attending a Dinosaur Jr. gig a few weeks ago, a buddy of mine got into talking about how great the Meat Puppets were/are.

This doesn't rock at all, there's no decent hooks or songcraft, I played it once and will probably never play it again.

Meat Puppets II is one of the first (and finest) examples of cowpunk, and is a songwriting-based punk album, such asMurmurby REM. Like Murmur, Meat Puppets II is literally flawless and every song is great though \\"Lake of Fire\\" is the finest tune on here. If you want an eclectic, strange, and delightful album to listen to during the hot summer months, give Meat Puppets II a spin--or a million spins for that matter. It's THAT good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meat Puppety Masterpiece","review":"This is, in my opinion, the Meat Puppets' BEST album. Many fans will point to its successor, \\"Up on the Sun,\\" as the artistic zenith of the Pups, but I feel that this is the one that really packs a punch. Whereas \\"Up on the Sun\\" features equally solid songwriting, tighter arrangements and some downright jaw-dropping musicianship, \\"II\\" is the one that showcases the greatest level of pure, undiluted rock n' roll energy that just emanates from your speakers like desert heat waves. You can FEEL the keen musical awareness that each of these musicians brings to the table as well as the dynamic interplay amongst them (we can easily forgive them for drifting slightly off-beat every now and then!). Look at the album cover, and you may get some idea of how this album sounds and feels: colorful, floating, breathing, LIVING music with a unique vibe all its own.

I've listend to these songs over and over again until I can no longer listen to them and still I can not find any sign of brilliance or musical mastery. I admit, these guys are creative, but that doesn't necessarily have to be a good thing. The vocals are horrible, and the whole album feels sloppy and unpolished. The only thing that even let's out a little shimmer of talent is the guitar work, which I admit is awesome, and that's the reason I gave this album a star. I gave it another star for the rhythm section, which is ok, but not great or innovating. The simply horrible vocals lose a star, and the overall messy production of the album lose 2 stars.

This book also takes one through the battlefield of the soul as we witness the author's struggles to survive the minefield of a bad marriage, navigating with the same courage that earned him many combat medals.In the end,his heroism is not left to dangle in the undergrowth of a forgotten country,but left to fuse the reader with a geater sense of honor.You see if the author-a man of such courage,and digity-could still be turned into a patsy by a manipulating woman he loved,if he was never less then a hero for all the humiliations he suffered,then so many of us who once knew such pain,will be a bit more whole after reading through his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"rayjoy@ipa.net","review":"Every one who knocked this book is either a wanna-be or a REMF.

This book is much more user-friendly than many similar first-person accounts, in that it doesn't assume that the reader is familiar with military ranks, anagrams, abbreviations, etc. It's also remarkably free of the braggadocio of many similar books, and Mr. Constance comes off - in the early chapters at least - as a self-deprecating wide-eyed kid who has no idea what he's actually in for.Did anyone notice that starting on page 53 of the paperback, we're introduced to Senior Chief Rudy Boesch, who would of course turn out to be the cantakerous Rudy from the reality-TV show \\"Survivor???\\" (Who, as I recall, was blasted by his island teammates for not being able to start a fire despite his 42 years as a SEAL!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent,easy read by a Shooter who has been there.","review":"This is an excellent read by a Shooter/Operator who was willing to share some of the personal side of his life.

For the reader from Seattle if you do not wish to hear about the trials and tribulations of the VietNam war why did you read the book? Who cares about these Navy SEAL's? Anyone who fought side by side with them and a lot of other warriors who would have ended up as POW's if not for the actions of SEAL's, Marine Recon and Army Green Barets. From your comments it's easy to see how you feel about VETERANS Of Foreign WARS. There is only three reasons a persons such as yourself makes commits such as you have. 1.

These pages read like sound bytes. Surprisingly short in length, poorly written, littered with empty buzzwords, the text focuses, for instance, on the difficult bureaucratic problems bringing the Internet to school systems, but amazingly seems to overlook the joys and encouragement that many teachers and parents have experienced when kids are awakened to the wonderful uses of the computer. To harp on the lack of training of school teachers in this field is not what I was looking for in this book.

As a 15th generation Southerner and descendant of 7 Confederate soldiers, I cannot help but be a little delighted by Turtledove's alternate world with a CSA twice victorious over the USA. But reading these books has helped me to further recognize the positive role the USA has played in the twentieth century of our own world. Turtledove's world is poorer and bloodier than our world. Would I trade worlds and go to live in his? Not a chance, but I'll continue to enjoy reading about his."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent alternate history","review":"couldn't put this book down! if you like alternate history don't miss this series.

This is the second in what should be a series of 4, with the next coming out in July, I believe. This series will stand up by itself, or you can also read Guns of the South and How Few Remain, which can also stand alone or make an excellent continuation. Guns is of course in a different universe, but we can't have everything. The only problem I have with the book is that there are large number of characters spread across the entire continent. The problem becomes trying to keep track of who is on which side and where they are at. I wish a list of characters were included, or each section began by telling the date and location of characters. But as I said we can't have everything, but then again (I have to brag) I do have an autographed copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was too long!!!!!","review":"Harry Turtledove takes too long to get to the point.

This second one picks up right where the first left off, and steps on the gas. Excellent story, compelling characters, and great battle scenes. Looking forward to starting the third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing!","review":"Turtledove has written an outstanding, devouring tale of an alternate history. This series has (so far) been far superior to his other works such as \\"How Few Remain\\" because most of the characters are fictional or mostly fictional so he is much less limited in character development. While I would agree with other reviewers that there are many subplots, the depth of detail and breadth of vision of Turtledove in this series is remarkable. The most surprising aspect of this series to date has been his sense of humor and sublety. For example, 3-Finger Mordecai Brown makes a subtle cameo appearance, and (not to give too much away), when the AMERICANS bomb Pearl Harbor, a casually tossed in line about \\"this day will live in infamy\\" is too rich to pass up. Outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept; ok writing","review":"I am fascinated by Turtledove's analysis of how WWI would have progressed with this lineup of combatants. It apprears that he has an excellent grasp of the way WWI *actually* was, in the trenches, on the seas, and among those planning (and bungling) strategy. The actual characters are interesting and compelling, but their motivations and words sometimes do not ring true. Oh well; a small price to pay for a very interesting and compelling series of books. My prediction: the USA technically wins, but it's more of a \\"draw\\", with the CSA and Canada losing some territory, but remaining as adversaries of the USA. Will we see a WWII trilogy in the future?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop with the plot shifts, I'm getting dizzy!","review":"I like Turtledove, but the method he employs in this series, changing from subplot to subplot every 2-3 pages is nauseating. Just trying to remember who's banging who (literally; sex is a central theme in all his books) is mind boggling. Just when I begin to remember the difference bewteen Captain Morrell and Sergeant Featherstone (and they keep changing rank as well) and the plot picks up in intensity, boom - it switches to some completely different subplot. It took me longer to read this book than the past 5 books I've read combined!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Turtledove's The Great war: Walk in Hell has few virtues. It has poor character development and literally none that are sympathetic. Its treatment of blacks is particularly offensive. In Turtledove's world blacks are as despised in the north as they are in the south. Yet after being crushed in a Marxist rebellion, blacks are welcomed into the southern army where they flock to fight for the country that held them as chatel and continues to ruthlessly suppress them. The book does a disservice to the 100,000 blacks who fought for the north. Basically the book is an excuse to demean blacks and to use the n-word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the next one!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this second volume and I'm excited and somewhat frustrated at having to wait another year for the third. Still the characters shifting locations provides additonal light on how the war is going on all fronts. I look forward to getting a look at how the South American war is going first hand as Sam Carsten and the USS Dakota are heading there. I hope maybe a character could go into Europe to provide a more in depth look into that war. Also a question: Why did the US flag in the begining have 34 stars before Kentucky returned? I believe it should've been 33. Still a wonderful novel recommended to all history lovers! Go USA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same thing all over again","review":"I hate to give an author I like only one star, but this book is really only a copy of the first one. Yes the plot goes on - if you consider the many small story strings a plot. If instead of jumping back and forth between 15 different small plots which never touch, Turtledove had written 15 seperate stories, not one of them would be worth reading !!! As it is it is tolerable, but only because I hate leaving something unfinished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep a list!","review":"Harry,Harry,Harry; you write well but please ease up on the puns. This is well written, but beware: you almost need a list to keep track of the characters. Mr. Turtledove tends to use a very broad brush to paint his picture and presents the views of many characters; but you really need a program to keep track of who's who.In his Balance series, he does this; providing a list of characters both small and great. Here though, he doesn't.All in all though; it's a good and engrossing story of what might have been even if you have to keep notes on who's who."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"I bought this as a present but it feels good in the package and looks just like the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Bedding Set","review":"This set was perfect for my son's room.

Ah, big mistake. All of this talk about \\"catchy\\" songs was nothing but claptrap, I'm afraid; I hardly remember what any of these songs sound like... they all sounded exactly the same. The production was so muddy that these songs just sound like a giant ball of fuzz. Like, would it have killed these guys to shell out a few extra bucks and record in a decent studio? Eh, I guess it wouldn't matter since the songs themselves were completely generic and reek of poser mediocrity.

Anyone who's [angry], depressed, or even excited will always be able to relate to the pain in Henry's voice and the unstoppable brutality of the music.

Always a fantastic listen, Damaged is not an album that can be ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're new to 'Flag...","review":"Buy this album first. After 'Flag got it's act together with a steady lineup, they recorded this gem of hardcore goodness. Don't fool around with the earlier versions; in my opinion they're poorly recorded and lack the focus of a full album. This album, however, drips with the raw ferocity of Greg's sloppy guitar technique and Henry's insane vocals. This album signals the end of the more punky, '77 style sound of Black Flag (such as the one found on \\"The First Four Years), one echoed by countless bands at the time, such as the Circle Jerks, etc, and introduces the hardcore/thrash/metal blitz that sets 'Flag apart and hits you in the face like an audio sledgehammer.Highlight tracks: \\"Rise Above,\\" \\"Six Pack,\\" \\"Police Story,\\" \\"Depression,\\" \\"Padded Cell.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"This was the first album I bought with my own money, think it was 1984. I wanted it because my older cousins who were skaters listened to it. I can remember pretending to like it when I first got it even though I had no idea what Rollins is screaming about. As I got older this disc became a favorite not because I wanted my cousins to think I was cool. Instead, it was all about the intensity. My favorite song by them is Damaged II. That is a seriously dark song and Rollins screams, moans, whatever are believable. It has to be listened to, to understand the impact. I still listen to this even though I have heard it since 1984. 20 years and it is still the most intense album I have heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black's Best","review":"I believe this was the one of the latest with Henry Rollins.and to be honest I wasn't into Black Flag at all but HEY! this is Hardcore.Personally this is one of the best ten punk albums ever made in the history of Punk Rock Music.It's sometimes very brutal and melodic at the same time and has got very good lyrics as well.since Henry left the group for me it wasn't the same anymore.Personal favourites; damaged,tv party.."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Tape Died","review":"I had this album on tape for years.

Intensity thunders out from this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop bashing Rollins....","review":"Okay, first of all this is a good album period-its a change of sound from their previous years, but still it's a good album. I'm not going to choose a side for Black Flag-Morris vs Rollins because Morris rocks hard and Rollins rocks hard. However, I can see how some people don't like their aggressive more hardcore and angry sound found on this album and prefer their less instense more just plain punk theme of Keith Morris Black Flag has and vice versa. In conclusion, if you enjoy a more heavier, angry, twisted, and hardcore sound in your punk buy Damaged. And if you prefer a less intense and more straight up old school punk buy The First four years."},{"rating":"1","title":"raw power ripoff","review":"This record is vastly overesteemed. Alright, I'll grant you Rise Above and Depression but the stuff in between isn't so hot. If you don't have it, get a copy of Raw Power by the Stooges instead. The songs are just as 'damaged' and violent but somehow extremely catchy."},{"rating":"1","title":"just noise","review":"Damaged isnt music. There are no songs on this album. Its just discordant, grating, noise. Like fingernails on a chalkboard.

Get the first four years, chavo or dez cadena \\"keep\\" it more real, esp. Dez's damaged. My War is when they started getting in a good direction then lost it, imho. I remember getting this back in the day (94!) and being totally stoked, maybe if you want people to call you HC, then you have to get it, this album may be hard, but not it has no core"},{"rating":"2","title":"a timeless one","review":"The first Rollins record of Black Flag is one of my very favourite punk albums ever made. People complaining about it that is dated, I beg to differ on this point of view. The production (! ) is that raw that it is timeless instead of dated. The issues that are dealt with on the album, life's little and big miseries, are are from any time from my point of view. And the music? The songwriting is a-class material, the tunes stay around in your head for quite a long time. No pseudo punk band of today comes up with this kind of powerful musical fury that is emotionally that intense that you are sure to agree when they sing: It feels good to say what I want! It feels good to beat things up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All hype aside...","review":"This albums rocks. Nothing is more brutal than Black Flag when fronted by Rollins. In my opinion, this was Black Flag at their punk best. Not much can be said about this album that hasn't already been said.

Your hubbie is bound to spring joyfully through the door singing 'Sixpack' and you can rejoin with 'Tv Party' as you both sit down to your TV dinner + sixpack. Damaged is the ideal music for those on the go as well, the violent chords and angry vocals will cheer you up on your way to work, the daycare, or the co-op.

This is the blue print for all of the aggressive music ala Korn, Slipknot, Mudvayne etc. Without this , that stuff never happens. Every song explodes with intensity. Rollins spits bullets while Greg Ginn and co. shred and abuse their instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but kinda disappointing","review":"i like this cd, a very classic \\"true\\" hardcore punk album. This albums best track is probably \\"rise obove\\" and there are a few other good songs such as \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\" and \\"Padded\\" cell. this album wouldn't suite any musical tastes though...This album has a few drawbacks.Such as, the quitness of the guitars, but vocals loudly over them. Also, the singers voice gets a bit irritating after a while.This is still a good cd that hardcore punk fans must buy, but be aware even though this is a classic its not all that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"two stars for rise above ..zero for the rest","review":"Anybody who was around when this album was released knows this was the beginning of the end for Black Flag. I admit its far better then any of the boy bands pretending to be punks(blink, good charlotte etc.) out now. Somebody commented on how \\"groundbreaking\\" this album was because they couldnt find a distributor. Sorry but your confused too. This album was punk for the mainstream frat boys and others just like blink and green day are now. Pure crap if you want to hear raw punk buy the first four years."},{"rating":"2","title":"the last good Black Flag record","review":"Henry Rollins is to Black Flag what Sammy Hagar is to Van Halen. He joined after all the truly classic material had already been written, but led the band to their period of greatest popularity. This is the first album Rollins recorded with Black Flag, and the only good one. On this album, Rollins mostly sings songs that were part of the Black Flag repertoire from the period before he joined. Later, when Rollins started to contribute to the songwriting, the quality of the material plummeted. But this album is great. Buy this album together with the \\"First Four Years\\" compilation, and you'll have all the Black Flag you need. \\"First Four Years\\" includes the great singles with Dez Cadena singing. Compare the Dez version of \\"Six Pack\\" with the much-weaker Rollins version on \\"Damaged.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"High Risk","review":"My refurbished xbox 360 had a dead DVD drive 5 days after the warranty ended.The xbox 360 is prone to problems with overheating and also with dvd drive failure.

However, a lot of the examples hold no real-world value, and much of the book is an introduction that Julie Meloni does much better in PHP Essentials. The end of the book finally gets into some real-world examples, but earlier chapters can be downright confusing to a beginning programmer. One subheader in Chapter 7 reads \\"Careful with nonintegral comparisons,\\" which means little to those of us who are not experienced programmers.4 stars for completeness and sheer bulk, and because it makes an EXCELLENT reference for PHP programmers. It tries to do too much, however... and doesn't provide a good introduction to PHP. If you're new to PHP and programming, I recommend PHP Essentials be your first book, and that PHP 4 Bible be your guide after you outgrow PHP Essentials."},{"rating":"1","title":"PHP Unexplained","review":"I've found most books in the Bible series to be quite good and in-depth. This is not the case with the PHP4 Bile, which barely scratches the surface on the subject of the greatest open-source server side scripting language (PHP). The book is very simplistic, yet at the same time not descriptive enough of the simple examples it gives. Two exapmples in ch 27 did not work without having to change the coding. The book offers very little above and beyong the online manual. The book would better be titled PHP4 Bible For Beginners.

After a some research and thinking, I finally settled on learning PHP as my entry into real \\"programming\\".Why? It's tag-based and easy to learn. It plays well HTML and databases. It's logical for someone without a programming background. It's open source and runs on almost all platforms. About the only thing that PHP doesn't do totally well is OO.So I picked PHP and scoured Amazon for PHP books. Of all the books in my PHP library, about 6 so far, this is the one read, used and referenced the most. It is well written, filled with great examples, and easy to follow. Yet, I also know that if there is something that I don't understand I can look it up and there has always been a lucid and detailed explanation.If you are thinking about jumping into the PHP pool, this is a great aid for you to help begin swimming right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Examples too complicated, some errors, but adequate overall","review":"The first thing I noticed working through this book is that most of the examples are pointlessly complicated, and not even useful in the real world. There is no real layout to how functions are shown... you're given an example or two, and that's about it. Rarely do they give a detailed list of parameters, and how to properly use it. No appendix of functions for easy reference, either. The most disturbing problem is the glaring errors in the book. The biggest error is the assumption that register_globals is on, even though in recent versions of PHP it defaults to off. The code does not mention where this will matter, creating some very frustrating searches through the real PHP documentation on how to properly use a variable. I've noticed many other errors in the use of functions in the book. There is no errata on the website, either. This book is two years old, and shows it's age. Get a better PHP book... there's plenty of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Complete Reference Material","review":"For a beginner PHP developer, this book should be excellent for a start. Although it doesn't cover Oracle or MS SQL related function, it has short tutorial of SQL language; enough for building a dynamic database-driven web sites. I used to use Perl, this book made migrating to PHP simple. I like this book mostly because it explains function's behaviour clearly and list them by category (array functions, string functions, trigonometri function, etc.). It also has troubleshooting section for you to refer if you encounter problems running your script and doesn't understand what php said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Resource for those New to PHP","review":"This book proved to be the perfect resource for me.

I have bought several other Bible series books and was very happy with them. I have had this book for a while now and everytime I run into a problem I grab the book and it gives me no help. The index is very poor ... you can't even look up a simple function like urlencode cause it isn't there!

Mr. Travis really knows how to do a gospel album. Again, especially in comparison to most modern country gospel, this is really well-done: Very sensitive and not egotistical.I liked _Worship and Faith_ better; this seems just a little overproduced for my tastes and, overall, I don't care as much for the song selections. However, it's really not glaring, and people who thought W&F; was too stripped-down will probably love it.The cover of \\"Precious Memories\\" is easily one of the best versions of that song I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travis has it..........","review":"Some folks have it and some don't...that special little something that lets you take almost any song and make it yours.

Nor, really, do I consider this album a \\"gospel\\" album. You can if you want to--it has all the usual fixin's. I simply consider it a Randy Travis album--which is reason enough to rejoice, even without the presence of the Almighty.I've always said that Randy Travis was meant to sing country...and I still say that now. His voice is like none other. It just so happens that, when he turns his growly baritone to songs of faith, he can melt an atheist's heart. These songs--most of them classics--deal with every aspect of faith, and Travis's delivery, and Kyle Lehning's production, never misses the mark. GOSPEL TRAIN is a record to be reckoned with, and not just because it has God and an entire faith backing it. Call it gospel, call it acoustic, call it country...call it another great Randy Travis record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem from one of the best!","review":"Glory Train is another stellar offering of gospel gems by Randy Travis. The variety, both musically and selection wise is superb. Randy uses that expressive and emotive barritone beautifully here. \\"Were You There\\" makes this listener,wish they had been. He gives it such importance and power. \\"Up Above My Head\\" and \\"SWing Down Chariot\\" with the vocal harmonies of the Blind Boy's Of Alabama make these such enjoyable listening.

There is little practical examples, the style is very cryptic and hard to understand what the author really means, and the examples are so unrealistic....

She is very much in touch with herself as the female voice and tends to assume that you have a parallel awareness of yourself.

I have no problem with ethereal concepts but I prefer straightforward language, and at least an attempt to describe the concepts as specifically as one might describe an orange or a goat. But it seems that this kind of language speaks to many people...so if youre that kind of person, this book might be just what you need.Like most guys, I'm interested enough in getting chix that I will read numerous books on the subject, just for the exposure. And in that respect I guess this book was worth buying and reading. Other than that I can't say whether this book is really any good. I can only say I won't be using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book: save you money","review":"Yea, like the other guys I bought this book along with some of the other dating guides and really got burned. I really hoped Anthony would deliver the goods, but this book really was Un-helpful. I have read other books and at least learned something new, but this book was really stupid. Have you ever noticed that people with Ph.D.'s can often be the biggest idiots? This guy with all his macho bravo probably couldn't get a woman if someone put a gun to his head.

This author says something worth hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid info","review":"This is a good book for anyone interested in understanding how women think, and what draws psychologically healthy women to a man.

If you want insight into female psychology, however, this is a good book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title says it all","review":"Why aren't there more books like this? This is a true research work on how to succeed with women. I have not found material like this anywhere else. It tells you how women feel, what they want, how to deliver, how you already have what they want, how to get in touch with it and make it show. The exercises helped me a lot. I recommend this as a solid title in self help."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one wiggedy-wack book","review":"This book is 134 pages of psycho-babble. It is printed in large type, double spaced, indicating its vapid content, because if you formatted it normally the book would be about 12 pages long. There are about 5 of these double spaced pages which have some interesting content, but most of the book is badly written new age pseudo-psychological drivel, with crappy clip art, and odd snippets of poetry. The excercises in the book focus mainly on visulizations, but the book provides only a blank slate of weak concepts as fodder. How to Succeed With Women doesn't live up to its name, and is one wiggedy wiggedy WACK book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a complete waste of time, skip it.","review":"I hoped this book would supplement the information I've read in other dating books, mainly William Perkins book and Don Steele's books.

The quality and the information is boring, useless, and written in an overly academic style. Anthony doesn't stand a chance in the dating literature when there are other books out that propose a \\"street wise\\" approach. Besides, the information was hard to apply and didn't seem to be tested by real men in real situation.I recommend that anyone skip this book and purchase something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money!","review":"This is a worst book about women that I have ever red.

It's use of the word \\"energy\\" could also be confusing. I got very little out of this book, even though I did read it twice. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good insight for good actions","review":"This is a unique book. It spells out what women feel and want and makes these easy to see. The book did a good job of getting me to see that male and female are meant to come together in an easy way. It helped me clear away ideas that don't work and replace them with things in me that women want. The exercises take some time but I found them very worthwhile.

I spend HOURS every day on it and still there is so much game left. I haven't been able to complete it in a few days or a week like many other games.

I have purchased many DS games and this one is the highest on my list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Tedious and Depressing","review":"This game simply is boring and almost sad. I like the idea of the whole survival aspect but all you really end up doing is constantly looking for food (which the characters don't like), resting (really fun...), stopping for water, and trying to figure out why you bought this game. It can be sad in the respect that your characters always seem to be slowly dieing and all you can do is find random food items, cook and eat them ( doesn't help them much), and then going out to get more food items. It is very repetitive and even depressing to some people, especially younger children, my sister hated it! Overall a good idea but very repetitive and boring.Lost In Blue 2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, if you like tedious boring stuff.","review":"I got this game expecting an open ended style game. But there really is just one way to succeed. It was difficult at first to find the balance you need to survive but it wasn't fun enough to stick it out. The actual game play is clunky and the graphics are poor."},{"rating":"2","title":":)","review":"This game is so fun! I was looking for the first Lost in Blue in Gamestop, but they didn't have it so I got this instead. In this game you can choose betweeen Jack and Amy. Well it doesn't matter who you pick, your partner (The person you didn't pick) will just sit around and pretty much do nothing except put twigs in the fire and complain. For the first few days, it's almost impossible to keep your hunger meter up. I accidently poisened my characters twice (Oops) but it didn't kill them. The only thing that is truly frustrating is cooking and making a fire. If you like games that are really fun and not annoying (Except when your partner starts saying every five seconds \\"I'm hungry can we eat? I'm thirsty! Let's sleep I'm tired!\\") then you should buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frustrating at First, but Then Extremely Fun","review":"The first time I started playing I died within five minutes. I started up a new game and made it for about ten minutes. This is a game where your going to have to let your character die a few times and do a reload before you figure out important facts. At first I thought this game was super boring. Everyday I was gathering up coconuts and couldn't get hunger or sleep above 20%. Then I found a new location on the island and figured out how to fish. It completely changed the game for me. Now I hunt fish to get all my percentages up, and then head off exploring around the island. There are definitely things about this game that are a little tedious like the fact that your tools can break and you will have to rebuild them, but overall it's a very engaging game. Every time I play my adrenaline starts going as I'm trying to figure out how to survive on this island. If you can get past the frustration, this is a really fun game."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"Over all I like this game. It's challenging to keep your people alive but after dying a couple times I figured it out. While the main idea is to keep yourself alive you find new places and new tools that keep you interested in the game. It's a lot like harvest moon but without the mindless repetition that can happen. I've had the game two days and I can't seem to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating presentation.

The last chapter is where the authors try to put everyting together, and in my opinion partially fail in doing so.

A young man sent off to fight a war against an alien foe loses time with each jump of his starship, aging days or weeks while years go by back on Earth. Each attack is planned years in advance to accommodate this and the war stretches on for centuries while only months are passing for those that fight it. A fascinating novel written during the depth of the prolonged fighting in Vietnam, the book is a metaphor for that time--but one that is still valid and insightful today. It does what the best science fiction does; it heightens and explains our current reality through the application of times, places, and technologies that are still far, far away."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was a surprise.","review":"A truly interesting and unexpected concept. I am not a regular sci-fi reader but I really enjoyed this book.Even though some of 'them fancy numbers' went over my head, I found the concepts fascinating, and was like \\"hell yeah - that could actually happen!\\"It was a bit of a tough read (I am easily distracted and the book is long) but true and potential sci-fi fans will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"I'm a big sci-fi fan and this was one of the few books I could share with my wife.

Still, this is a solid and enjoyable piece of military sci-fi, and its tongue in cheek tone keeps it moving along even when the story line is a little flat.

It was truly average. Pedestrian. Workmanlike. Perhaps for its time, 35 years ago, it was cutting edge.

That isn't saying a lot.Alas, most books I read, I would never read again. This one, I'm sorry I spent the time in the first place. It's not bad. It's just not what everyone led me to hope for. The bar is set too high, and so the rating must be harsher.J"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing going in military sci-fi","review":"I have read \\"The Forever War\\" several times now, and I'm always amazed at just how good it is. On the one hand, it's loaded with action, has great characters and technology and is just a great read. On the other hand, it is a surprisingly thoughtful novel.Haldeman isn't just telling a story; he's examining why the human race seems to be constantly incited to violence, and the impact that violence has on us. His particular concern is the impact on the young soldiers drafted into an impossible conflict. In much the same way that soldiers in Vietnam faced an unknowable enemy with no home front behind them, so to do his characters face the ultimate enigma (an alien race) hundreds of millions of miles from home.Simply put, \\"The Forever War\\" is just an outstanding novel.

Within the bounds of theoretical science.","review":"I read this shortly after it was first published back in th '70's so my memory of the details of the book are a bit rusty. But, the fact that I recall not only the title but the author after this long shows the impact it's had. One of the first sci-fi's that actually dealt with general relativity as a consequence of distant space travel. Our hero, Private (at the start) Mandella survives his way through this interstellar war and the military ranks as well as a constant culture shock each time he returns from his campain battles.

No mystery here. Slick writing, hip 70's views about sex, politics and war equals Hugo and Nebula awards---simple as that. I disagree with reviewers who say the battle scenes are exciting. They are written purposely NOT to be exciting, NOT to be satisfying, NOT to be involving. This is an antiwar novel, not an enthralling story.

While I was impressed by the story's insights into the pointlessness of war, what stayed with me the most was it pervasive homophobia. Rather than coming away from the book thinking about the nature of humanity and admiration for Mr. Haldeman for writing such a wise and compelling story, I simply came away feeling sad. Sad for Mr. Haldeman for detracting this reader from the wisdom of his insights into the Vietnam war by his inability to see beyond his own prejudice and sad that friends and reviews would recommend such a homophobic book. With all of its insights, the book's greatest irony is how it could so movingly point out one form of human stupidity while pervasively supporting another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and Demented","review":"The first several chapters read like a high school short story writing project.

I liked its anti-war message and theme. It was a good analogy for how alien and lost veterans of war must feel when they return home.But I have to say overall I was very disappointed. It seemed very dated. Its depictions of sex were juvenile and overdone and didn't really add anything to the story.

The depth and vivid detail in this book was amazing, every page gave me a new visual and i often found myself right next to Mandella in combat against the tauren enemies.

Most sci-fi books come up with some \\"warp drive\\" or other propulsion system that discounts the effects of relativity. This one is centered around that very problem, with very intriguing results.Throwing some general relativity into a military story was cool enough, but then Haldeman actually manages to throw a love story into the mix as well. Very well done - as a result, I started looking for other books by Joe Haldeman, as well as similar authors (such as Robert Charles Wilson and John Scalzi)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I like military sci-fi and this is one of the classics.

This book was an *almost* winner for me--the Vietnam parallelism was a little strong (I knew exactly what the end result of the war was going to be because of this) and the overtones of sex and sexual orientation were also a bit overwhelming to the story.Thats not to say this wasn't an interesting book--the concepts of how faster than light travel would impact a war as well as society and individuals was really interesting. I did like it but it left me wanting a little more of the \\"military\\" part of the military science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I read this book because of the raving reviews, the awards it received and because I am a sci-fi fan. First of all, I was very disappointed with the writing. It is a mystery to me why it got all those awards. Writing style is not compelling, some of the dialogues are plain awkward, character development is unsuccessful and overall the book feels fragmented. The author had some original and very good ideas considering it was written in the 70's, and I can understand why it was a success back then given the relevancy of the story to the Vietnam war. But, he is not a good writer and everything about the book feels out dated today."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome adventure and scifi Nam experience","review":"This book is cool. Get a look into how much a country and a person can change during war. The earth Mandala returns to after each combat tour mirrors what it must have been like to return to the U.S. from Nam after so much social change in the 60s. The bureaucratic shenanigans do not change in the future, and in the end, nobody thanks the soldier for defending them from nothing. The joke's on you.

It had no staying power and I became disinterested in what would happen to the main character. By the end, the story was just dragging on and I couldn't wait for it to finish.And the finish itself was so lame. Talk about anti-climactic.

Most fiction deals with the issue by using some sort of hyperdrive technology, or worm holes, etc. Or, the trip taken is one way, so time dilation doesn't matter. In the Forever War, we are forced to think about the situation where humans go off to fight an alien enemy light years away, and when the soldiers return, massive amounts of time have passed. Earth is different, culture and society have changed to make the returning soldiers aliens in their own home. Absolutely brilliantly done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price","review":"I was hoping for something ok and I found an amazing book. It's quick and lively.

I can see why it is a classic in sci-fi, and I greatly enjoyed the detail it gets to with the physics, especially the time dilation that is the centerpiece of the book.The Vietnam allegory is very transparent to the point of seeming amateurish.The author's obsession with sexual orientation alternates between amusingly juvenile and disturbing.Also, while it is only mentioned occasionally, women being required to have sex with men on demand, by law (early in the book, assumedly not went Earth switched to a \\"homo life\\" norm; his word, not mine) is simply creepy.Also, the omnipresence of legalized drugs dates this book badly as well.While an interesting story worth reading, it has aged badly. The anachronistic viewpoints and society of the 70's are distracting at the least. Also, almost all of the technology is out of place, being too primitive at the start and painfully so at the end, given that a thousand years have passed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Very enjoyable read, read it in just a sitting or two.....can't wait for the movie! Hope they do it justice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This book is great. I think I found my new favorite science fiction writer the only problem is the ending is a little weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"sci fi classic","review":"This is a fast, satisfying read and alegit classic of science fiction. The characters are not terribly detailed or complex, but the universe Haldeman creates is so vibrant and urgent that the story remains one of the most compelling I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book!","review":"I really liked this book. First of all, \\"The Forever War\\" makes a greatly entertaining read (if only for the hell of reading). Though militarization and blind obedience (no matter how good the cause) causes my gut to wretch with pangs of utter puke, this book is a good and \\"frank\\" account of the possible psychological, moral, and socio-economic aspects of war. I learned a lot from this book and I recommend it highly and without reservations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Science Fiction","review":"This is, by far, one of the best sci-fi novels I've ever read. The first person perspective is fresh and draws readers closer to the characters. The book turns bittersweet somewhere in the middle but the ending washes away the bitter experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"SciFi at it's Best!","review":"Great story, great characters, great everything. An interesting way to re-read The Forever War is by substituting the middle section with Haldeman's original piece which is included as short story in his \\"Dealing in Futures\\" collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good at what it is.","review":"Not literature, but a good punchy story. Haldeman tells the tale of a soldier fighting a lightspeed campaign who finds himself increasingly isolated from the society he is fighting to protect. This isolation is caused by the enormous spans of years that pass on earth relative to his few months on campaign. Each battle is a huge gamble since neither side knows if they are fighting troops from last week or from one hundred years ago. Technology changes at breakneck speed and language, customs and social mores change at the same rate. This is a frightening and thought provoking image of interstellar war told in a spare and direct style. There is a heavy focus on the tools of war and the armour suits which save your life by lobbing off limbs here and there during battle. A good short read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar language","review":"I stopped reading after 6 f*** and 3 g**d*** in the first 6 pages of the book. For those of you who are bothered by this sort of language then this book probably isn't for you. I don't care for it and think it is unnecessary for good literature. If this was a historical work then maybe it would be needed for accuracy, but a work of fiction doesn't have to have it on such a vulgar scale. I am giving it one star based on the fact it was unreadable for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, boring, waste of time!","review":"Don't bother with this book. I forced myself to read halfway through this book before resigning to the fact that this book is just plain 'silliness' wrapped up in sci-fi technobabble and hippy-love politics.The main characters are 'elite' conscripts (what conscripts have ever been elite?) simply because their IQ rates >150. They smoke weed whenever they like in service, the female conscripts are legally obliged to have sex with male conscripts as part of the 'perks' of the service and have assigned random sex every night (which they rush to with open legs, of course, in sci-fi land...)The story is very slow to develop and even by halfway through the book hasn't even really started.This book would probably appeal to teenage boys with military-sexual-alien fantasies.For a mature good sci-fi military book try Lee Stephen's Dawn of Destiny.Note that 'The Forever War' has 11 ratings of 1 at the time of my writing this review, and Dawn of Destiny has all 5-star ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly for Teens. . .","review":"I've enjoyed several sci-fi books through Amazon and generally find the reviews helpful. For this one, I can see why teen males would find it \\"deep\\" and give it high marks. There's plenty of sniggering sex-and-drugs-in-space, all told by a jaded and self-obsessed main character. For grown-ups in the 90's, however, this book is awfully stale."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"I stopped reading around page 100 it was so BORING. FLATliner. Unemotional. No depth what so ever. It is like procedural. This book is beyond over rated. I agree with all the 1-2 star ratings...this book, this author has nothing to offer.I would recommend to you Frank Herbert's Dune series. I can't find anything that even comes close to it.......and I've been searching a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Forever War","review":"Frankly, I wasn't at all surprised at this boring, whiney and none too amusing parody of all things military or patriotic using the guise of sci-fi genre. After all, this has been done numerous times before. Sometimes it's a book, sometimes a movie adaptation used as a total corruption of the book (one memorable example is the deliberately asinine motion picture perversion of the \\"Starship Troopers\\"). What surprised me is how many people have recommended this trash on Amazon! Come on, you can't be serious: even if you a passionate peacenik you cannot honestly claim that this nonsense is anything new, imaginative or thrilling. Nor is it of good literary style, as far as I can judge - English being my second language. My sincere advice to the perspective reader: save yourself time, money and agony and buy some other book. There are plenty of good sci-fi authors out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book is pure garbage, don't waste your money. How it got some of the reviews it did is beyond comprehension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good.","review":"I will be concise.This book is highly overrated. This \\"science fiction masterpiece\\" doesn't come close to the engaging prose obtained in his short stories.For starters, this world is poorly detailed, hardly any historical info of his \\"future world\\" was given and I'm sure Mr. Haldeman could somehow have integrated some of that info. into the story.Secondly, where's the detail?Oh, of course detail is given, but at sparse intervals, and even then it doesn't present any real feeling of atmosphere.Lastly, where's the emotional depth?All this book is is one superficial view of human emotion; its just a poor atempt at a futuristic action story. If you like overrated,propaganda backed,literary drivel then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Hyped","review":"I heard a lot of great things about this novel and was somewhat disappointed when I read it.The main character is one dimensional stereotype (stoic army hero, with a degree in physics, of course) and the author spends a little too much time trying to explain his theoretical world (the main thrust being that every time he travels in space to go to battle, he returns to the distant future).As in a lot of bad science fiction, there is a little too much emphasis on the sex life of the hero and not enough on story and character. I was still hoping that there might be some final redeeming twist in the end-(like maybe the aliens he had been battling were really just distant future versions of earthlings) but alas there was no such reward in the end. Just a cheesy ending.I think the author had a lot of cool ideas but they just didn't gel around a good character/story. Unfortunately this is very common in Science Fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not for me","review":"I have nothing positive to say about this book. I really tried to complete it but I couldn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and dated","review":"I read a lot of sci fi and can't understand the enthusiasm for this novel. Even though the main character is a reluctant soldier the description of military hardware and tactics seems to take up more than half the book. And then their's the author's obsession with homosexuality. It's so obvious that he was reacting to the changes going on in the late seventies, and was less than sympathetic. So he made it a big theme, which was in the end mostly a distraction. The end finally addresses a question about the enemy introduced as soon as the fighting starts, but in a way that was almost predictable.There are a lot of great sci fi novels from decades past that don't feel dated. In my opinion, this is not one of them (though this is obviously a minority opinion)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good hard sci-fi","review":"A great thought experiment about the \\"relativity\\" of war. I hadn't ever thought about how the great distances involved in an interstellar war would affect those fighting in it.Obviously, Halderman's own experience in Vietnam seeps through in his judgment about the utility of war, but good stuff nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Space Opera","review":"No fantasy world here. Just a nice space opera. This could be another \\"young readers\\" take on \\"Starship Troopers\\" or even \\"Stargate SG-1\\". It's a great little escape that doesn't require a great deal of thought or analysis. Just choose a rainy Sunday afternoon and let the time pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"More jew, commie, spaceship prison porn","review":"Jew authors claiming this book is chicken salad when it's really chicken s***. I couldn't finish it thru the race-mixing, slave/master, military cult-worship tripe. No plot, just a good title doesn't make for good reading. Stick to Bradbury or Clarke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found it pretty boring","review":"I gave this book several chances, but found the writing spare to the point of drabness. There were no exiting ideas, characters, or settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless it's going to have a very surprising ending","review":"It's not a bad book but I am reading it since I started it. I don't want to hurt the authors feeling,sorry... I find it hard to keep tabs on the characters, the story itself or what you may call the \\"big picture\\".Spoiler alert:The time travel is a nice touch but it somehow goes wrong instead of making the story more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Joe Haldeman's _The Forever War_ has been imitated by lesser authors, but never surpassed. It is a classic novel of interstellar war and the experience of being a soldier ever more alienated from his society by relativistic time dilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sci-fi/adventure book","review":"I've read \\"The Forever War\\" three or four times already, and everytime is as good or better as the previous. This book is a unique blend of science-based sci-fi and good ol' adventure novels. The character of Mandella is superbly portrayed, and the narration of the situations/environments he finds himself on as a result of the war and near-light-speed-travelling is vivid, concise and realistic. As far as sci-fi reading goes, this book is as good as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it","review":"Although I am a sci-fi junkie, I did not care for this book. I gave it an honest try but did not finish it as it was too out there for my personal taste. I suggest sampling the book before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A love story","review":"This is a military science-fiction novel but also a damn good love story. It takes the point of view of one soldier, William Mandella. The character is smart, has a sense of humor, and is very likable. He mocks the military but like most of us can't escape his situation. War took over most aspects of the society he lives in. This book has also some deep philosophical ideas. One is that war is not natural. Soldiers need to be conditioned to kill. There are no \\"right\\" war. Who are the aliens? Who are the invadors? Is love possible in a society at war? The gruesomeness of the war is compensated by no-guilt sex. William partners with MaryGay casually and she becomes his only link to who he is. There does not seem to be an end to the war until humans are sufficiently evolved to communicate with the Taurans, the aliens here. The love story is that throughout it all, especially time travel, William and MaryGay never forgot each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute classic","review":"It's already been said, so I'll keep it short. This is a classic sci-fi war story with a totally different perspective than most war novels. It is an absolute must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"Good read, nice length; quite an interesting look at time travel which is always hard to get your head around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I enjoyed this book, it really reminded me of StarShip Troopers although I suspect the influence might be the other way around. Definitely worth a read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the ending the best.","review":"I would not consider this book as the best, only one of the excellent books. The story----the time period it crosses, the way soceity and people changed----is very intreseting. It is pretty graphical, I can vividly recount the scenes still now. You will like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Forever Book","review":"An unusual book in that it was copyrighted in the 70's, and isn't outdated in the least. A forever book about \\"The Forever War\\". Mr. Haldeman has written a classic that's withstood the test of time, and in a fashion that keeps the readers interest from beginning to end. A great story of unending love during wartime, with action, ingenuity, promise, and an excellent ending too. A star omitted because of minor editing flaws. This book is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science Fiction at it's best","review":"I first learned about this book when I read that Ridley Scott was going to Adapt Forever War to film. I am a big fan of his films so I had to find this book. This book was simply science fiction in it's purest form. Halderman writes at a great pace and about half way through I just couldn't put it down. It's one of those books that will keep you up late into the early morning because you can't stop reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"CERTAINLY NOT THE BEST, BUT NEVER-THE-LESS A FUN READ","review":"I must admit to having read better SiFi, on the other hand, I have certainly read worse. The overall premise of this work is good and certainly has a lot of potential. Wars, futile wars, lasting for centuries, are not all that far fetched. The sillyness of the war here is not all that much different than some of our past wars. This work gives you something to think about. I did enjoy many of the characters in this work, although their developement could have been better at times. This is one of those works that I am glad I read, but I doubt if I will give it a second read. Recommend this one with reservations, it may not be everyones cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped","review":"With so many stars and good reviews, I expected a really good story, but I was disappointed. I thought if I kept reading it might get exciting at some point, but it didn't. It also was too out of date for my taste. I guess if you bought the book and read it in the 70's you'd think differently, but I just couldn't get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun thought provoking read","review":"Wow--was my reaction when I finished. This is a very imaginative story, but lacks in the emotional department. My brain feels satisfied, but not my emotions. Entertaining though. I highly recommend this to anyone that slightly enjoys science fiction. I doubt you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"I read this book based off recommendations from a online book club. It's a good story albeit short and simply worded. The idea is a great one. For $5 I was happy I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, if simple","review":"This is one of those classic sci-fi books that uses tech as a prop for a story rather than as the plot. All in all a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Science Fiction","review":"One of the best I've read. The combination of sci-fi and military is great. I also recommend Robert Doherty's AREA 51 books. I saw where someone recommended Steiger's Alien Rapture, but one wonders where Steiger got his idea from-- seems like AREA 51 blazed the path first. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little-known classic","review":"Many years ago I had the fortune to stumble into this story in an old issue of Analog. It is one of the best sf books ever written, and easily is within the class of Heinlein's best. Humanism and humanity, and a biting anti-war message make this book stand above almost all other sf writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest","review":"I stumbled across this book quite by accident, and must say that never have I been so pleasantly suprised. The novel provides brilliant speculation upon brilliant speculation combined with a timeless message and eloquent story-telling. I just read it for the third time, and it continues to entertain and enlighten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning. What 'science' fiction was meant to be.","review":"It was years ago when I first read the Forever War. At the time I was young and was simply attracted to the book as a fun piece of science fiction.Twenty-years and three wars later I read it again and I was stunned by how different it felt. It was like I was reading a different novel. What on the surface is just a good piece of sci-fi about how war might be in the future is in fact a book about every war there has ever been. At least that is my theory. It certainly feels like every war I have been in.On another level it is a novel about anyone who goes home after many years, only to find it vanished the day you left. There is a reason this classic is still around nearly 30 years later. This is one of the books they will be reading centuries from now when they talk about a new type of fiction from the 20th century called \\"Science Fiction.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Equally understanding of human nature and military science","review":"Wow, where do start with this one. It starts off interestingly enough - the cream of the crop - the best and brightest - recruited to be an elite military unit to go off into space and ... become cannon fodder. Its as if a Marines recruiting poster took itself seriously. In a world of tactical nukes and lasers, platoons keep a tactical spacing between each other of ... 20 meters... I apologize for the sarcasm but its hard to avoid. There's nothing in this book approacing believability when it comes to humans interacting or anything to do with the military. Even the science disappointing. There's absolutely no depth, as if the author is an avid viewer of the science channel, and thought it would be fun to write something about the last episode he watched.There are so many interesting concepts in this book, any of which in the hands of a skilled author would have made an excellent read. Too bad... Really too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I usually don't leave negative reviews, but this book was so disappointing. There's no plot , no story,no emotion, main character war bland. Can't believe the author won the hugo and nebula for his other works. I'm told its autobiographical, the main character relives the author's experience thru the Vietnam war. I guess thats why it feels more like a documentary then a story. Ender's Game, Old mans war, starship troopers are so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"There are very few books that I can say were not really worth my time. Sadly, this is one. The plotting is terrible, the characters are wooden, and the anti-war message quickly starts to seem relentless and wearying. The future society it proposes is so absurd that I am amazed that anyone ever thought that the book contained greatness. If I had to guess, I would say that the approval people show towards the book is really just an outgrowth of the era which produced it: the Vietnam war. It said what people at that time wanted said, and thrilled them because of that. Now it just reads like a relic of an era whose premises and hopes have clearly failed. It amazes me that people like John Scalzi, who can write a wonderfully enjoyable book, liked it. His Old Man's War is in some ways very similar. There is only one difference: it is so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"Honestly, I have to buck the trend here against all the critics and people who loved it. Compared with a work like Ender's Game or even less, I beliewve this book is a one. Simply monotenous."},{"rating":"1","title":"70's sex and drugs and more sex.","review":"It was unconceivable to have a few military woman share their beds with 18 soldiers in an orgy room. The book talks about different sexual positions and how the woman were worn out by being used and used again.Finally the soldiers get to an alien planet and it was about this time , that I think the author started smoking something again , because the military action was very dull and hardly made any sense. I finally gave up on the book after reading almost half it. What a waste of time. I also find it hard to believe there are more positive reviews about this book and hardly any negative ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated","review":"Boy...I believed all the stellar reviews of this book so I decided to purchase it seeing as lost material was added back in on top of it. I was glad it was under 300 pages because it had to be the most boring book I have read in a long time. I could have cared less for any of these characters. Plus the preoccupation with sex in this book was ridiculous. This book doesnt hold a candle to Heinleins Starship Troopers.
