Ever hear of Stetsasonic or De La Soul?? If not do your homework and then holla at us! Saying youve never heard of Prince Paul is like saying youve never heard of Michael Jordan or Barry Bonds.

Paul merely glazes over the issues, well known and easily identifiable to an intelligent audience. It seems that Paul, although making fun of the industry, has succumbed to the industry's will and is making a boring, typical mainstream hip-hop album with a touch of cynicism. In effect Paul has acknowledged the industries power in mass-producing hip-hop for the intent of sales, not musical development. Paul doesn't go anywhere past dissing the musical industry. He himself is perpetuating the terrible trends of the music industry. So Paul sells out, he sells out to loyal fans who must be dissapointed with this work and to the gullible mainstream audience.Despite this he makes an enjoyable typical celebrity filled hip-hop album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a drop-off...","review":"To be honest, I bought this cd based on the recommendation of the reviews on this site.

You would think after 4 years that someone who is as full of themselves as Prince Paul (up their with Nas) would put out a decent cd and this one falls short. The only thing creative on this cd is after 2 minutes or so on the last track, Prince Paul does an encore of 2 takes, one which is good, but should there even of been an encore???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Christmas CD!","review":"I purchased this CD before Christmas and have played in many times.

Because it is a photocopy some of the illustrations/diagrams are of a very poor quality. In addition, when three pages are crammed onto one page the font size, as one would expect, becomes very small. What is really disappointing is that there is a wealth of information here but poorly presented at best. I feel \\"ripped off\\" for having paid so much for a collection of loose pages.

My work around is to make sure the Nuvi is fully charged when I need it and use the side USB connector when the battery gets low. The side USB connector works if you're navigating to a destination, but otherwise, the Nuvi thinks you're trying to connect to a computer. Also, this vent mount easily moves from center to left or right when you turn the car, it's too loose and there's no way to tighten to minimize this swivel action.

This was in my mind as my brother and his wife had their second child a few weeks ago. In this book, the family dog has to deal with feelings of jealously at the arrival of a new baby in the house.

What a doggy movie! It makes even the lamest Disney movie watchable. Basically, it is \\"Hey, look at that animal!\\" and then a cut to some stock footage, except in one case where a giant rubber spider creature creeped along like a relative of \\"The Tingler\\". Star Stewart Granger also seemed to understand every African language dialect except when it was really important. And, there was also an emphasis on how much ammunition was left, so the final bullets were used on certain natives to great effect. Once they got to the mine itself, it was still snoresville and basically a letdown.

It was difficult to maintain the momentum when making a 30\\" cut, and sometimes I'd end up with an edge that wasn't as straight as I hoped.The OLFA Rotary Cutter is PERFECT for the job. Being able to push it forward, instead of pulling back as you do with a knife, allows me to be more accurate with my cuts and is much faster!

I ordered this and a cutting mat and I could not be happier. Cuts down on some of the tedious part of the sewing projects I do. Apparently rotary cutters are also very helpful for cutting shapes out of cardboard and paper, but I use mine specifically for fabric so the blade doesn't dull as quickly. I do agree that for cutting small or very detailed shapes that a smaller diameter might work better, but I find this to be a nice all-purpose size for most projects. I was also happy to see that these cost considerably less here than in a retail sewing/fabric/craft store! If you have not tried one of these, I highly encourage it.

That fat guy does move rather fast for his size.Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Jamie Kendall,","review":"The description hit it right on the head if you ask me.

You can't beat the price for the quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobler","review":"I was excited, at first, to get this griddle. I read many great reviews. However, it is very sensitive to heat. After only three (3) uses, the griddle is warped and no longer sits flat on my solid surface electric cook top. Now it is pretty much useless.I did not overheat the griddle. It was used on heat settings medium and lower.If you choose to get this griddle, use only LOW heat settings. Don't use anything above medium-low."},{"rating":"1","title":"its a wobbler","review":"I used this pan over an electric range and it became significantly warped after a few uses. Otherwise it has been quite sturdy and does not have problems with the non-stick surface after about a year of use now but all the wobbling and \\"unlevel\\" surface does not make it desirable for a good cooking experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle too heavy","review":"I had the same problem so of the other reviewers have mentioned. The handle is too heavy so it does not sit flat. Also, the bottom is not perfectly flat so it wobbles when cooking on a flat top range. The ease of clean-up and \\"nonstickyness\\" are great though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I have bought Calphalon griddles before and they are excellent. They are made really good and clean up is a breeze. My husband uses them alot also and prefers me to buy this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more","review":"I own a bunch of calphalon cookware with no complaints except for this one. Its poorly designed because the handle is so heavy, the pan tips over to the side and will not sit flat. Because this happens food is unevenly cooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good griddle","review":"The griddle is satisfactory - the pancakes don't stick and it cleans up well, but I have had to really play with the heat to get the right temperature for the perfect pancake. I went through a few dark, discolored ones before I finally hit on the right temp on my range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prone to warping because of its lack of thickness, but a great value!","review":"This pan is really good for making pancakes, bacon, hamburgers, etc., but it is a bit thin and has warped slightly. Make sure you don't leave it on the burner for any length of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first experience with Calphalon - I'm Hooked!","review":"We have had many nonstick griddles (buy 1 or 2 every year), but none have compared to this one by Calphalon. I had never purchased any Calphalon pieces before because I felt we were too hard on our cookware to justify spending the extra money. It remains to be seen if this holds up better than the other griddles we've had in the past, but right off the bat I can tell you it is superior in most ways. Excellent weight and balance, with a superior nonstick finish. And it cooks evenly. And best of all, here on Amazon, it cost no more than the other brands we had bought at the \\"Super\\" Retailer. I just wish I could find a 12\\" skillet in the same price range now....:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great non stick griddle","review":"This is a great griddle. Pancakes, perfect.French Toast, perfect. Heats and cooks evenly..super easy clean-up..lightweight..I like the square shape....and having a handle a real plus...I own alot of regular Calphalon but this is the first non stick pan...works well....and the price was right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic work","review":"Thia dictionary has many more entries than the dictionary that most Latin students and teachers probably have on their shelves, such as Cassell's. However, it is intended as an aid in reading classical Latin works, and therefore does not have an English-Latin section or many words created in the medieval era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute and appropriate for age","review":"This is a very cute book and is age appropriate for my daughter who is turning 3 next month. She loves to pick out who she looks like, which is typically cookie monster or the honkers.

However, even though the book is trying to teach children how to love all people regardless of their differences, I think it is important for parents to teach their children that everyone is unique in their own way, and how to embrace the differences between one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book","review":"It didn't really hold my son's attention. I'm not really sure why. Maybe because a lot of the characters weren't recognizable as Sesame Street characters. Otherwise it does a good job of showing the similarities in all humans (we all have noses that do the same thing, etc.) I only gave it four stars because my son wasn't interested after 2 or 3 reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"christmas gift","review":"This book is a gift for a child in the chgo sun-times letters to santa program. so i hope he liked it.I liked itElaine"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for young children","review":"I really like this book for my preschoolers.

But they both have a cute voice!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You could never sleep at night if you knew what I've been through.\\"","review":"Above are some of the best lyrics Jonas has conjured. This album blew me away at the time I first heard it in '99 as great example of the Cure gone metal... it has since been eclipsed by the albums after it but is as essential as anything Katatonia has done from Brave Murder Day onwards. Really more of 4.5/5 but then again most their albums are. Also has Dan Swano on drums (Nightingale, Edge of Sanity, producer of Opeth's Morningrise and Orchid)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Katatonia cd, and now a fan for life!!!!","review":"I picked this album up about a year ago and loved it immediately. It is well done and has a great atmospheric sound throughout the entire cd. It has a gloomy, moody sound to it, which is great for an album because that is what any good album should do, create a mood while listening to it. I have since bought viva emptiness, and last fair deal gone down. I consider all the albums excellent and perfectly done. I still love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright","review":"Let's revamp this review. This album sounds like Weezer with a little bit of a temper and a slightly hard edge. It really does. I don't see how this music is considered heavy or hard music really. The singer is somewhat whiny and irritating while the music is as equally interesting. The song diversity is rather absent through the whole album and everything has a monotone feel to it. I wouldn't recommend this album for this band to anyone unless if they were looking for something slightly harder to listen to, and they were fans of emo looking for some darker emo. There is better music out there, YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it","review":"There is a lot in this book that's illogical. The characters' actions, the dialogue. Most of the time I don't know what's going on in the dialogue. I basically just had to skim over sections I just couldn't understand. Maybe North's style is just too different from my concept of good writing. So much of it didn't prgress the story line. I had to give up midway; it just didn't hook me. If I'd bought this book instead of getting it at the library, I would have been very angry."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent book!","review":"The book is a brilliant example of what you might call\\"kitchen story\\" -- it allows you to look at things frominside. You feel like you've become a lawyer, all of asudden, and have to decide other people's fates...Caroline Masters, whom we remember from \\"Degreeof Guilt\\" and who reappears here almost on the otherside of the barricade, is really great and makes me wishI had known her in real life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfactory","review":"I found this book to be one of the worst books written by Mr. Patterson. It was so predictable and the characters and their conversations were so unbelieveable I could not finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugg, not a good book--boring !","review":"This was a boring and difficult book to read. It just goes on and on and on. The flashbacks and endless descriptions and conversations make this very dull. I ended up skipping about a third of the middle of the book , and finally went to the last pages of the book and still knew everything that happened in the skipped hundred or so pages. Normally I really enjoy the authors writing; but this was not one of those books. Dont bother to read unless you enjoy excessive dialog and description. The story was not believable either. A young woman lawyer would not allow a husband to manipulate her like this. I certainly would not not recommend reading this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a great book, and a sequel to \\"Degree Of Guilt\\" in the Chris Paget series. Don't read \\"Eyes Of A Child\\" without reading \\"Degree Of Guilt\\" first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Court Room Drama","review":"This book is overly long -- I think the author spends too much time injecting romantic interludes and mushy dialog into it -- but by the end, I think the average reader will feel his time was well-spent perusing this intense courtroom drama. The best part is Patterson's facility for showing us how criminal trial lawyers think and perform. Somebody killed the evil husband of the hero's girlfriend and although you might have your suspicions about the killer's identity, Patterson is very good at keeping you guessing. I liked the courtroom dramatics -- of which there were plenty. If you're looking for a spellbinding crime book, this is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too drawn out","review":"There's a great story in this book, hidden under countless flashbacks, repeating conversations, and multiple meandering chapters that do little to add to the story itself. Sleazy politicians and lawyers being drawn into a custody fight was too much. This book would have been much better without all of the padding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heading south","review":"I was surprised about the stars given by other readers as I found the book rather annoying. The story itself was quite good but i found the characters really annoying. Sad to say it wasn't Richie that I found annoying, but the main characters of Christopher and Terri. I think the author tries to hard to make everything black and white. Richie is really evil and Terri and Christopher are like Joseph and Mary. It just becomes too much after a while. I think a bit of ambiguity in the characters would have made the book far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal and disappointing","review":"I'm a fan of his books, but I found this one very painful. I couldn't finish it. At a certain point, I skipped to the end to confirm that who I thought actually did it, actually did do it! I had the person pegged very early on. What's so painful about this particular book is the child abuse angle. I work with child sexual abuse victims and this is a very disturbing book to read through. I just couldn't stand it anymore, but I wanted to see how it would end. I liked the main characters (Paget and Terri) much more in the earlier works. I'd skip this one, if you're reading his books in sequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"brutal, nasty discription of crime","review":"i was taken back at the too-unbelievable writing, topped with a brutal and nasty result. it may happen, i guess but i wasn't ready for \\"america's worst\\" most disgusting crime i have ever heard(read) of. but it drew a realistic, very intriguing picture of court, defense, and so on. but the subject was too harsh for me to deal with(i'm 16) otherwise, richard is a great writer, in my opinion. but i find it also interesting, that he gave the most hateful person his own name-richard."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book that is hard to put down.","review":"Richard Patterson describes the trial in this story in complete detail, but keeps it interesting. His knowledge of this topic is evident in this story. He did very good research in writing this story. The plot is very interesting and grabs your attention in the first chapter. He continues to hold your attention until the very last sentence. It was interesting and well-written, and now I am searching for more books by Richard North Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible album","review":"Usually I skip over album reviews if they are too extreme (5 or 1 star). But it's quite called for here. CAN A MAN RAP WITH ANY LESS CHARISMA??!!Cam's come quite a long ways, as evidenced by this album. Average production. Uninspired, generic rhyming schemes and also-ran content. The production and engineering are fuzzy and lo-fi - and it's not on purpose.An amateur job all around. It would be nice if this was cut to 4 songs and labeled a demo tape. There's definitely growing pains all throughout. Skip to his later selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Nice Blazzin Hip Hop Classic","review":"Cam'runs this album. It's nice. You can feel it out on all levels: R&B, dance, street,underground. A must for any hip hop head or anyone for that matter. I originally purchased the album for 'Horse & Carriage' , but soon discovered that was just the tip of the iceberg. The most overlooked album of 1998. Can't wait for the next album ... provided it doesn't turn out to be a softmore jinx."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda been better!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Alright, everyone who likes Cam'ron and Ma$e only because \\"their fine\\" and \\"their hot,\\" their dumb. This CD does not represent Cam in all of his \\"Glory.\\" There are some songs worth listening to, such as \\"357\\",\\"Glory\\", \\"Horse and Carriage\\" and \\"Shanghai.\\" But other than those few songs, it's obvious that this CD was made to appeal to a pop audience. It's okay to get your money, but I know that Cam will come back twice as nice on some stuff that truly represents him."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Confessions of Fire' is not so hot afterall.........","review":"This is the album, unfortunately, that I try so very hard to forget came from Cam'ron - but, what's done is done. After hearing the first single off the record, \\"Horse and Carriage,\\" I wasn't too motivated to buy a copy, thinking that songs like that were what to expect from the CD. Despite my friends many arguments to look past the single because the album was \\"blazin',\\" I decided to borrow the CD and peep it. Not only was the record a waste of time, but I was enthused by the fact that Cam'ron was supposed to be an underground emcee, yet, the whole album was commercially drenched. The only joint I found worth listening to off the album was \\"Wrong Ones,\\" but other than that 'Confessions of Fire' is the epitome of the new style of music nodding heads -- hip-pop, and oh boy, is it wack."},{"rating":"1","title":"coulda dun betta","review":"cam is way betta den dat. in horse and carriage, he used swears and tried to sound cool. the radio version sounded better. the only good song is glory, and 357 is aight. but other than that, it sucked"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the fire fool you!!!!","review":"This CD is As mediocre as mediorce can get. Camron has no skills and the only good songs are Horse and carriage and N.B.C. Trust me when I say it is a waste of money. The album could have been done better. I give him credit for showing his mom how to rap though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm very disappointed!!!!","review":"After reading all of the reviews, I couldn't wait to get this CD. I am most disappointed and if I could get a refund, I would. Cam is very vulgar, he is quite misleading with \\"Horse and Carriage\\". I knew that there would be some explicit lyrics, but he is a joke and Mase is along for the ride. This artist won't get another dime from me and Mase should take heed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blazin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1","review":"The CD is hot...

The Vienna Philharmonic (as always) is well balanced, very transparent, and well rehearsed; they play incisively and with total conviction. The playing is especially inspired in the Scottish Symphony, where the dialogue between wind and strings is delightful. However, the best parts of this set are the \\"filler\\" overtures. Both Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage and Fingal's Cave are played to the hilt. Dohnanyi conducts the symphonies tightly, and that taught quality makes these recordings very exciting. My only complaint would be that, at times, the orchestra sounds a bit small. Still, overall, a wonderful compilation by London Decca."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time and thought turned back on itself again and again.","review":"This is a delightful book, easy reading but full of content for all level readers. The characters are likable and there are several interesting concepts that are woven into the story line. The reader needs to keep his thinking cap on to catch the intricities of the storyline. I have reread this book several times and it continues to be a favorite. I will not discuss the storyline in this review as I do not want to pre-color the first time readers perception of the book. I prefer to let the author present his own story. I will tell the reader that this is the story of an unsophisticated young man who in the process of growing up leaves the safe enviroment of his backwater planet and is flung into the hustle and bustle of a vast galactic empire where the meaning of the term key players takes on a whole different meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for begginers!","review":"If you've never tried yoga before and feel intimidated by the more advanced moves of other types of yoga this is a great book for you.

Flames of Grace is such a tale. I found it powerful and symbolic, a joyous metaphor for every struggle we as human beings encounter in our attempt to find and follow our true path, to honor our spirit, and to come closer to God. Walker's journey is daunting, described in vivid, flowing prose, but her message is always gentle and loving - be strong, be true, and you will persevere.

I recently purchased the Singer Futura 250 (awesome) and bought this as a companion book after reading great reviews. It wasn't what I expected.

I was actually able to figure out my embroidery machine on my own with the product manual and can search the internet (for free) for any future questions I have. While some people might like the book, it wasn't for me and was a waste of my money. I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good info for beginners","review":"This book is a wonderful introduction to machine embroidery. The information was practical and comprehensive.

I've tried to read it 2-3 times and it's like looking at the 1970's sewing books...very dated, showing floppy disks, etc.I truly expected way more and was very disappointed. Yes, I sew, but I'm new to embroidery and this book didn't help me at all. The author's other book about Editing, Resizing, Customizing was way better and answered more of my questions. With this, I was expecting a current A to Z primer to guide me and got a 1970's style book with little helpful information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to display childrens artwork on fridge or at work","review":"The size is great to display my son's fingerpainting from school.

I was expecting a clear ACRYLIC frame.... something with some body to it that I can either choose to stick to a fridge or metal surface, or stand against something.

But it bears repeating that this digital transfer is *atrocious*. The film is presented in \\"full-screen\\" format, lopping off the edges of Haskell Wexler's beautiful frames. Celluloid scratches and \\"reel change\\" hole-punches are visible throughout. And the sound, if you can believe it, is worse -- it's in hissy, almost inaudible MONO, for God's sake!Zero commentaries. Almost no bonus extras, unless you count a few panels of \\"production notes.\\"Not worth a purchase. Wait for the morons at Artisan to get their collective act together and give this fine film the gold-star release it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the item advertised","review":"OK, this is listed as the Widescreen version 1.85:1. Immediately after beginning to watch the movie, it was apparent that this is a bad transfer of the widescreen tape version with the sides cut off. I ordered it for the very reason that it specifically set itself apart from the the version that others were complaining about. Well, I am keeping it because it is a great movie and I doubt I am going to do any better anywhere else, but don't advertise it as widescreen when it IS NOT!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Film Ruined By This DVD","review":"This is a wonderful film. The story is moving, the performances stellar. I liked learning about this part of American history. But this was a terrible DVD. We had to have the sound on our TV 3/4 of the way up to understand words. Tokoyo 111 was right about the sound being almost MONO. I kept going back to hear things I missed. And as other reviewers have mentioned, the DVD only allows a \\"full screen\\" option, so you miss most of the great frames of this film.I appreciated the opportunity to see this film, but have no idea why Artisan would present it so poorly. My guess is that they don't expect many people to be interested in the film and did as little as possible to clean it up. A very low budget production. Really does a good film injustice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant classic movie by Jonathan Sayles - buy one for your local library","review":"I'm sure there are ample reviews praising this amazing film about the labor wars in the Appalachian mine fields of the early 1920's (staring James Earle Jones, David Strathrairn and a young Chris Cooper). Also see the 1976 (77?) academy award winning documentary \\"Harlan County, USA\\", about a mine strike in the same area in the 1970s - the Criteria Collection reissue of that has a lot of really wonderful extra material as well. I bought two copies of Matewan and donated one to my local public library - the librarian tells me that the distributors that libraries rely on are no longer carrying Matewan. So, for about $10, I got a factory-sealed copy of the DVD to donate and make available to a new generation. With Netflix cutting back their selection, public libraries are becoming the best place to get DVDs - and its a good idea for progressives to donate great films when not otherwise available to the libraries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historically Accurate Movie","review":"I grew up in the Western Pennsylvania coal fields hearing similar stories and the area portrayed in this movie is very much like that area. The movie is intense and viewed from the vantage point of the 21st century, we tend to forget how badly laborers as a whole were treated in the early half of the 20th century. Memorable performances abound and the movie will leave an indelible imprint in your memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matewan Massacre is in here somewhere . . .","review":"This is a great movie. That being said, the events it is alleged to portray are only a small part of THIS film. There's a story being told by Mr. Sayles about the conditions in which the miners and their families lived, what their prospects for improvement were, the efforts to unionize the coal fields, and the efforts to thwart the unionization of the same, but beware that you understand that Mr. Sayles was telling a story that only refers to what happened in Matewan and Bloody Mingo in 1920-1921. This is not a documentary nor does Mr. Sayles intend for it to be. His vision of the story is certainly true, but not historically accurate. It is one of those films that makes you think about the message, but be sure you understand that Sayles has a message and you may or may not agree with it. As a piece of drama, it is first-rate. As an account of a series of historical events, it takes great liberty with the details to make a point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matewan","review":"The movie was very good,and educational,however the sound waspoor.I had to turn the surround sound all the way up and stillcould not hear some parts of it.Ihad seen this film on TV beforeand the sound was fine on TV but not on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad copy","review":"I loved the movie and wanted to buy it...I received a such very bad copy., quality was so bad that it was distracting trying to watch"},{"rating":"1","title":"it bears repeating, buyer beware","review":"You will likely be sorely disappointed if you buy this movie in its current version.

A local tennis shop carries them for $35 a pair.

Deep pockets will hold two balls easily, that won't pop out during serves.While they do not have a liner for runners, you need to wear some type of underwear with these, otherwise other balls start flying. :( :(The inseam isn't too long which I appreciate. Some shorts hang below my knees and I'm 5'9\\" with a 33\\" waist. I think they run a little tight in the waist, slightly loose on the legs. Seems the waist could have been a little larger, but the legs fit nicely.I have both one pair of medium and three pair of large shorts.

It never gets the respect it deserves. The only other live album that comes even close is Live at Leeds or maybe No Sleep Till Hammersmith. Before morphing into a radio friendly pop band (The Locomotion), Funk were the heaviest thing going. Nobody could touch them...Zep, Purple, nope. What's really cool is Mel's bass is high in the mix ala Entwistle and it really drives the band. And Mark has a guitar sound like no other mainly due to the Messenger axe going into the West amps.

This CD it's a must...about the remastering work, the drums is better defined than the vinyl, so too the guitar work...the bass, instead, is less powered (and Schacher used to set West Amps at \\"10\\").

The violinist however, simply wasn't up to the task. There are very few instruments that shiver the spine when off-key like a violin. This collection has those moments in virtually every movement.

Well she is in my book. I loved Topaz. This novel was very rich in Black Seminole and African American history,\\"American History.\\" The characters in this one are truly unforgettable. Dixon Wildhorse was a man after my own heart. I reall don't blame Kate Love for falling in love with Dix even though the circumstances would suggest her dislike for him. I loved the way their love developed for each other over time. Even more Jenkins once again created characters that will be remembered for a long time to come. It is one thing to have a great romance in a book, but when you add great history, great characters, and a great connection of all those things, the novel is truly in a class all by itself. That ladies and gentlemen, can also be said about the author of that great novel. Love you work, you, Beverly Jenkins, are truly in a class by yourself!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Pleased","review":"Topaz is a must read.

So a year or so ago, I bought my second LP copy, used, cheap. This time it included \\"Spirits in The Night\\", another decent Springsteen cover, after \\"Blinded By the Light\\". The problem was the album sequence (this on the LP, not the CD) They put \\"Spirits\\" in the MIDDLE of the best transition between tracks on the album, and one of my favorite transitions on ANY album- between \\"Road To Babylon\\" and \\"This Side of Paradise\\" - ruining that wonderful transition.Who's bright idea was THAT LP song placement? SO, last weekend I bought another LP copy of the original configuration, without \\"Spirits in the Night\\"...I note that on the CD release, they wised up and moved \\"Spirits in the Night\\" almost to the end (only followed by the singles version of \\"Blinded By the Light\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Re-Mastered CD","review":"I Highly Recommend this re-master of this album.

It was worth every penny. This is not Jay-Z's best album, probably top three (Reasonable Doubt is number one, then i cant decide wether the black album is better than Vol. 1). This album is not comparable to Reasonable Doubt, that was from a different jay-z. He put that classic out in 96, a long time and a lot of money ago. Jay-z has started to annoy me since vol 2 or 3, but he redeemed himself with this album. Its a great finish from one of the greatest MCs of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best to Pick Up a Mic","review":"The Black Album, is a good CD, not an instant classic. But, I'm a die hard Jay-Z fan, This album isn't Reasonable Doubt or The Classic, \\"Blueprint\\". But the first track Dec. 4, is a look into Jay's life as a child, it kind of lets you in his mind more, which is hard to do. What More Can I Say, is the highlight of the CD, this is Jay at his best, spitting at hatas and saying i'm done. The CD is ok through the middle tracks, but he definately picks it up on Lucifer, Allure, and My 1st Song. However the interlude could be a classic single itself. The most brilliant part of this record is the sample of \\" Are you not Entertained\\" The Gladiator piece is classic, I applaud Jay for that. Overall, he leaves at the top of his game. \\" God forgive for my brash delivery, I remember vividly what the streets did to me\\" Hov!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hot","review":"this album is one of his best. probly this and reasonable doubt. every song is hot cept' for maybe 2 or 3. my favorite songs were threat and number 13 produced by kanye west. this is worth your money. its a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"NERD's 2nd album \\"Fly or die\\"","review":"N*E*R*D consisting of Chad,Pharrell,and Shay will be dropping their 2nd album \\"Fly or Die\\" on March 23rd 2004.Go to www.n-e-r-d.com to listen to their future hit \\"She wants to move\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Lazy album by Jay-Z","review":"I was feeling some songs, but none of them varied from his patented formula- a hot beat to make up for the less than prolific lyrics and presentation.

I fully hold this album to be truly great and it is well positioned to become a classic, however, to those who do not fully appreciate it, 'obtaining' a copy of the infamous 'The Grey Album' would be in your best interests. It is not actually illegal to mix, and/or own, other persons music, just to sell it on without control of the copyright, which DJ Danger Mouse did not have but then he didn't sell this music either. The Grey Album is revolutionary and none of Jay Z's message is lost in its mixture with Beatles beats.

He'g got incredible beats on this album from producers such as DJ Quick, Kanye West, Rick Rubin & Eminem. \\"Dirt Off Your Shoulder, Encore & Lucifer\\" are clubs songs that will get you up off your seats. Jay Z shows his lyrical skills on tracks such as \\"99 Problems, Moment Of Clarity, Justify My Thug & December 4th\\". Trust me on this one, this album is a must by if your a Jay Z fan or even just a hip jop fan. When you pop the album in a your cd player you won't want to take it off for a long while. Even his intro is better then some full length tracks out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaving the Game on Top","review":"Jay-Z's rap career has spanned over ten years. He is the poster boy for commercial hip hop and has certainly reaped its financial benefits. \`The Black Album', his supposed final CD, is solid, but in no way his best. With a small army of producers, the album clashes with so many different production styles. (\`The Black Album' has received a rainbow of remixes, and I've heard many. However, I would recommend \`Kno vs. Hov: The White Album' produced by Kno of CunninLynguists over DJ Danger Mouse's \`The Grey Album'. It gives one feel to the CD and the production overall might outshine the likes of Kanye West, Just Blaze, Eminem, and The Neptunes.) Almost any song could pass as a single. Jay-Z decides to be a little more personal on this CD, but still doesn't seem to say much. Despite nearly ten years of Jay-Z, I still don't feel as if I truly know him. Still, you can't deny that Jay-Z went out on top and should stay in retirement.(3.5/5 mics)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Exit to a Phenominal Career","review":"I have never been a Jay Z fan, but this album was worth every cent. Jay Z exits the rap game on top in a classy way. The entire album was a remarkable production, with Just Blaze, Kanye, and the Neptunes all making production appearances. \\"December 4th\\" is a great start to the record, and by far the best song on the album. Jay Z expresses his most personal feelings of his childhood experience, and continues the trend through most of the record. The album is worth the twelve dollars or whatever, especially if you've enjoyed his previous work. The creative beats and meaningful lyrics show a deeper side of rap which is desperately lacking right now. Buy this album ASAP if you can appreciate rap as more than a platform to shout and scream of Crunk, Cars, Rims, and Hoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hova The TRUTH Not Tv Brainwashed Reviews","review":"1.

How about we stop copying that gay rock, who likes that anyway?Rap consists of degrading women to primitive levels, and violence.

Once again i believe Jay-Z has stuck back once again after years of doing commerical hiphop songs. The album is filled with Jay-Z's earliest and latest experiences and hardships on the road.

The Black Album was pretty good, I must say.Change Clothes -- this was probably the song that I loved the most. The tune is catchy. Jay-Z and Pharell work well together. It took awhile for me to understand exactly why Pharell was singing, \\"Change clothes, pass and go\\" but I didn't care that much anyway because the song was so tight.Dirt of Your Shoulder -- This song's ok, but after awhile it got so aggravating. I like the whole message, get the dirt off your shoulders, but that little tune gets annoying after awhile. The music video was really well done though.Encore -- Awesome song. Nuff said. :)Those are the only 3 I felt the need to review, since I think they're the best off the album. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone. Bye Jay-Z we'll miss you.

I don't want to make this album sound like a disappointment, because it wasn't. Many of the tracks were very good, the beats were tight, and Jay's lyrics were pretty nice as well. I don't know if this is truly Jay's final album, but if it is then I would say that he went out with a good album, but like I said before, its a good album, just not a great one.My 3 Favorite Tracks:Moment Of ClarityPublic Service Announcement (Interlude)My 1st Song"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jay Z/The Black Album","review":"Hova's Back!!! Jay Z climbs to the top of his throne again with this one.Not as good as BLUEPRINT 1 but better than BLUEPRINT 2.Alot of different styles on this one.A few tracks are produced by artist's like Eminem and icon's like Rick Rubin.The hip-hop entrepenur goes out with a bang...and a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A farewell to greatness","review":"Altough this might not be the best effort Jay Z has put out it is certainly a great one. From the start of this cd to the finish it is great. The lyrics are sick and the beats are very good.

Overall Jay goes out on top of his game as we give a farewell to greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Final Album!!!","review":"The Black Album is one of the best cds of the year and one of the best jay z cds ive heard.

He released alot of albums, and all most all of them sold well.Reasonable Doubt was one of the best all time hip hop albums. All sold well. He was just awesome. And now with this, his last album. This CD has the big hit, \\"Change Clothes\\" with Pharrell. Jay-Z was an awesome guy, and I will miss his awesome work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jay-Z \\"The Black Album\\"","review":"This is one of my favorite Jay-Z albums next to \\"Reasonable Doubt\\".

As you know \\"Change Clothes\\" is off the hook. \\"Encore\\" is easily the best song on the album. This CD is a must have especially for Jay-Z fans. He did excellent colaborations with Kanye West and the Neptunes. No Hip-Hop fan should be without the the greastest rapper of all-time's last album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good album, but somewhat disappointing","review":"After heavy bootlegging and much anticipation Jay-Z's the Black Album has been released. To casual rap fans, this album is worth listening to. However, to extreme Jay-Z enthusiasts this album will be a gigantic letdown. To be his last album Jay somewhat disappointed. His lyrics and songs are often repetitive and lyrical quality is nothing when compared to Nas, Eminem, Pac, or BIG. Bluntly this cd is not a classic. Reasonable Doubt, Blueprint, and Vol. 1 are much better. I hate to say it but Jay-Z did not go out on top and to any hardcore rap fan he needs to put out another album to redeem himself after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best&using the oldest Cliche in Music:Retiring","review":"I've never been a Fan of Lay Z as I call Him because everything is pretty much the same but like everyone doing there thing I respect the Hustle.Production wise is Hit&Miss.His Lyrics are typical for the most part&just don't do alot for me but the cat found a Formula for Success&ran with it.I doubt this will Be His Last set but hey pull the oldest cliche in Pop Music&the Hype starts pouring in.there will be other Projects&of course Hits Packages&things."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Advice You To Read This!!!","review":"ok im gonna break it down for ya'll..i been a hip hop head since tha age of 8 and ive been exposed to all types of rap. and i can honestly say that this album goes beyond its expectations..hov jus gives us a piece of his mind and talent.. he proves to being one of tha best MC's in tha game maybe even earning the title \\"King Of New York\\" Its gonna take alot skill to beat this album. Jigga enters and leaves the game with perfection, i feel this album is a sequel of Resonable doubt.

I know people who don't even like Hip-Hop and seem to love alot of the songs on the album. I still think that if it were not for two or three songs at the end, then mostly everybody would agree that he really did save the best for last. This guy is just great at what he does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"The Black Album is an incredible piece of work from one of the best rappers out there. My favorite songs include \\"My First Song\\" and \\"Only a Customer\\". The whole album is great though. If you are a Jay-Z fan, you must own this album. I liked Jay-Z before this album, and now i can't get enough of him. The collabs on this album with Dj Quik and the Neptunes are very well done. He says this is his last album, but i doubt it. He definitely put out one of the best albums of his career with the Black Album.

Peace out."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks","review":"This album sucks, this was a very disappointing retirement album. I think Jay-Z just wanted to get it over with and he rushed it.

But anyway, my point is, before you unwrap the factory shrinkwrap, contemplate wheather it's worth is or not(which it's not), and when you're done conversing with yourself, go buy an album that you can listen to more than twice without getting sick....like ANY 'PHISH' ALBUM!!!!! ya know something that has a story, or at least SOME substance worth listening to, do yourself a favor and throw this in the garbage, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isnt Jay Z...It should be called \\"JAY-Z AND FRIENDS\\"","review":"Why does every hip-hop album every song has \\"featuring\\". Whats the matter, People cant sing a song by themselves anymore?? Every video on MTV is by some artist \\"FEATURING\\" some other artist. Rock groups dont do this. Its because Hip-Hop artist have no talent. This CD is the worst. Every song has different people singing. Why?? Is it because JAY-Z is a no talent bum?? I think thats the answer...He was on Saturday Night Live recently, and there are 5 guys with mics screaming all at once, and Jay-Z did the least talking!!! THIS IS TOTAL GARBAGE!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JAYZ SUCKS","review":"THIS CD COMPLETELY SUCKS..JAYZ IS A MISTAKE AND HE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEGAN RAPPIN IN THE FIRST PLACE...HE DOESNT KNOW HOW TO WRITE HIS OWN LYRICS SO HE WENT ON AND COPIED PAC..JAYZ JUST PLAIN OLD SUCKS DO NOT LISTEN TO HIM"},{"rating":"1","title":"J-Z is overrated and unremarkable","review":"Now that he's retiring, he's going to need more money at some point to continue his superstar lifestyle.

Jay-Z has got to be one of the most overrated artists of the decade, and the Black Album is continuing the trend. First of all, Jay-Z pulled out alot of big names for production on this album. The result: it sucks. I've never heard a weaker collection of beats than throughout this entire album and from Just Blaze and Kanye West just to name a few. As far as the lyrics go, they're not not too bad, but not really anything all that special either. He's still talking about the same thing: nothing and/or himself. And with the whack beats the lyrics are over, the results are painful to listen to at times. Fade to black is right. This is the end of a career that started off great and went down from there. Listen to some old Jay-Z and compare....Dangermouse did a great job with the beats on his remix album if you want to hear the Black Album lyrics with good production however."},{"rating":"2","title":"cant stop playing this cd","review":"good look for hova jay the best to ever pick up the mic this album is the bomb drop of \\"justify my thug\\" you got a classicthis album is the best this year no questions asked .with lines likes this ..Who you gon' find doper than him with no penjust draw off inspirationwhat more can i say ? pick this cd up ....WHAT ARE WE GOING DO WITHOUT HOVA ?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"The King of NY Keeps His Crown","review":"Love him or hate him, you have to admit that Jay-Z is the most consistent MC hip-hop has ever seen. The only thing that keeps every album from perfection is that sometimes the tracks just can't keep up with the man. The same goes for The Black Album. Jay-Z shows how much he's grown over the years and has lyrically advanced past \\"Money, Cash, Hoes\\" and has become more introspective. While it's still not Reasonable Doubt, the Black Album is one of the best albums hip-hop has seen in the past few years and is certainly the best of 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"Jay-z lacks anything, but the ability to take advantage of a good thing. After his phenomenal Reasonable Doubt he could relax and lower his standards to attract new fans. It is a sad choice he has made; and the array of albums consequent to Reasonable Doubt are reminders of the killed potential. The lyrics on these consequent commercial albums have gotten exceptionally weak and the beats have regrettably departed from the original jazzy melody; the Black Album gauges just this separation from the original. Every album after Reasonable Doubt has been a backstab to the original fans as his lyrics and content plummeted and plummeted and plummeted until he has made a weak retirement on this very weak album: a real teenage boy and girl pleaser.Lesson: do not be a backstabbing ... and best not make high standards for yourself if you cannot compete with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE'LL MISS YOU JAY-Z!!! ...","review":"This album should be in every single rap collection its so good (it could've been better) mt favs. song are \\"What More Can I Say?\\",\\"Change Clothes\\",\\"Dirt Off Your Shoulder,\\"Lucifier\\",\\"Moment Of Clarity\\" (Very hot) the rest of it is aight but its still a very solid album its way better than \\"Beg For Mercy\\" and \\"Blood In My Eye\\" cuz people are most likely to compare these albums 2gether but this ALBUM IS GOOD GO PICK IT UP ITS THE ROC!!! ...

As is the case with the blueprint, In My Lifetime 1 & 2, he only has a few bangers, which I consider tight beats AND tight lyrics. Dec. 4th, what more can I say, change clothes, dirt off my shoulders, and my 1st song are probably the best songs on the album. Encore, 99 problems (with that Rick Rubin old school spice), and lucifer are OK, but the other songs pretty much suck (beat-wise; lyrically, there aren't many who can touch J). I don't know why he continues to enlist Eminem to produce these same redundant, boring tracks, but Em sells so I guess I don't blame him. In all, I would say that this effort is a 3 and a half, but I'm underselling it; it's worth purchasing, regardless if this is his last album or not, which I doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Production is lacking, too","review":"In my previous review, I forgot to mention that the recording engineer must have been on something, cuz several of the tracks have very obvious clipping.Also, I thought there were a couple of okay tracks, musically. It's just that most of them really sucked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goin' out right!!!!Maybe?","review":"Well, if this is his last, it is what I wanted him to go out with. Something alittle more street, reminisant of Reasonable d. Nothing can be Reasonable Doubt, that was when he was young and hungry. Now he's a veteran and had his fill, but, that brings a new sense of wisdom of the game into it. I'd put this album at #3 spot. 1.reasonable d. 2. blueprint. If you are a hov fan cop it for sure. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of his Best","review":"This is Jay's best work ever. Reasonable Doubt was unbelievable, but this is better. Every beat (maybe, maybe with the exception of Change Your Clothes, which is a little too happy go lucky, but it is the New Neptunes, so I can let it slide) is unbelievable and well done by their respective producers. Jay spits even hotter stuff then on Reasonable Doubt and with much less help and much more maturity. Congratulations to Z on his best work to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"jay-z on top for the last time","review":"jay-z proves that after 7 years he is still on top of his game with songs like dec 4,what more can i say and 99 problems he leaves the rap game like a legend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My God...","review":"This album is literally perfect. While listening to it I actually got tears to my eyes thinking this was Jay's last album. His flow is perfect, the production is perfect, the lyrics are perfect and intelligent. He definitely moves away from his usual Jay-Z talk on this one. On this album he basically tells us about his whole life, a great way to close out his career. There are no guest appearances on here, which is very nice. As far as I'm concerned, this is right up there with Reasonable Doubt, better than The Blueprint, and definitely better than Hard Knock. Best song on the album, is, well...all of them. Not a bad song on this one. Jay-Z is definitely a legend. Let's just hope he has a trick up his sleeve and plans on making another album for us in a few years. We'll miss you Jay. Cop this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"So exactly how old is too old?","review":"This album sux major ?

He has no skill, talent, and is far from original. I place this guy in the same catergory as the Insane Clown Posse. I think he never should've got a record deal in the first place. When you sample hooks from a kids movie you have no imagination. I personally hope this is his last album. I will never purchase any garbage by this no talent assclown."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was time to retire Jay-Z","review":"The Black Album should be called the Wack Album. I was never a real Jay-Z fan until the Blueprint. That album is a classic. he should have retired then if he wanted to retire on top. His last 2 album has not reach The Blueprint plateau. He is not the greatest rapper of all-time. That is Tupac. He need to stop telling them lies. i will not waste my money buying the album bootleg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Support the effort","review":"For those of us who like earning paychecks, living in homes, driving cars, and eating decent meals, the biggest threat to our way of life is competition. Rap music, with its byproducts, drugs, death, and unwanted babies, goes a long way toward removing a significant percentage of the population from the race. Rap aficionados are, in the main, illiterate, inarticulate, and ignorant people who will never be able to compete - they've already taken themselves out of the game. As we dismantle the welfare state, they're left to their own devices, and the rest of us get on with our lives. I say kudos to Jay-Z! Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Guy who could have been Good","review":"Well this is the way it has been ever since after Jay Z's classic album Reasonable Doubt. A bunch of empty fluff lyrics recited over well produced tracks. If you want to dance then this album is cool, but if you want lyrical content go somewhere else. The track \\"Lucifer\\" was an exception, dosen't even sound like the same guy responsible for garbage like \\"Dirt on your Shoulder\\" wrote that. The track \\"Threat\\" was also ok. I'm going to give it two stars;One for the production, and one for the track \\"Lucifer\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going Out On Top","review":"This album is one of Jay-Z's best. It is not on the same level as The Blueprint but it is close. After releasing a somewhat disappointing double cd (The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse), Jay-Z rebounded with this release. The beats are hot and the lyrics are nasty. Jay-Z is the best rapper alive. He's still not better than 2pac or Biggie, but he is the best rapper alive. I'm sorry to see him go. At least he's going out after redeeming himself with one of the hottest rap albums of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brush the dirt of your collection","review":"This album is pretty good.

There weren't a lot of tracks on it which was kinda dissapointing but \\"Dirt Off Your Shoulder\\" is HOT enough to make up for the weaker rhymes. \\"99 Problems\\" is a great track too. I really thought Jay-Z was sounding a lot like 50 Cent on this album and not like his older ones. Great last Cd by the original rapper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Jay's BEST but a Great Album...","review":"At first I wasn't feeling this CD so much but after 4-5 spins I realized this was a really nice album. IMO it's behind Blueprint, Vol. 1, and Vol. 2 for the best Jay-z albums. Alot of people don't agree with me on Vol. 1 but it was a great CD(besides \\"I Know What Girls Want\\" & \\"Sunshine\\") It was before he went materialistic and commercial."},{"rating":"2","title":"My second Jay-Z album","review":"I got this album like 2 years ago and I think that this album really isn't bad at all. for the most part I like the whole album, especially \\"What more can I say\\", (which they got the background music from Groove Armada's song \\"Suntoucher\\"), \\"Justify My Thug\\", and my personal favorite, \\"Allure\\". \\"Dirt Off Your Shoulders\\" and \\"Change Clothes\\" are overplayed, but this album is definitely one of the ones I can listen to for hours at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a Reasonable Doubt","review":"It can be argued that Tupac and others are better then Jay. In my mind however these two are at the top of the ladder and every other rapper is struggling just to get to the bottom of that same ladder. This album not only defined Jay Z as a rapper but as a man. He let it all out on this cd. If any Jay Z fan, or even rap fan can say that this album was not one of his best then they need to take another listen. You watch him grow up from Reasonable Doubt but never lose sight of where he came from, and can't help but think he has to be \\"They Best\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"-What's lacking-DJ PremierDr DreMore Kayne WestSkiI think the cd is solid, but could have been better.

But hey, everyone needs to get inspiration from somewhere, right? So here is some advise about making records: Next time around, come up with an original title, ok Jay-Z?

The score was fast, moving, and deep all at the same time it also deserved a nomination from the acadamy this year. It had it the depeth and romance. If you liked this score you should buy the score to Mighty Joe Young by James Horner!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have received exactly what I was expecting when I bought the product, so I am totally satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Dissapointing","review":"The movie was great, but this score just doesn't sound good by itself! In most places it is just too quiet, slow, and repetitive. An action movie score that is actually sold to the public needs to be exciting, with more...well, action! Don't ruin the movie by buying this score, but if you're a classical fan, you just might like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't relax during this CD. Bang, whimper. Loud, soft.","review":"This CD was a disappointment. I really liked the movie, but listening to the CD was a study in irritation. Each piece is a mixture of loud bangs and soft whimpers. Just try to relax, and BANG. Try to get invigorated, and it gets mushy and soft. I wish Horner would keep all the loud music together and not destroy the somber or relaxing songs with all that bashing about. For all the talk of flamengo, there is not one piece that is authentic. Well, my kids like the CD so I am presenting it to one of them as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last song is best","review":"I don't care much for the soundtrack, except for the song Marc Anthony and Tina Arena sing together-'I want to spend my lifetime loving you.'One of the best songs so far. Could listen to it over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horner cuts and pastes AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The man is a FRAUD! In every soundtrack that James Horner \\"composes\\" elements of every other score he has done can be heard, repeatedly. This was simply Braveheart vol. 3, Titanic being vol. 2. I have visions of Horner at home on his computer cutting and pasting his scores to his new films and changing the instruments for new textures. For a man who blantantly steals from himself and others he pushes the line of influence and crosses into abuse. His music gets in the way of watching the movie. His last James Horner Original Soundtrack was in 1992 for Sneakers, which Kenny G has been doing since 1986. But the illustrious composer manages to fool the public again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junior-League El Cid Meets RiverDance","review":"Clearing away the hype, this score is admittedly a smooth and pleasant backdrop. The orchestration, long-lined melodic writing, and performance are all superficially a good imitation of traditional romantic scoring. Of course the whole thing is totally impersonal and devoid of a point of view about the film, the characters, the drama, anything, but that's probably why Horner's popularity as the generic soundtrack specialist continues-- film music as designer wallpaper. Mask of Zorro mines the same Spanish folk influences as Rozsa in El Cid so the criticism of the similarities are unfair, but what about the other material leaning on Goldsmith's The Edge, a score from less than one year previous? The cute River Dance touches seem really commercial and for fans of Horner that can only mean great. First rate hair gel from the oscar-winning stylist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music for dancing","review":"I love playing this wonderful music at dance parties. Sensous, passionate, exciting music!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awesome soundtrack to accompany an awesome movie!","review":"James Horner is just great Titanic's soundtrack was breathtaking but this is EVEN better. The love theme \\"I Want To Spend My Lifetime Loving You\\" is way better than \\"My Heart Will Go On\\". Everything about this soundtrack & the movie is beautiful & magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horner does it again!","review":"I love this CD. I grew up listening to Spanish guitar music and this almost matches the same flavor. It is just a little too orchestral in some places for my taste. But still, it is a great background for my hero, Zorro. James Horner just knows how to capture the essence of a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars for 2 Good Songs","review":"Most people might disagree with me about this review. But I'm the person who want the music to be loud and agressive ( If you want to know what I'm talking about listen to MINORITY REPORT, SIGNS, DANTE'S PEAK, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, JURASSIC PARK 1 AND 2).Song number one is really cool due to the begining and the fight scene in the plaza. The Ride is the coolest song with a secondary theme from the movie playing in the backround. It has great action and suspense. The rest of the music was romatic in a way. So I give the soundtrack 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not altogether correct........","review":"I hate to write bad reviews, but this book is not correct in its explanation of the release of the Holy Spirit...the book is directed to the 'carnal Christian' who wants to 'fast food Christianity'.....I would NOT recommend this book to anyone seeking the Holy Spirit...if you are seeking the Holy Spirit, simply read the Scriptures...and focus your heart,mind,body and soul on Jesus Christ....after that the Gifts of the Spirit will flow out effortlessly..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alice Cooper - 'Dada' (Warner Brothers)","review":"Not sure as to WHERE these numerous upbeat reviews of this reissue came from.Question:did these fans even listen to this CD?I've been a HUGE Alice Cooper fan since his original band released 'Killer' and 'School's Out',but this 1983 release really bites!!Nice lp cover,though.Just two cuts here even make the CD semi-worth keeping the disc around,which are the title track \\"Dada\\" where it appears that Alice is sitting on a couch telling his problems to his psychologist and \\"Former Lee Warner\\" where he speaks about his deformed brother the family needs to keep hidden in the upstairs room.For die-hards ONLY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting But Hazey","review":"There is supposed to be a loose concept here about multiple personalities, but you'll be hard pressed to find it. \\"dada\\" is Alice having another nightmare, but this one, while a touch better than \\"Zipper Catches Skin,\\" still lacks coherency in the writing and performing. The main standout is \\"I Love America,\\" the most Alice Cooperish of the songs included.\\"Former Lee Warner\\" and \\"Pass The Gun Around\\" hold up to the quirky new wave feel that first exposed itself on \\"Flush The Fashion,\\" but after that it's rough going for anyone but the diehards. You can just say Nada to \\"dada.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong 'em boyo...","review":"The previous review slagged on 'Zipper', which, while not a great ACalbum, beats the snot out of 'Dada'. The troika of 'Flush The Fashion', 'Special Forces' and half of 'Zipper' mark the prime of post-original-band Alice. Save your money and get these three instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!!","review":"Far and Wide the worst Alice Cooper Album ever made! He even breaks his own rules(listen to the commentary on the \\"Good To See You Again Alice Cooper\\" DVD to hear the rules Alice Cooper set up for him self as a musician)and uses the Fword second track.the only song worth listing to is track 7 \\"I Love Amarica\\"and unless your a die hard fan and must have every album he put out, down load the song and move on.I really can't recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST of Alice's early 80's...","review":"I once met Alice Cooper at an autograph session, and slid the cover of DaDa his way. He responded by explaining how some people either like DaDa or are frightened by it, and that \\"Former Lee Warmer\\" is a song even he doesn't understand. Now's my chance to not stutter in response. DaDa is the darkest Alice Cooper album this side of Killer. While \\"Dyslexia\\" has tones of the campy Zipper Catches Skin, tracks like \\"Scarlet and Sheba,\\" \\"I Love America,\\" and \\"Fresh Blood\\" stand among Alice's best.What I always meant to say way, \\"Yes, Alice, 'Former Lee Warmer' is a great song, but 'Pass the Gun Around' is the highlight.\\" Ever go through dark times? \\"Pass the Gun Around\\" will make the problem seem like child's play. The rest of DaDa moves along with dark intrigue as well. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Alice's best nightmares!!!","review":"Great underrated album!! From the first listen, it was apparent to me that this album is the third installment in the Great Alice Cooper Trilogy - Welcome to My Nightmare, Alice Cooper Goes to Hell and Dada. All are similarly constructed with equally eerie subject matter and fantastic musical composition. Dada is definately among his best work.Sure, the song I Love America seems out of place, but isn't 'out of place' what Alice Cooper and his fans are all about!?!?If you like Nightmare and Hell, you ABSOLUTELY MUST add this album to your collection to complete the trilogy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"PACKERS SHEETS","review":"I first liked the sheets but when I washed them before putting them on my sons bed, they shrunk quite a bit and now don't fit his bed that great.

I like it, but I agree some of the songs are repetitive. The drums are almost stripped to blast beats and double bass at a minimum. The guitars are better than I expected, sounding like buzzsaws at times, but add to the atmosphere. The vocals do a semi-good job, along the lines of Mayhem's \\"De Mysteriies dom Sathannas\\", adding to the mood but not really sounding great. My favorite song has to be \\"Summer of the Diabolical Holocaust\\" I just love how evil it sounds. This is a good cd to add to any black metal collection, but hard for some to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, Unholy, Hateful Black Metal","review":"Darkthrone's album \\"Under A Funeral Moon\\" is a great, solid black metal album. Actually this might sound crazy, but this album has a \\"melodic\\" twist to it that really makes it unique. The song \\"Unholy Black Metal\\" is what Darkthrone is all about and this ablum proves it! Buy now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmmm","review":"i REALLY recommend that you buy this cd. favourite track has to be To Walk The Infernal Fields.

We've got a new town. Mm-Hm. We're in- Where are we again- Waterford, Vermont. What do you mean where is it? That's where it is.\\"Such begins an incredibly engaging adventure of a film crew's efforts to begin shoot on the problem-plagued film 'The Old Mill'. This is, to my knowledge, Mamet's first comedy for the screen but you'd never guess.Those who are long-time Mamet fans will recognize many of the faces from other films as well as Mamet's trademark snappy dialogue. I believe the writer of the score is the same as in 'The Spanish Prisoner' also. Put all this together and you've got a real treat.On top of all that though, Mamet shows us great characters from the first-time film writer trying in vain to complete a script about purity, to the big time movie star who has a thing for 14 year old girls, to the overpressured director who wants a compromise at 'half-a-twenty-eight-year-old girl.' We all knew Hollywood was fun!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Likeable movie","review":"I tend to watch movies for a story and take them at face value. If there is an obvious lesson, some laughs or tears, or if I learn something, those are plusses. I do not like to have to work too hard when viewing.....I want to relax.\\"State and Main\\" allowed me to relax while I watched it. There were no gimmicks, no tricks--just a humorous story, simply told. The casting was good and there was a wide variety of characters populating a somewhat typical New England town. There were no real caricatures, although many of the Hollywood people were as shallow and smug and conniving as I always imagined them to be, many with huge egos.The movie keeps the viewer on his/her tos with cleverly written dialogue and fast scene changes. All in all, an enjoyable film."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like 2 1/2 stars","review":"Well, this movie is worth seeing if there isn't anything better to see at the time. \\"Annie\\" has a GREAT performance, she can very well portray a small towner, and she is a good example of people who \\"make their own fun\\". It's an OK movie overall, but the last 5 min of the movie are worth seeing, so you might as well watch it for those 5 min."},{"rating":"2","title":"State and Main, Shoot first and ask questions later.","review":"It keeps you wanting for more, never a dry area that could've been improved upon. State and Main is about a big-time movie company filming in a small town. Each group of actors does a teriffic job portraying their parts, and the conflicts between the two groups are presented so well, it couldn't have been done better. This has to be one of the best movies about making a movie. The cast and crew had to move out of another city, becuase of problems that aroused, which they never do explain. Thats one of the great things about this movie. You know something happened, and it's a major part of the movie, but they never tell you what or why. If you only get this movie for one reason, get it because it is a hilarious comedy with an all-star cast. If you get it for another reason, get it because there probably will never be another film like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mamet, Hoffman, Macy, and Baldwin...Can't lose!","review":"I've seen this movie a dozen times but don't yet own it. Phenomenally great direction, acting, writing, sets/locations. David Mamet writes brilliantly about the industry he knows so well. P.S. Hoffman is at the top of his game, Alec Baldwin is his typical understated comic genius (the delivery of the \\"So...THAT happened\\" line is a clinic on comic timing and delivery, and should be taught in acting classes), Bill Macy is superb-no other word adequately can be used to describe his performance. Sarah Jessica Parker and Julia Stiles are great in their supporting roles. If you love movies, know a little about what you THINK goes on behind the scenes, WATCH THIS MOVIE! I've been told by friends who ARE in that industry that this nails exactly about 90% of what happens a) on indie movie sets, b) how stars are dealt with by those working on-set (and by the money men off-set, as well)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"Over-rated\\"?","review":"Lots of snappy dialog. Lots of recognizable actors. Lots of... blah blah blah.I wanted to like it, but just like the Hollywood it parodies, it's pretentious. It has its humourous moments but ultimately... I just don't get the hype. Maybe the actors read Mamet's scripts and get all excited about doing his films because the staccato dialog seems so good to them on paper. To me, watching his films is like watching a stage play where the actors have to exaggerate to better get the meaning accross to the audience. I see a film to watch the story like a fly on the wall. Like a real event with an invisible watcher. Oh well, maybe it's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toothpicks for your eyes, a stake for your heart!","review":"This movie was about as much fun as watching paint dry. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Alec Baldwin, and Sarah Jessica Parker were wasted in this movie. I was looking so forward to seeing \\"State and Main\\", but both my husband and I were sorely disappointed. The pacing was terrible and it plays like an inside joke that only people in the film industry will understand. Every tidbit worth viewing was in the trailer. If you're looking for a movie about a small town w/ eccentric locals, buy \\"Nobody's Fool\\". It's far more entertaining than this rubbish, even if it doesn't have a thing to do with movie making on location."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth even one star","review":"Someone once said that if you put one million monkeys in a room with one million typewriters, eventually they would produce the complete works of William Shakespeare. I am sure that while getting there, the monkeys produced the script for this movie. \\"State and Main\\" has the most contrived and artificial dialog I have ever seen. Especially painful are the exchanges between the playwright and Annie, the bookstore owner. I found their conversations irritating, fake and phony. Not even the great William H. Macy or Sarah Jessica Parker (who plays the part of a bad actress very well) can save this movie.

Though the movie seemed a little over the top, i'm sure it's still very simular to what goes on behind the scenes.

Not clever. Not anything. I'm not even going to finish watching this dog before returning it to Blockbuster. A great cast...with nothing to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"the absolute worst","review":"This movie makes me physically ill when I watch it...one of mamet's actors once said that Mamet's dialogue is a style of its own but when you're acting it out well it doesn't seem like a style it seems real...well the dialogue sure as hell seems like a style in state and main, and a frustrating style at that...this movie feels like a bunch of people in the real world speaking a language that is annoying and doesn't exist, or maybe i just can't understand it....regardless, after this and 'heist' i think it is safe to say that ole Dave should stick to writing play which he is brillaint at (i.e. American Buffalo, Glengarry Glen Ross and Speed the Plow.)....phillip seymour hoffman is the only saving grace in the film but he's pretty much brilliant in whatever he does.....don't waste your time with this one folks....it was filmed in my home town and i didn't even like it!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is a tragedy","review":"My girlfriend brought this DVD over the other night to show me. Now, she is normally a very sweet girl, but I have reason to believe now that she may be smoking something.This film is plagued by poor acting, bad direction, and third-rate script-editing. Lines are cliched and forced, and characters are stereotypically two-dimensional. I'm normally very good at the suspension-of-disbelief, but this is beyond my abilities. Even the NAMES are contrived.State And Main attempts to recreate some of the real-scenario feel of other films, and their influence can be felt. I am reminded of Magnolia, Wag the Dog, and others. The difference is, I actually enjoyed watching these, unlike State and Main. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A painful letdown","review":"If Mamet doesn't pull out of his deathspiral soon, you'll soon be able to officially file him amongst Paul Auster, Eric Clapton, and a score of other dinosaurs who busted out of the gate with a seemingly endless reservoir of talent and then proceeded to give everyone a lesson on appearance versus reality. The story is certainly not the most exciting, but the acting is mostly at what's fault here. Or, let's be honest, it's the acting AND the directing. For someone who's MARRIED to the guy, Rebecca Pidgeon seems to not have the faintest clue of how to read a line written by her husband. To be fair, though, she's not the only one completely botching things up. Lines and entire plots just go clunk, clunk, clunk. Simply don't waste your time with this one, and revisit Mamet's first 4 or 5 movies, all winners by any standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Mamet fans only!","review":"I couldn't get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking. The characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do? Mamet appears to have never left Manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective. To be honest I didn't finish the entire film, but instead checked the TV Guide for reruns of Northern Exposure for the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur night all the way around!","review":"I guess this is supposed to be a satire on Hollywood making a film in a small town, but it's more of a self-satire on Mamet's own very tired & overdone one-note schtick. This movie is lazily written & sloppily uneven, it goes all over the place from moment to moment, scene to scene. The acting (what there is of it, because as in most Mamet productions, there's a lot of postured readings instead of acting) is like something from a school play rehearsal. Poor Alec Baldwin is supposed to be a star but looks like a fat old villain out of a Chaplin movie. If this movie is supposed to be a put-down of the Hollywood system, it fails miserably. It makes one yearn for blockbuster special-effects. Should be rated NO STARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good...","review":"...But it gets one star for the brief moments that Ricky Jay has in the film and another for portions of Alec Baldwin's performance.

Two renowned actors playing their seminal roles, meeting each other in an action movie reminiscent of the Clint Eastwood-Lee Van Cleef era. Instead, the movie is tedious, dwelling on a depressed and irascible Yojimbo and a character conflict that is more annoying than significant. When Yojimbo and Zatoichi square off against each other, it's hard to explain why they'd really want to -- it certainly isn't for bragging rights or honor or to ensure that the good guys win. The ultimate resolution of the story and discovery of the hidden treasure is somewhat interesting, I suppose, but hardly makes it worthwhile to sit through the length of the movie. The only real reason to see the movie is for the curiosity factor of catching Zatoichi and Yojimbo together. I understand there is one other movie that pairs the two of them -- perhaps it is more worth seeking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS!!

It would be like Classic American Western to Spaghetti Western, both are western genre but not really comparable.Toshiro Mifune (the bodyguard) and Shintaro Katsu (the blind masseur Ichi) hook up as opportunists playing two yakusa syndicates against each other. Does this sound familiar?The predictable theme and general story line lets the really subtle relationship build between Ichi and the Yojimbo.

The follow up relase From the Inside would fare much better musically and chronicled Vincent's time in rehab/the institution.

Alice has even played in concerts within the last five years. But this is only his third solo record and is a far cry from Welcome to My Nightmare.

At this stage, the band gives us some gritty guitar styles and a few good hooks. However, when compared with Toys In The Attic and other material, this collection is a little bit weak.Out of the eight songs, I find three(Same Old Song And Dance, Lord Of The Thighs, and Train Kept A Rollin') stand out the most. And even these songs are good and not quite great. Seasons Of Wither is a little noteworthy too as a result of an interesting acoustic guitar passage.Seek out Toys In The Attic, Nine Lives, and/or a good compilation. This one shows a little promise but does not fully deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-rated, like the band","review":"The band didn't hit it's stride until \\"Toys in the Attic\\", and even then was nothing more than a competent take on much better British hard rock.Highly derivative,this album sounds like a small time bar band ripping off the Yardbirds,Stones,New York Dolls, etc. Advice-See if you like \\"Toys\\" and \\"Rocks\\" first-They are Aerosmith's only 2 consistent albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerosmith's most musical album","review":"All the songs on this album are ambitious, diverse and inspired. There's a lot of flavor to savor. To be fair and honest, acknowledgment should be given to Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, the two guitarists from Lou Reed's Rock-n-Roll Animal album who made uncredited contributions on Get Your Wings.The record company hired them to embellish the tunes and they delivered, tasteful and dramatic as usual. Train Kept-a Rollin' has their signature all over it. The phrasing in the solo at the end of Woman of the World also comes to mind. If you only own one Aerosmith album, this is the one to have.

Yes, democracy is good, science, rationality, progress are all good, anything exists that's different is inferior and is doomed to fail. We are already very familiar with this kind of ethnocentrism, however, a book with such an ideological bias cannot accurately reflect what the Chinese language really is. Language, as an indispensible cultural element that intertwines with other elements, refuses to be reduced to a pure systems of abstract symbols. The value of the Chinese language cannot be judged as being isolated from its people and its other cultural context."},{"rating":"2","title":"The West Coast is back, GANGSTER Style !","review":"TAKE A TRIP WITH PAYASO ON HIS FIRST SOLO ALBUM SINCE THE UNDERGROUND CHICANO RAP CLASSIC, SOUTHSIDE STORY.THIS IS HIS BEST WORK BY FAR, MIXING HARDCORE GANGSTER RAP LYRICS & TOP NOTCH WEST COAST PRODUCERS LIKE, FINGAZZ, ROYAL T, VMF & BIG CAPONE, NOT TO MENTION FEATURES WITH MR.

I won't get into all the reasons why this movie nauseated me, (thank God I didn't pay to see it). Anyway, as an African American woman, I found this movie degrading, and even racist. African American women are not the only women that do things to enhance or change their physical appearance. In particular, many Caucasian American women wear extensions (weave), all the time, and also dye their hair blonde and dye their children's hair blonde (similar to chemical relaxing treatments that African American, Asian, and Latina women use to straighten their hair). I just felt as if the movie was attacking and belittling African American women, had no educational value, and to top it off wasn't even funny. It shouldn't even be classified as a documentary, because that is not what this film is, and I was personally offended by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"thanks for the info","review":"hey i liked it only thing i did'nt like is that white woman Believe it or not wear weaves 2 why they do i don't no paris hilton britney spears also white woman that are not famous all in all good info well britney did it when she cut her hair and before then paris hilton has fake hair in a store called sallys beauty supply"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVD.","review":"DVD was defective.

The sound is good, but not great. Some remasters are radically better, and although it is an improvement, it lacks some of the \\"wow factor\\" that I would give to a great remastering job. The bonus tracks are interesting, with the Chris Rainbow overdub my favorite. Even if you have an old copy of the original CD release, this version is still worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Side 2 is much better than the well played songs from side 1","review":"Everyone raves about \\"Time\\" and \\"Games People Play\\". They're part of side 1 which is nothing more than a preview of Woolfson's 80s material, not bad but not compelling. Side 2 of this album, however, is the whole Project at it's best and it's one of the best thematic pieces you'll ever hear. It's just too bad there wasn't enough thematic material for two sides, hence my measly 4 star rating. This is probably a more \\"accesible\\" album for first time listeners since it combines all the \\"pop\\" elements found later in albums like Eye in the Sky and the great thematic elements found in the first three albums (Tales of Mystery and Imagination, I Robot, and Pyramid). That makes it an \\"easy\\" choice for new listeners to pick. But if you like this stuff, you'll immediately get sucked into the \\"heavier\\" material, not metal heavy, just deeper.

Maimie's actions seem so easy to condemn at times and yet so disturbing to the reader who is forced to asked themselves about their own actions during such circumstances. Stark's use of flashbacks to tell the story is first rate. A thought provoking read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and wonderful","review":"As the grandson of Jewish, Polish Holocaust survivors who has spent countless hours listening to tales of fear and sorrow relating to both war-time and post-war life, I related very well to the themes and main character in Stark's book. I found the book to be very well-written and enjoyed it immensely. I look forward to Stark's next work - regardless of the subject matter. Congratulations on an excellent debut novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and workmanlike","review":"I assume that this was published because of the subject matter, which might have been interesting in the hands of a more talented writer. This is workshop prose designed to please a workshop teacher--clipped, stripped-down style, with enough invoking of \\"weighty\\" issues to give the appearance of being serious. Sadly, this story doesn't cut it.Mamie's voice is unengaging, and her broken speech gets not only insufferable but offensive at times. I agree with the reviewer who said that the pivotal moment was buried far too deep in the book to justify reading it, and at no point is there any mention of the moral and ethical issues faced by the narrator. In an era where workshop prose by Raymond Carver write-alikes rules the day, it's easy to see how this got published, but that doesn't mean it's worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put...","review":"boring. The book reads like a writing workshop exercise, not a novel. Maime's tone is one of unwavering petulancy, and the book's central device (she turned in her parents to avoid capture) is breezed over, with hardly a mention of its political, ethical implications. It's impossible to get into the character, and by the end of the book, my sole question was: Why bother?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin and empty","review":"This book on the Holocaust is an embarrassment for those who have survived.

It's range in sound from metal to jazz to funk to circus-rock makes your head spin. The vocals are done beautifully, covering screams, singing beautifully, and singing in a completely weird fashion. The lyrics, the music, the keyboards, all create the feel of Dog Fashion Disco. And one last thing.....the best place for a hidden track i've ever come across. If you haven't found out by now, their cover of Grease is before track 1, you have to rewind the cd as soon as you start it. Genious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Fashion Disco as Great as Ever!!!","review":"They may sound a little like Mr. Bungle and FNM, but they still have their own originality and they are just amazing.

Well, the son was already here, so why not the holy spirit in female human form? After all, as stated in Revelations, the faithful and true one is unnamed, and noone knows it's name but it itself. Revelations also mentions a Bride and a Woman on the Mount. There's a reason Revelations hasn't been able to successfully be decoded. A woman may actually have more of a chance to save the world.

I will not go into details, you can read those in the Amazon review. What I will say, though, is that Kim Basinger did a fantastic job of acting in this one. Her character exuded warmth and strength simultaneously. I actually cared for her character and wanted the good to overcome with tremendous conviction. The story had depth and a somewhat believable premise, if not convoluted slightly (but not too much to take away from the edge-of-your-seat thrills). This movie was a top-notch thriller/horror flick! Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!RECOMMENDED! DON'T MISS IT! YOU WON'T BE SORRY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rock-a-bye boovy","review":"What can be said about this movie? OK there is a script not a very good one, not very predictable but sadly not very interesting. This movie is prometted as a good supernatural thriller. Like all thriller it is between good and evil or good and bad (you pick and am not doing it for you). It's so hard to review this movie. First Kim Basinger ,Jimmy Smits Rufus Sewell and specialy Christina Ricci are all very good. The problem is that even with those great actor the movie is just boring ,you go from scene to scene and become less and less interested you get to a stage where you loose all interest and just hope that it will end soon so you can go to bed. So in my professional opinion do not waste your time looking at this movie just go to bed and nice dreams. P.S. the 2 stars are for the actor not the movie !!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe au gratin with gratuitous violence garnish","review":"What a waste of time, money and effort making this trash is. Forget that \\"you won't like it if you're not a Christian\\" claptrap. This movie is so insulting to anyone who cares about parenting, children, the clergy, with no intelligence behind it. I'll give them some high marks for some scary special effects. But how can Kim Basinger have anything to do with this trash.Having a cult leader demonstrate to a six year old girl how to douse a homeless man with gasoline and set him on fire right in front of us? Yes, that's an important message to get out.This movie was made in the hopes of sucking up a few more hapless teenagers' movie dollars, and they didn't care for one second how they did it.Its worse sin? It's sinfully stupid. The dialog is not to be believed. \\"Say his name [Satan, we assume]. SAY IT\\" yells the villain as a knife is held to the throat of a small child. I think they hired a few small children to do the screenplay, is what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooh, this is bad.","review":"Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The number of ludicrous plot twists in this movie is really astounding. This has to be the only movie ever where Satan's plans are foiled by a dental appointment (Really!). This movie is just laughably bad. Those who have posted positive reviews must be people with absolutely no standards. This movie cannot be considered worthwhile entertainment by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bless the Child, And Only the Child","review":"That little girl really did a great job with this. She was the only positive aspect of this movie, but she was fantastic. The way her character was portrayed as a human being made you care about her. I didn't want to see someone like her get possessed by evil. She appeared to be possessed by Jesus, with her ongoing likeability. Born prematuribly and unhealthably, obstacles stood in her path of being normal, but she was still so admirable. She used her powers only to help others.Good job, little girl. As for everyone else, why did this have to be a combination of a supernatural/Christian drama and have a cult of Satanic worshippers dressed like lawyers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Bless the Child\\" Isn't Scary, Just Silly","review":"The main problem with a movie like this -a scary movie I mean- is when it is not scary. Kim Basinger is just bad in this film about a young girl that has a special gift to lead people to God. I wouldn't be surprised if the reason her and real life ex-husband Alec Baldwin split because of her lack of being in good movies(this and \\"I Dreamed of Africa\\"). The young girl featured is good. But the murderer of the film has to be the screen writer chickening out when it finally get really creepy. I mean, Satan shows up, roars and is gone just like that. Why couldn't he eat someone or at least say how hell is doing these days. An okay attempt that falls short compared to others of its kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the movie first...","review":"After reading the book, I hardly thought the movie was worth the money I wasted to rent it. The book is by far more encompassing, taking into account a variety of religious beliefs and deities, interesting characters and memorable internal battles with faith. The movie barely skimmed the surface of these things, and the story was vastly different. Overall...a disappointment.In all fairness, I might have enjoyed the movie as a solitary experience had I not been tainted by a truly enjoyable novel. I strongly recommend seeing the movie before reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a bad book adaptation","review":"This movie was based on a very good book. You could see just how much research and time was put into it. The movie, on the other hand, was terrible. Other than the names and general idea, it was not even the same story. There was no depth in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmemorable.","review":"The story plods along from scene to scene trying to hold the viewer's attention with a sloppy script and some pretty unremarkable special effects -- the highlight being the candles which \\"divinely\\" light up by themselves.This film pales in comparason to 25+ year old religious horror films such as The Omen,The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I first off wanna say that this movie was well done. Even though the story is controversial, that is, a girl playing what should be a boy Jesus. I thought that was going to turn my interest off when watching the movie. But instead, I was applauding at the effects that used in the movie and the End Times that was thrown into the story to make it more suspenseful. I thought the acting was well done and the lines were good too. But...of course all movies can be chessy with some lines and I like that there wasn't very much. Now, I wanna say that if you look at the movie as a fictional story it plays well. But if you ask yourself the question, \\"What if Jesus was was born a girl and not a boy?,\\" I think it's interesting but don't let that question make you think that the authors idea was just bad. It's an interesting fictional twist that will never be true but still interesting enough to be a good supernatural suspenseful movie. So there you got it, my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies of the Year","review":"As far as wastes of time and money go, Bless the Child is one of the most successful. I can't think of another movie that contains as many cliches or poorly constructed symbolism. To see Kim Basinger \\"acting\\" in a movie that can almost be called a parody of itself is unfortunate.

I had a lot of fun watching the story grown in the beginning. The effects near the end and the bedroom scene, were a little dated, but other than that a fun watch.If you are looking for an action film with a religious theme then this is a good one. Not as inspiring as some, but a nice story and as believable as you want to let it be. The overall plot is a little far fetched if you are talking strictly biblical, but as a movie it is good.Best advice... have fun and get ready for a good movie with likeable characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Bless the Child is another Good Versus Evil type of movie, but unlike most of them, this one is pretty good.Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smits were great(although Smits' role wasn't a far cry from his character on NYPD Blue). There is just enough suspense to keep you wondering what was going to happen next. The special effects, although sparingly used, were well done.Overall, its an enjoyable movie, and worth checking out.Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pro-gun, Pro God, Pro Church.","review":"This is a refreshing change from the usual good vs. the Devil story in that it portrays the Catholic Church, God, and even guns in a positive light while showing the New Age movement for what it really is. No wonder it stirs such a vehement response from a lot of people.Ignore the bad reviews. After seeing this film, I'm going to rent \\"Left Behind\\". I had heard horrible things about \\"Bless the Child\\", none of which were true. Perhaps \\"Left Behind\\" isn't as bad as I've been led to believe. I didn't notice poor acting nor bad special effects.I'm no fan of organized religion, but I'm tired of always seeing Christians portrayed as the antagonists in films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really screwed up the original story","review":"I recently finished reading Bless the Child, by Cathy Cash Spellman, the original author of this story. The movie really twisted the plot around, and the characters were screwed around with. If you've read the book and want to see the movie for that reason, take my advice and don't see it-they are two different stories entirely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Horror Masterpiece!","review":"First of all, I'd like to say that this is one good movie not to be missed! Forget what the critics say, because that's their job: to criticise! Kim Basinger gives her very best performance(in all her movies I've seen). And so is Jimmy Smits. The horror in this movie is NOT blatant rip-off, it starts from calm to climax all the way. The special effects are there to simply enhanced the movie. Let's face it, a movie without a special effects is kinda bare, isn't it? So, give this movie a chance and accept it in an open-mind. Soon, you'll learn to appreciate the art of this well-crafted movie. Calling all horror movies lovers out there. DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is awesome!","review":"While i agree that the special effects go a little to far (and which movie doesn't), this movie has meaning. This movie touches your heart and this movie will rock your emotions. I can't believe it was placed on the worst of 2000 list. obviuosly, the critic had no feelings. This movie is a BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unredeemably awful; not even Basinger and Ricci can save.","review":"I used to think that Hollywood could release a movie of Kim Basinger reading the phone book for ninety minutes, and I'd happily plunk down five bucks to see it. Of course, movies cost much more these days, and my tastes have become a bit more refined.With laughable villains, predictable and stereotypical characters, and a stumbling plot with holes big enough to drive a hearse through, this movie is an utter waste of time and money. Not even worth a rental.The only saving grace is Christina Ricci all gothed out, but sadly, as soon as she opens her mouth, the film's sad and insipid dialogue destroys the moment.Don't waste your time seeing any part of this movie. Even fans of supernatural and religious thrillers will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALLS FROM GRACE","review":"This is one of those movies that has a good idea but cannot seem to figure out just what to do with it. The early segments of the film are testament to this, because, at first, I was really hooked and enjoying myself and wondering what had sired all those bad reviews I'd read. But mid-way into the film what was subtle becomes blatent, what was creepy becomes cheesy, and what was promising does not ever find its full potential. The climax of the film is completely underwhelming, though mid-way through things start to become more amusing than frightening. All in all, it's a bottom-of-the-wrung supernatural thriller, and if you want to see good against evil on a Biblical scale, check out The Devil's Advocate instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give us back the Oscar, Ms. Basinger","review":"How does an Oscar winning actress come to find a home in 2 of the absolute most moronic films of the year. After i saw this film, i only thought that \\"I Dreamed Of Africa\\" was a good film. that is how bad this movie is. it makes bad films look more appealing. This film has the makings of what could have been a better fillm, the first thing being the actors. Here we see Basinger, Christina Ricci, and the great Rufus Sewell (Dark City). Do any of these actors give a performance that i remembered when i walked out of the theater? No, not at all. When walking out the only thing we could think of was ways that film would have been better. The main suggestion on how a film like this could have been better would be for it to have never been made in the first place. Now, let us all join forces and go to the home of Basinger and hubby Alec \\"i'm the annoying one\\" baldwin and get that Oscar back."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Studio Cast Recording is in MONO?-What's up with that?","review":"For many years this recording of BRIGADOON (1957) was the definitive version out there, but in 1991 Angel/emi released what has now become the complete version to have. After 1956 columbia records started recording everything in STEREO ( this doesn't mean that everything was released after that however at that time). It's amazing to me that this wonderful recording was not done in stereo but in MONO. A few years later this recording would be electronically re-channled for stereo but still sounded mono. This new DRG remaster is wonderful in terms of it's sound and I'm so thrilled it's finally available at long last. Thank you DRG and Dan O'leary for your dedication and hard work in bringing these recordings back into print again. Michael Sherman"},{"rating":"2","title":"A BETTER BRIGDOON COULDN'T EXIST","review":"At 17 having just seen OKLAHOMA!, I was in love with Shirley Jones. I purchased this recording because of her and became familiar with the Brigadoon score for the first time. It will always be my favorite. I hadn't listened to it for years, but with the new CD release, just listened again. I had forgotten, or not realized what amazing performances were there. Jones and Cassidy have never been in better voice, both artistically and dramatically, and the rest of the cast just excellent. Go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deja Vu","review":"Really shows what a difference 1,000 years can make. The most remarkable fact this atlas brings out is the border of Eastern Germany and the Slavs is almost exactly as today's border with Poland. Can this be a coincidence or were the allied powers after WWII knowingly trying to repeat history by forcibly removing 13 million Germans from lands east of the Oder and Niesse rivers ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended!","review":"I just saw Caligari. I thoroughly recommend it!Timothy Brock's score is the best score for a silent movie i've heard so far! Its such an authentic orchestral accompaniment that you can actually hear the breathing of the string players! Truly wonderful compared to the old organ or set classical or jazz music pieces which run alongside the movie instead of help tell its story.And what an incredible movie. One of my favourite silents so far! An eye-opening experience. If you haven't seen much silent cinema, you'll be shocked at how involving a silent can be. Caligari takes you to another place. The world of Caligari has a feel all its own, where houses are wonky, doorways triangular, people ghoulish, and everything like something out of a nightmare. One of the best pieces of what they call german expressionism. See it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CALIGARI","review":"Two star rating indicates I didn't, particularly, enjoy film, which isn't entirely true --it was hysterical! (still laughing) Dark eyeliner rules. Acting was mediocre at best (intense)..... Fun, Creepy movie to immerse yourself in -- on a late weekend night. Psychological thriller, macabre, nightmarish. Did \\"not\\" view the original version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...unwatchable","review":"This film is unwatchable due to flickering and the interludes are difficult to read. Don't bother unless you are a true diehard silet, German noir fan and have to say you've seen every one out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh! Frustration...","review":"I bought this video to show to some high school German students. Unfortunately, the words displayed on the screen are in English, not German. I didn't see any information about that before I ordered -- just assumed since it was a GERMAN movie, the text would be in German."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover","review":"Yuck! This film is aweful! Why in the world is it still in print? Movies like this are out of there prime. The plot is that a mystical man named Calligari uses his zombie that tells fortunes to go out on a murder spree and kill certain people. I can't think of anything less tasteless."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919)","review":"The story is told in a very simplistic manner and the pace is sluggish. The hammy, melodramatic acting really dates the film and causes what was once a horror film to seem comedic. The one high mark is that the twist ending actually surprised and impressed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari","review":"One of the finest achievements of the silent era and in some ways an allegory of Weimar Germany's decadent demise, Wiene's \\"Caligari\\" is an eerie, heavily stylized horror film. With its distorted angles, chiaroscuro lighting, and jarring German expressionist sets, the film is a striking precursor not only to Lang's \\"Metropolis,\\" but to the look and atmospheric feel of 1940s American noir. And its tale of a crazed doctor and his zombie-like proxy introduced a basic template for many later horror features. Still creepy and lurid after eighty-five years, \\"Caligari\\" will cast a spell on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most frightening movies of all time, and that's what matters","review":"I don't want to go for a long, involved review here, both because others here have already done the job and because much of the movie's appeal lies in just watching it. Show, don't tell. That said, I must respond to the Amazon reviewer's off-handed condemnation of the film as a museum piece. On the contrary! It'll make you shudder, if anything can. Artistic interest aside, one really should remember that at the moment of \\"Caligari\\"'s conception cinema Expressionism was in its infancy. It practically began with this. The movie was, at the time, a bold attempt at creating something new AND that new thing was meant to be a horror film. \\"Caligari\\" was meant to terrify with visuals and atmosphere. More than some \\"statement,\\" it remains a little world unto itself, hinting at something horrid, short, venal, coherent of purpose. Let's be creeped out and not miss the forest for the trees."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiration to film makers alike!","review":"I sent off for this film a few days ago after learning so much about it. I became very intrigued and said to myself. \\"I gotta get this.\\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is over 80 years old but the plot, concept and characters, still work today.I'm looking forward to owning this film, it's an inspiration to me as a budding horror novelist and should be an inspiration to film makers.I ask, could this film ever have a sequel or a remake for 2000? I wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Dr Seuss made silent horror films...","review":"This is certainly one of the most interesting silent films of the time period. Unusual story line, beautiful use of light and shadows and very artistic sets all askew as if from a Dr Seuss illustration. Whether you are into German Expressionism or not, this is an entertaining movie to watch. The score for this edition was absolutely horrid- synthesizer and electric guitar-that does not go with the movie at all. After muting the sound the movie was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of movie","review":"Turned it off after 5 minutes watching it. Old style movie with no sound just music in backround with subtitles"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful which version","review":"I bought the Alpha Video version and am not very pleased with the quality, picture, or music. I heard the Image Entertainment version is the best and I'm not sure about the Kino version. I'm watching a version on youtube that's far superior to the dvd I purchased. Waste of five bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book, a must-read!","review":"This book explores not only our possible future, but our collective past as well. Never before have I read a book where past, present and future have been tied together so well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A review from the 'target audience'...","review":"I got the book about a week ago, and was pleased at such an easy read.. and I got it for 4.97, hardcover at that. It was WELL worth my money. I am, for the interested, a 16 year old male. And like many have said, it reads like a comic.. which is what it originally was. I'm an alien buff, and astrology guy, and a computer geek... this book was me. Some people will not like, but then again some people didn't like 'The Hobbit'. In my opinion, if you dig comic plots that run high on the 'techno-modern' side (X-Men, Spawn, etc.), are into aliens, and want a book you can put away in a week easy... this is it. I eagerly await a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever Schubert needs, Lenny has it!","review":"Although you might not think of Leonard Bernstein and the Concertgebouw Orchestra as the ideal team for recording Schubert Symphonies: many listeners have loyalties to Bohm/Berlin (DG), Kertesz/Vienna (Decca), Walter/New York (Sony), and Beecham/Royal Philharmonic (EMI, 5) in these works - whatever Schubert needs, Bernstein and the Concertgebouw Orchestra have it in these mid 1980s recordings. Bernstein is sensitive to changes in mood and slight variances of tempo, and the DG sound is better than what Sony has for Bernstein's New York recordings of these same works from the 1960s.The Concertgebouw Orchestra is one of the world's top 5 orchestras, along with the Vienna Philharmonic, Berlin Philharmonic, and Philharmonia Orchestra, and this recording is evidence of their excellence. Bernstein's tempos are expansive, but never drag. The beautiful Concertgebouw sound is well served by DG's engineers.Highly recommended, and not only to Bernstein fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary!","review":"This has been described as 'atmospheric', and well, it probably is! Whatever, it is one hell of a debut. I don't agree with another reviewer that the musicianship is 'pedestrian'. It's crafted very melodically, and skillfully. As far as the songs, 'Up the down escalator' is one of the lost classics of the 80's, and the entire album is very catchy and listenable. Not a bad song in the bunch. The Chameleons were definitely one of the best 'guitar' bands to come out of England, and this album is must-listening for those who think The Prodigy or Jamirquoi are the best that England had, or has, to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fantastic album!","review":"The music embodies all that is wonderful about the 80's new wave music, and will definitely appeal to those who are into goth music as well. Many of the tracks are a perfect snythesis of a sort of upbeat wistfulness, for lack of better words. This is definitely a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Best","review":"I just discovered this band. I had always been a fan of many post punk bands. These include early U2 and REM, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Smiths, The Cure, Modern English, The Psycedelic Furs and many more. In my opinion \\"Script of the Bridge\\" is better than any single album any of these great bands ever made. That is a strong statement, but that is how I feel about this album. It is amazing this band and this album did not get more attention. Every song on this album is very good. \\"Second Skin\\" is my personal favorite, but they are all great. Give this album a try and give it a few spins to sink in. After that, the songs melodies will pop in your head all day and you will not be able to get enough. 5 stars all the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album nobody ever heard!","review":"I've listened to this album for 16 years and am still not sick of it. \\"View from a Hill\\" is an incredibly simple but effectively haunting tune. \\"High as you Can Go\\" is great. \\"Pleasure and Pain\\", \\"Paper Tigers\\", Monkeyland\\" All great stuff!!!! In fact this is my favorite album of all time.(and I have 600+ in my collection. I like all of the cuts. My biggest regret is that his band never caught on and created more music. Oh well, at least Reg created great album covers!!! \\" Th e babe you're bouncing on your knee, needs your help now can't you see\\" Oops that's from their album titled \\"What does Anything Mean? Basically\\" Bye."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Group of th 80's & 90's (and maybe ever)!!!!","review":"I first heard of them in 1984 on a Washington DC alternative radio station. This group is unlike no other that I have heard. Pretty much every song is a hit that should have made it to radio. I promise that you will not be disappointed in the band. I only wish that they were still together today! I have turned on many people to this band, and all of them love this group."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"This cd, as many others have stated here, can be described as being one, if not the best cd, of the 80s. Every new musician should have listening to this cd on his or her checklist. After listening to Script, one again wonders why the stars of the 80s rose so big, and the guys in the band never reached beyond cult status. If one wants to be inspired, buy this cd now!! If only the boy and girl bands had the courage and drive to make music like these -- it would be a better world."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought-provoking","review":"I thought I would write this review because I am a student at Southampton university and am currently trying to surf the net for information on Jackie Kay.

Speaking of bad writing, this is it! This is the worst book that I have ever not finished. The constant sex theme is easy to analyse when the main character is old and impotent - like the author maybe?Heinlein did acknowledge the existance of someone/thing higher in this one. Maybe that was another idea that crept in in old age...This may be interesting to people interested in transgender, but I wouldn't know because I am not. The idea is not new either, what man has not wanted to think like a woman for a day? But to do that I can read Friday. I remember liking that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I ever finished reading","review":"Usually when a novel is this bad and fails to engage me, I put it down and don't return to it. I felt I needed to finish this one for 2 reasons: I never finished \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" and I thought it might be going somewhere. It turns out the plot device is merely a vehicle to allow Heinlein to imagine how he'd act if he had boobs and a vagina. About halfway through, the novel merely becomes a series of hook-ups although none of them ever go into enough detail to be racy or titillating. The entire premise is about as sophisticated as a man trolling a sexy internet chat site masquerading as a woman. I'd recommend finding another use of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read","review":"I found it boring... so boring I couldn't even finish it, and after reading some of the reviews here, I don't think I will ever finish it. And yes, I read \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" first, and yes, I found it boring too and gave it one star as well, even if it was a little better than this one. I don't think I will ever read one of Heinlein's books again, but at least I tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BOOK THE EDITOR FORGOT ABOUT","review":"I am really proud of myself because i have read every heinline book and short story ever. I am completely serious about this. I really must say that this book along with \\"the rolling Stones\\" is his worst book of all time. It belongs in the romance novel section. The begining had me intrigued, i thought i was in for another great Heinlien, but it goes downhill fast. After johan gets a brain transplant into the body of his beutiful young secratary, he looses all of his gall, and all of his will. I also found the sections devoted to describeing an excersise regemin absurd. After i finished this book i laughed. I do have a conspiracy theory about this book though. Henlien wrote the first chapter, and Daniel Steel interceded and wrote the rest. I guarentee you thats what happened. I bet the editor droped his draft somewhere and he didnt have the heart to tell Robert A. Think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea - lousy execution","review":"Feel free to include me on the list of those who liked the premise of the book much better than the book itself. Instead of being a thought-provoking examination of gender roles and sexual identity, this comes across as one of those self-indulgent (i.e. boring) letters to Penthouse Forum...without the details. The interminable dialogues about clothing (or lack thereof), along with those of which characters haven't had dalliances were nearly excruciating. And let's not even get started on the cloying conversations between the two main characters; simply gag-inducing.I've long been a fan of RAH's work, but this one left me extremely unsatisfied (no pun intended)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it, enjoy it, love it!!","review":"Heinlein was a genius and a visionary. I have never NOT liked a book written by him. This one has always been one of my favorites. I've re-read it at least 4 times (with years in between each reading), and each time I read it I'm amazed all over again at what an incredible mind the author possessed. I highly recommend this book, or any other by this author, and I think I've managed to locate and read ALL of his works, including the short stories. I appreciated reading ALL of the reviews, even though I didn't agree with everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Robert A.

I gave it 2 stars cuz it RAH - but this was a one star book. The characters were unlikely and had motivations that were obscure and at least to me, seemed unlikely.There were still a few chuckles to be had, and a passage or two had me thinking it may turn aroud and get good, it just never happened.This was largely a soapbox piece. It was hard to believe how far left RAH ended up after how far right he started out, but this was a clear indication of the hippy / free love impact in his later wrtings. Gotta make you pretty sure RAH and his wife were swingers, though I have never read anything to lend that credence, just reading this book makes me think so.If you arent a hardcore fan, skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what anyone expects...BETTER!","review":"I'm sorry, but this is just not Heinein Sci-fi. However, as any true Heinlein devotee realzes, heilein is not a conventional sci-fi writer. With this novel he escapes the bounds of his boyscout adventure books and leads the reader to an expostion of the human soul, and of course, another of his favorite themes, love. How can anyone like Stranger or any of the Lazerous Long stories without enjoying the rollops into love? My own copy of this book is older than myself, and held together only be a ribbon (or 8), this book is a comfort, a joy, a vacation and something to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to respect Heinlein, don't read this book","review":"This is the worst of Heinlein's books. Don't bother with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read","review":"I love Heinlein and have read everything of his that I could find, but I could not even finish this book.It is the story of a very sick old man who has his brain transplanted into the body of his hot young body-painted female secretary. Part of her consciousness remains and the two of them go on a grand romp seducing other very old men. Heinlein himself was very ill when he wrote this novel and it reads like pure wish fulfillment.He wrote so many amazing books, there is no need to waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring book that's a great read!","review":"I've been a big Heinlein fan since my first encounter with \\"Job: A Comedy of Justice,\\" but this book surpasses even his usual excellence to produce a truly stellar reading experience! I liked the provocative discussions of gender and sexuality throughout that I feel are becoming ever more reflective of today's diverse society. I also like that these discussions fit right in with the plot without feeling like people are breaking character to preach to the reader. His futuristic society is realistic without being as grim as 1984 or other dystopian fiction. His characters become people you know well and care about by tale's end.This book is the epitome of speculative fiction and will hold you until the last breathtaking page!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly disappointed","review":"I started reading this after just finishing Starship Troopers, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Farmer in the Sky. I thought he could do no wrong. One of the negative reviews said it was more like pornography than science fiction. Since I didn't plan to read it with anyone, this even further intrigued me. This book not only fails as pornography, it fails as science fiction. Since the main character spends most of his(her?) time in the same room with inner monologue, it might as well be the chronicles of someone in a mental institution. It is a great concept for a book, but I'm afraid I'll have to find another author who knows how to deliver.I do plan on reading more Heinlein but it'll be a while. If you're on a Heinlein kick, save this one for last if you even bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Reader","review":"This book is somewhat odd, and really, not that good.

Just got bored. Dated and predictable. Love the cover though it's a genuine knockout."},{"rating":"1","title":"What could this have been?","review":"What could this have been had RAH been well enough to edit and rewrite it? As most fans know, Heinlein suffered periods of sickness. I think this time it was peritonitis, but I am not really sure. He did not get to edit or rewrite to his standards, and it shows. What you are reading is one of his rough drafts, not a finished product. That makes a big difference, and for that reason, I can't really recommend this except to die-hards. However I am surprised at the number of people who are not die-hards who seem to enjoy it. I would just hate for this to be someone's first or second experience with this wonderful author. May I suggest Citizen of the Galaxy? Time Enough for Love? Even To Sail Beyond the Sunset? This should be one of the last books Heinlein competists like myself should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't let this be your first Heinlein book","review":"I've read the majority of Heinlein's work over the past 10 years (in fact, \\"Revolt in 2100\\" was my first sci-fi book), and \\"I Will Fear No Evil\\" is the worst. It is here that Heinlein sets the tone he followed for all his later books: two one-dimensional characters -- the gruff, wise man who's always right, and the self-obsessed woman who always needs protection from her man -- lots of meaningless sex, and some claptrap about how great life was in the 1920's (when Heinlein came of age).Heinlein's early work (1930's through 1960's) is superb, and I recommend it all as some of the most creative, original writing around. But please, if you want to begin Heinlein, don't start with \\"I Will Fear No Evil.\\" And if you are a devoted Heinlein fan (as I am) and want to stay that way, skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book he ever wrote","review":"I loved Heinlein's books, couldn't get enough of them, but I wish he'd never written this one.Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heinlein's biggest fan","review":"I had never read a Heinlein I didn't like. Even when, starting with \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" he quit writing for children and started writing for adults, I made the transition (I was 12 that year) and forced my tastes to grow up right along with his stories. 45 years later, I liked \\"For Us, the Living,\\" which is more of a rough draft of an unpublished novel than an actual book. I even liked \\"Variable Star,\\" although it frequently loses Mr. Heinlein's voice in Mr. Robinson's.I DON'T LIKE \\" I Will Fear No Evil.\\"It is too long, it drags, and it is, ultimately, plain ol' boring, despite a fascinating well-developed premise.Too bad. But it is really the only dog he ever wrote, so read it once, and then go back to the rest of his truly brilliant ouevre."},{"rating":"1","title":"only sci-fi romance novel I ever read","review":"This book was absolutely horrible. The very beginning was interesting, especially when Johann was still Johann and being a real head-strong individual. After that, the book was total crap. It turned into a dialogue about who kissed whom, why it was done, whether or not it was good, whether or not Johann-Eunice should have sex with one person or another, and on and on and on. Then toward the ending, Jake arrives in their head with no reasoning or justification whatsoever. The final thing that tore it for me was the exchange of Joan with the beaurocrat who reviews her entrance to Luna. The whole thing about her parting with him as \\"friends\\" and getting her good-bye kiss just made me absolutely ill. This book's ideas became boring and repetitive real fast, and it turned into a sappy-crappy romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Boring. Childish.","review":"Considering Heinlein is best known for Stranger in a Strange Land (which I have not read), which is about a man who teaches the world about love, I was shocked to find that Heinlein seems to have the sexual maturity of a 13 year old. Interactions between the sexes in his books are incredibly awkward and unrealistic, and I usually find his female characters somewhat insulting to the sex. So you can imagine how strange and convoluted this book is. Aside from being hard-boiled, corny, and shallow, it is also incredibly boring.

He arranges to have his brain transplanted into a younger body when he goes. It just happens that the body is that of his gorgeous female secretary, Eunice. So, now he has to learn to be female... and it also just so happens that Eunice still kind of inhabits her body and the two of them have really great conversations. Okay. Interesting idea. I could not read more than half of this. I found the dialogue stilted and awkward. I kept thinking, people don't really talk like this! I couldn't keep my disbelief suspended. And, by the way, Eunice acts like men wish women would, but few do. Really unbelievable and disgusting. Lots of adult topics explored. Not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"As long as it isn't our world....","review":"The characters in this book are so two dimensional it's scary. There is no conflict of any kind. Everyone is happy if they're good guys and angry if they're bad guys. The conversations are trite with the same catchphrases appearing over and over again. The \\"witty\\" banter between characters is the entire book, all people ever do is talk and none of them seem to be able to do so in an intelligent manner. I have no trouble accepting Heinleins drawing of people since this is a work of FANTASY, but I do find it hard to believe that the world he draws would be in such a sorry state when full of such loving and generally bland people. The sap runs pretty heavy in this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull...dull....dull","review":"OK, so what am I missing about Heinlein's writing that everybody likes so much? This book was awful! In typical Heinlein style he fills the book with endless inane bantering between characters (in this case the main character keeps talking to himself) and then key points and plot twists get the better half of a paragraph and then its on to more endless rambling. About of the way through the book I kept thinking of potentially good plot twists or events that could spice up the story, but nothing happened, it just went on and on up until the last sentence which concluded the story without any fanfare. It literally was a chore to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one and save a tree!","review":"Heinlen is a genius, but you'd never know it from reading this book.The book starts out brilliantly, with two main characters: Johann Smith - a cunning old codger at the end of his years, and Eunice Branca - beautiful woman with enough love in her heart for the whole world. Through a twist of events Johanns brain is transplanted into Eunices body, while still inhabited by her gost, who only Johann can hear and speak too.You are enticed by the idea of seeing the difference in how the sexes get what they want, but instead you are taken on a tour of this womans' sex life. The book completely loses any focus it might have had. and you are then tortured as you have to finish the next 300 pages with no real energy or point to the story.Here's the book in a nut shell:Men get what they want through power. Women get what they want by being sweet. Vengeance, Rudeness, and Jealousy are destructive to both. Old people have been there and done ! that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heinlien at his most demented","review":"Although this is not a masterwork by the master of Sci-Phi, it is a very thought provoking book. Take a dirty old man who wants to die, put him in the body of his favorite sectretary (11 on a scale of 1-10), and mix. One of Heinlien's first anti-bible belt novels, it challenges the morals of American society. Although the ending was weak, the charachters are well thought out. Not recomended for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn Trash without the Porn","review":"Interesting idea in this one, but there were a couple of flaws- the main, of course, being that the book is a 400 page ramble about WHO HE IS GOING TO HAVE SEX WITH.

I found this to be one of the most boring books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every woman should read this!","review":"I bought this book on a fluke and I found it to be one of the most beneficial books I have read.

While I appreciate the discipline of the martial arts, I found that it can take months or years before you ever reach the point of learning how to actually protecting yourself in a real life situation in the modern world. The book gets to the point: If this happens, this is a way to react. Not just a lot of talk, but specific things you can do to protect your life and help save yourself from a rape.

And the fact is that some of the greatest literature ever written was done by the Classical Greeks. The trouble is, they came from a world so different from our own that reading their stories is often a challenge, since they take for granted things we may not know. So before or while you dive into the likes of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides or Aristophanes, a book like this one is a helpful tool to have. It makes sense of the authors of ancient Greece and their world, and it helps guide you to the good stuff.And believe me, the good stuff in these old plays is better than good; it's the best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a little Bias","review":"This book is good background but be wary, my teacher has read much of the ancient Greek this book refers to and warns that the book tends to state things as fact that are very much up for debate for the convenience of having a definitive answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value Great Product","review":"I used this product to replace Norton and I have loved it ever since.

In addition, the price is great since you can install it on up to 3 computers, which includes a one-year update subscription. The only thing that could be improved is the description of this product. I had to contact the manufactuer to be sure that the 1 year subscription was applicable to the 3 users of the product.

I then call Trend Micro and they tell me that the version, that they mass produced and sold for $60, was a bad version. It had lots of problems. Which I soon found out when they told me to uninstall and install another version. It was unable to uninstall right. And after 4 calls to tech support waiting at LEAST 10-15 each time before talking to a foreign accented tech, it was off and the new version ready to go. This version had the same problem, along with more. The webpage that was supposed to display at program launch would never find the site and pop up a error. Still wouldn't scan my computer for virus.

It looks like a mere platform to settle a personal thing, than to actually provide readers with correct information.

The writing is very organinzed and is simple enough for the average layperson. It could be read in less than a couple of hours if someone wanted to really pay attention. Brown is off in a number of areas, and any Christian who wants to rest assured that his or her Bible is trustworthy ought to consider what Abanes has done here. Every Christian needs to be informed of his/her own faith, and then be ready to have a defense for anyone who attempts to contradict truth (1 Peter 3:15-16).

I'm not certain if it is because Dan Brown's novel threatened Abanes' worldview or for some other unknown reason, but he spends all 75 pages of his book skewering every little detail of The Da Vinci code as if the book was a personal attack on his own belief system.He has divided his book into primary concepts and then breaksdown each section by details and suppositions found in The Da Vinci Code. In many cases he wins at knit-picking, but loses in attempts to refute the overall concept (see the section on the history of the Bible or on Mary Magdalene).I made it only half way through before a tore the book in half, disgusted by boredom and the time I had spent trying to get a balanced view of the novel.Do not waste your time with this book when I'm certain any other book on the same subject must be money and time better spent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K.

Dianne Masters was in way over her head, and with a naive belief that she could escape Masters deadly grip, she instead fell victim to his rage.Yet this story offers hope in the determined efforts of John Reed to uncover the corruption that made Dianne Masters murder by her husband and a sheriff's police officer possible. Fascinating most of all because the story is local, with underworld figures populating the the backdrop of Chicago politics. I recommend this for a good read. It's sad, frightening, fascinating, and true. Fortunately, Masters and his \\"buddies\\" did not get away with murder.

This one is for mature listeners who want to remember how good Santana's music could get in the early 70's. Favorites include: \\"When I Look into Your Eyes\\", \\"Welcome\\", \\"Mother Africa\\" (GREAT soprano sax work) and \\"Love, Devotion and Surrender\\".

This is a complete departure from Latin rock, and a dive into lite jazz fusion jam sessions.I didnt enjoy this album at all. It is too dated, the early 70's really do come thru here, sounds, lyrics, almost drugged out California feel to it. Some songs too short, others way too long. In all, this album is a collection of amateur mindless jamming; any garage jazz band in the 70's could've released this nonesense.

A mixture of fusion and blues, it's also the only studio album to feature jazz artist Leon Thomas on vocals (he sings on three of the tracks). As far as the content ,it's not dissimilar to its predecessor \\"Caravanserai\\" in that it's mostly instrumental and has no hit singles. It's the kind of album to be played straight. \\"Mantra\\" is bonus track with a great rhythm. The title track was written by John Coltrane. \\"Flame-Sky\\" was co-written with John McLaughlin and runs eleven minutes.If you liked \\"Caravanserai\\", you'll have no trouble listening to this album of mystical and spiritual tunes.

You also get here a guitar sustain master class for the same price. He impressed me so much. Just have a listen to the title track to see what i say, he even made me understand what this Coltrane piece is all about.

The author of the book makes an attempt to be interesting, but fails miserably. The book is extremely over-generalized. The first few chapters have more about Egypt than Greece. The information given in the book has no use in life, and I see no reason why anyone would want to read it.I wouldn't reccomend this book to a friend, unless for some reason they had to read it (in which case I would feel sorry for them).

As such, he was able to capture with such vivid imagery that of a man fascinated with the lives of monsters (Gilles De Rais in particular), and only slowly becoming aware of his descent into hardcore, introspective reality. Though his life is full of dinner table coonversations and interesting people, he, himself cannot avoid the ultimate conclusion that his complete dissassociation and overanalyzation of his emotion has left him without a soul. Nothing is of value but the sinful imagination which, in his mind, is so built up that nothing in reality can ever match the dream. Heavy stuff for one to contend with. A warning, this book can make you re-evaluate your own life and make you pose a question: Are your priorities out of whack?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Disturbing Book I've Ever Read","review":"I would give this book 5 stars, but there was too much to nit pick at.

While I am making a joke, I am definitely not kidding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Concise Social History","review":"This concise and clear book is a summary of French social history during the Napoleonic period. Bergeron covers the structure of government administration under Napoleon, economic life, class structure, and elements of intellectual life.

There is also a good and concise discussion of how the Napoleonic period set the stage for the social structure of Restoration France."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I could get it","review":"This is a small industrial band that I have followed over the years and was very happy to get a copy of more of their work.

Pat Boone's \\"Love Letters in the Sand\\" is an \\"alternate cut\\" that never made it to the air. Gene Vincent's \\"Be-Bop-A-Lula\\" sounds like a re-recording in a style 10 to 15 years after the original. Fats Domino's \\"Blueberry Hill\\" is a concert recording with a crowd yelling in the background. The Platter's \\"Only You\\" is also a later-day re-recording when their voices weren't fresh anymore. The two CDs are not total rip-offs.

This patchwork construction of the piece begs a second reading of the work even by the careful reader. This is not a work to be undertaken lightly but will be most rewarding to the careful reader.The Author takes us on a journey through the life of Abel from his beginnings on the reservation through his tragic life in urban society to his eventual return to his roots on the reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"I read this book for my book club. I have long been interested in Americal Indian culture and arts. I was very excited to read it because of my interest. However, I found the book dissapionting. I think it degrades the American Indian and makes their culture a bunch of misfits and complainers. I do not see this as accurate. Every culture has it's problem people but it would have been better and more interesting if the author had not presented the characters as typical of the culture, which I do not think they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Perhaps I expected too much..and this was a big let down.The book IS beautifully written..but, oh so boring! Hardly any dialogs, I never, at any point, felt drawn into the story, or close to the caracters. I struggled to finish is and when I have, I asked myself..what was it all about?

Only to discover that he is caught between two worlds. This book is a great example of Native-American fiction, it reveals the hardships of the Native-Americna people. Anyone who loves a good book based on storytelling and myth will find this book a must-read. It draws the reader in, with it's vivid description of the landscapes and ceremonies. At first I was a bit apprehensive in reading this book, because I have been told this is not a good book to read if you're reading Momaday's work for the first time. Yet, I enjoyed reading it, I apprieciated Momaday's effort to draw the reader in with the struggle of Native-American Indians living in industrial America.

Guess whose values turn out to be far superior?Unfortunately, the narrator gets into peyote. The author chose to embody this in the form of dramatically shifting narrative styles, something that makes the book hard to follow.Also a very heavy Hemingway influence.

Over all I enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"Understanding the plot of this book was difficult at first. In particular, in Part One, I was confused whether the protagonist of certain episodes was Abel or his grandfather as a young man. However, after surmounting this difficulty, I found this book to be a subtle, moving, and intricate narrative. The prose remained starkly simple and poetic throughout, a distinguishing characteristic of this book. Abel, the main character, has little dialogue throughout the novel, thus marking his role as a symbol for Momaday's theme, rather than a developed character. I believe that the lives of Abel and his grandfather are meant to coincide. After the latter's death at the end of the novel, Abel sprinkles blue and yellow meal on his body before reporting the death to the priest - which, as we learn from the memoirs of a 19th century priest, was exactly what the grandfather's people had done in their day. Abel returned to his roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seattle Sports Pack Sink Collapses","review":"I had purchased this sink to take on a camping trip.

Because these studies, more often than not, display clinicians taking part in chess-games, puzzles, and mutliple-choice questions, all in an effort to show how clinicians are prone to error in clinical reasoning, the text offers the reader no sense whatsoever of how clinicians actually reason in real-time clinical settings.

The history he describes is well substantiated. He shows how various forms of the pagan worship were adopted into the Christian churches of the first centuries; how it came to happen that \\"the higher clergy... held not much less than half the land and half the property in Europe.\\" (p.165)The Churches tremendous power over the people of Europe is given in clear and forceful terms. Heron writes about the development of the inquisition, and how the Church ruled over the Kings of nations. He writes of the deposing and dethroning of the King of Hungary; of King Henry's memorable endeavors to say to the Pope that he was sorry, and to beg his forgiveness.A well written book comprising 357 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"SSM t/a Basic College Mathematics: A Real-World Approach","review":"A great book that shows the solutions step by step.

This tea isn't that strong so new comers wont be turned up by over bitterness when using to many leafs.

Years ago I saw the author in a television interview proclaim his indebtedness to Proust and I could not understand how Proust's prose could be possibly germane to writing about the Civil War.

Second, I read on the instructions that it works best with some \\"bonder\\" base coat and I didn't see that until after I tried it.So.. it just doesn't work! That's all there is to it. It forms a pretty hard acrylic feeling coat on your nail and after about a day (I wash my hands a lot, I work at an automotive repair, which is why I was looking for a product like this) it started to literally crack. so I guess technically it doesn't \\"chip\\" at first, it just stays cracked looking for a while and then starts to chip away.

It recommends that you use the Orly Bonder Base Coat, WHICH I DID, but nothing. So I spent like 12 USD in both products for nothing!!! If you're lucky, your nail color will last 2 days, but no more if you are in constant contact with water.

Now at 7 months, we use it all the time, even with the wooden restaurant highchairs and it's great.Keeps little hands away from germs and protects his legs from hot or wet seats from sun or rain.

It is obviously made very cheaply & not worth the money.Take my advice & don't waste your time or $$$$!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a better cover out there...","review":"I have never owned one of these, but I did see them in store at Babies'rUs. I played around with it there, and then I read the reviews for it and saw people mentioning the BuggyBag. I looked at the BuggyBag online and I must say I was much more impressed with the BuggyBag and it's features, so I ordered it. The BuggyBag is cushioned much better. You can actually unzip this one and put it in the cart while holding a baby. I practiced with this one at the store and I had a time using it. The BuggyBag has loops and holders for toys and cups/bottles. Also has zippered storage so you dont even need to bring your diaper bag in the store with you! If you are going to spend this much money on a cart seat cover, spend a little bit more and get the BuggyBag. It's well worth it and you'll be glad you spent more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SAFE...DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"I loved this for about 3 months until I realized how unsafe it was when my 9 month old son fell out of the cart. Thankfully he was not seriously hurt. This has a saftey belt for the seat cover but there is no way for the seat cover to attach to the buggy. You need to by a \\"buggy bagg\\". I found one for $52 online with no shipping charge. They are more expensive but it has a strap to attach it to the buggy, a strap to go around the child and velcro that attaches around the bar between their legs. It is worth the extra money not to have your child fall out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I absolutely loved the floppy seat until today. My 14 month old son some how fell out of the shopping cart with the floppy seat still attached (it was attached properly, I use the floppy seat at least 5xs a week). I had one hand on the cart and was reaching for crackers with the other. I had my eye off him for one second to reach the shelf. The floppy seat and my son landed on the grocery store floor. Luckily he just has a bump on his head. I do not recomend this product, I believe it gives a false sense of security. If you use this seat please just remember my story and never take your eye off your baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please be very careful!!!!","review":"I was very excited to use this product. My 9 month old has been very sick and I was thinking this would be a way of cutting down on the amount of germs to which she is exposed. I am very careful about reading all directions and being cautious with everything she does. I read the directions and installed the Floppy Seat into the grocery cart. We were shopping and my daughter reached for a pear. I moved the cart just a touch away from the pear display and turned to respond to a question asked by a person next to me and I heard a thud and looked and my daughter was no longer in the cart, but lying on the ground. Luckily after an evaluation by the paramedics and a head CT, all she is left with is a large bruise on her face. I had a sense of security that was false and my small one paid the price. I don't feel confident in recommending this product as it is now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save yourself 2 trips to the doctor, and it's paid for","review":"This is SO worth the money!I really wanted this, but didn't want to spend the money. A friend of mine and I went to lunch (she has a 9 mo old and I have a 7 mo old) one day and she had a Floppy Seat. I didn't. It was appauling to me how much our daughters were putting the straps in their mouths; hers on the strap of the Floppy Seat, mine on the chair provided by the restaurant. YUCK! So, as I reasoned with my husband, you have to figure that this seat costs the equivalent to two doctor visits.We ALL love it! I love how wide it goes on a shopping cart seat, because my daughter always seems to want to nap at the store. So, I just lay her sideways! It's obviously comfortable, because she falls asleep sometimes.Did I mention that this is worth the money??"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST THING I'VE EVER PURCHASED","review":"When I was at the stores, I kept seeing other mother's with this Floppy Seat. I knew instantly I had to purchase one for my son (now 7 months). I love the colors and the pockets for toys & a drink. Now it does state in the packaging that it only requires one hand to unfold it from the bag position...that's totally impossible if you're alone. So I just unfold it before getting my son out of the vehicle and carry it in. Once he's in it, he loves it. I really like the fact that it protects him from the germs that may have been left behind by other children. I will definitely tell others about this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"my son is only 4 months but he already sits up steadily. he's outgrown his infant car seat *he's to tall for it* and this is great to keep him off the cart so he doesnt' get germs, plus he loves to look at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for every mom who shops!","review":"What a wonderful product! I bought this floppy seat after seeing a mom using it with her daughter at a Toys-R-Us. I am so happy I did! My 7 month old son is sitting up now and I can safely place him in the seat of any size carriage and not worry about it! It is soft and cushy, and covers the entire seat (including the handle), and even has it's own safety belt. I really feel he is protected from germs because there is no way for him to lean over and suck on a yucky carriage handle. It also helps keep the toys he plays with from falling out of the carriage because it covers all the little openings they could fall through. Other mom's stop me all the time and ask me where I bought it. This is a must have for any mom (or dad) who shops!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This product was way too large and annoying!","review":"I tried four different cart covers in the store with my 10-month-old son. The Floppy was awful. It was just too huge! The leg holes are way too large. It was just annoying. Skip it and get either the Safari Cart Cover with Microban by Infantino ($40 BRU) or the Buggy Bagg ($60 BRU). I got the Buggy Bagg and I love it; have used it seven times in a mere two weeks. It also works as a high chair cover. It is expensive but worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but glad I shopped around first...","review":"After extensive research (both in-store and online), I made my decision for this investment. The Burdick Baby site offers a complete comparison chart of all cart covers on the market today. I chose the Buggy Bagg. It has a detachable pillow and offers the most fabric coverage to cover wherever my son wants to explore. It only takes 30 seconds to set up with one-hand operation, to fit shopping cart and highchair. I was pleasantly surprised how cushy the batting is. The Twingles site offers an ingenius tray to attach to the highchair, since most chairs don't reach the table at restaurants. It also works beautifully with the Buggy Bagg cover-These two items install very quickly without any guesswork."},{"rating":"1","title":"EZ carry not so EASY","review":"I found this product to be extremely bulky. It is hard to maneuver by yourself in the store. I had a very difficult time holding my 8 month old and trying to assemble the seat cover into the grocery cart. I would not recommend this product and have found it easier to carry antibacterial wipes in my purse and wipe down the carts and baby seats available in shopping carts. I found this to be a royal waste of money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I purchased the Floppy Seat when my son was 4 months old, he grew out of his infant carrier so early and was not sitting up well yet on his own, it really came in handy at the grocery store and in restaurant high chairs.Now he is almost a year and we are still using it. It helps him stay in place in restaurant high chairs, he tries to get out of the high chair if The Floopy Seat isn't on !It can be difficult to put on my yourself, so when I go to the grocery store I always unfold FIRST before I even get in to the store so it is easier to put on while holding on to the baby !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Live Without This!!!","review":"This is by far one of the best baby products I have ever bought. My daughter loves to put anything and everything in her mouth, and what's worse than the grimy shopping cart handle or a disgusting restaurant high chair?? I use this product almost every day, it is machine washable, very easy to use, and even has a little pocket inside where you can store pacifiers, small toys, juice cup, etc. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"we love it","review":"i bought this when my daughter was 3.5 months old she was too long for her infant carrier and i wanted something she could sit comfortably in when we used shopping carts. this was the perfect thing as it covers every inch the baby would come in contact, when she could not sit up yet i put her in long ways and she laid down kinda. now she can sit up and i am even more in love with this as she is now nawing on anything and everything.one poster said too bulky with a baby and trying to put it on what i do is try to park next to a cart corral and when i get out i grab the floppy put it on the cart and then take my daughter out and put her in it. much easier then you also dont have to carry her in the store so it saves the back and arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS THING","review":"This is the greatest thing ever invented. My daughter is 9 months old and it is wonderful on shopping trips and great for restaurant high chairs. It is cushy and comfy and my daughter seems very comfortable riding or sitting in it. I get lots of questions too and am happy to recommend it to anyone. Everyone should have one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!","review":"I am a part time waitress and I have seen people using this for their babies, being a mother myself I noticed this and had to have one! I see the kids and what they do in those high chairs and I wouldn't want my 6-month old daughter to be next in line to use a high chair that a sick child has been drooling all over. I bought it mostly for the high-chair use. It works great and keeps my baby snug as a bug. I haven't used it at the grocery store yet, but, I am sure that it will work better then her carrier that she has outgrown anyway. I am thrilled with this purchase and I recommend everyone get one!

For fans of the play and movie \\"The Lion in Winter\\", this book captures the wonderful scheming and backbiting of an ambitious royal family in medieval Europe. The use of Celtic and Druidic rituals and magic fits in wonderfully with the premise for this series. Matt Mantrell,The Lord Wizard,continues to keep one entertained in this book with his integrity, mastery of wizardry and his abilty to land on his feet. Other titles I would recommend would be Tad Williams' Dragonbone Chair;Stephen R.

This is fantasy writing, with a fair understanding of history. It's fun reading. I found it originally at the public library.

This ruins the film and no .... I'm not rushing out like a good little punter to get an HD system. So the ploy failed.

Until the very end, this is a slow moving film that borrows heavily from the Handmaiden's Tale and Soylent Green. In the end, you're forced to coble together most of the character's motivations because the film spends most of its time on the chase and very little on plot. It's as if no had the time to write a complete enough backstory for this film. Consequently, you find yourself in scenes that hint of something more, but never really reach fruition. I suppose the filmmakers left it all ambiguous to seem smart, but the film becomes something of a patchwork at the end, leading you nowhere, literally out to sea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"after finishing the movie i felt like i wasted my money.

Our population is out of control, why is it a bad thing exactly? Why are they so concerned about immigration and getting the illegals out of each country? They never explain the need to rid each country of illegal immigrants. Why would you be concerned w/ immigrants in 2027 when we do nothing about them now? They never explain why this is especially a problem. The violence is completely unnecessary. Why would the world turn increasingly more violent if women were infertile? The movie never explains this. In fact, this movie never explains anything and you're left thinking why did I even bother watching this nonsense for 2 hours??

Rather than repeat what others have already said, let me raise one plot point which makes no sense to me. Early in the movie a big deal is made about the need for the protagonist to obtain two travel passes so he can escort a girl from London to Brighton. This is a fascist dystopia with strict travel control regulations, let us not forget. So Clive Owen's character visits his rich influential brother to ask for the really big favor of obtaining two travel passes.The next thing we see is Clive, the girl and 3 other people heading down the road in a car. Did the extra 3 people somehow get travel passes, too? We never find out because no word is ever again spoken about travel passes.

It didn't need all the conflict, ridiculous and comical chase sequences, and near-death experiences. The jump-start escape scene was laughable and the point where this film went downhill. Julianne Moore is a fine actress but can't play this role in which she was cast. Do they think a nose ring can instantly turn her into a rebel?

Most shockingly was the cop-out ending that couldn't even give a face to or a creative explanation for the \\"Human Project\\" or whatever it was called.

Not one single question regarding the plot of the film was answered!!! Not a single one!

It's a sad state of affairs when people find this to be a poor movie yet something like Spiderman 3 or Wild Hogs makes billions. This is one of the most beautifully shot movies you will ever see. Clive Owen is amazing, the story is tension filled. I'm wondering if some of the reviewers even watched the movie because it isn't slow moving in any facet, it's non stop action once it starts from beginning to end. The story is haunting, and a downer which will turn some people off, but this is GREAT moviemaking.

There are a few films that I will watch repeatedly and this is one. There is a rawness and harshness to the imagery, dialogue and at times, music. All of it blends well together in my opinion. I catch more and more symbolism each time I watch it ... the barn scene, the mention of high pitch noise that eventually fades (and later when the audio of a high pitch note coincides with a particular scene). There is much to catch while watching this movie and therein lies the beauty.If you are curious about whether you will like this movie or not, rather then telling you my favorite movies, I suggest you give it a try. Like reality, it is beautiful, dark, moving, raw, ugly and harsh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps a New Beginning","review":"This is an intriguing film that has you going one way, and then turns you around the other way. As the film goes on it is bloody and horrible how the fugees are treated.I would suggest watching the short interview film under features before watching the movie. That will give you more of a sense of what the film is about and it helped in my understanding. I was not going to necessarily watch this film again because of the violence but after seeing the interviews, I will watch it again in a new light... a new beginning.Jackie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful camerawork & engaging plotline","review":"I hadn't heard of this movie before but was pleasantly surprised at how awesome it was. The camerawork is spectacular and the sets are beautiful, though the film captures a very bleak time.

We are supposed to care that people can't get pregnant anymore, and then one woman emerges pregnant, and the entire film focusses on getting her to safety so that she can deliver her baby.On paper, this is interesting, and yes, I have to give credit to the director for making a deep, hued film of a certain texture. However, you cannot get past the very weak casting, as well as the extremely useless ending. I never once cared for any of these characters, and am I really the only person who cannot for the life of me understand all of these five star reviews?\\"Children of Men\\" is a very poor 'futuristic' drama. This is a movie that is definitely overrated, and I am sorry I wasted time on it. Next time, I'd trust my own judgement rather than these 5 star reviews on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"a stinker","review":"I hated this movie.It was well-received by critics, though, so I watched it twice to confirm my belief that it was bad. I still think it's bad.Main problem was that they had two sci-fi premises that didn't belong in the same movie. There was the idea that there hasn't been a baby born in 18 years: a serviceable idea. Then there was the idea of a police state based on evicting immigrants: another quite viable idea.But what these ideas were doing in the same movie was beyond me. Either of them could have carried the movie, but shoehorning them together didn't work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed in film","review":"I was pretty excited to see this movie, but was hugely disappointed.Read the review a few reviews down entitled \\"Wasted premise ... narrow focus on modern politics instead\\"...and that is how I feel about this movie, pretty much. It lacked a purpose in every aspect of the movie. We're hardly aware of what's going on most of the time, we don't know what the Human Project is, we don't know why women are infertile, we don't know why the government is sending all immigrants out of the country, we don't know the \\"hows\\" or \\"whys\\" of anything. All we see is desperation and violence with no purpose or meaning.Granted, the cinematography is quite well done. But I can see well done composition in a photograph. This is a movie, it was supposed to tell a story...with a beginning and an end. And hopefully a point. But alas, this movie lacks all of the above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go straight for DVD features, and then order Adam Curtis' DVDs","review":"If you are about to order this DVD for you... DON'T... really!The movie tries to be \\"pop\\" by hiring 1-2 famous actors, and by propping contemporary objects to look like futuristic. Everything comes across cheap, which, no matter how relevant the script might have been, makes the movie uninteresting.SUGGESTION - if you are interested in topics of system thinking, and how decisions today affect our future, please check something that will make you really understand a little bit better today's world - ADAM CURTIS' -The Power of Nightmares by Adam Curtis,Century of Self [2 DVD Set], etc, etc. If you really have to watch it, please go straight to the DVD features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Cinematography and big stars do not a great film make.","review":"Here I amagain.

The story sucks too. It's really about leftist politics. There's no freaking science fiction in this movie. I hate this movie. I hate anyone who thinks it's a good movie, and I hate the guy that recommended it. This is a nonsensical, stupid, amateurish movie made by untalented nobodies. Wikipedia says \\"Children of Men was not a financial success\\" and that's about all you need to know. It lost money because it SUCKS!

A two hour lesson of how bad it is to be against illegal immigration. Fittingly, it is directed by a Mexican. Every scene drips with how nobel it is to be liberal. This was like watching a left wing politcal rally. What a crock. I guess if our world is to survive we must do away with conservative values and open our borders unrestrictively. Scientiste and homeland security ruined the world and it is up to old hippies and left wing beliefs to save it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even bad...","review":"In reading some of the reviews here, I think I might have seen a different film! The one I saw had only slight resemblence to the book but, even a that, a knowledge of the book was essential if one was to have any idea of what was going on. A sudden pregnancy is the deus ex machina which will save mankind from extincition but, if the characters in this movie are any indication, I would wonder why we would want to bother.The greatest mystery of all is how great actors such as Michae Caine and Juliana Moore could be enticed to appear it this dreary (in many respects) movie.I would have walked out early on but it was so bad that I kept thinking that it had to get better. So much for that logic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Film!","review":"I must say, I never read the novel, but this movie was incredible. Apart from a great story, the filmography was superb. There were scenes over five minutes long without a single change of film, and I've never been so intriged by a film. In addition, the world in which they live in extremely convincing. Exellent job with the surroundings especially for a war-torn world. My legs were shaking the whole film with suspense. All I can say is \\"Go See This Movie!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, dark and gripping","review":"An apocalyptic adventure set in the not-too-distant future, this film beautifully portrays a dystopic, infertile world. Magnificently staged and exquisitely choreograped, it telegraps a palpable sense of fear. Though it has a gripping narrative it also asks as many questions as it answers, weaving in mystical and religious undertones that leave it to the viewer to find hope - or not - in the darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Owning!","review":"The only reason I rated this movie a 4 is the sound isn't that great on the DVD.

The amount of style that oozes off this film is insane, it really reminds people what a film as art really is. The only down side to this dvd is that it is a dvd and not a blu-ray disc. Although there is a hd-dvd version my only hope is that a blu-ray version is also released so I can add that to my high definition collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious propaganda","review":"I don't see the point of this movie.

I couldn't help but ask... \\"so what?\\" At the end.I think the storyline had huge potential and I think the setting was great! The setting is the only reason I can give this movie two stars. The director sufficiently convinced me of the hopelessness of mankind in that situation. Its too bad that he could not accomplish more with the potential he had.There has been a lot of stock put into the depth of this movie. I have to say that other than the depravity of man there is nothing the movie has to say on any subject. I think other movies more skillfully paint that picture, such as Blood Diamond.I guess this movie is worth renting but I do not reccommend purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Predictable and Bland Movie","review":"I found Children of Men to be slow-moving, predictable, overtly political, and unoriginal to the point that I turned it off.And you can see by the way the army of leftist fanatics are spamming the negative reviews that this is a very political movie.

Based on reviews I had read, I thought it would be a great film. After watching this movie, I am greatly dissappointed. To say that it was just boring would be too kind. It was also very depressing. I suppose some could say it's thought provoking and the acting is good, but it's still boring. If it weren't for the occasional explosion and gunshot,I would have fallen asleep several times. Luckily, I only wasted 99 centson it during the special sale last weekend. Don't waste your time or money on this yawn fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen","review":"The acting is laughable, the pacing is slow, there are ridiculous scenes like when the guy has bullets zinging around his head but does not move, and it goes nowhere.

What's equally amazing, though, are the reviews here on Amazon. But then again, I guess it shouldn't be that surprising, since these are the same people responsible for the \\"successful\\" careers of Rob Schneider, Queen Latifa, and Kevin Costner.If you don't mind using your brain when watching a movie, then I highly recommend \\"Children of Men.\\" But don't take my word for it - check the reviews on IMDb, and RottenTomatoes, and MetaCritic, and the 3 Academy Award nominations..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating on many levels","review":"The action in this film is poignant, meaningful and unexpected. There is an amazing uncut action scene that immerses you in the hopeless, meaningless chaos of violence, which I believe is what the director intended.The film asks, why? To what end, violent conflict? It does not answer those questions.Consumers raised on Hollywood-style morality tales will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of 2006 easily","review":"I do not own this as of yet (I don't know why), its a fantastic movie. The first time I saw a trailer for this movie I was hooked. I waited patiently for this movie to make it to the theaters so I could go and see it in \\"big screen glory.\\" It was great. We talked about it for quite a while after we left the theater. Now that I think of it, I need to go and get this on DVD. Clive Owen is spot on as usual, and Michael Caine did quite a good job as well. The story will keep you wanting more. A keeper for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"See this before you die (sorry for the morbid title)","review":"I bought this dvd purely out of seeing the reviews and trailers. I'm not regretting it one bit. Amazing film. Alfonso Cuaron has incredible vision. One of those movies that makes you think \\"what if?\\" I'm not a huge sci-fi lover but at the base there's a really good moral story with little laughs (i.e. baby names) and oohs (the getaway) and ahhs (the scene of taking the baby out of the building) in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best film of 2006, techinical issues with the HD disc.","review":"A must buy, but beware - the majority of the first-print discs have been wonky when played on certain HD players. Mine froze and skipped around on an Xbox 360 player. But, Universal is sending out replacements if yours crunks out. Don't be afraid to buy it however as the special features and the film itself are beyond 5 star quality. If you can find any discs from Cuaron, Innuritu, or Del Toro definitely pick them up.

It is a great movie full of metaphor and not at all what it seems to be on the surface.The DVD is full of extras such as 'the making of' some of the subtle yet perfectly executed special effects and a whole documentary on the politics and philosophy of the movie.Overall a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull - - I walked out","review":"The movie tries to be Very Relevant And Topical by littering the scenery with terrorists and mistreated immigrants. The director obviously took a how-to-film-a-bleak-dystopia course at a community college, so the mise-en-scene is properly gray and gritty. But the movie is enough of a hack job, the premise dull and the characters hollow, that my internal alarm \\"this movie is never going to get anywhere\\" started ringing really loud after ten minutes. When that happens I give it ten more minutes to show some promise. It didn't. *click*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Tell Me Again Why We Want To Save Mankind?","review":"I haven't been able to watch this whole movie in one piece. It's so DEPRESSING!!

Who in their right mind wants such a cruel species to survive?I'm slogging through the book which is very over written. I think I'm at pg. 47 and something is finally beginning to happen, but I find it very hard to pick up the book each time.You just look at the state of the world today: Kenya hacking hundreds of people to death over a political result that may not end for decades,African genocides that have become national pastimes, terrorists,etc, ad nauseum!

Foremost being it has one of the most powerful cinematographic visual strategies that I've seen in a long, long time. Extremely well-shot but executed in a manner that doesn't call attention to itself like most visually-driven films. Acting and script are understated yet excellent as well. If this film doesn't make it to the top of every best film list this year then the critics need to think about a career change."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge disappoinment","review":"This movie was dark and predictable.

Not suitable for anyone allergic to blood, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark, Interesting Look at the Future","review":"Great film about a possible future for mankind where women can no longer bear children- and the population is dying off. A very frightening scenario and with solid performances, particularly by Clive Owen. The opening scene sets the mood for the movie- all in one shot- and is brilliantly directed by Alfonso Cuaron. A thoughtful, intense, raw movie that builds to a powerful but hopeful ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow to build and never really finished","review":"Very disappointing.

Why a director/producers cannot replicate a book with the same emotional intensity is beyond me. The book has an incredible plot which the movie uses as its central theme -the reality that man is now infertile and the population is going to die off. The movie, however, becomes a propaganda film for immigration issues and a political agenda that is so overt that it is silly. The acting is sub-par at best. Clive Owen looks like he could care less about being in the movie and the entire cast looks lost at times. The dialogue is sloppy, the acting is poor and the book that is an interesting read is ruined by this sorry piece of film work.Read the book.

Everything was moving so fast including violence, gore and subplots I just was overwhelmed. Perhaps because it seemed everyone had a gun and wanted to wontonly shoot everyone else, it reminded me of the unpleasantness in the war we are currently trying to disengage ourselves from.

The upper towel bar sticks out only 1\\" more than the lower, hence the towels are close together and take longer to dry.It still looks good, I just don't know how long they will last or it's flimsiness drives me to rip it out from the wall.I would not buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap price/ Cheap Quality","review":"This is a flimsy unit, I'm sure we'll be buying a new one before long. The installation was okay but the screws attaching the shelves to the wall pieces kept coming loose. I was afraid of tightening them too much since the inserts felt like they were slipping. Not suitable for rentals or any place where kids are very active, any more weight than a few towels and the whole thing will probably collapse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap adds towel holder and holds towels","review":"This is your standard cheap towel holder. I previously had the single towel hanger and \\"upgraded\\" to this one. Nice for the price, especially since I just needed an additional place to hand a towel. In the process of redoing the bathroom and just needed something solid and cheaper, but not cheap looking if that makes sense.This fits the bill perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well built and sturdy","review":"I looked at many towel racks before ordering this one. All my towels fit great, and I have a lot of them stuffed in there. Easy to install too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice item at a good price!","review":"This nice chrome look bathroom shelf is made of a good quality metal, and looks sleek and new in your modern bathroom. A good deal at a low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product @ a good price","review":"The Polder wall shelf with 2-racks has a nice contemporary appearance. It was easy to put together, but it does take a little effort in order to mount it perfectly level (especially if you're alone). I used different wall anchors than the ones provided b/c I had better anchors available. Overall, the shelf/rack works very well, allowing enough room for extra towels if you have guests that need to shower. I am happy with the purchase and the price was very low compared to other similar units."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - Great price","review":"I have purchased this time before from a different manufacturer for almost twice the cost. While the other one was slightly better looking quality-wise, it wasn't twice as good so I'd say this was a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"Item looks exactly like photo, easy to assemble and mount on the wall. As for the two critical reviews... I have *NO* earthly idea how and/or why anyone would have problems putting this thing together as anything but SOLID. How you can screw up something SO easy, I have no clue. I am very happy that I did not let those two poor reviews influence my purchase at all.I put this up in TWO bathrooms and am thrilled with it! I am definitely considering a third one in my half bathroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobbly & Short Life Span.","review":"Ours came apart after light residential use, approx. 24 months or so from date of installation...the bars are not particularly secure.

There are no solderings or welds, the unit will not come apart as other people mention.The plugs that come with it are not well suited for a sheet rock wall (probably excellent for a brick wall). I used other plugs and screws and the unit is now firmly attached to the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't be exposed to moisture","review":"Will work as long as you are going to install it to a wall and not in the shower. It will start to rust if exposed to moisture in the shower.It is only plated with chrome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"This towel rack is a piece of garbage. The back crossbar on the top shelf was cut too short and wouldn't stay in. (Or if it was supposed to fit up against some material inside the frame, that material wasn't there.) I had to buy a dowel, cut it a little longer than the crossbar, and then run it through. The directions don't tell you what size hole you need to drill. (Most people would pick 1/4\\", but it would be too big. Go with the 7/32.) The wall anchors are so flimsy they crumple if hit with anything more than a light tap. And my power screwdriver stripped the slots on one of the screws. I probably should have sent it back but just didn't want to go through the hassle. It's in place, and I'm just hoping it can handle the four towels I have hanging on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive","review":"I have to say that this box set here is highly expensive, I bought one NEW, in $ 85 so, How could they sell this in almost one thousand dollars... Its Incredible..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not worth the price","review":"Ok, the package is gorgeous. But little else.The gem here are CD's 3 and four, BEAST OVER HAMMERSMITH. The sound, the performance, the set list (it's practically a \\"Best Of\\" their first three albums), everything is top notch. And this perfection is also a problem!! Why?Because, listening to how good this live set is, you will notice how weak, really, are all other live albums by Maiden. You'll notice how the drumming by Clive Burr was much more powerful, precise, loud and creative than that of Nicko. You'll notice how all the live albums with Janick Gers are crap.The B-Sides are interesting, but already own most of them.

Even at this price, it is worth it, but it is out of the range of some fans, so whilst I LOVE the fact I got the special collection at a very neat price ( way under 80 dollars) it would be a good seller to have the content out in a mini pack for those who can't afford the current collectors price. Although, it is worth paying the extra for the goodies, it might be a better sales decision by the band to have the discs available for a lesser amount when all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"Honestly, my kids wanted this just for the music, after having watched the music video of the title track like a MILLION times.

I would like to remind you when buying it does not come with a hanger. So the tasseled hanger is not included. The add tells you this but I overlooked that part. It has a nice weighted rod hidden in the bottom to keep in wrinkle free and where it should be. The colors are the exact colors of your dishes. They are sitting on a sideboard which you cant see. It is all in vintage style. I promise this tapestry will not disappoint and the price is dirt CHEAP!!!! This would sell in a gift shop for 400 dollars easily. So you will not be sad you ordered. I waited forever for it to become available I see now it is out again. lol I know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"No words can describe...","review":"No words can describe this movie. It is a timeless classic set to a (at the time)futuristic setting. The singing is magical and the talent is even more of a treat. Diana Ross brings so much feeling to this role, that her song \\"Home\\" puts me to tears everytime I watch it. I have never heard a voice with so much emotion and substance. If there is one movie that is a must in your DVD collection...This is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Musical Ever!","review":"The Wiz has been billed as a remake of The Wizard of Oz but that shouldn't be your reason for seeing it. This movie is an urban rendition for those who couldn't identify with the original, farmgirl Dorothy. The music is more expressive and the dancing is more exciting. The characters are much more entertaining. Everyone will not like The Wiz but it was not made for everyone. So put aside your preconceived notions and dance along."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a pleased customer with this particular product","review":"the company saw my mailing address and still sold me two copies of the wrong region.... dvds will not play on my home, now i have to spend more money to buy two more and i lost money by buying the first two... so i am very unhappy with this purchase... how could you receive my billing and mailing address and still sell me a product that won't even work in my region."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Even If Diana Ross Isn't The Best Actress On Earth","review":"The movie version of the Broadway musical is very good. Everything about it from the scenery to the catchy tunes like \\"Ease On Down The Road\\" are perfect and remind me of the Broadway version. The only flaw is that Diana Ross was picked for the part as Dorothy only because of her miraculous voice, but she is not the most skilled actress. Overall, the movie is good with familiar faces like Michael Jackson and Richard Pryor along of course with Diana Ross."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 - Doesnt work","review":"I cannot rate the video because I can't view.

Far too many slow ballads in minor keys to suit my taste. Even the rockin' songs have an overload of sharps, flats and disjointed rhythms. The pacing of the music and spoken sections is far too slow to maintain interest IMO... the only section that really moves is the middle, where Dorothy is joined by her three Friends for their quest. The filmmaker has apparently become so enamored of the set design and costuming that it takes priority over telling the story. And who IS the strange, ominous stalker with the tray of odd-looking items? The song \\"Ease on Down the Road\\" does, however, ALMOST make up for these deficiencies :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrill and Depressing","review":"I never saw this movie as a child, so nostalgia was unable to assist me in appreciating this movie the way that it helped some of the other reviewers. I found the movie oppressive and unrelentingly dull. Diana Ross sqeals and whines from start to finish, and, though she plays the lead, is completely unable to make her character at all likable. An emotionally crippled 30-something teacher living with her parents is a terrible premise for the main character anyway. She's so pathetic that it's impossible to care for her the way we cared about Judy Garland in the original. I like Diana Ross, but I hated this character, and indeed I hated the entire movie. Watching the thing just made me feel awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie of all time.","review":"I have had The Wiz on VHS for years, but after my niece broke my VCR, I decided to invest in the DVD.

I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!!","review":"The movie is done very well - with all of the colors they use, one would expect colors to bleed and not be clear but the picture is very sharp. The only reason I could not give five stars is that the CD does not include the Lion's song - it is my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"A numbing experience","review":"This was a huge disappointment for me back in 1978 and it has NOT improved with age, except for a few of the dance sequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This movie loses a lot in translation into something more \\"urban\\". It is no longer a movie for young children as it contains visual imagery of prostitutes, drug users, and what appear to be pimps instead of horses changing colors. I actually had to cover my granddaughter's eyes while Dorothy was leaving Munchkinland to find the Yellow Brick Road, because she ended up in what appeared to be the \\"Red Light District\\" of Munchkinland, which is filled with graffiti and trash. This is a terrible, unnecessary remake with a mottled message."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIPPING DVD","review":"This dvd sucked.I couldn't wait to get this DVD and watch it with my 14 year old son.. only to find it was all scratched up. Most parts skipped and others just never showed up..lol*sigh*I will try again with a BRAND NEW dvd !"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie... shhhh, don't tell anyone!","review":"Now honestly, Berry Gordy KNEW Diana Ross was too damn old to be playing Dorothy in this movie. Diana's overly dramatic acting at times makes this movie painful to watch, but seeing a young Michael Jackson when he was still recognizable, and hearing the songs written by Quincy Jones makes up for Diana's bad acting.At the time it was released the movie wasn't well received and I do understand why, but now it's sort of a cult classic, especially with Michael in the mix. It's worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE Film","review":"Aside from this DVD not being 16:9 and including zero extras, the film itself is extremely boring, the songs or terribly written and witless, and the acting is the pits and pathetically miscast in almost every department (outside of Michael Jackson who does a brilliant job). The only \\"hits\\" from the show on more chants than songs, I would much rather watch The Apple or Xanadu or eat live rodents than have to suffer through this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wiz is no Wizard!","review":"Im going to give my honest opinion. I bought this video because as a child I LOVED the original Wizard of OZ. Since then my kids have become big fans of it too. So I bought The Wiz thinking it was goin to be good also. This movie was VERY slow. The scenes were dark, And all together very boring. I Ended up putting the Original Wizard of Oz in the VCR before the Wiz was even over. Sorry, didnt like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wiz?","review":"This is a complete waste of time. \\"Creepy\\" is the best way to describe this movie.

Do yourself a favor, watch the original, this version stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is awful!","review":"The soundtrack is excellent! The movie is simply bad, and the sets and locations are some of the ugliest things I have ever seen. Was this entire movie shot in a garbage dump? Simply watching this thing is depressing. Do yourself a favor and watch the original with Judy Garland. It'll put a smile on your face again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid waste of time and money.","review":"There are some films that should be left alone. The wonderful 1939 classic \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" is one of them.This feeble effort is an insult to anyone who loved the original. Diana Ross as Dorothy, when she's not even half as talented as Judy Garland was? Get real! For one thing, she's WAY too old. To me, Dorothy will ALWAYS be Judy Garland. Judy's portrayal of Dorothy sparkled with yearning, vitality, and vulnerability. Who can forget her poignant rendition of \\"Over The Rainbow?\\" Diana's \\"Dorothy\\" is positively annoying. You actually want her to return home from Oz because once she does, this sacriligious movie will be over!As for the rest of the cast, they are so collectively bad in their parts that they don't even rate a mention. It's a pity that all the talented people involved with this production couldn't make a talented movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst 'musicals' of all time!!!","review":"I couldn't let the 2 reviews written be the only ones out here. This is truly one of the worst musicals ever made. I suspect Mr. Lumet only did it because of his mother-in-law (Lena Horne). Everyone involved should be embarassed and ashamed for perpetrating this travesty on one of the greatest films of all time. Luckily, most of those involved never made another movie...and well they shouldn't have after this. This is one time I can't really blame the director, as he is one of the few good directors still alive and working. But then he had never attempted a musical before, and, thank goodness, has never attempted another. Though I must say, he should have been forced to watch this and do a commentary as retribution. As for the show itself, it has long been forgetten, thankfully, and should stay that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm part of a teathrical foundation...","review":"Yea, we made a great adaptation from this movie and now in just two weeks we wonna get to the teather at Mexico, we just made a great musical taking from inspiration tin, the scrapecrow and dorothy ohh the lion and also glinda well you know the story, just a great story i widely recomend u to u! a great story"},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU SIMPLY MUST SEE THIS!","review":"True, I didnt much care for the songs, except for one or two maybe, but the scenes, teh characters and the plot-lines are VERY imaginative, and the entire production has a BRILLIANT twist. Dont go to compare this with the book or the 1939 Wizard of Oz MGM Movie....Just try to enjoy it in its OWN right, and you will.......The cast is all African-American, but that doesnt matter, since the performers are all SUPERB. I totally enjoyed EVERYONE's performance. True, it VERY 'modernized', and ahead of its time, but what does that matter? It onyl makes Oz 'jazzier', even though I prefer the Oz we find in the books and the movie. Still, if your a Wizard of Oz fan, you MUST see this total MASTERPIECE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great director, terrible movie","review":"A great director's (Sidney Lumet) worst film.1. Diana Ross is way too old, and frankly, it is laughable when she tries to sound sincere.2. The dialogue and lyrics are so ridiculously dated and sound like the self-help nonsense from the 70s.3. The costumes look like something the PTA would create for the school play (Oscar nomination? Seriously?)4. It is way too long (2 hours 15 minutes of monotony)5. They removed all the great songs from the original show and replaced them with dull, touchy-feely tunes.6. A lot of it is shot from far away (obviously to play down Diana Ross' age)7. The sets look like rejects from Sesame Street (Oscar nomination for that?)8. Ending is really dull and sad9. Richard Pryor looks like he is another movieWhat should have been a fun, tuneful fantasy has been turned into along, dull trek by someone you just don't care about and accompanied byactors who look embarrassed to be wearing these Fruit-of-the-Looms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Region Code","review":"You think it would be written somewhere noticeable since I am purchasing this in the United States and I expect my videos to play in the correct format.

Not happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As The First Time","review":"My 11 year old watched and enjoyed the Wizard of Oz and came to tell me about it. When I remembered and told him there was Black version of the film, \\"with Michael Jackson in it!\\" he was not interested. I purchased it anyway, and got him to watch it with me, I couldn't believe how much fun we had watching The Wiz. I couldn't believe I still knew all the words to the songs and my son was happily surprised that I remembered also. I taught him the philsophy behind the film and he watched it over and over again until I heard him singing the songs alone in his room. This film gave my son and I a wonderful new experience that we could share together and discuss. I remembered watching this with my Mom, and watching it with my son, is as good as the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wiz","review":"I would give this movie a negative star rating. My daughter had her classmates (middle/high school) over to watch the movie becasue their school is performing the play (when it was on Broadway it won about 10 Tony awards). The movie was worse than horrible, we all found it racist, stereotyping black people, and extremely painful to watch (not because of the material but the way it was acted and portrayed). I apologized to all the parents for wasting their kids brain cells. The kids did not like it but said they would finish watching it (I offered another movie about 45 minutes into this one which is 2 hours and 15 minutes). The music was fine but the visual detracted from it's enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Picture Quality","review":"I read the reviews before selecting which The Wiz DVD I would purchase. I already loved the movie; so, reviews and price were my deciding factors. Now that I've purchased and viewed the 30th Anniversary Edition I think I may have gotten a dud or bootleg DVD. The picture quality was so dark throughout the entire movie. My plasma TV usually shows a bright brilliant picture, but not with this DVD. No amount of adjustments improved the picture. The original version on Netfix shows a better picture than the DVD I got. I'm going to return it for another copy. If the picture is still dark I'll request a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wiz (30th Anniversary Edition w/ Bonus CD)","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my 12yr old niece everytime this movie came on tv she would alway catch it in the middle or at the end so now she can watch it from beging to end uninterupted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wiz provides positive messages for minority children!","review":"This movie, though it did not do well in the box office, is EXCELLENT!

This is an excellent movie for the family and perfect to pass down to generations to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It isn't the \\"Wizard of OZ\\"!","review":"I saw this movie when I was 7 years old and loved it. Honestly, I believe \\"The Wiz\\" needs to be critiqued on its own merit and not how the movie compares to the old classic \\"The Wizard of OZ\\".The Wiz is lively and full of energy. It is one of those movies that causes you to want to get out of your seat and dance. I found it to be upbeat and unique. The cast was fantastic, especially Michael.At 28 years old, I rented the movie again so my boyfriend could see my favorite childhood movie. I love it now as much as I loved it when I was a kid. The songs still make me smile!This is a wonderful movie! I am glad that I had the chance as a young white child to be exposed to a black musical, such as \\"The Wiz\\" rather then the boring colorless white version! The Wiz definitely has soul!You will really enjoy this film. Pass this uplifting experience on to your children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who needs the Wizard of Oz when you've got the Wiz!","review":"I love this movie (except Diana Ross)! The music is great. I love Michael singing the \\"Crow Anthem\\" You Can't Win & Evilene's Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News. But the ultimate is Can You Feel A Brand New Day. This is uplifting and the dance number is excellent! This is one of my all time favorite movies. The Wizard of Oz is a classic and I still like it, but this movie has a whole different flavor that I love! This is one to have permanently in your video collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"scrached","review":"Well, the movie was alright but the good parts would skip.

And that is exactly what it did at the box office for good reason. First and formost Ross is far too old to be playing Dorothy. An excellent cast is wasted except Michael Jackson, who somehow though this mess of a film, gives a good performance. After this turkey neither did Jackson or Ross starred in another theatre released film. The film is soooo bad that Berry Gordy forbid it to be mentioned on any of the Motown tribute shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average","review":"i'm a big Michael Jackson,Diana Ross&Richard Pryor fan.but this film falls flat.it made me happy with an all African-American cast.but the talents of all the folks involved don't really shine.one great thing came out of this film the Meeting of Quincy Jones&Michael Jackson."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disaster","review":"I love THE WIZARD OF OZ. I love the book, and I especially love the 1939 movie version. I even love the less-popular 1985 sequal RETURN TO OZ. Maybe that's why this film just doesn't deliver.The film begins on the wrong note by casting Diana Ross as Dorthy. Not only is she way to old for the role, but her relaxed style of singing doesn't match the material. She just doesn't seem to be able to hold the picture together.Jackson, on the other hand, is well casted as the Scarecrow. It's just a shame the rest of the cast isn't as memorable. Everyone just seems to be going through the motions with out bringing any emtion or life to their characters. The whole production just plods along until the disapointing finale, with Prior looking anemic as the Wiz.Yeah, the production values are good, but there's no magic or joy. You and your family would be much better off following the old yellow brick road of the 1939 masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD- THE WIZ","review":"GREAT CONDITION ABSOLUTELY ENJOYED.

An insult to African-American culture and movie-goers in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love The Wiz :)","review":"My daughter is 8 years old and became an INSTANT fan of Michael Jackson when he died. She was only about 4 years old at the time. They played his music and videos so much that she was just mesmerized by his talent. She loves absolutely every song, movie, or video he has ever been in. She stumbled upon The Wiz one day on TV and has been a fan since then. I surprised her with the DVD on Christmas and she was beyond excited.

Maybe the worst remake I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic of \\"The Wiz\\"","review":"I absolutely love this movie. I remember watching it when I was a kid and being absolutely emersed in the film. You see, the first movie I ever remember seeing on the big screen was \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". Yes, it was re-release in '76 at the cinema down the road. And to see the same story recreated opened my mind to tolerance of a story, a classic story, retold in a different way. I am always amazed to read or hear \\"Wizard\\" fans put it down, when they should embrace it as the same story told in a modern way. They obviously have no tolerance of things different.

I was skeptic at first, before buying the DVD version. Now that I bought it, I realize that this was a great decision !!!!! The transfer for this 21 yr old movie is superb !! Great job. Great video-great audio. For anyone, such as myself, who adores this movie-don't miss out. Go out and make this title part of your collection. Don't waste time renting.

I came in about ten minutes into the movie, and my impressions were: 1). What a mediocre movie; 2). What mediocre performances; 3). Why did Lena Horne, Quincy Jones and Richard Pryor debase themselves this way?But, worst of all was when I found out that it was directed by Sidney Lumet(?!?) No kidding, the great director of \\"Network,\\" \\"Serpico,\\" \\"Dog Day Afternoon,\\" and -- later -- \\"The Verdict\\" for some inscrutable, strange reason, chose to direct this unforgivable mess and waste of Technicolor stock.Guess he needs to eat, too.This would be like Elia Kazan directing \\"Hot Dog: The Movie.\\" But, on the other hand, it makes Francis Ford Coppola's sins for \\"One From the Heart\\" pale by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the original","review":"The Wiz is not the best version of the Wizard of oz.

In such manner you will enjoy it more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wiz","review":"What a mess this movie is! The charm and innocence of the Broadway production is gone. It's a mean ol' movie full of bad news! Songs omitted or edited out of existence turn this into such a hash that there is nothing to commend it. I directed the stage production at Savannah State University and found it a charming play, full of hope and promise. The movie took all that out. And, when we meet the Wiz, he is pathetic. The Broadway production has him continuing his flim-flam to the very end. Dorothy learns much from all those she meets along the way, but we have an adult Dorothy here -- who should have learned these things when she was 12! The first song of the movie and the play is wonderful. The movie confused the story line of the song so much it was impossible to understand what Aunt Em was singing about. I wish a real Broadway tune smith had done the movie.

I think that Hans Halberstadt did a good job there, yet some chapters seem a little short and do noe quite entirely cover the respective topic. Short eyewitness reports lighten up the reading. Nice book; I caught myself every now and then checking certain things on my HO models, to see if they were there, too.

For a book who claims to be complete! So unless you are going to be an University teacher who wants to specialise in Praying mantids, or is into dissecting them.

Look elsewhere to find the beauty, sadness,and triumph that characterizes this great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"All I can say about this album is WOW!!! I love CESARIA EVORA'S voice and I have other albums by her and I just love them all. This album starts off a little different than the others. The song BIA LULUCHA has that 80's sounding pop sound to it that makes you want to get up and dance. The good thing about his song, is that even with all the rhythms, the music never takes away from her greatest quality which is her voice. No matter the musical arrangements, it is her voice that always stands out on her albums, and it does her also. When you listen to her sing, you can feel all the emotion that she is pouring out and also feel the despair and pain that she is singing about. I think that if you are a serious fan of music, then this is an album that you must add to you collection. I cant find any weak spots and I think all the songs are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have enjoyed Chris Bohjalian's other novels. He usually picks an offbeat topic and sets up a lively family situation surrounding it. However, this novel seems endless, and the main focus gets drowned in wordy descriptions. His dialogue seems stilted and old-fashioned. For all the character development he describes in painstaking detail, you never really get to like any one of them. The book was at least 100 pages too long, and very repetitive. Not his best effort I'm afraid. I will continue to read his other novels, though, as his other novels are more engaging, especially those in first person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a rough draft","review":"The plot is more of a punchline, animal rights activitist shot by his daughter because she thought he was a deer. Irony. The End.The character development was very uneven. Too many details on side characters, not enough depth on the main ones.

All I can say is I tried!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's sad when good authors aren't edited","review":"Oh Chris Bojhalian, your fans must mourn! A good idea, a well-set up plot, but why did you let them rush you to publication? Three-quarters of this book reads like a first draft - overwritten, with more extraneous ideas crammed into a sentence than it needs in a whole page. Explaining the same things over and over, not as drama building hints, but disrespecting your readers' intelligence. We can make the connections ourselves, we can remember what you wrote last chapter. I am sorry I paid money for this book - sorry it is taking up space in my house. If only it had been edited it might actually have been enjoyable to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I have loved Bohjalian's books, every one of them until this one. He really dropped the ball in this novel, as did his editor who allowed all of the parenthetical asides that interrupted any flow he might have established in the narrative. The characters were vapid and unappealing, so unlike the persons of depth readers usually find. The plot was contrived and tedious. It was always a pleaure to learn from Bohjalian's work about a subject totally unfamiliar and surprisingly interesting, like midwifery or alternative medicine or transexuality. The FERAL people were consistently annoying and extreme to a fault. Their abrasive stance made Spencer's \\"accident\\" seem a just dessert for someone so narrow- minded and controlling. I am hopeful that, having purged this novel from his system, Bohjalian will write another that returns him to the ranks of outstanding contemporary authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"well crafted family drama","review":"What happens when a tragic accident rips apart not just a man's shoulder but an entire family? Can people forgive those whose actions lead to needless suffering? Can they forgive themselves for their own weaknesses and shortcomings? Bohjalian has addressed all these questions with such poignancy that they reader cannot help but reflect on his or her own life and circumstances. This novel starts as a page turner, but evolves into a slow and meditative study of human behavior. Each character is so well developed that by the end, you feel as if you know them and care about what happens in their futures. Though there is no real \\"mystery\\" here, as implied by the back cover, there is something very worthwhile. Definitely worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good read","review":"BEFORE YOU KNOW KINDNESS is about a 12 year old girl who shoots her father by accident, causing him to lose all function and feeling in the arm. It is a sad story in many ways, but also shows how tragedy can change people in different and remarkable ways.A large part of the book is dedicated to the animal activist cause. For me, it was pretty radical. The dad who was shot was an avid vegan and animal rights activist. This plays a huge role in the story.I like Bohjalian as an author. I had to learn again that he takes his time and allows the plot to unfold slowly. I did not find this to be a quick read, but it was fascinating and very readable.A good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a terrific book!","review":"I had never read any of Chris Bohjalian's books and probably wouldn't have read this one except for the rave reviews received here at Amazon.I agree with my fellow reviewers that this is a wonderful story told with eloquence and grace. Mr. Bohjalian is a sensitive and talented writer.I enjoyed this book enormously."},{"rating":"1","title":"long story that could be summed up in 1/3 the book.","review":"This book DRAGGED on.

I was tempted to stop reading it several times and never finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugggghhhhhh.....","review":"I was asked to read this book for my job. I started out with high expectations because it was suggested by the community to read. As i go to reading it, i was disgusted on how slow and tiresome it was. I proceded to read it untill i got to chapter 7, and when i found that no plot has even erupted yet. The entire chapter was about a deer. How can a book be seven chapters in, and about 100 pages in, and still have expostition material. this book was terrible and would never suggest to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"It seemed as thought the author kept repeating himself over and over and the book was boring and predictable. Things started to pick up in the last 1/3 of the book and I became more interested. Not as good as Midwives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, no heart","review":"The story is interesting and certainly holds your attention, but it left me cold. There was no heart, no feeling. I could not develop a bit of empathy toward any of the characters. And there was just way too much detail. Who cares what the husband of a minor character such as the EMT does for a living?. I have read most of Bohjalian's other books, and find this one to be atypical of his writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BITTERNESS BEFORE AND FOR KINDNESS NOVEL","review":"Have been a fan of Bohjalian's for years and SKELETONS AT THE FEAST absolutely brilliant. This one was verbose and filled with useless dialogue, description etc. Would have worked if it was for a purpose as in other novels of his, MIDWIVES excellent but this was so tedious I couldn't subject myself to more than a l00 pages and then wondered why I did. Written like a Victorian novel, but this one goes nowhere: no characterization, no plot, no style. Are you sure he wrote it????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one","review":"I've read nearly all of Mr. Bohjalian's books at this point, and BEFORE YOU KNOW KINDNESS is another good entry from this rather prolific author. His novels tend to have well-drawn characters who are faced with a major crisis, decision, or ethical dilemma. They're good people dealing with the difficulties of life.I've always found his novels to be gripping, compelling, and realistic. You really believe that the stories could happen, and his characters react in all-too-human ways. Sometimes this type of novel can stretch the bounds of belief, with outsized scenarios or one-dimensional characters, but Mr. Bohjalian rarely disappoints.BEFORE YOU KNOW KINDNESS is a good read - pick it up and spend a few hours with these characters. You'll feel that you know them, and you'll feel for them, before you know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Read","review":"Droll but dull, this book ultimately leaves the reader flat, as if waiting for the long belabored point. Written with great technical acumen, endlessly trite observations never seem to take root and the result is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I cannot believe that so many people really enjoyed this book. Bohjalian's characters are, to a person, humorless and unlikeable, and his storytelling is weirdly gory and dry. A waste of time. Any single John Irving novel would be better and along the same lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, I got rid of the book","review":"I'm a fan of Bohjalian's work, so it was a huge disappointment for me to rank this book as just 1 star. It was horrid. There were a few parts that captured my attention and moved beautifully. And there were a couple of others that were written with true talent. But for the most part, the book was filled with information that went nowhere, characters so flat and boring I couldn't care less about them, and a plot that, at the end of the book, made me say out loud, \\"That's it?!?\\" Some reviewers say it was a compelling family drama, and to that, I would have agreed IF Bohjalian didn't constantly lead the reader into believing there was something bigger around the corner, on the next page, in the next chapter. The book, as a whole, was a huge disaster for me. Long, pointless and with shallow characters. This novel went right to the library's used book sale as soon as I was done. And since I keep every single book I've read that I even mildly enjoyed, that's saying something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"The only character in this novel who isn't flat and stereotypical in the grandmother, and she is just a slightly younger fictionalized version of Katharine Hepburn. There is very little action to move the plot (and I use the term \\"plot\\" loosely) forward, just endless inner monologues of each character's views on animal rights. It's also repetitive and very poorly edited. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"This is the fourth book of Chris Bohjalian's that I have read and I will continue to read other offerings by him, but I must admit, halfway through this book I was thinking about all the other good books I have piled up on my bookshelf that I am waiting to read. Mr. Bohjalian is a wonderful portrayer of the family drama and these are the parts of this book, of all his books that I like the best. But, I don't go for too much of anything and Spencer's fanatical animal rights activist character was just too much for me. The last 100 or so pages of this book were the best because they showed how the family endured and dealt with such a senseless tragedy, and, I think Spencer was able to finally realize and take responsibility his views and how the affected every one of his family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"a stunner","review":"Love this book. This is by far Chris Bohjalian's best so far - characters are memorable and human. I have been using it as my long term book and love coming back to it after my quick reads. I was in the midst of it during the Newtown shootings and had to put it down for a few weeks as the topic matter raised some emotions that were too raw. Now I believe it is adding some much needed perspective. A fantastic book on the matter of gun control, animal rights, families and how far a person's beliefs can go before those beliefs, however well-intentioned, start to dehumanize the humans who are most affected."},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't know something what i can say","review":"hallo leute, ich spreche (schreibe) leider nicht gut englisch aber ich versuche es ;-) i like the Onions since i heard it the first time in the film \\" sie nannten ihn Muecke\\" it was a film about a footballteam with young boys out the bronx or somewere else. in my town i can't get the CD's so i ask you about them. the best greetings from l.kramer@ob.kamp.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for anyone interested in filmmaking!","review":"At last a book about the real process of screenwriting. Not just about \\"format\\" and \\"formula,\\" Screenwriting from the Heart provides a step-by-step method by which any writer-- novice or veteran-- can write a rich and engaging screenplay. Mr. Ryan gives a craft to practice, a path to follow, and the tools needed. Beginning with the fundamentals of storytelling, the book uses personal experience and contemporary film examples to illustrate how a writer conceives a story and develops the detail that makes complex and compelling characters that lead to first-rate films. Character development serves as the means through which a screenplay is written-- rather than plot, like most screenwriting books suggest. Nurturing pointers, useful exercises, and cinematic lessons are sprinkled throughout. Buy it, digest it, mark it up, digest it again, mark it again. This book will become an old friend you'll turn to over and over for guidance and inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"Really enjoyed this book as a beginning screenwriter.

He is mad at everyone it seems until he finds out that not being the richest man in town isn't everything. Of course there are some bad guys over at a neighboring ranch, but they play into a minor secondary story that correlates with the main one with Ben Justin and his family.

I'm not into loud, thrashing albums, and if you are, then this album will hold great appeal to you. Beck changed drummers from Micky Waller on \\"Truth\\" to Tony Newman on \\"Beck-Ola\\" and it was a change for the worse. This is a loud, loud album, no matter what volume setting you choose. Beck's guitar thrashings and Newman's pounding drums completely overpower Rod Stewart on most of the songs. The only song I would want to hear again is \\"Girl from Mill Valley\\", which is a lovely piano instrumental by Nicky Hopkins. \\"All Shook Up\\" is okay. The rest of the album gave me a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wait soo long for it","review":"i wait soo long for it, and came without a book... it is a pity. what can i tell more, what could happen different?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Beck Group - 'Beck-Ola' (Sony) 4 1/2 stars","review":"Band's second stellar effort, first gracing our ears in 1969. His second of two lp's with Rod Stewart and Ron Wood on board. Definitely a classic from that era. Tunes here I got into the most were the rocking \\"Spanish Boots\\", \\"Plyuth\\", the hard-rocking (sort to speak) seven-minute \\"Rice Pudding\\" and the two Elvis covers (actually do a nice job) \\"All Shook Up\\" and \\"Jailhouse Rock\\". I've read a few blogs, comments, reviews, etc. about this CD reissue and it's been noted that at the time this lp was released, Beck was REALLY trying to sort of (in his own way) compete with Page - with Zeppelin fast becoming a rock & roll giant at the same time Clapton was with Cream. Nonetheless, a lot of Jeff Beck fans will tell you he may not be a 'huge' of a household name as those other two former Yardbird's guitarists, but he is still truly a brilliant musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another nice expansion on a great old Beck/Stewart album","review":"Jeff Beck/ Beck-Ola/ Cosa Nostra (bonus tracks): This album (and its previous disk, \\"Truth\\") is one of the best vehicles for Rod Stewart's voice.

I confess that I am not a fan of Jeff Beck's later solo albums, but the work he does with Stewart here is just magnificent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"I was so excited to find this item on line.

Precocious and dramatic, Adrian is surrounded by a world that is at a loss as to how to deal with him. His ignorance of his own ability to rub people the wrong way veers wildly between hilarious and infuriating.By the time you get to the end of The Wilderness Years, something special happens. Adrian is finally starting to grow into himself (we hope), and perhaps he'll be a bit more at ease in the world in books to come. We can only keep reading and find out for ourselves. This volume is special for being able to offer us some previously-unreleased looks into Adrian's life, and it makes the whole story that much more entertaining. Well worth the almost 800 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Food to Octogeniarian","review":"I was raised on pretzels since my mom was from Pennsylvania Dutch country.

I remember learning about World War I briefly in history classes in school, but what I learned then were basically details behind what started the war and the countries involved. This film really brought the war to life and highlighted the tragic life loss. It was at times difficult to hear the stories and young ages of some of the soldiers who lost their lives in such a violent end. This documentary provided a very detailed account of the war and poignantly reminds the viewer how different our lives would be today, had the outcome of World War I been different."},{"rating":"1","title":"mistake in ordering","review":"did not notice this pet tab had calcium, previously bought pet tabs without the extra calcium she loved them.

Great for teens and young folks (who don't need supervision in the kitchen). Instructions were straight forward and the end result turned out great! Highly recommended.First step involved boiling the tapioca pearls. Just make sure you have enough (if not additional water in the pot). Because of the excess starches, these pearls need room to expand and soak. Don't over cook.After drained and cooled, you make (shake) the packet ingredients. Our favorite was strawberry, but Mango came in a close second. Have not tried the tarrot yet (fear of the unknown).We even tried standard lemonade (our own making) with the bubble pearls and it was good as well.Don't forget to get extra straws. You can't suck these pearls through standard sippy straws.Happy bubbling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and Easy","review":"This kit is so cool!

My workplace (a hospital) uses almost exclusively HP monitors very similar to this, and they use them for x-rays ect. The resolution is very adequate, the size is excellent, and the adjustabilty of the monitor (up, down, and forward/back) is nice. This would be a good monitor to buy for everyday use, and is still good as a light gamer too.Update: It is now June 23rd,2011 and I want to report that this monitor was still going strong for me until I accidently got wires confused and power surged it with a look alike power adapter for my speakers after I moved it into another room. After almost 7 years, it's dead at my own hand, not of it's doing. RIP, was a great monitor, highly reccomended. I really miss the adjustable stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"monitor has flickering lines through it","review":"[UPDATE: Exchanged monitor and has been great since]I got this monitor for Christmas and it has lines running throught and real faint color changes. When you move the cursor or look closely you can see flickering lines throughout the display. My wife got this from Circuit City so I'll be taking it back when it opens. I tried all of the settings, installed the driver, etc. and no help. It only got worse the longer it was on. I am taking the computer to my brother's to see if his monitor works on it.

The bag is made of a nice, soft material and it's a really cute pattern. I love how many different ways you can carry it or hook it to the stroller, but the only qualm I have about the bag is i wish it was stiffer so I could keep the baby items more organized and structured.

I definitely would NOT pay full price for this bag though."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a great bag","review":"I searched for a diaper bag and thought that this would be \\"the one\\". First off it is soft and the material is really cute, however, the material is very soft and the bag has no structure. You have to use two hands to get anything out of it. Another thing I didn't like is the quality of the bag. I am comparing it to a Ju-Ju-Be bag that I did end up with. I unwrapped this bag and held it for a minute then wrapped it up and took it to the PO to send it back. I would not recommend this bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag for style and function!","review":"I love my bag! I'm expecting my fifth child, and I've learned quite a bit about what I want in a diaper bag, and this fits the bill.

The best part for me was knowing the ending was near."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic characterization against a background of the Blitz","review":"Christopher Hyde has drawn an amazing fictional plot against a background of real-life characters and actual events. This marriage provides a novel that holds the reader in thrall from beginning to end. It is fascinating to see the story unfold through the eyes of its unlikely hero - and to suddenly realize that you are meeting actual characters from the London of World War Two throughout the pages! The historical detail is accurate and a delight to read, giving added depth to this intricate tale. I would recommend it to anyone interested in WWII, or psychological thrillers, or spy stories ...... as it combines a little of each within its covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense war-time mystery.....at times TOO intense","review":"This is one of the best-written and most logically thought out mysteries I have ever read. Mr. Hyde has obviously done his homework, and knows exactly how to keep the suspense at a consistently high level throughout the book. I'm very tempted to buy another of his books, although I understand from the critics' reviews that this book is something of a change of pace for Mr. Hyde, and so I'm a little unsure about it. I would have given the book five stars, except for the items already mentioned in other reviews (a second autopsy on a body, the VERY detailed descriptions of what happens during a bombing raid), and the very intense description of the killer's home toward the end of the book - up until then I was reading each page very slowly, but I sped through this part - it really turned my stomach.But that aside, this one heckuva good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's a good block set","review":"The lair is good for people who like blocks.

They don't stay connected at all and the entire thing was always in several pieces. The boys would try to play with it and everything just kept falling apart. The little balcony is a joke, just kept falling down when they placed a turtle figure on it. The \\"rip cord\\" wouldn't stay attached to the fence thing, so the turtle figures couldn't slide down it. It looks good on tv, but is just horribly fabricated.

Absolutely not for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"DODGE THIS LIKE A BULLET -------->","review":"Larry Clark you brave man. The cover of this DVD says \\"THE FUTURE S*CKS\\", it should have said something else like \\"THIS MOVIE S*CKS\\". One of the worse films I've seen in recent years. I have one simple question. WHY? Now I'll go on and tell you the pro's & con's. Let's start with the numerous CON'S.. 1. The acting is terrible, Will any of these actors work again? 2. Director Larry Clark's idea was good. However, he obviously didn't have the ability to put it all together. I have to scrutinize his future projects. 3. Stan Winston must have been working on Clark's budget, the F/X are not Stan Winston quality. 4. I care not to see a bunch of teenagers run around naked for an hour and a half. This is something that you can count on from Mr. Clark, being that all of his films are loaded with it. I could go on and on explaining how BAD this movie is, but I think you got it. Now for the PRO'S.. oh, sorry my mind just went blank."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is up there with the Rocky Horror picture show!","review":"It's amazing to see anyone rate this movie with even one star - this was literally worse than the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

While the story made the path for a OK movie, it failed on its objective. When the kids get caught in the storm and just wake up and are clothed and all lying on eachother, it just does not seem real. The effects are somewhat korny and the graphic nudity and violence show its a Clark film. Drugs, alcohol,sex, and caveman. Not a great mix and this movie shows that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Real Larry Clark reveals himself...","review":"Don't expect good horror or sci-fi here as Larry Clark concentrates primarily on sex scenes.For years he's made sleazy films like Kids and Bully under the guise of teaching people a lesson about the youth of today.With no moral lessions to hide behind in Teenage Caveman it's crystal clear what REALLY intersts Clark the most.This movie may appeal to some in a guilty pleasure way but the \\"plot\\" padded out with sleaze is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"For prehistoric pea-brains only","review":"Creature Features remake of an old Roger Corman quickie in which a group of outcast teens are taken under the wing of two \\"superbeings\\" who have ulterior motives, but this fact is not made clear to the youths because there is plenty of drugs and sex available.TEENAGE CAVEMAN has none of the cheesy camp which makes other Creature Features enjoyable. The movie is directed by Larry Clark who made KIDS and ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE (Hopefully his movie BULLY is released in NZ soon. See my SPCS list for details). I don't understand how some reviewers made such a big deal over the movie's sex scenes. They're not explicit or anything, it's just your average run of the mill T&A; stuff. Whoopee.In spite of a couple of good gore scenes and female nudity, all this movie succeeds in doing is making the viewer want to track down a copy of the 50s version. TEENAGE CAVEMAN is far below Clark's abilities as a director. A real shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"RENT IT!","review":"This film has no small amount of controversy surrounding it but if you strip that away all your left with is a pedestrian bland movie. Perhaps it is supposed to be shocking just like all uber-darling Larry Clarks movies but to be honest you could see worse in HBO shows like Oz or Six Feet Under and at least those are worth the effort. I could ramble on about the sub Mad Max 3 plot or the characters but hey lifes too short. Which was something I realised after wasting 2 hours of my life watching this. To make matters worse I actually bought it on DVD as it was the only way to catch it in the UK. Don't make the same mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for fans of Larry Clark.","review":"I bought this video strictly because I am a fan of Larry Clark. I was disappointed in that it is not at all like his other films. It is basically a sci-fi/horror film. As such, it has merit, but that is not a genre I am particularly interested in. Do not by this based on Clark's other films. You will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's horror alright, but not as intended","review":"Thank God this was a rental. This \\"horror film\\" is neither \\"horror\\" nor a \\"film\\". 50% of the 90 min run time was drug scenes and sex crazed drinking. NO PLOT, NO DIALOGUE, NO......ANYTHING. Just put a half dozen teenagers in a room, give them booze and cocaine and watch them have sex. That is all that happened for 45 minutes. I am totally convinced that their was no script for this movie. Almost every line seemed to be improvised. Its almost as if the director told the kids to \\"just wing it\\". The ONLY scene in this film that even resembled horror was the finale. And it was so laughable done that it bordered on comedy.One bright spot though was some of the acting. Forgive me for not knowing the names of these youngsters but the main bad guy/monster was an EXCELLENT actor. He had the look and delivery of someone that didnt belong in this film. His character was a bit annoying though. But this young man should be in better work than \\"Teenage Caveman\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy for the nudity claimed by other reviewers","review":"Basically nothing but an R rated movie, the usual BS about it being unrated to make you think it's better than a movie you might see on Skinimax, which it's not even close.

It was a typically cheap production for American International Pictures but it did benefitfrom some interesting ideas and a surprise ending which pre-dates Planet of the Apes by a decade. The new version barely uses anything from the original other than the title. It is one of the longest 100 minutes I haveever spent watching a movie. There is nothing, I repeat, NOTHING even remotely redeeming about this film.I found a copy for $3 and even then I felt ripped off after I had watched it.

In general, he's right: McDermott was born a Scot in Glasgow. In fact his mother's family -- which came originally not from Dublin but from Ballymeena, near Belfast, in Northern Ireland -- had been in Scotland for several generations before John was born. But his father emigrated to Scotland from Bunnygee in Donegal, in Ulster but a part of the Republic. So by heritage on both sides McDermott is definitely Irish.Besides, Irish and Scots are the same tribe anyway, speaking basically the same language and sharing centuries of history. The Romans' name for the Irish was \\"Scoti,\\" after all, and that Irish treasure, the Book of Kells, was probably begun on the Scottish isle of Iona.

The new version of \\"Young Hearts Run Free,\\" while inferior to the original, is infinitely more danceable. It's nowhere near as terrific as \\"Love On Love,\\" \\"What Do You Want and \\"Love Has Come To Stay\\" -- all of which are dancefloor stormers -- and \\"Outside In\\", a terrific midtempo ballad with crystalline production. \\"You're Still the Lightning,\\" written by vastly underrated dance diva Billie Ray Martin, is also a highlight. Don't miss this record, which has inexcusably remained unreleased in the U.S. Do make sure to get the UK import; the Japanese version doesn't include \\"You Got The Love.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all those waiting for a Candi Staton secular disc","review":"After seventeen years, Candi's back! James Horracks and Thomas Foley of React Records in London persuaded Candi to record a secular CD, and it's GREAT! Excellent arrangements, and songs with lyrics she could agree to (all songs have a message, some more subtle than others). My personal favorite is the opening track, \\"Love Yourself,\\" though \\"Outside In,\\" \\"Love on Love\\" (written for Candi by Boy George), and a millenium remake of \\"Young Hearts Run Free,\\" are all excellent. Great music here! Totally worth the import price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined one of my all-time favorite film creations","review":"If you liked, 14.)A Bolt From the Blue (episode 77713), you may be disappointed as I at the ending of this, for me, most incredible stories - what on earth $$$, I know, paying royalties, motivated the producers to change the music in Northern Exposure?! Phooey on them. They ruined the ending of this episode, and deserve to rot in media hell! And I hope they get audited by the IRS as well. And have sleepless nights. And...dumb, stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Season!","review":"I love Season Five of Northern Exposure, it might even be my favorite, and would say that this set is definitely worth the price (especially if, like me, you feel the need to re-view the series in its totality every so often)--after all, it's the second to last season in the series, so you can still pretend that it'll go on forever while you watch:) Also, we have a lot of great episodes here. Some of my favorites are \\"A River Doesn't Run Through It, which includes a guest appearance by an adorable young Jack Black, \\"Fish Story,\\" where we see Holling's artistic side come through in paint-by-number form, and \\"The Gift of the Maggie,\\" where Maggie shows her affection for Joel in a very sweet, though slightly misunderstood (by Joel) way. This is a wonderful set, full of all the quirks and sweetness that any Northern Exposure fan loves and expects."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am NE junkie","review":"This is TV at it's best. There has been and probably will always be mostly bad programming on television. Occasionally something gets aired that is great quality from many different angles, in my mind Northern Exposure arises to that level. I'm not saying it's the best of all, but it is so far above most of the drivel that has ever been produced it could be used as a bar setter. The series is consistent from beginning to end. They move the focus around giving each character their time under the microscope, story lines run the gamut from intriguing to bizarre ... always simultaneous story lines with an underlying theme that might take some work to ferret out. All the characters are well developed and mostly likeable. TV needs more product of this quality - always."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Show!!!!!","review":"The bottom line is that if you love Northern Exposure, you will love this DVD. For years reruns were televised on A&E and the Hallmark channel, luckily about the time they stopped televising them these DVDs came out. This is one of the best shows out there. Lately they have put every nonsense show ever televised. It is good to see this one produced on DVD. I have never watched an episode that didn't make me feel better than I did before I watched it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norhtern Exposure 5","review":"Love it! Will never regret it!

The many charcaters made this special."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series really ended with Season 4","review":"It became fairly obvious that by the time Season Five rolled around, that the producers had either found new writers,or the original writers had lost all initiative, or the job was outsourced to India. This was evident by the loss of personality of the cast, the lack of interlacing between the characters that was the key to the success of the original script. The absence of Rob Morrow was sadly missed, he was one of the nails that held the vehicle together, and a short appearance here and there hardly enough to continue on .Congratulations to the producers of Seinfeld and others ,that knew enough to quit on a high note."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the disks arrived damaged (warped)","review":"One of the disks was warped, hence the player rejected it.

She is also one of the bravest missionaries that I have ever heard of."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful recording","review":"I might be a little biased- this was the first version of \\"chess\\" that I listened to, so I naturally became accustomed to the vocal subtleties inherent in this particular recording... I've come to believe that these subtleties are essential to what makes this recording so lucidly memorable.None of the recordings have thrilled me the way this one has. I love that it's live- you can feel the energy of the performers as well as the audience; also, certain performances and tracks off of this album are undeniably outstanding. \\"Pity the Child\\" is a moving and powerful performance, \\"Nobody's Side\\" is a ballad that would incite bitterness from the most optimistic of us, and, above all, \\"Endgame\\" is absolutely convincing and heart-wrenching: its buildups and climaxes are powerfully visceral.This musical is underrated and underperformed, and this is the best version of the soundtrack I've come across."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I have the Broadway, London versions of the CD's and I have heard the Austrailian cast. The cast is almost perfect with Tommy Korberg playing the Russian and Anders Glenmark (who was an Ambrosian singer in the London Album) does an ok job at the American however isn't the greatest. The Arbiter and Florence are incredible and the Arbiter is a rival to the London version's. An overall great CD with great singers and chorus and especially orchestra, however I give this album a 4 star and not five because of the Americans tendancy to butcher certain songs although he does superb on most of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Musical in the Greatest Way","review":"Chess introduced me to the possibilities of pop music in musical theatre when I first heard (and then performed) the piece back in 1993. Yet even then, I had no idea of the possibilities with this score. These are the best performances I've yet heard, and I love the larger orchestrations. Special kudos to \\"Pity the Child\\", which FINALLY has its much-needed soul and emotional impact and to \\"Soviet Machine\\" - it's a wonder why this was not a part of the Broadway version with changed lyrics like everything else (but then again Richard Nelson didn't know what he was doing, I fear). Anyway, this is a must-have for the musical theatre Grandmaster or the Novice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chess in concert (1994 Swedish Concert Cast)","review":"I've recently finished performing the musical chess, and i found this album to be alot more entertaining. Soviet Machine is featured on this album unlike the 1986 album. The Soviet Machine would have to be my favourite song in the Musical. It's worth Buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch guitar playing.","review":"Well, everyone is correct by saying this album is AMAZING, but I just wanted to make a little side comment. I saw the release date here at Amazon, and it says 1998... well, that's the \\"commercial\\" release date, because this album was recorded and \\"released\\" actually in 1993 or 1994, and it was sent as a gift to suscribers of a guitar magazine, I forgot which one. I first heard this album in 1994 and was blown away by it. By the way, on the first song, Reb Beach plays all instruments if I'm not mistaken."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"ONE OF THE BEST PURE GUITARISTS ALBUMS OUT THERE!! HEAR FOR YOURSELF!!

The songs all sound as if they are slight variations of the same theme: \\"Look how fast I can play\\". No interesting ideas, just fast, repeated riffs. There are so many talented guitar players out there, I can't imagine why anyone would want to waste their time listening to this cd. The previous reviewers thought it was good - maybe to a pre-pubescent kid with a brand new electric guitar, but to any with even slightly mature taste, this offers nothing but a headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price, Quick Shipping","review":"I was very happy with the condition of the book I purchased.

I am 27 and at this point I don't have the ability that most 8 year-olds have to just pick up a video game and intuitively know how to play.The graphics are fun and colorful and the characters look great.

Clinical Depression is a muddy area, wherein the biological and psychological often overlap. The fact is, a normally healthy and happy woman can descend into a severe postpartum depression, and depressive disorders often run in families.

I had difficulty finding it. I hope it comes out on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is boring","review":"I find this movie boring. Sure Richard Williams spent many years working on it and it still doesn't impress me.I saw the Recobbled cut a while ago and I was no more impressed with the Recobbled cut than I was with this version.

Everytime we went to Blockbuster we would rent it. The stunning scenery and plot capture your attention and keep it. Plus the funny monologues of the Thief make you laugh until your stomach hurts. Seriously he is the best character. I think this is a really good children's movie and I don't really think they care about how many times it's been redone and stuff. No offense.The new songs in it are okay too. The first ones are a bit sappy and Princess Yum Yum can't dance, but the brigands song is the best. I can't comprehend why everyone is making such a big fuss and are rating only one star.Anyway for someone who's looking for something to entertain and occupy their kids I definately recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Movie","review":"The animation is very very poor and quite ugly but the story is entertaining and the thief is super hillarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I have owned the Thief and the Cobbler since it was first released on VHS, and both my children have watched it over and over and over. PLUS all their friends ask to borrow the tape because we seem to be the only people that bought it when it was in wide distribution. But this is not JUST a kids film, it has plenty of duel meanings to keep an older audience snickering. It's animation style is unique among children's film, and though it does have some dark parts to it, I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone since it is a film the children never seem to tire of. I can't wait until it's on DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO WIDESCREEN?

I can see why people gave it such bad reviews... you have to be somewhat intelligent to enjoy this movie, or at least be appreciative of art. The way the characters interacted with the scenery was very intuitive. For a good comparison, it reminded me of Aladdin on an acid trip. Once again, you have to appreciate the subtleties in the animation and the whole \\"weirdness\\" of some of the scenes. I give it 4 stars because it obviously has some flaws, but if you watch it with the intent to be awed rather than criticize you will love this movie. In fact I'm about to bring it to a friend's house to watch it with a bunch of guys that are 17-20 years old, to give you an idea that this isn't just a kid's movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"The story line is great, the graphics are amazing, the acting is well done, but I bought the inexpensive DVD version and it is totally out of focus.

The same price for half as much stuff is a COMPLETE rip off. And they are wondering why they are losing so many customers to streaming and downloading over dvd's? Viz is the crappiest and slooooooowest production company for an anime....if they really are wanting more money, then they should release only subbed versions as soon as they're able (yes many of us would rather have subbed versions quickly than waiting half our lives for a season to be dubbed by your snail of a company) and then re-release the subbed versions with the dubs, like they already do, twice the money, and no pissed off consumers."},{"rating":"2","title":"why viz media why","review":"ok i my self have been collecting the bleach box sets on a regular basest and all of them rite up to the first part of the aranncar ark have been worth there sticker price but at the regular price of 50$ viz is crazy to think we would pay that at full pricenot much on bonus features here this is how i decide on buy this box set is it cheaper then buying the dvds one by one well with a sell for 30$ its still cheaper then paying 20$ a dvd viz go back to 5 disc box sets please it is such a better deal then what your doing now"},{"rating":"1","title":"Viz is a disgrace","review":"Bleach is one of my favorite shows, but this method of releasing it is bull. All of the real fans already bought either the singles (like I did) or the season sets, and wanted to complete the series in the same format. Canceling both of those lines to produce this cheaply packaged piece of trash is the most disgraceful, greedy thing I've seen an anime distributor do.I urge you to avoid supporting Viz at this point; tell them that being inconsistent (Bleach) and canceling shows altogether (Monster, Hikaru No Go) is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the money guys","review":"Once again viz is getting greedy. I bought season's 1-3 of bleach because I love the show and want to support the industry, but this is bs. They split the season in half just as they did for season 4. Now it does end right before a block of filler episodes, but that doesn't make it ok at all. I say wait till viz is forced to sell it as a whole season, if enough people say no to this garbage they will."},{"rating":"2","title":"agreed, they are being greedy","review":"Bleach is one of my favorite shows but this is such BS 37 dollars with a list price of 50 bucks for 12 episodes!

The previous set (The Assult) that concluded the Bounts was getting tiresome. Right off the start, box set 6 feels like season 1-3. The action is powerful, character building pulls you in (Ichigo's dad and Ikkaku!), and the humor had me rolling a few times.Again, if you can get past the price, and you liked seasons 1-3, you will not be disappointed watching box set 6. On pure watching value this is a 5 star. By it and enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear God, Cure them of their Greed","review":"At first glance, looking at the packaging, I had no idea this product was a \\"season\\". Bestbuy, a major seller of DVDs, admitted that DVDs are a dying medium so why then would a company decide to jack up the cost of their DVDs? Greed? Yes, however there is a bigger issue. There is an unwillingness to lower cost and adapt to growing demands of online availability such as Netflix on Xbox 360. Instead of going digital, they jack up costs and force individuals to illegally stream repeat episodes on the internet.These anime/manga companies need to re-evaluate where they put their money. Check on sales of manga, of monthly manga magazines, of licensed merchandise. A lot of the consumers in this market are young, so why charge prices that require a salary?"},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad day","review":"So we find that now they are going to release the DVDs in 12 episode installments but with the price at roughly the same you can purchase the original seasons. The original 3 seasons had more episodes, more features, more artwork... its pretty ridiculous. I pre-ordered this item and was so disappointed when this arrived instead of the full 6th season. If they continue down this path, they will no longer get my money, and that's the end of that. Funny thing is, it doesn't stop me from watching them on hulu.

Edward G. Robinson shines in his role as a mild-mannered bank clerk who gets involved with the wrong people. The story is thoroughly engrossing and embodies everything that you would expect from a film noir (and maybe some things you wouldn't). This is also the first American film from Fritz Lang that I've seen. It's definately interesting to see a proven master tackle American genre film; and the results, as one would imagine, are quite stellar."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Fritz Lang Film Noir","review":"A very dark and interesting film noir tale in true black and white.

Who cares if it isn't like the book of the other movie. What makes a movie good is that it isn't boring and cheezey like and from the stone age. This movie defenitly met those requrements.

Guy Pierce is bored with the role and the movie does not resemble the novel at all. Eveything takes place in America instead of England. I really thought it was a total joke, boring, and had a horrible ending. He never goes back to see his friend Filby to tell him good bye. I thought that Simon Wells was a horrible director and should be ashame of taking such a classic and tearing it to pieces. Don't even purchase this movie, waist of money and time. Amazon is making me give this move 1 start and it doesn't even deserve that!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Time Machine that wastes it instead of gains.","review":"Although the writer of Time Machine had a good idea, he failed to follow it through the end. Which left us the audience with one word on our now befuddled minds. Huh?Yes Huh, for I couldn't make heads or tails of the movie, and boredom that ran through my foggy brain didn't help any. Yes the CGI was good, but does computer enhanced graphics really make up for bad story plots? The answer no, as this movie clearly shows us.A true rendition of H.G Wells story this is not, and for fans of his works I have to say don't bother with this movie. Wait a few more years until someone gets the right idea on how to follow through with Well's original story."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING to do with Wells' work!","review":"Once again a big FX budget makes dishwater of an excellent story. Although the 1960 version was romanced up and the ending made more blithe than the original book, it was --at heart--more true to Wells' work. Wells' story, however, is brilliant. From the UN-NAMED main characters to the horrific image at the story's close, the tale is a gripper. WHY OH WHY can't any director simply take a good story and let it tell itself? This version is laughable, pot-boiler, silly at times, and so full of over FX and over made up villains (who do NOT exist in a person in the orig.) that I nearly puked. I walked out on this film in the theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Unfortunately I cannot rate the DVD itself as I, happily, do not own it. I have, however, had the misfortune of seeing the movie and can say without a trace of remorse that this movie is abyssmal. There are so many solid time travel movies around. From the cryptic, beautiful, and thought provoking 12 Monkeys to the light-heartedness of movies like Back to the Future and Tenchi Muyo in Love. Even Terminator 2 had fewer plot holes or, at the least, excuses itself from reality with genuine entertainment. I can't recommend this movie less, even with it's stunning special effects and reasonable cast. Guy Pearce and Jeremy Irons are usually dependable fellows but they seem to be stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story. Great Movie!","review":"I've never seen the original Time Machine versions before, but I absolutely loved this movie. I am of course a big fan of special effects, but the story is fascinating! I've watched the movie several times, and every single time I'm blown away. The story line is inspirational and imaginative and knows no bounds. You'll continue to wonder where the story will end up. If you love science fiction and have a fascination for time travel, then add this movie to your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get It And Judge for Yourselves","review":"Well, I've read some of the negative reviews and cannot agree with them. Granted, some people prefer the original 60's movie to this one, particularly if they were kids and easily impressed. But just because a movie's old, doesn't mean it's THE BEST version.Concerning the question of intellect, both are geared towards the medium intellect of the general populus. That said, it is still a well done, well acted movie. What would H.G. have thought of the job Simon did? There's no way of knowing.Folks, there DO exist movies that out-do the original. This is one of those movies...it bests the original in the acting, the script--the whole production. Get both versions and judge for yourselves. They are both reasonably priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've got nothing better to do","review":"This is a remake of a pretty good 1960 film version of the H G Wells story. Guy Pierce stars in the leading role. Now Guy Pierce isn't a bad actor, but here is given an impossible job. At the start of the film he is the obsessed Prof. Hartdegen who just happens to on the verge of building a time machine. He has a sweetheart of course and after an evening in the park he has recourse to use the machine. From then on its downhill all the way as Hartdegen changes from a somewhat reclusive Prof. into an Indiana Jones type character.Add to this magical transformation a frequently vomit-making musical soundtrack and overall you have a film that really should only be watched if you have nothing better to do. There are worse films for sure, but this certainly lacks any of the charm of the original and has even less to with the book. Result - only buy if they are giving it away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point?","review":"I rented this movie thinking it was going to be enjoyable, boy was I wrong. The special effects were cool, but the story went nowhere. I usually can follow plots and storylines, even the really complex ones, but this one was beyond me. Maybe I'm wrong, but I highly encourage you not to buy, rent or see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Time' to Sleep","review":"H.G. Wells' classic novel has been brought to the big screen again, but by his great-grandson. The special effects are dazzling, but the movie moves slower than watching turtles fight. I must have dozed off during this movie because I got maybe five hours of sleep and it was still on when I woke up. Guy Pearce plays the professor who tried to save his girlfriend's life twice, but he went into the future instead to fight ugly things called Morlocks. Samantha Mumba doesn't sing, \\"Baby Come On Over,\\" but tries to sound intelligent instead. I felt like I was getting older watching this movie. Gray hair and all, I now use a cane to walk around. If you're looking for excitement, then rent a lordage movie. If you want to sleep like a rock, then watch this movie. Insomniacs pay attention!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did he read the book?","review":"This is not a good movie at all. I honestly believe Simon Wells did not read the book his grandfather wrote! He looked up a 5 sentence outline of the book and filled in the rest with his ideas.Now the movie included some special effects, but I don't agree with the majority who say that they are so amazing.If you have not read the book, this movie may appeal to you, because you have no idea what the story is all about.I have read reviews that the book could not be made into a good movie, so this adaptation is good. However I completely disagree. The book is much more compelling with much better imagery than the movie includes.Skip the movie, read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"was this a 'Made for TV' movie?","review":"I missed this film when it was in the theaters, and finally added it to my Netflix queue this past weekend, only to be disappointed. In the initial scenes during the late 1800's, the scenery and the time machine itself looked good, and I had no complaints. But then the \\"future\\" scenes and cheap visual effects started coming, culminating in a not-so-tribal group of future homosapiens where, apparently, makeup and hip hair fashion will still be of utmost importance. And for a tribe of regularly roughed-up, victims-of-underground-dwelling-cannibals, their outfits wouldn't be so clean-pressed. I think this film was mis-labeled from the low-budget Saturday afternoon movie on the WB that it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"HG Wells would have used a time machine","review":"I think H.G. Wells would have used his time machine to travel forward into the future to stop the making of this disappointment. What a horrible thing to do to a classic. The original story line, coupled with modern special effects would have been a real masterpiece.

Only in this film a large chunk is devoted to a pre-story trying to explain why Guy Pearce invents the time machine in the first place.This film has many stupid plot twists - why would a cannibalistic Morlock let Guy Pearce walk away (instead of eating him perhaps)?Even the star, Guy Pearce said that this film is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This movie was just plain old bad and it cost 122 million dollars to make! Where did all that money go? I think it went to the bad special effects and the futuristic scenes. Everything in the movie to me looked really fake. The acting was okay that could have been worse. If your looking for a good movie try the original Time Machine in 1960, It was more interesting and didn't rely on special effects to be exciting. I don't recommend this movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"With all the hype this movie had, it was one of the biggest disappointments ever.

And Jeremy Irons doing his Edgar Winters impression as the smartest Warlock I've ever seen.This movie starts out so perfect, and the effects are INCREDIBLE, but the film dies upon Guy Pierce waking among the Eloi, where the Old Language just happens to be perfect English. No learning curve. PUHLEASE!So what would you do upon waking in the future? ASK WHERE YOUR DAMN MACHINE IS!!!! He doesn't. Instead, he melds with the Eloi.And then, the movie grabs me with the absolutely perfect warlock graphics!Perhaps I am too emerged in the greatness of the original Rod Taylor classic, but I have to say rent tis movie. If for nothing else, for Jeremy Irons. He deserves a supporting actor award here.But to be real, don't buy it. rent it.This review does not go into the plot.

(Missed Titanic at the theaters too.) When I did see it, I was amazed and entranced. The sound tract was hauting and beautiful.

It started out OK, but quickly went down-hill from there. Too many unnecessary liberties were taken from the original story. I would love for Hollywood to produce a version of The Time Machine which is faithful to the original story. George Pal did an OK job for that time period, but I expected so much more from a modern-day film. The destruction of the moon sequence was so totally unbelievable, the Jeremy Irons part was pathetic, the fact that 21st Century American/English was spoken 800,000 years in the future was plain ridiculous and the omition of the climax of the book, where the main character travels forward in time, was a huge let-down. My advice is to skip this one altogther, watch the George Pal version again, and pray the Peter Jackson remakes this film properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good CGI - OK plot","review":"This movie had some good CGI effects. The plot idea sounded promising but the movie is alittle disappointing. Most of the movie takes place in what is supposed to be the future. The problem is, the future looks like the dinasour age with cave-people. I really expected the future to be HIGH-TECH but instead it's CAVE-MEN in huts. So the premise is the ice-age, an astroid or some event completely kills off most of the people and cities on Earth and then everything starts evolving over again. The main character ends up surrounded by primitive people with spears. He later falls in love with one of them. The time machine is lost and he doesn't care because he wants to stay there with his new love anyway. Even the time-travel machine he builds in the beginning is a little silly looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Timemachine","review":"This product is great.

For a while, in fact, it seemed like this was going to be a good movie.Then it... drifted... It drifted into ghastly political correctness. It drifted into sets that didn't seem plausible with the story line, and less-than-stunning monster effects (where's Rick Baker when you need him?). Then it ended with a huge, ridiculous, totally unbelievable twist that must have H.G. Wells rolling over in his grave.What can I say? Read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I did not see this movie until two weeks ago. Now I know why I did not see it in 2002. The story line was the typical guy trying to forget girl and moves on (with some unwanted help) through time encountering one global disaster after another and finally when the rest of the human race is a bunch of pansies our pansy traveler becomes the half hearted macho guy to the rescue. That's another thing about the movie that stinks- pansies don't build time machines! None of the characters were very interesting except for the mutant people eating underground dwellers but that angle has been overdone beyond belief.I guess I was expecting much more and disappointed myself. The story line had far more potential than was allowed. Hopefully nobody is purchasing this movie except from the $1.00 bin at fine retailers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"The Time Machine is way better than the origonal. the special effects are great and it has a great plot. but if u buy the dvd, dont use the sceen selection cuz if u miss even 5 minutes of it the rest doesnt make any sense"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Time Machine","review":"When i heard this movie was out at the cinema i was eager to seeit even though guy pearce was in it. for the record i think he is a terrible actor and hes just painful to watch.

If they wanted to show how good this movie could be they should of copied the 60's version and just updated the effects and would have been brill."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were They Thinking?","review":"The new version of The Time Machine was amazingly silly! Even the talents of Jeremy Irons couldn't save this script. The movie kept the basic of the original HG Wells Story but forgot the most important part - having characters we like. They did adjust the story a little bit.The special effects were state of the art, of course, but that didn't help the lack of feeling and compassion this script had. The sets were grand and the Time Machine itself had an interesting design, but the movie lacked a lot. I just can't find a lot of good things to say about this one. The performance was by the best friend - Fred Flintstone himself in The Flintstone Viva Rock Vegas and The Full Monty's - Marc Addy.This is not something I would recommend seeing in the theatre. I will definitely rent it on the DVD went it is available later this summer. It may work much better on the small screen because if bombed on the big one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Machine Widescreen DVD","review":"Remake of old movie with good special effects.

Passion, a mortal pushing against the immortality of time to rescue a tragic lost love. Even conquering time cannot bring her back, nor heal his broken heart. And yet he hurdles through the centuries like a comet. At the end he meets the Terrible, head Morlock who can sift through his mind, every memory is there for his viewing and study. His question is answered, She is lost and cannot be recovered. To set the world right our time traveler takes on the Morlock and expunges him and all those with him. He destroys his time machine and lives and loves those he finds in his present time. Who has not lost a love and who would not be haunted at the thought of traveling back to retrieve her? Who would unlock himself from his own time and charge headlong into the future and past to find her, to save her? Great Flick !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the original better.","review":"This movie is an adaptation of the original 1960 movie. I watched it in the theater a few months ago. Guy Pearce plays a time traveler who must go back in time in order to prevent the death of his fiancee. She was killed the first time by a robber and the second time she was ran over by an automobile. This segment of the movie somehow was badly made that instead of engrossing the audience with a sense sadness and despair, it turned the movie into a semi-comedy. The rest of the movie was then the Guy character went into the far future where he must save a docile tribe from a group of carnivores (evolved humans). Some segments of the movie are confusing. I think it could have been done a lot better. Sorry, only two stars for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood needs to go back in time to redo this movie","review":"This movie started out pretty interesting, however it ended up not being a good movie. the music was beautiful and the scenary was nice, but the storyline was confusing and not good at all.

My husband and I felt the 1960's version was better but our son thoroughly enjoyed this newer adaptation. Plus, he had plenty of questions afterwards - mostly about time travel and space.Adults should be forewarned that this movie definitely is designed to engage younger viewers but even with that in mind, we still enjoyed it. Updated computer and digital techniques make ensure that the special effects are truly awesome.With so much junk fare out there in theatres and on television, this is a great choice for family viewing.

Pearce builds an amazing time machine to get back into the past and revive his girlfriend who had been shot, for her ring; however she dies again from an accident. Finally something wrong happens and Pearce is projected into the future, at a time when a strange but technically adavanced civilization manages to blow up the moon by mistake; the effect is disastrous for the Earth's climate and for mankind. So Pearce goes even further into the future and finally reaches a very remote time, when civilization has been nealry completely wiped out of the surface of the Earth. Strange mnsters inhabit the Earth's undergound caves and use humans as food. The end of the movie is very disappointing, as the time machine explodes and Pearce cannot escape from the future; because of that he will never be able to revive his dead girlfriend. It is a sad end, but this movie is not a good one anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of Time","review":"Don't see this movie you'll regret it. Most sci-fi movies are stupid.

The settings for the future world to come is decent but who will believe the earth could survive the Moon's destruction. And even if it did, how come some (extremely beautiful) people survived intact on the surface of the Earth while others needed to hide below it mutating into brainless (or brainstorming) canibalistic creatures. Sure, H.G. Wells book covers some of this stuff, but the the fashion the movie is trying to paint the evolution doesn't have any sense. If you need to watch this movie, wait until it's on free TV.

A thin plot, tired cliches, poor acting and directing, and a lousy ending are just a few of this movie's problems. HG Wells must be spinning in his grave after watching his wonderful book turned into a silly action flick by his grandson. Good sci-fi usually makes a statement about the human condition, as Wells did in his book, which warns the reader of the dangers of communism and fascism. The movie has no such lofty goals, and there is no statement here, just typical hollywood tripe aimed at the masses. It gets 2 stars for the nice special effects, most notably the time travel sequences. An okay rental for a rainy Saturday afternoon with plenty of cold beer, but I'd never actually buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise","review":"Well it starts out interesting enough when his fiance gets murdered and he builds his time machine to go back in time to change this horrible accident. But then it just goes a little haywire. What I mean is that he goes forward in time to figure out why he can't change the past....sounds good, but he goes WAY forward in time. And this is a place that no movie's ever been to and now I know why.Guy Pearce is good, not great, maybe another actor could have held me through the movie better, but it's just the second half of this movie that's got me in a state of fluster. Best part I must say was Jeremy Irons, though he never ceases to amaze.Still interesting, the concept of time travel is a complete mystery, and this movie won't solve it any time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"the new time machine","review":"Take a time machine back to the original is my advise.

Wells books?","review":"There's not much I can say that others have not. It seems H.G.Wells is no longer taken seriously in cinema. In my opinion, Dr. Moreau was horrible, as was this movie. The only Wells movie I've found enjoyable is The War of The Worlds. Ths movie starts out great. I began to think, oh, how sweet, it's going to be a nice love story, but no, it starts that way, then he basically says 'forget it, let's doing something else with this thing.'He then travels 800000 years in to the future, and that my friends, is where it goes not just down hill, but to the very bottom of the ocean. From then on it seems like one of the cheap movies you would find on the SciFi channel that a person would only watch to LAUGH at.Spare yourselves unless you enjoy horrible, cheap remakes, of something that mixes Xena, Beastmaster, and planet of the apes, to become one horrible blended barfbag."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all in the score","review":"My recommendation is to rent the DVD and watch it once for the special effects, particularly the time machine itself, a well-rendered combination of mock-up and computer graphics. While you're at it, pay special attention to Klaus Badelt's magnificent symphonic score, then buy the soundtrack CD and forget the movie. As others have said, the plot is puerile and forgettable. Among multifarious problems, the callow kid played by actor Guy Pearce has in no way the scientific gravitas to invent a time machine (I wish I did). Instead of the movie, I recommend reading Wells' groundbreaking sci-fi novel of the same name while listening to Badelt's score. Symphonic music is not dead, friends, it lives on in movie scores like this one (replete with a choral Eloi theme worthy of the very Garden of Eden). One can only hope that, when the next really grand movie does come along - David Lean style, they will get a composer as good as Badelt to score it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent story","review":"I would have rated this one only 3 stars, if not for the potent charisma of Orlando Jones, who is quickly coming into his own as an actor. This is a decent story based on a classic adventure. Please correct me if I'm wrong, though, but didn't there seem to be an extraordinary amount of Guy Pearce close-ups? I think he's good-looking and all, but man-oh-man, it was as if the camera crew had a crush on him or something! Samantha Mumba did an unremarkable job in her (granted) very limited role.

I recently saw this (April 2004) and realized that this movie was released in 2002. The special effects are stunning and Jeremy Irons brings about an intensity and brings life the uberMorlock character. Guy is excellent and his traumatic look at the lost of his loved one is well-expressed and his desire to bring his love back by travelling back in time and his failure to rescue her makes him look inconsolable...Tragedy, combined with comedy, visual effects make this movie a truly memorable one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Special Effects OK. Where's the Story?","review":"Guy Pearce hardly broke a sweat in this one and minimal supporting cast meant alot of special effects. Some interesting new concepts were raised but never developed.

As another viewer pointed out: H.G.Well's story is social commentary, and like the writings of Dickens, stands the test of time while pointing out the continued failings of humanity. To claim this cannot be protrayed in a movie version has as much truth as saying Citizen Cane whould have been better to avoided the subjects of greed, corruption, and averarice. Skip this version - buy the 1960 version."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the original instead!!","review":"Yes, the special effects here are state of the art, but that's about it. The first 20 minutes or so are actually an improvement over the 1960 film; they give the character some more depth. But after that, the film begins to fizzle, and quickly. The eloi aren't depicted as Wells intended them, and what should have been the most fascinating and enjoyable part of the film -- the changes around him as he travels through time -- were severely limited and truncated. Jeremy Irons role was almost unnecessary, as was Orlando's. Nice try, but it didn't work, guys. The nod to the original w/ an Alan Young cameo was a nice touch, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed by a long shot...","review":"This 2002 new version missed the whole point of the story.

Unfortunately this movie was a complete disappointment. Where do I start?, well, The storyline is completely different than the book and the 1960s original. The movie has no scientifical explanation and/or fascination regarding time travel in general. The soundtrack does not draw you in. I get the feeling that this film was a quick put togheter project rushed out to the big screen hoping to make it big relying on the success and the following of the original movie.

Who cares! Move on into the reason we want to watch the movie, sci-fi action. By the time we get to the conflict there is no time left to have an exciting, plausible resolution. Unfortunately, I'm sorry I spent the time watching. I did like the main characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely songs","review":"I was in India when the movie was released a couple of months ago, and saw and heard for myself what a buzz this movie and the songs created. The buzz was based on 2 factors. The first is that the music is based on the works of the late music director Madan Mohan, and the second was that Lata Mangeshkar who just turned 75 has sung about 9 of those songs. (I am not a big fan of Lata, I prefer Asha Bhonsle instead). Not all the songs are good, but on the whole this is a good music album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is good, the binding is terrible","review":"There was another review about the poor quality of the binding on this book, but I thought it might be a fluke and ordered a copy anyway. It's not a fluke. The glue binding on this otherwise beautiful book is such that as soon as you open it, pages will start to fall out. I've been treating it gently, but even so, every page from the first three chapters has fallen out.The text itself is really solid scholarship, thoughtful and informative stuff. I would have given the book a 4 or 5 star rating if not for the fact that it is literally falling apart whenever I read it. (There's some irony in that fact, given the topic of the book. I'm afraid the irony has mitigated but not dissolved my disappointment.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expect much more for $120","review":"Maybe the GUI is great.

This book has been written by a person who have lived in mid 60's and hasn't been updated since apparently. There are phrases and words (mostly words that have Arabic or Farsi roots that got replaced by modernized Turkish ones) in this book, that are not used in daily life anymore. An example to such phrase is \\"How many bulbs are there in your radio?\\" The book still may be good for learning the grammar (can't comment on that since I only glanced through it), but in terms of learning recent vocabulary and phrases that wouldn't sound make you sound funny, it is not the best reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stool!","review":"I purchased this stool to save my back from bending over to reshelve books.

China Crisis had a great ear for catchy hooks and melodies; not too far off from Crowded House, later Roxy Music and their oft-mentioned mentors Steely Dan. Walter Becker (ex-Steely Dan) produced a number of tracks from this collection along with Mike Thorne. I dare you not to enjoy any of these tracks...there's nary a dud in the lot of them.

But this was something else.The album is a non-stop compilation which doesn't even change the beat. Most of the songs are bland and empty compared to those in Once Upon A Time. There are some nice touches here and there, but overall I got the feeling there was simply something missing.

The rest of the movie was full over overdone gross jokes, crass humor that went way over the line and kept running. The pee joke was funny once, but even at that one time they overdid it, then overdid it again, and then again. The Harry Potter parts were hilarious! Jack Sparrow was awesome! But I wished I had not been forced to watch the rest of the crap just to see a few funny parts of the movie. It's another Scary Movie (1) deal, only worse!

To my ears, the sound becomes a trifle wearing after the first 30 minutes, but what prevents me from tuning out is the solo work of Bill Hardman (whose conceptions are as daring as his technique is formidable), Jimmy Ponder (one of the best at complementing a B3), and Frank Wess (taken for granted because of being buried in the Basie pack for so many years).If you're even mildly disposed toward the sound of the B3, purchase with confidence: you'll get your investment back with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea Hunt Marathon is excellent release","review":"There is no other offering of Sea Hunt that matches the quality of this set - 24 Hour Marathon.

Even if it is not as well done as some of their later albums it is pretty damn' good.The power that Manowar is so famous for is there through the whole album. The album is somewhat uneven, but it does contain some very memorable and classic tunes like the title track, Dark Avenger and the stunning show-off bas solo Williams Tale by Joey DeMaio. Manowar has always been a band of incredible craftmanship, there is no doubt in my mind that DeMaio is one of the premier metal-bassplayers in the world, and Adams vocal is superb, almost equal to Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden.This album seemed to lay the plot for the rest of their albums. Most songs contain strong elements of war, battle and glory. For some people it is too much, and granted: Manowar IS over the top...but that is why we love them. Their no nonsense and attitude is undisputed."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an epic adventure","review":"If you're looking for a type of music that can make you feel alive and puts you in the new and dangerous territory of high end vocals, screaming guitars and amazing harmonies... this is for you.

In order to make it to the elite level, sacrifices have to be made. No one can make an athlete give up 40 hours a week to train; and no one can make an athlete perform at their peak. Only the gymnast can do that.Also, do we really think that young male and young female athletes need to be treated so differently? How many football coaches yell and swear at the players? How many wrestlers starve themselves to make weight? No one seems worried about them. Young women do have the guts to make it to the elite levels. It is ultimately up to parents to decide how their kids are treated in the gym. It is up to the gymnast to decide how hard they are going to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad book","review":"I understand that figure skating and gymnastics are both very demanding sports, but this woman did nothing at all but talk about how horrible everything about the sport was. I myself am a gymnast, and anyone who has not loved the sport themselves probably would not understand.

I am certain that the truth was skewed to paint an unfavorable picture of gymnastics.

Anyone who is thinking of getting themselves or a son, daughter, relative, involved in these sports should go for it.

Look at such gymnasts Bogenskia and Korkina, they are 5'4 and 5'6 and still win competitions. And Kim Zemeskal is certinly not a little pixie and is still winning competitions to this day! And, it's a fact that gymnastics helps build bone density because of the pressure of tumbling. And, on one last note, Kerri Strug was NOT forced to do the final vault in the Olympics, she wanted to, for the team.

I emphasis elite because it is a very narrow field, that 1-2%. This book exposes a world that coaches, parents, and athletes themselves keep hidden. Having been a former professional figure skater, I can tell you I was on the ice 6-8 hours a day starting at the age of eight. I could relate to what Joan Ryan said about gymnasts. It WAS that same world for us; injured, sick, or not you still worked out.

I wouldn't know the true things that go on during practices, or if the stories choosen were only the ones that went over the top. But this did make me look at the way these athletes were treated in a different way. The stories were haunting and some of the statistics were startling. I do agree that the focus of the book was mainly on gymnast and I wanted to hear more stories from the ice. I'm not sure if it's my place to say any of this, since most of the reviews on here are not in favor of this book. I recommend this book to any current gymnast/skater or someone considering the sport. Not to scare anyone away, but to maybe show them the reality of what might happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"There has only been a few deaths that had to do with gymnatics.

Obviously, the author only investigated the negatives, which, by the way, could exist in any sport. If Joan Ryan had bothered to do the research neccesasary to write an accurate description of gymnastics she would have discovered that gymnastics teaches very important lessons to girls early on. Gymnastics teaches determination, motivation, discipline, as well as increases strength and confidence.I am a gymnast and the lessons I have learned have benefitted me in every aspect of life. Sure some fanatical people take it too far and do have eating disorders, but perhaps it is not the gymnastics motivating it. Many, many, many people, non-gymnasts, get eating disorders. Joan Ryan uses gymnastics as a scape goat. This book is a very inacurrate description of gymnastics."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO!","review":"I think that this is a horrible book!!

There are a lot of mentally abusive coaches out there, but on the other hand, there are a lot of good caring coaches. I teach preschool gymnastics, rec. gymnastics, and I coach competitive teams, and I strongly believe in self-esteem. It killed me to read all of the horrible things about gymnastics, but i've witnessed some nasty coaches, and I know this book has a lot of truth to it. I've been involved in the sport for 16 years now. Some gymnasts feel trapped in the sport, because their parents have poured so much of their time and MONEY, into the sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most honest books about the sport","review":"This book is one of the most honest accounts of gymnastics that has ever been written. I was a competitive gymnast for several years and experienced first-hand some of the accounts in this book. I almost couldn't read certain parts of it because it brought back so many memories. Competitive gymnastics has shaped so much of who I am today and it was a wonderful experience to read about that world from the perspective of someone else. It really gave me insight into my own feelings about my gymnastics past. Bravo Joan Ryan for an excellent reading experience!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully true","review":"For those of you whom believe this book not to be true, I strongly disagree with you! Being a gymnast since the age of 3 (I am currently 14) I have heard the horror stories, been to the types of gyms detailed in this book. And I know that just because you want out of gymnastics doesn't mean you can just up and leave, You and your parents have spent large amounts of time and money in the sport and most of the time are unwilling to let you leave!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating look at the inner workings of gymnastics","review":"I've been a gymnastics fan for years but I was never aware of the conditions that produce our country's star gymnasts. The material covered by the book is very interesting.The author sometimes repeats herself (occasionally more than once) with facts and anecdotes, something a good editor should have caught. Also, if you're interested in figure skating, this book is not necessarily for you - the author's main focus is gymnastics.All in all, though, it is a very engrossing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was a good book but...","review":"IT was a ver good book but it only gave you the negative points of being a gymnast. I was in gymnastics for 5 years of my life and yes, it was tough, the coaches wernt always nice but i still loved almost every minute of it! I learned descipline, self control, hard work and to be deticated al thinks to gymnastics. If it wasent for that then i dont know where i would be. Those 5 years were the best of my life so far and i wouldnt trade that for anything. So dont just think of gymnastics as all bad and no good. not every gymnast is anorexic or bulimic. i may not have become an elite gymnast or made it anywhere close to the olympics but i did compete for four of the five years so when you think of gymnastics, dont just think of the bad things it has, think about the good things."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided and written for shock value","review":"I participated in gymnastics drom the time I was 7 until I turned 16. I feel that this qualifies me to write about gymnastics much more than someone who has never trained or competed in this sport at all. Joan Ryan's interviews were interesting in their shock value, but the book was definitely one-sided. While there are some gymnasts who had traumatizing experiences, there are also some who have had terrific experiences. Interviews from BOTH sides of the spectrum are critical in order to get an accurate picture of the sport. The same can be said for coaches. Yes, some of them have very strict (even tyrannical) methods, there are plenty who are positive and supportive (such as the ones that I myself have worked with). In my opinion, Joan Ryan did not achieve her goal in producing this book: Instead of an unbiased, true look at gymnastics, she presented a very biased, sensationalistic piece. We don't want tabloids--we want the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"As a former Bela Karolyi protegee I have to say this is the worst book that I have ever read!!!! Joan Ryan has NO right to write a book about elite gymnasts when she has never been one herself. When I was w/ Karolyi it was never ANYTHING like what she says. What ya'll don't know is that Bela's smile and encouragment continue when the camera's not on him. I think that Ryan has a very sorry way of making a living!! I was an elite and I guarantee u that I and Dominique Moceanu, Kerri Strug, Kim Zmeskal, Jaycie Phelps, Shannon Miller etc... are in it 4 the fun. Bela, Mary Lee Tracy, Steve Nunno, The Rybacki's and every other coach who has an elite gymnast cares very much about there gymnasts. If they didn't they wouldn't have any elite gymnasts. Some people don't like Bela's coachig method and I respect that, so does he. But if u don't like his coaching just don't train w/ him!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful","review":"Books that are based on a few rare incidences should not be applied to the sport in general.

Sure there are some coaches, but there are bad coaches and pushy parents in football, basketball, baseball, didving, swimming[steroids], volleyball, etc..... noone want's to ban any of those sports. This book is biased and unfair to coaches like the Rybacki's, Mary Lee Tracy, and most other coaches in the world. Very few are like the one's described by the book.

My coach never once told me to lose weight.

I highly reccommend this product to anyone living in a cold climate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe for carseats","review":"I was initially excited to get this product at my shower. It seems perfect and the reviews are great. However, the hospital would not let us leave with it installed in our infant carseat. They said that it makes the carseat unsafe because it slides around too much. It is the hospital's policy to warn against Bundle Me's and similar products, so I returned mine. I suppose you could still use it on the stroller, but since I use the carseat that snaps onto the stroller, I would only be able to use the Bundle Me next winter and then only for a few months. For me, this product did not make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SAFE","review":"You must not use any aftermarket products with your car seats. This item is particularly DANGEROUS because it adds cushion between the baby and the straps. In a crash the cushion can compress and cause your baby to be INJURED OR EJECTED from the seat.

Your children should not have anything between them and the car seat except for a single layer of clothing because that is how the child retraints are tested and certified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe!","review":"I bought this product for my infant and when I went to the fire station to have the seat installed (with the bundle me in it) the fireman told me that this product should not be used!

I wouldn't recommend it but I would recommend the shower-cap style covers that don't go behind the baby but just over the outside of the infant seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for winter babies","review":"This made taking my winter babies out in the cold so easy. No need for a coat or heavy snowsuit. The only downside is it can be hard to get the straps right with the bundle me in (much the same problem you'd have with a snowsuit). I have found that if you cut a square out of the back it works a lot better. I know who wants to cut a brand new product, but it is so worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item!","review":"I brought my daughter home from the hospital in this. It's warm and cozy.

For the extremely cold winter days I just put a fleece snuggle suit on for the extra layer.

I'm planning on getting the next size up for this winter-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a snow suit","review":"My son was born in October and I used the Bundle Me until May. It is perfect for the baby. There is no need for a snow suit or blanket when you use the bundle me. It is made from a soft flece that keeps the baby snug and warm, you can unzip and remove it once you are in the doors, very easy to use. just like a jacket. I would really think of this a winter blanket or coat and would not be good to use during the summer. It was very easy to wash and actually became softer and more comfortable once it was washed. I loved this product and would recommend it to anyone who has an infant in the fall or winter months. It beats buying snow suits for everytime they out grow them, You can use this until your baby out grows the infant carset, it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Investment for fall/winter babies","review":"I bought this for my twin girls and i love it. I had them in September and they fit it in all winter. It was so much easier to get the girls out to the car then using winter suits and trying to get twins to wear them or even put them on without screaming.

I highly recommend this to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe","review":"I keep looking but I can not find a safe car seat cover anywhere that is warm. I wish manufacturers would make them so people who car about their child's safety will buy one.

To use one of these is to risk your child's life in a collision. Nothing should ever go below your child in a car seat and nothing should ever touch the harness but the child. Use blankets OVER your child not under them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not safe with a car seat","review":"I returned the product. It is way too bulky to add to a car seat.

The Bundle me was the best. Once installed it didn't move, like some of the others did and the straps on the carseat fit perfectly through precut slots so we didn't have to struggle to find them when strapping our daughter in.

It's safe for a five-point harnness to fit through and is easily washable. Baby doesn't need heavy sweaters or coats that could interfere with carrier safety. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you cannot bring it all the way up over the baby because there is no window for baby's face.

The fact that one would have to totally dissemble the car seat straps and headrest in order to apply this cover and then remove it for simple cleaning tells the tale. I would question the willingness of car seat manufacturers to continue to insure the safety of any infant in a seat that has been tampered with.

A combination of \\"The Night of the Living Dead,\\" \\"Thriller\\", and a little bit of \\"Sid and Nancy\\", RETURN OF THE LIVING Dead is a great punk horror film. The tag-lines are hysterical. (My favorite: \\"Hey, guys, how can you kill something that's already dead?\\" \\"You know, Frank, the kid's got a good point there\\")Some gruesome special effects, especially the make-up, are effective, but they do not overwhelm the film. The cast, playing it up between tongue-in-cheek camp and true terror, is made up mostly of no ones but they are quite up to the task. RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is a great horror comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"This horror/comedy kind of take-off on Night of the Living Dead was surprisingly good. It goes under the assumption that the Night of the Living Dead movie was based on a true happening. Except it really was a failed top-secret government experiment.As this whole thing is explained to two unsuspecting young men, they accidently release the top secret gas that starts to animate all dead things. The dead come walking demanding \\"brains.\\" In this one it seems it is impossible to totally kill any of these re-animated dead. Even dismember them, the individual body parts keep coming looking for brains.Rather than the slow scarry looking creatures from the Romero flicks, these creatures can move just as quickly as living people, can talk, and in many cases are humorous looking.The humor is so well done that it never feels corny."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"this was a good cult classic. even to this day few movies compare. there was even a cameo appearance by the former miss america VANESSA WILLIAMS!!!

The commentary by the cast was good until the zombies came in (I really DID want to shoot them in the head coz they were NOT funny in the least and were really annoying). Only the little mall chick that married the crew member (forgot her name) was entertaining with any insight into the movie at all, everyone else was too busy talking over each other and the zombies interupted some key points she was trying make.

The actual cover and back are nice, but the lack of any sort of insert (not even a promotional one), means that the tabs usually used to hold the inserts are uncovered, meaning pushing down too hard on the cover will cause it too rip.

The writing is clever, the character's motivations are believable, the soundtrack is top-notch and, when you get right down to it, the situation is even more apocalyptic than anything in Romero's films. I'm very glad to see that this film, which has been out of print for quite a while, is seeing a DVD release.

The homage to Night of the Living Dead, James Karen's hysterical perfomance, a couple of [disgusting] site gags. Then when all hell breaks loose it does downhill. The teens - - in horribly dated 80's garb -- exist merely as snack food for the zombies. None is distinguishable from the other - so who cares! Linnea Quigley has a quick turn as the teen [idol] and is the only one who brings any life to the proceedings when the kids are on screen. Not gory enough for real gore fans, the humor gets strained as the film goes on and there are very few chills.

The humor is derived from wonderful comic performances from veteran character actors James Karen and Clu Gulager, who appear to be having a ball here. The result is the single best zombie movie--comic or straight--since George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. Full frontal female nudity and killer punk soundtrack only add to the enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"i just wanna party!\\"","review":"i recently (finally) saw this movie and i really enjoyed it. my favorite type of horror movies are the ones with zombies and this movie pulls it off. i especially like the fact that it is uber 80's it was awsome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie is a thrill from begining to end.

They are only carry what I believe to be the inferior quality brands that I mentioned.I'm sure that the Hoffman and Manischewitz families that own Crown Prince and Season brands wouldn't mind having the Wild Planet brand alongside their own, since they feel theirs are such great quality, right?Who knows, they just might learn something about having high standards from the lovely bunch of people that own Wild Planet in California.To top it off, all Wild Planet products are in BPA free cans...what more can you ask for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The multiple positive reviews here are baffling!!!","review":"Let me preface this by saying I've never tried sardines of any kind before.

I found most of the later symphonies as recorded by Klemperer a big disappointment. Ponderous, heavy and slow, I found none of the esprit that is also necessary to bring off these special works. The 9th is almost unlistenable, it is so pompous. Surely there is a difference between this and grand. These were recordings made late in Klemperer's life and I'm afraid they lack the necessary energy and eye for detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Translation Is Bad","review":"Don't buy this version.

It touches the mythos within us and opens us in ways that destroy all doubt that the mystic art of music is one of the shaman's tools.Now, after all these years, let these words be prophetic..\\"Through change of dawnsee, peace will comepeace will reignall along our dayssee your lovesee your lovesee your love\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best from the best","review":"As a life long YES fan this solo albium opened up to me the the imporatance of the input that jon had on the band.

Since I haven't found the first Jon & Vangelis album, \\"Short Stories,\\" on Amazon, I thought I'd give it a go. At the time, knowing that Yes had disbanded yet again but in a way that signalled a true breakdown of the 70's musical vision, I was a desperate man. \\"Short Stories\\" should be made available by Amazon because it is the LAST Yes-vision album to be written. Vangelis rises to the occasion orchestrally and rythmically while Jon delivers the cleverest melodies. I only wrote this to tell you it's one of the last jems from the Yes-related folks at their best. That's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take The Ride","review":"To say this album was ahead of its time is an understatement: It still is! Time hasn't caught up to this masterpiece yet. In 50 years it may still be ahead of its time. This is a true masterpiece of progressive music. Most of the instruments were played by Jon and the production of his vocal work is mind blowing. It's new age and yet at times it rocks and has stick in your head catch lines as well.Jon Anderson is the master of cosmic music, the man comes from another place than the rest of us. I gave up trying to figure out where he is coming from a long time ago. I'm just glad he lets me come along for the ride and this album is a ride. A ride that is worth taking every now and then.

Schoolyard chanting, simplistic melodies, vocals which show emotion when the music doesn't call for it. If this is what you are looking for in music, then this is your disc. By the way, I would rate all Yes albums in this period 5 stars. In addition, Chris Squire's solo effort rates a five. This might be the worst album I have ever heard. Thus, I am a Yes fan and a fan of Jon's. However, this disc is unlistenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the soundtrack of my life!","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with all the reviews here.

Sylvia, the heroin, has a refreshing take-charge attitude and will not submit to the will of her father, her step-mother or her husband.However, the many racists comments of the author quickly turned me off. Unlike in The Lamp on the Desert, where some indian servants are described in a positive view, the Kaffir (as Mrs Dell calls them) are all written as lazy, monkey-like, rolling their eyes, their speech barely human etc. I found it really offensive and for that reason, would not recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isuzu grille clip","review":"These clips are not quite as large as the original clips.

Those who've heard the rattle trap about Ivo being brash, irreverent and unschooled ought check this out. The funny thing is that despite the fact that there are a lot of great Ivo discs, this is the best I think. In place of the overt pyrotechnics, there is a mixture of spellbinding rhythmic intensity and amazing touch. It helps that these are among Bach's most hypnotic pieces. The first movements of both of these suites are amazing, constructed of repeating figures that anticipate some of Beethoven's great constructs (like the Eroice and the Scherzo from the 9th). For those who think that Bach's rounds can be dry and academic, and Ivo brash and uncouth, meet the wonders of a happy marriage of seeming opposites."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH BABY!...

Also, unlike some bands, none of their songs sound the same. Like some of the songs are really fun, like Turn, Run, Sweet Voice, and Let Love Grow. While others are just really convicting, and make you think about what your life is all about, like The Killing Tree, I Dream, and Lullaby. Actually my totally favorite song by them is The Killing Tree.

And when she was touring there was no hype behind it either like the velvet rope tour. The only good song off this CD was I learned from the best while the other hit singles grew stale fast though I was enjoying them only when they firzt came out.

The only worthwile song on this album to buy is \\"When You Belive\\" the duet with Mariah Carey. It's only good because Mariah is on it. Without her the song would be horrid.

She combines strong and up-tempo hip-hop beats with smooth and mature voice so elegantly! Surely she also gives what she can do best--emotional ballads. Maybe she doesn't hit hi-C note for half a minute like she did in \\"I Will Always Love You\\", but she has climbed to another higher level.

Cause your a crack head, I love you my little fiend, but seriously drop Bobby and leave the pipe with him.Take your own adivce and\\"Get it Back\\", another hot track on the album by Darkchild. It's not right but its okay, Hex Hector made the best dance remix of that song..and we all know about the other singels.As corny as it is I always have a special place for the Diane Warren pended ballads so \\"You'll never stand alone\\" is another song I never skip when I take a visit with \\"My love is your Love..Our love, 1 love...dont sleep and give the worlds most talented fiend a chance"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, not Whitney at all!!!","review":"The only noteworthy song on this album is the duet with Mariah Carey. Whitney Houston usually does well. But this time, she missed the mark and missed it by a mile. She was singing songs that were not Whitney. She didn't have that \\"hungry\\", spirited sound like she once had. She should try again, but this time, use her talent or maybe listen to her previous cd's and see what is missing.

Gone are the exploding high notes that used to send me into ecstasy - instead her vocal range seems to have dropped down an octave (or more!) - most likely due to her smoking cigarettes.

I was very glad I did because this album is filled with some really great songs. I like every song except for the hidden track. The singles thus far have been great, especially \\"My Love is Your Love\\".

I like most the smash Hit - My love is your love and You'll never stand alone- It's not right but it's okay-Until you come back (Classical Whitney)-Heartbreak-Hotel-When you believe with M.

Go buy it today!","review":"It has attitude, it has class, it has style, it got it all. Whitney Houston\\"s new Cd , My Love I s Your Love, is her best singing yet. It is filled with an all-star class ( some just produced songs but it adds their style to the album) like, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, and Missy Elliot. The lyrics are amazing and the touch your heart. To sum it up, this album is the 1 album that came out on Super Tuesday. Go buy it and i gurantee you will love it! Johnny T.

Whitney Houston rocks-and this CD deserves to be heard-with no frills. \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" is a slow groove that soothes your soul, and \\"It's Not Right...\\", classic R&B that lets you know where Whitney stands. The immensely popular Thunderpuss Dance Mix isn't on here-and thank God-there is no place for it. \\"If I Told You That\\", my personal favorite, is a roll lickin', who dunit, that needs no introduction, and \\"Get It Back', is just plain sexy. Leave the dance mixes for the club and refresh your body, mind, and soul with a little R&B-Whitney style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever!","review":"Whitney sounds beautiful on every Song of this Album. She can sing all categories of music! With every commercial released Song of this Album she had a big Hit. And that shows, how talented she is! It's great to hear her new style on the CD, but nevertheless there are also good Ballads on it, like: \\"I learned from the Best\\" (her new upcoming Single), You'll never stand alone (very touching!) and many more. All in all the Best R/B Album out there. Don't hesitate to bye it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful CD","review":"I think this CD is great! I purchased the CD as soon as it hit the stands.

'It's Not Right' sounds better as a remix. 'My Love is Your Love' sounds like 'It's Not Right' pt 2 and the duet with Carey might have been better as a solo. Buy the single remixes, there's more life in those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitney has lost what she once had.....","review":"This album doesn't even compare to Whitney's earlier work. That would be alright if it was better, but she has missed the mark with this one. It seems so poorly planned and written, that one wonders if she should have just stuck with the original plan, and made the greatest hits album. This album is totally devoid of groove or good lyrics. Whitney fans from the late 80's and early 90's, do yourself a favor and don't buy this album. Remember her how she was. Whitney, hang it up, baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"PITIFUL AND DISAPPOINTING","review":"When I heard that Whitney had a new album, I rushed out to buy it. I have been a Whitney fan from the very beginning, and I couldn't wait to hear her latest compilation. What a disappointment. The songs on this album are a pitiful attempt to appease to 13 and 14 year old kids who know nothing about the texture of music. While there is nothing wrong with an artist experimenting with different styles of music (it keeps the creative juices going), I fear that Whitney chose the style of music on this album only to make sure that Generation X (what a bore) would purchase it. Or maybe, she just can't do the strong ballad anymore due to smoking or perhaps she's too busy monitoring her husband. Anyway, Whitney, go back to the old landmark -- the passionate ballads that made you who you are today. You never really could get the r&b thing down but that's o.k., we love you anyway. Hopefully, you will listen to critical commentary rather than record sales the next time around....."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HOPE Whitney RETURNS to her: \\"I Have Nothing\\" Days!!!","review":"I can HONESTLY say that I GREATLY ANTICIPATED the release of this album, but once I HEARD it, I was GREATLY DISSAPOINTED! I think Whitney knows that this IS NOT HER BEST WORK...BY A LOOOONG SHOT!!! The bottom line is, ANYONE can jump on the bandwagon of whats \\"POPULAR\\" in music, but it takes a TRUE ARTIST to bring CREATIVITY to the table. I beleive Whitney CAN DO IT, WITHOUT A DOUBT...but it's going to take a LITTLE LONGER than TWO MONTHS!!!

Thank you Whitney for outsinging that poor excuse of a singer called Mariah Carey. Celine Dion could easily outsing you on WYB. Be thankful that you had to sing it with Mariah. Celine is so much better live. Take notes Whitney before it becomes too late like in Mariah's case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"How can anybody spend money on this kind of crap? Whitney Houstons singing could have been just as interesting if made by a machine, and the whole CD feels so politically correct that its scary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same Whitney!","review":"Being a faithful, touched by all her previous work, fan I can't even get passed the second song! I have been listening to her music since I was 12, now I am 25, and I can't relate to any of these songs, maybe if I was still a teenager and into hiphop, but this c.d is a let down. It is not even worth keeping it around. I guess I will have to buy one of her old albums, again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an Annoying and Boring CD!","review":"Whitney Houston has such a loud and annoying voice! How can anyone listen to her?! Her songs are boring, and her voice is repulsive. She's so loud, and what's worse is that after listening to one song, that loud voice has already become annoying! The only halfway-decent song on the entire album is \\"When You Believe (From 'The Prince of Egypt)\\", with Mariah Carey. Mariah Carey saves the song, but otherwise it's just as bad as the rest of the songs on this album. Whitney Houston's new CD, \\"My Love is Your Love\\" is definitely for Whitney Houston fans ONLY, because if you don't not like her already, this album will most certainly convince you not to like her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Like The Radio","review":"Songs played on the radio are generally the songs I would like to hear on a CD. Well, this is not the case here. I purchased this CD thinking that her songs would sound very similar to what was played on the radio (because they sounded great!). HOWEVER, when I popped the CD in the player, boy was I surprised! It sounded nothing like what the radio stations played...NOTHING! I think she was a little rap-happy when making this CD.

The woman has wasted her talent and it shows. She once was a singer with potential. She's now degraded herself and sings insipid, trite (what some might call) R&B. The woman takes breaths in the middle of words! Give it up Whitney. Your career is headed in the same direction your husband's already is. Dead in the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come back, Whitney","review":"Whitney Houston has been one of my favorite singers for such a long time, and it's a shame she's not using her voice like she once did. The only good song on here is WHEN YOU BELIEVE, and even that has Mariah Carey screaming through it. I don't know what Whitney Houston even bothered with this album--if you could call it that.I hope she goes back to her older style. If she does that, that will bring more people into the pop-rock world instead of the heavy rock world. That's just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you Whitney!","review":"What a horrible album for Whitney. All the songs but about 3 sounded exactly the same.

If they look back, her and Janet Jackson came out almost at the same time, at almost the same age (Whitney is a little over two years older). Upon listening to this album, it was made very clear: the songs she sang in the past were too sappy for a relatively young artist like whitney. But, she decides to turn back the hands of time a little with this one. And she proves without a shadow of a doubt that she can hang with the young'ns (give \\"heartbreak hotel\\" a listen) and maintain her credibility with babyface adn diane warren ballads. But her parings with Missy and Lauryn hill turn out to be the best this she could have done at this point in her career. \\"In my business\\" is perfect to repel the Bobby-haters, and Oh Yes is brimming with the barely tamed sexuality, something she has almost never shown. Whitney is back!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Love Is Your Love is definitely a keeper","review":"Whitney Houston has just given us some more incredible music. In fact, there are songs on this album that are arguably some of the best she has come out with to date. Her singing is just as good as ever. There's a nice balance between belting it out (which is great) and singing subtely. The duet with Mariah Carey is disappointing. I like the song, but I'm not crazy about it. The song could have been produced better. It also could have been sung better (at least on Mariah's part). The title song is a definite highlight. It's one of the best things Whitney has ever done. I think any fan of Whitney's, or R&B in general needs to check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh new sound, but still clasic whitney","review":"those of you who are looking forward to an album filled with teary inspirational love songs, one of whitneys trademarks, you may be disapointed except for the ballad \\"you'lle never stand alone\\" and the Mariah carey duet. The other tracks are more rap influenced R&B tunes that would probably appeal to a younger generation of fans than the middle aged crowd that has been whitneys main fan base. Anyhow this album is still a fine example of this womans versitile talents, and their is something for everybody. the bottom line: This may be a little different, but it's definitlyl worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"whitney's songs are cool and her voice is hot!","review":"i was around when whitney first burst onto the scene via mtv, and we were all impressed by her youthful energy and natural grace and talent. now, years later, she has made an album that lets us all know that her impression was indeed lasting. this album is polished, her voice is poised, the music is pure pleasure to hear, and the orchestrations are an excellent match for her tremendous range. pop this cd into the car stereo, and your journey will be a delight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whitney Houston for life","review":"The track \\"It's Not Right But It's Okay\\" is the most liberating tune of all times for any women living in pure unhappiness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Diva!","review":"This Album is amazing from the first to the last Song!

And that's not a bad thing at all. This one is more industrial based, a bit more electronic in nature, probably having to do with Hate Dept.'s Seibold being the producer. This EP is aural ecstasy, some of the best industrial I have ever come across. But I do have a complaint: This EP is too damn short! Once you get into it, poof, it's over. Fortuantely I also had Rise, so the audio adventure could continue. I can only imagine how bad things could have been if I didn't. So in closing, this is a must have band with a must own release for any fan of industrial, rock, and everything in-between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Female-fronted American-style Industrial","review":"This disc is fast, heavy, dark, and emotional... alternately angry and sorrowful. I would give this 4.5 stars, only because it is so short. (A remix or two would not have been out-of-place.) Having said that, all of the tracks are good, and two in particular (\\"Another World\\" & \\"Icarus\\") are superb. Icarus is actually probably my favourite recent American-style industrial track, and I would say it's worth buying this disc for that song alone.Natasha's vocals are excellent; she is by turns smooth/ethereal and harsh/gutteral. The synth comes across heavy & dark on its own, and the percussion is great (keeping the genre in mind; metal this is not).If you enjoyed Rise and would like to hear a darker, angrier side of MKIO, try Metamorph.

Eli will have nothing to do with that. But might the vultures be able to help when some hunters arrive?Bill Peet's books are filled with charming characters and great illustrations, and this book is no exception. The plot is a little close to one of his other books, but that doesn't keep it from being very charming. The moral, that everyone has value, is certainly wonderful.This is a book to treasure.

However, the author promotes a very miserly approach to creating wealth. Sadly, by the time you have wealth, you'll be too obsessed with not spending 10 cents more for a bag of potato chips in the flavor you really want. The basic financial principles he is teaching are classic Dave Ramsey. While these are great tools to use, I'd recommend buying something by Ramsey or Orman as opposed to this book. Likewise, if you are serious about becoming wealthy, you NEED to read \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" by Robert Kiyosaki.

Its well written, and raises some valid points, however the issue is presented almost totally in an 'America-vs-Islam' context. The main conflicts Qureshi deals with involve post 9-11 America v certain parts of the Middle East and Israel-Palestine.Qureshi has missed a major oppertunity to investigate other conflicts which involve Islam. Why does he not discuss Kashmir, Chechnya, Southern Thailand, Timor, Ughur/Western China? All of these conflicts have a religous dimension to them, and all of them are often talked about by Radical Jihadists, yet none of them really involve the US or Israel. His lack of attention to this means his book has just become another generic study which simplifies the whole issue.Overall it is an ok book, and from an academic point of view it does provide an alternative to Huntingdon's theory. But sadly it has a narrow scope and leaves too many crucial questions unanswered."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read","review":"As someone who is sick of the likes of Robert Spencer peddling fearmongering propaganda, this book is a breath of fresh air.

For a low-budget film, it is gorgeously filmed (good job, Matt Faw!) and well acted. Given the title and the word \\"erotic\\" on the cover, I was expecting the plot to evolve into a kinky threesome, but instead its twistedness takes a whole different route. It starts out normally enough: a couple who's stressed out from trying to get pregnant takes a vacation and allows another couple they don't really know to house-sit. When they get back, the house-sitters won't leave. The mind-games quickly escalate and eventually turn violent and unexpectedly (but very inventively) sadistic. Not a date movie, but definitely worth watching if you like odd, twisted, offbeat films. (And the director's commentary only added to my appreciation of the cast and crew's achievement.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleopatra needs to go back to 1st husband","review":"I'm not going to tell you how the movie ended like the previous poster had, thank you very much.

I wasn't enjoying it much and not too enthuses about this cuz it's not my type of movie and i would not watch it again due to the nature of the subject matter which is twisted. My question is 'who is the 2nd husband of cleopatra?' which is what i was trying to figure out during the whole movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travels with Henry Miller around the United States","review":"In \\"The Air-Conditioned Nightmare\\", Henry Miller writes about an automobile trip he made through the United States in the 1950's. His encounters with colorful characters, and his hilarious and insightful descriptions of the towns he passes through make this a \\"must read\\" for Miller fans. His criticisms of the banality and shallowness of American life he observed then still hit the mark. His favorite region was the South, which, as a Southener, I appreciate, and so this part of the book was especially interesting to me. Compared with Jack Kerouac's \\"On the Road\\", which was written at about the same time, this is a more cynical and negative view of America, but is saved from being merely depressing by Miller's wonderfully savage sense of humor and his ultimately forgiving human heart"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes illuminating, but mostly rambling, dull and pretentious","review":"This book was sort of a sprinter. It started off interesting with pretty solid essays on post-WWII America. But towards the end I found it pretty hard to get through. When Henry's writing works, it's really good stuff, but when it doesn't it seems dated and pretentious. I found his narrative of a Hollywood party to be useless and his long winded tirade about war to be about as valid as some drunk at a bar. It's interesting how Miller's stream-of-consciousness style of writing may have permanently changed modern literature, but if it came out today, I doubt anybody would take it seriously"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on kindling?","review":"I happened to come across this book the day before I headed out on a road trip of my own. I, like the author was headed across this great nation. I understand disgust at strip malls, track housing, neighborhood associations, fast food billboards, makeup counters at christmastime, etc. So I picked up the book, figuring I would find someone whom I could relate with on my trip. There is one thing I didn't count on though, that as much as hyper-capitalism makes me sick, hyper-pretensiousness is not a whole lot better. Henry Miller drove me crazier with his vague esoteric consciously-artistic language than any flashing neon McDonald's sign could. About three-fourths of my way through the book I happened to be camping in the desert, was short on kindling and tossed in the book without a moment's hesitation. I may not want a nation run by soulless corporations, but I sure don't want one guided by the likes of Henry and his band of pessimistic, puffed-up, \\"super-artisans\\" either.jim"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read, kinda disappointing","review":"I was all excited for this, and then it wasn't so good.

I am sure most, if not all, Russians, especially those in St. Petersburg, would be offended by the intent of the title of this book.The story itself is okay. It's entertaining enough for kids.

Although somewhat dated, it should still be a valuable resource in every mathematician's education."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a wonderful read","review":"Paul Halmos is regarded as one of the few mathematicians who can write well and engage his audience. He does not disappoint here. It is wonderful overview for us, naive persons, of the main logical and set theory axioms that are used today as a basis of everyday mathematics. The ideas of statements, relations and axioms gave me what I needed to understand a bit better my main interest....diff. geometry....and it's extensive set notation. Countable sets and powers of infinity helped with the ideas of analysis and it's sets of infinite series and sequences. So if logic and set theory exist only as union and intersection operations from your elementary school days, and is what got you you're engineering degree, then this is the book for you. It will give you a good idea of how set theory proofs are conceived and written. It gives you a taste of just how deep the rabbit hole goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"I do not like this book, because I do not understand his proof of Zorn 's Lemma. Maybe this book is not that \\"naive\\" after all.I think Goldrei's Classic Set Theory is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A contrarian opinion","review":"I beg to differ with other reviewers of this book. Although the book may have been regarded as a classic in its time, it cannot be recommended as a source for either self-study or as a reference book on set theory by present-day standards for mathematical writing. Its style varies from too concise to too verbose in an erratic manner. It attempts to combine rigor and lack of rigor, and does so inconsistently. There are no references to other works. Finally, I was particularly turned off by the last sentence of the Preface, the pompous and patronizing \\"read it, absorb it, and forget it.\\" Those who are interested in elementary set theory are advised to consult the books by Robert Stoll and Patrick Suppes. Besides being much better written and more comprehensive, they are also cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far from naive - as clued up as you can get","review":"\\"Naive\\" set theory usually means: set theory taken from an intuitive standpoint, rather than taking the Axioms as basis.

Taro is not 8 years old. It's never mentioned in the show, but it says plain as day on the back of the DVD case that Taro is a 3rd year middle school student. For those of us who can count, that ought to be about 8th grade and 13 to 14 years of age. And for most normal males, that's not pre-pubescent.Now, on to the show. It's quite funny at times, though a little predictable. FYI: there's a lot of nudity in the first episode. Everything after that is very tame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harem DVD","review":"I have seen a subbed version of this disc. The translation was a bit too Japanese to allow complete comprehension, but what I saw was intriguing.The series appears to be a cross between Love Hina and DNA2. The main character, Taro, is a schoolboy (15?) who inherits a large estate with thousands of maids. The maids are so conscientious they end up over servicing, insisting on helping him bathe, go to the toilet and so on. They get pouty when he refuses their help.Unfortunately, Taro is alergic to women, etc.If that was all there was to it I wouldn't recommend it so highly. But there is a ninja maid, a maid who is a scientific genius and keeps inventing wierd machines (that tend to blow up), an eight year old mute maid with a dark secret, and the teenage head of a rival family who has sworn to destroy Taro but who is also his fiance. And that was just in the first three episodes.There are some intersting things going on in the story and I definitely want to see more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of money, it doesn't even deserve that star!","review":"I do not own this vaccuum, I own a real roomba.

Basically it goes very, very slowly until it hits a wall, at which point a very simple gear box(comprised of under 10 gears) rotates the drive wheel until it is free sending it off in another random direction. The chances of this cleaning a 10X10 room with one or two obstacles in it are REMOTE at BEST. The other thing is there is no ground clearance between the pad and the floor, people who have used it said it just piles up the dirt right in front of it, or snow plows it.

The best tracks are Re:locate by Passion, Primer-the silver lining, Smith and Pledger:forever, & Mark Norman:Phantom Manor. If the world of trance was less competitive, this would be a competitor. I say buy it if you are familiar with Mark Norman, cause a lot of the mixes are kinda average. It seems this is a more mature mix of typical club anthems, such as Castles made of sand.

The only scenes at the pier where Ruth Gordon is in the company of a man, it's Columbo."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the $#%& Universal??!","review":"Is Universal high on crack? They have had a series of problems with their Columbo (and other TV show) DVDs. This time they did it again - why is the MUSIC TRACK missing at the end of \\"The Conspirators\\"??Suddenly we have nearly blank audio stretching out with Columbo driving over the Long Beach bridge and chugging along to the binoculars on the docks, etc. Ludicrous. Everytime I saw this on TV and video previous to this release there was a cranking bagpipe incidental soundtrack. Can Universal turn out ONE tv series without some kind of jacked up mistake??Aside from that the DVDs seem fine. SEEM fine.

Not my favorite, but Shatner chews scenery which is always fun.The Bye-Bye Sky-High IQ Murder Case - as a CPA, I love it when the accountant did it.Try and Catch Me - a very understandable murderer. You know she's telling the truth when she tells Columbo she wishes he had been on her niece's case.Murder under Glass - Unusual in that Columbo says outright that he doesn't like the killer. I can't think of another Columbo in which this happens.The Conspirators - a very fun episode. I disagree with the murderer's goals, but you can understand it and I wish he got away with it.Make Me a Perfect Murder - another murderer I feel sorry for. Well done as you can see the exact time she decides to kill him.

I was in complete shock when I read the back of the set box and it said the final two seasons. Some of my favorite episodes are still out there.....Columbo goes to the Guillotine, Rest in Peace Mrs. Columbo, and who can forget Butterfly in Shades of Gray....its one my favorites seeing Bill Shatner doing a bad Bill Shatner impersonation!!! If Universal has any heart, they'll continue to release the episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"Columbos\\" of the early 70's!","review":"I loved this most recent 6th and 7th Season of Columbo.

Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"before my time and still awesome!!!!!","review":"i actually purchased this set for my moms birthday and she asked me to watch it with her. at first i was skeptical, because well im 20 and this is older than i am. but to my surprise Columbo is awesome. i love the fact that the characters are much more articulate than they would be nowadays. But my favorite thing is Columbo'S intelligent yet deceptive nature in dealing with the suspects, in the words of Rob Schneider \\"he pretends to be stupid, but hes actually sharp as a tac.\\" . All in all a great buy and i recommend it to any detective show enthusiast or any one who just likes a good show."},{"rating":"2","title":"They ruined my favorite scene","review":"Great set but they ruined the classic scene in The Conspirators where he's driving across the port bridge and discovers something through the telescope. They omitted the awesome, riveting music score that was in the background on the TV version of that episode. It sounds minor but certain scenes and their original scores go together like peanut butter and jelly.

It is STILL the very best, most logical and systematic music theory program I have seen. However, many people don't understand what a \\"programed course\\" really is. Programed learning is a way of self-instruction - you must cover the answers and be honest with yourself. It has now evolved into many of our computer-based instruction courses, where the next screen of the computer gives you the correct answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Introduction to Theory","review":"This is a good book and excellent way of learning the basics with how the lessons are laid out. I have really no formal training in music but was really keen on learning so I picked this one up based on recommendations from the other reviewers. Some parts were a little hard, like compound time and borrowed time but I kept ploughing through and it just got easier. As of course with any book, don't expect to get all of your information from one source. I have some other books that explain a little better the Major/Natural Minor, Harmonic and Melodic Minor scales with regards to the pattern of intervals that define each. I would recommend picking up a basic book on how to read sheet music. With this and Basic Materials in Music Theory you'll have some good introductory foundatation for further studying and other texts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Materials in Music Theory","review":"This is a required text for the intro to music class I am takingin college. It would make a fair to average work book, worth about $10 on the open market. But it is by no means a text book,as the reader's attention is continually distracted by questionsand \\"fill in the blank\\" trivia. Explainations of note divison,beat and other fundamentals are rarely shown on staff notation.The vocabulary and definitions are archaic. This is not worthreading let alone paying $76 for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken?","review":"When I bought this toy for my little sister, I was anticipating how happy she would be when she opened the box, but she wasn't happy because the toy was broken! My friend bought the same toy for her little sister and hers was also broken. Coincidence? I think not. This is a junky toy.

This book was a favorite of my mother's when she was young. She shared it with me as a child and now I am reading it with my children. It tells the story of the Pilgrims starting in England; going to Holland and then coming across the sea in the Mayflower and ultimately landing in Plymouth where they form a friendship with the Indians and share a Thanksgiving feast. It is a nice story and the illustrations are wonderful. A fun way to share some history with children of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eurocentric","review":"Readers should be aware that this book is often cited as an egregious example of racist views that ignore the Native Americans' point of view. See \\"Rethinking Columbus\\", by Bill Bigelow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's printed on.","review":"Restall presents an awkward introduction to formal logic. Explanations are convoluted and a chore to disseminate from the text. The book features several errors in both the main text and exercises which can only do harm to the reader. Explanations come across as muddled intertwined with a very casual and imprecise literary style. If you are looking for a straight forward and clear introduction to propositional and first order logic, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"very good book! but very bad formatting for Kindle.","review":"This book is very concise and efficient introduction to Logic. I would highly recommend for boginners of logic. But Kindle edition has critical flaws in formatting. especially tables and boxes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not get the kindle edition","review":"I first bought the kindle edition of this book for a class I have this semester. I ended up buying the paperback due to formating issues on some symbols (such as the symbol for inference). This makes the book basically unusable on kindle, especially for a student since guessing at which symbol ought to be in the missing place is probably not wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing!","review":"The swing is is of great quality and very sturdy.

This is the same heavy duty swing that you find on playgrounds. The chain has a protective coating, so no pinched fingers. It also swings straight. My 16lb 9 month old fits in it pretty nicely. She is a little string bean, so I do put a blanket in with her right now. She thinks this swing is just the bees knees. She will definitely be able to use it for a few summers, so I think that it is worth the initial price. You can find this swing cheaper on the Wal-mart website, however. Would definitely recommend this swing to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"true love","review":"Just a happy movie with a happy ending...it's Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz - what's not to like ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading package, meandering plot","review":"The back of the case for this DVD starts with the following phrase: \\"Brotherly love takes a beating in this wickedly funny romance...\\" Given this description and the sunshine-filled, happy photos on case, I was expecting this movie to be a relatively tame romantic comedy. They sure fooled me! This movie is a violent drama with little content that I considered to be remotely comedic.That isn't to say I'm rating the movie poorly because of the violence. I do enjoy watching that sort of thing from time to time, but the story behind this film seems to be poorly contrived. It seemed to never end. The characters are played by a number of good actors, and they each perform their roles well, but even they can't fully make up for a mediocre script.Watch this movie if you want. It isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but there are plenty of better ones. Just don't judge it by the cover like I did. You'll be in for a pretty big surprise if you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but still entertaining","review":"I'm not a K. Reeves fan so I was hesitant about seeing the dvd. However I like the other actors and took a chance. I like the interaction between Reeves and Diaz and D'Onofrio. They were able to elevate his performance and make an enjoyable small movie. Sam (D'Onofrio) works as a mob accountant and Freddie(Diaz) who owes them moeny is forced to marry him. On her wedding day she meets Sam's brother jjaks (Reeves) and hooks up with him. There are several twist and turns, but it more a study of some losers and how they ry to work themselves out of dilemmas. Sam is goofy, but he is also unpredictible and violent. jjaks tries to save freddie but he also has some loyalty to his brother. A think plot but at least the characters are original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joyous experience","review":"Keanu and Cameron have mesmerizing chemistry - it is just impossible to think anything or anyone could keep them apart.

And did I mention tedious? I would rather visit the dentist than sit through it again. I haven't felt this bad since \\"Bedtime For Bonzo.\\"The plot: Who knows? Who cares?Generally, it's nice to have a protagonist to root for. There are times, of course, when the characters are gray and I can accept that. You don't always have a \\"hero\\" or well-defined character who steps up to the plate. But in the case of \\"Feeling Minnesota\\" the characters are downright murky and you find yourself wondering, \\"what's the point?\\" If I were living with those characters, I'd be hopping on the next zeppelin or Greyhound bus out of town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I'm not sure why I hated this movie so much, since I've certainly seen- and enjoyed- movies that were much more disturbing. Maybe it was the fact that I felt like I was watching empty shells instead of actual characters- like, some motivation would've been nice. Although, I did miss about forty-five minutes of the movie, since after tolerating as much of it as I could I had to just fast-forward to the end to see what happened, and I have never before not sat through an entire film, which just goes to show how bad this was. The most redeeming aspect was Cameron Diaz, who showed more talent than her role deserved, and an opening sequence that was truly brilliant. Too bad the rest of the film couldn't maintain it. Don't see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"...worst movie in years...","review":"Never before I left the cinema. But this time I really couldn't stand it anylonger. The plot was boring, strange and unlogical. Cameron Diaz was pretty to be looked at, Keanu Reeves also. That seems to sum it up nicely. If you can avoid that movie - do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is bad.","review":"One of the worst movies ever created. Even the \\"R\\" rated version seems chopped-up and the story flows right into the toilet. Absolutely terrible. Don't think about buying or renting this garbage.

It was too painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless American drivel, how bad could it get - pretty bad","review":"The story makes no sense.Acting is horrible by everyone - or, the plot and dialogue just suck so badly that no one could cure it. Having an all star cast raised expectations, then cruelly dashed them.Worst part is that the scenery is not identifiably Minnesota. Even the title raises hopes, only to disappoint.Hopeless American flabby drivel. Sad to see how far Tuesday Weld, Cameron Diaz, and Keanu Reaves had fallen to have to do crap like this for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am ashamed for the people of Minnesota","review":"Mostly, I love watching Indie movies, with their complex plots, weaving an appeasing story with unforgettable characters. This movie tried miserably to be interesting, but it failed. In fact, I watched this movie, under 30 minutes because I was holding down the fast forward button so much. The only aspect of this movie I enjoyed, was the fact that Cameron Diaz was cast in it. Besides that, do yourself a favor and rent THE USUAL SUSPECTS for a really interesting plot line."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain stupid","review":"A waste of money.

My sister is a fan and she bought this book. I had a browse through and it is what I had expected. This book will appeal to those who imagine themselves as intelligent and sophisticated. Although they may be entertained, they will learn nothing of consequence. Do not be fooled by Wilde's pseudo-philosophical style. There is nothing to be gained from a reading of this book besides mild, and brief, entertainment, or the satisfaction of knowing you can apprieciate the wit of a supposed intellectual, who is in fact nothing of the sort.I would also like to correct a mistake I noticed in a previous review. Oscar Wilde is not an 'English Gentleman' - He is in fact from Ireland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dobro album","review":"This is some of the best of Mike Auldridge's early music.

A lot of reviews I read indicate that Citizen Cope's music is nothing new and/or special. It may not be revolutionary, but his music is some of the best that I've heard in the past few years. It's a great mix of soul, funk, pop, and ballads. This is a great album and is very catchy, but if you like this one in the least bit, I highly recommend his previous self titled album. The lyrics are great and the songs very emotional in nature....one of the best cd's I own. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everyone","review":"I am never bored with this recording. The quality and scope of the sound is absolutely amazing. Cope wites about a range of real life situations and melds then into highly emotive, expressive music. In doing so, he creates songs that would appeal to just about anyone at any stage in their life. Bluesy, melancholy at times, also determined and vivid; the breadth and depth of Citizen Cope's musical ability is immediately evident. And through all of it, his hip-hop sensibilities are softened, but not diminished. Truly amazing, this CD appeals to me on a different level every time I listen to it and I find new ways that it relates to my experiences more and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"spectacular","review":"An unbelievable record. These songs have not left my consciousness for a single moment. Cope shows amazing diversity as well as honesty with this album. The songs seem to tell stories which he is passionate about, and they burrow their way into the soul.

After the third song, I get what he's trying to do and lose all interest. Lyrics and vocals could save the album, but instead are lazy without point (rhyming by using the same word gets annoying fast on this CD). This style works well on songs of blues, but not every song. He's taken popular, if offbeat musical styles (folk, rap, jazz), put them together and tried to hide a lack of creativity with a dirty musical style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I was looking foward to Citizen Cope's follow-up to his self-titled debut ever since its original release date of summer 2003. Once you listen to it, it is apparent why the album was the reason Cope got dropped from Dreamworks and it took 2 years to get it released. On his debut, Cope was able to create stories with characters we cared for, and could actually sympathize toward, Cope's storytelling skill seems like it was missing from The Clarence Greenwood Recordings. I thought he did a bad job with the songwriting on this album, songwriting was not a problem on his debut. Cope showed himself as musically gifted on his debut, again, is missing from this album. His trademark \\"folk-hop\\" style, in which he fused folk with hip-hop sensibilities, which made his first album stand out, is completely missing here. On his debut, Cope established himself as a gifted storyteller of urban folk tales, with The Clarence Greenwood Recordings, it seems as if Cope has lost all of his talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of 2004","review":"Set aside copyright or CD issues. This is not the artists choice, this is a bigger problem with the whole record industry, and has nothing to do with a \\"review\\" about the music. I get the feeling some people have not actually taken the time and listened to this entire album before deciding to write some type of disgruntled review, which is ridiculous. This is one of those rare albums that each and every single song on there is absolutely amazing. The kind of CD you put in car and enjoy the ride, because each song makes you move and sing along. The kind of album you put in when friends are over and while they are moving to the beat they ask who it is because its like nothing they've heard before, but love it.

Took the whole feel out of the song and enjoyment away and gave TOTAL different meaning.

Couldn't barely make out a word he was singing as his mouth was barely open the whole time. \\"Bullet and a Target\\" was ok, but ok is the best praise I can give. I think the only redeeming thing about his performance was his keyboard player who is way too good to be playing with this outfit. The drummer was checking his cell phone in the middle of a song and the bassist might as well have not even existed as he was so forgettable. I can't even believe this crap got a record deal. If you are considering buying music from this artist--don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oceans of Sorrow....","review":"First...why is this not listed under Angelo Badalamenti? He composed the whole score and when I searched his name this disk didn't come up... This CD is HEAVY(no, not metal dude). From the opening (odd dark carnival like)till the end this is a deep emotional disk. Very depressing...don't listen too when already down ,because it will drag you lower.Still, it is oddly enchanting and I recommend to anyone who is a fan of Badalamenti's other work(Twin Peaks is a fine example also).Great music...just be careful with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"get it for the bathtub filler and the stage banter","review":"I agree with the other reviewer that the sound quality is not too outstanding, but i don't think it is that bad, or reason enough not to buy the cd. If you read \\"mike's notes\\" (which you can at the phish website) the title is \\"portland with pot brownies\\". The use of these brownies is made pretty obvious through out the show with the band's excessive banter. Phish was debuting a lot of their SOTG material in the U.S. as well. The show has a great spacey feel with a pretty solid setlist. If you don't want to hear them talk then the bathtub gin filler (23 min) and the disc two: limd by limb>simple>tweezer>california love>tweezer>free is reason enough to buy this or burn it from a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tweezer>Free and HOOD!!!","review":"This is an incredible CD. I wouldn't reccomend this to a newbie but if you are a certafied Phish head than this is for you my friend! This disc has lots of well played SOTG songs and to balance it out it has Tweezer, Wolfman, Free, HOOD! and Antelope. Great disc! these other reviewers must not know how bat bootleg tapes sound! cuz this is actually really good sounding Phish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"This show has a loose feel from the beginning. The songs seem to flow in and out of eachother, and they often give that phish-like feel of making you forget what song their playing. The jams are more than your typical creative extensions of studio songs. I have not listened to very many phish shows that I can say all four were each on the very top of their game, but that can definately be said of this show. To say that this show is sloppy is to say that true phish is sloppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Saul must have peaked......","review":"Don't read this book if you find topics such as Alzheimer's disease and sexual abuse of children less than entertaining. There is alot of ugliness in this book, not the mystical eeriness that John Saul ususally projects. The plot also moves way too slow. And it's not particularly scary either. Mysterious perhaps, but not frightening. John Saul's earlier works are so much better. I hope this doesn't mean he's losing his creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Tired Formula","review":"John Saul is a hack writer with very little imagination. In all of his books, a youth encounters a dark sinister spirit which affects his/her entire family blah blah blah. The names and places are changed to protect his lack of imagination, but the plot is always the same. This is the last John Saul book I will ever read. Give it up already."},{"rating":"1","title":"corny","review":"Eh. The main adult character, Joan, was too stupid for words. Who's going to let a nasty cruel mother ruin her home, huh? Get real. They had the money, they could have put her in a home. Too unbelievable. My second John Saul and my last. His stories are corny."},{"rating":"1","title":"TinaM","review":"This was the first time reading a John Saul book. I had read a few reviews and it sounded like it would be spooky which I like, however, he did not scare me at all and I kept waiting for it to happen. Did not care much for the characters in this book either. The main female character just kind of drove me crazy, did not like her. Anyway, as I said it was my first time reading Mr. Saul so I probably should not judge too harshly, but I was not impressed or scared."},{"rating":"1","title":"A scary, disturbing book","review":"I thought this book was creepy and disturbing. How could it end up being the person it was?? I won't give the book away but I was deeply disturbed and the ending wasn't that great.

I have read all John Saul's books, and am currently waiting for delivery of his latest. I can't wait!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brain Candy (and black licorice at that)","review":"It's a quick read that has some interesting plot twists, but overall it's not even good brain candy. Saul has been on a downslide since Second Child, the book where his writing peaked. It's ironic then that Nightshade is a poor attempt to bank on Second Child by stealing its premise. Saul's prose is stale at best in Nightshade, but more often his writing is downright painful (I was quite ill at the thought of having to read yet another passage about Matt's mood matching the dark sky or gee, this time it's in opposition to the sunny sky). The biggest change Saul has made to his formulaic stories in the last decade is he no longer names a character in every book Jeff.I'm still addicted to Saul, but I refuse to buy any more of his books until he can write something that matches Second Child or some of his other late 80s books. Until then, you'll find me at the public library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychological suspense with a supernatural flavor","review":"Joan Hapgood has a cozy, comfortable life at Hapgood Farm withher husband Bill and son Matt (from a previous relationship). That is, until the day her aging and increasingly senile mother, Emily Moore, sets her house on fire and Joan brings her to live at the farm. Emily is the mother from hell and makes life [extremely] intolerable for Joan's family. .... The psychological suspense is unrelenting as John Saul leads the reader through a tangle of fractured relationships, unearthly jealousy, repercussions of child abuse, fragile egos, and injured psyches held together with blood revenge. It becomes pretty clear in the last quarter of the book what's going on, but the ending will still sucker-punch you. There aren't many books I feel compelled to finish the same day I start them. This was one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filler...filler...filler....","review":"Never judge a book by it's cover...as an author this can't be stressed enough...as a reader, I couldn't resist! Unfortunately, I was wrong in this case. The cover was awesome and promised a haunting tale that the story just didn't deliver. I thought I'd never finish this book! It grabbed my attention at the beginning, but by the third chapter, I felt as if I had read the same thing over and over. This happens throughout much of the book as Mr. Saul builds to the stories climax. This could have been a very good psychological thriller and a real page-turner, if it had been told in half the length. Instead I found myself putting it down and walking away, waiting sometimes days before I picked it up again then once again becoming frustrated with the same scenario's, bearing slightly different descriptions. This is a classic example of once hitting the best seller list, always remaining there...we should all be so lucky!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truely Shocked","review":"I cannot believe the number of good reviews this *horrible* book received. I have to confess that this is my first John Saul, but after the trite subject matter and tedious writing style (\\"his body began to respond to her touch\\") of Nightshade, I don't dare read another. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Johnny","review":"As a fan of John Saul who has enjoyed a majority of his books over the years, I was a little more than letdown with his current novel, NightShade. I found it to be very dry and rather boring. The plot was easy to see through right from the beginning, and the level of suspense was basically nil in comparison to Saul's previous novels. The ending was extremely disappointing. I don't wanna give it away to those who haven't read the book, but keep this in mind...it was unfair and unfinished, unless John Saul plans to follow NightShade with a sequel perhaps. If you are looking for a novel of suspense and terror, unfortunately you will not find it here. This lastest writing of Saul's is lacking to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"good light reading","review":"This story is very well written and intriguing. I picked it up on a whim not knowing what to expect as this was the first book I've read by Saul, and quickly found myself lost in the story. couldn't put it down and finished it in two nights of reading. characters are complex but relatable and the story is rather dark. Not so long that it's a commitment, and totally a page turner. If you've ever had a family member (currently with us or not) who wore a signature perfume, this will probably resonate with you for a few days after finishing. Also, if you like a little bit of spookiness in your reading but only want a book long enough to knock it out in a weekend NightShade is just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and predictable","review":"I decided to read this book after I read Saul's Blackstone Chronicles. I enjoyed the build up in that book, but the ending fell flat. So I got this one thinking I would give him another try. But I was none too impressed with this one, either. It was slow building and not much happened in the first 100 pages. I guessed the identity of the \\"evil person\\" early on, and guessed about Matt's connnection to Cynthia also. The ending wrapped up too neatly and left you with an unsatisfied feeling. I am going to give him one more chance to impress me ... I hope UNLOVED is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL AND BORING","review":"What a waste of time, and totally boring and predictable and stupid story.

Recycle bin, here it comes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I thought this a very contrived story","review":"Reading the other reviews posted for this book I realize I am not in the majority, however, I did not find this book entertaining at all. The author went to too many extremes with the characters in their actions and reactions. I found it unbelievable that Emily could be so ill with Alzheimers and Joan still felt compelled to care for her...as if she was convinced she could handle that type of situation . The nightmares of Matt and the total snub by his friends after Bill was killed were very unrealiatic.I did not like this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland!","review":"I've ordered hundreds (maybe thousands) of items from the internet and this is my first review.To put it succinctly, these cakes are bland.

Graves lost his faith, while Tolkein held fast to it, for one thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, moving account of a bye-gone era","review":"This novel is a wonderful evocation of a past era, spanning the early decades of this century. It provides a telling insight into the attitudes and prejudices of late Victorian and Edwardian Britain, as well as an unforgettable account of life in the trenches in the frist World War. It tells us much about the author, his humanity, his insight, his undoubted inspirational courage, and his vanity. His was clearly a complex character, who although charged with socialist ideals, cherished his heritage, his military past and even his old school, although clearly against it's \\"system\\" as a whole. This is an intriguing and thoroughly readable book, full of humour, pathos and tales of umimaginable human endurance, almost too difficult to comprehend in this cossetted era of the century's end."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Read","review":"The book was a good look from the perspective of a World War I British soldier. Too much redundancy about the actual war. The book was supposed to be autobiographical, but Graves did not get into much else sbout his life until the last chapter or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"warts and all","review":"I came upon 'Goodbye to All That' relatively late in life. I had enjoyed his fictional biography of Claudius, but here was Graves, speaking to me of his own youth, across a gap of more than seventy years, with a candour one hardly dares hope for in contemporary autobiography. Yes, he had loved, both men and women, and he dared admit it. He writes, not just with courage but humility, of his harrowing years on the Western front, which saw the wholesale slaughter of most of his generation. Along with fellow poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, he gave the lie to the 'honourable death' for King and Country. Despite their valour, the friends he lost had been slaughtered like cattle led to an abbatoir, and he spares us nothing of their suffering. A truly courageous book in every sense. I can't speak for the audio rendering, but its disappearance from the bookshelf would be a tragic 'Goodbye to All That' indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting, but long in spots","review":"Before reading this book, I knew little about WWI. I saw it recommended somewhere and ordered it from our library. I'm not sure which issue it was. Anyway, it was very interesting and well written. I learned a lot about the way gas was used in WWI.I found myself amazed that the author kept going back to the trenches when he could have avoided that duty. Actually, I got a little frustrated with him too!About two-thirds of the way through it became a bit of a slog to finish, but overall, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do two 18-year-olds go about killing each other?","review":"Written because Graves was out of money and threw in everythingfrom his life that he thought would make the book sell (e.g.,anecdotes about T.E. Lawrence), this is a great book for understandingthe terrible gulf that separates a public's enthusiasm for war and a soldier's actual experience of war. Trench warefare in World War I is different from a ground war in Kosovo but the basic idea is the same: a bunch of old guys in suits lead a cheering public to send their young men off to die. What is a clear-cut moral case to someone reading a newspaper at the breakfast table isn't so clear-cut to two 18-year-olds who are supposed to try to kill each other in the field.The book also has some interesting portions about the life of a poet and a writer (hint: don't try it unless you were born rich and aristocratic) and a particularly funny anecdote about how Oxford wouldn't accept a thesis from Graves because it was not written in standard academic style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compulsory reading for every politician.","review":"A sad commentary on our society that only the audio versions of this book are available. With the increase of interest in the First World War recently it is to this book that many people should turn for a gripping, factual account of life before, during and after the Great War. Mr Graves documents the pastoral quiet of England in the early part of the twentieth century and abruptly descends to recounting, in cold detail, the dreadful slaughter of the trenches. Through some of the most famous battles in history he survives, physically more or less intact but from the dry words; modest, English, reserved, we glimpse the true weight of the burden that such memories impose on their carriers and understand better the terrible toll that the War levied on all the nations of Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay Attention to the Editions, There Were Three","review":"There are three editions of this Robert Graves Classic: \\"Goodbye to All That\\". Get the first or the third. The first came out in the 20s and was raw and popular. The second came out in the 50s and was somewhat bowdlerized by the author, because several of the people involved were still alive. His son oversaw a third edition in the 90s which explained some of the reasons for the changed second edition and restored some of the original material. If you pay attention to details, find out which edition you are getting. I have downrated this edition because it is the second. I purchased a third edition off of Amazon about a year ago but I haven't seen it available since and I'm still looking.If this is too nitpicky for you, the second edition is still very good, it is missing some interesting material however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Text Too Small","review":"I purchased this book used but in very good shape and I fully expect I will enjoy the work once I find a different edition with larger text.

I expected a bittersweet telling of how the author went from true believing to disillusionment with British society and British militarism.What I saw instead was a rather flat telling of the author's life before and during the Great War that dwelt on the fact that he was in the British upper class, had an upperclass accent, went to an upper class school and was an officer in an elite regiment. He comes across as a terrible, unlikeable snob.What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Scrusher","review":"This is a major boot scrape!

The story unveils masterly the reasons of this fear.Marie Cardinal evocates fiercely her violent psychic battle with her unconscious in order to force it to reveal its secrets, her fear to (re)discover forgotten painful, but crucial, incidents or the psychic violence needed to open the doors of the subconscious.Her book is also a profound meditation on the impact of a \`colossal' religion on people's lives (interdiction of divorce) and on the female condition and female psychology.A formidable and shocking book.A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an add on for AT&T DECT 6.0 Cordless Telephone","review":"False advertising.

While some [and I stress the word SOME] of the ideas in thie series have interesting beginnings, the writing is so bad, and the characters so genuinely unlikeable, that it is hard to give a good damn what happens to any of them. The names are childish in their sound, and the silly prophecy which they are following has no interesting twists to the outcome, so it was basically as dumb at the end as it was at the beginning. Sarah Douglass is a mediocre writer, fine for producing potboilers like this, but otherwise not worthy of note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb from beginning to end","review":"The art on the cover of the American versions of these books is wonderful.There. That's the one nice thing I can say about Sara Douglass's books.I am amazed at the popularity there seems to be associated with this tripe.

Spoilers ahead !","review":"The first book in the series isn't bad..in fact I loved it. However, by the third book Sara has destroyed the one character who you have bonded with from the very beginning....Faraday, the heroine. It seemes as through while writing the trilogy, the author thought to herself \\"Hey, Faraday is just not the heroine I wanted when I started the series...Let's add another woman who can take over,\\" which is the case in the second book. Faraday becomes a second rate female character whose actions mirror that of a slave's. I know there are three more books after this and that Faraday comes back a bitter woman...well wouldn't you be too? But that fact alone does not save Starman from turning out to be the worst book in Douglass's career. In fact, after Starman I swore to myself that I would never buy another Sara Douglass book.

The 3rd story takes a turn towards ludicrious. Some of the \\"it's so dumb I can't take it any more\\" points:- Two of the main characters turn into gods or immortals. Axis literally cannot die, but can be killed by his brother.- The prophecy tells you everything you need to know about the series.- A newborn baby plots, 2nd male in line for the throne, to get his brother kidnapped, so he can be named hier. The baby has a woman carry him around to carry out the plot.- The bridge guardian that challenges everyone can be fooled by saying \\"trust me\\", and it's a female guardian no less ;-)- Faraday and Azhure fight off a god by holding on and telling him to go.- You know the outcome of every battle before the author writes it which leaves no suspence.I didn't know the author intended the series to be a comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy, lazy author","review":"Wow. Sara Douglass apparently missed the lesson in writing class that taught that synonyms are your friends. She really liked the word \\"cuddled,\\" for some reason. People never hugged, babies were rarely cradled, and bodies were seldom pressed against each other. Also, she seemed unable to think of many other epithets besides \\"b^tch.\\" I don't really have a problem with it being used to make the characters realistic or whatever, but it's just annoying when it's used as often as it is in this book. I felt like it was on practically every page during some sections, like the whole Smyrton and Artor battle section, and everywhere around Caelum's kidnapping. It constituted 90% of the insults hurled by Douglass's men against her women... which strikes me as sheer laziness on Douglass's part."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a hassle","review":"Ordered a new book and was sent a obviously used book.

I was really pleased with the strength of character she showed throughout the story - and the only small disappointment I had about her was her martyr-like tendencies. But overall, well done to Sara Douglass for taking a very weak character and making her strong.There were just a few surprises in this book, but they weren't all that large of surprises. The battle scenes were well done. The most heart-breaking portion of the story was the relationship between DragonStar and his parents.With this book the first trilogy ends and I think I'll take a bit of a break before reading the next three.

The twists and turns were very exciting and kept me interested all the way through. Sara Douglass put just the right emotions in this book that made you feel for the charachters.

And all those movies are about walking around outside, while Inside Man is well walking around in a bank.I as a movie-goer find myself looking back at the already produced movies to find that a majority of those today, lack any plot. Which I can say is the story here. I could stick this movie in the same stack of Jurassic Park 3. Kid gets lost, parents go to island to find kid, everyone leaves.

Denzel is always strong, and thoroughly enjoyed Jodie Foster's character. Clive Owen was a big surprise for me as I normally am not a huge fan, but thought he was great to watch. The film plays a bit with some rashomonesque story telling and flashes, and it's intriguing to see the plot play out. A little bit long towards the end, but usually Spike Lee films are.

Throw Jodie Foster into the mix as a mysterious problem solver of sorts, and you end up with a very entertaining movie.There are quite a few holes in the plot, but \\"Inside Man\\" is definitely a lot of fun to watch, although I doubt I'll ever sit down and watch it again.

They should have matched the clothes with the real people, and if any two of them climed the same item, one of them is certainly a criminal. And the real owner should been easy to spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely above terrible","review":"Spike Lee is not intelligent enough as a director to tackle the many disjointed plot lines of this film. In one scene you'll have a cliche filled mess regarding how Muslims are treated by the police. Then in the next, he's trying to create an intellectual battle between Washington and Owen. Believe it or not, despite the fact that there is so much going on, the entire film just feels so, well, boring. Jody Foster is a pointless addition, and after about 35 minutes you're still waiting for something to improve...but....it never does. I'll give it 2 stars simply because I love bank robbery movies, but this one might just be the worst on record. Even Denzel seems to be stumbling through this role, I haven't figured out why he ever agreed to take it on. Stick to mindless UFC and car chases Spikey, because serious directing eludes you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of many talents, except the lack of Washington's","review":"Well, this movie is way too laid back to be real for a bank robbery movie. It's a stupid movie, that's what I'll call it. Washington's performaance is typical of his tyle, like God's speaking to the mass, his sure style just makes everything feel fake and too much acting. The plot is barely Ok. The cop Washington played is just a dumb 3rd grade cop, with more wild guess from nowhere than intelligence. The scene where he walked into Mr. Case's office and accused him lying is just very odd because he has nothing about what happened and why money isn't stolen. And, a small-time cop just walk into a big bank head's office and accuse him lying, just because he hasn't seen money not stolen during a bank robbery before?! Come on, it's cheap and dumb. 2 stars at most. It is worse with Washington's typical over-acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside Man","review":"It's intense fun that never slows down or takes the easy way out, making it one of the coolest movies.

It had lots of twists and turns that kept me interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very rewarding!!!","review":"Spike Lee finally came through on his fourth film with Mr. Washington. This film is very moving and intriguing. Nail biting. Exciting. Smart casting and directing. Clive Owen wanted to help out those who deserve it, unlike the big tycoon entrepreneur...selling himself out and trying to hide his past. This film demonstrated that everyone has demons, and no matter how hard someone tries to hide the past, and how rich you are...there will be someone out there who is smarter and willing to take even bigger risks to reward himself and at the same time reveal the true meaning of pride. Furthermore, Jodie was playing a dirty lawyer. Stopping at nothing to achieving her greed on the front page and scoring points to achieve the unremarkable...betrayal.This film had all aspects of our human nature. What more can anyone ask for. It makes you think...Would you risk your life to prove that someone else's life is worth more than yours if you get caught?"},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"Denzel Washington is One of my all time Favorite Actors. Jodei Foster is one my all time Favorite Actresses,but they are both wasted on this overblown film. back in the day Spike Lee was happening,but it's been so long since he has made a film that has truly held my full attention. I dig the aingle where he is coming from with this picture,but something is missing in this film that keeps it from reaching it's peak. you get a Post 9/11 flavor with a few other past films of this style thrown in. it should have been more tighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"dA inside to INSIDE MAN","review":"pLOT:Russell (Clive Owen)is a bank robber who has planned the perfect heist....Frazier (Denzel Washington) is a hostage negotiator whose mission is to manage the situation....

Jodie Foster's character, for one example, is so pretentious and obnoxious that one is tempted to reach into the screen and slap her face.The language that everyone uses, particularly the Mayor, is so full of obscenities that it is just not credible. Filthy language for the sake of filthy language is just filthy.The story, where Denzel Washington's character appears to finally understand what is going on with the bank robbers, is just too obscure and nonsensical for anyone to figure out, even Denzel Washington.If there is some kind of message her, like criminals will finally be found out and will receive justice, it is lost in the juvenile way in which this movie is presented. Just plain awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flick!!! Do the right thing, and rent this DVD!","review":"I borrowed this from my local blockbuster, on Tuesday Launch day, August 8th!

Thanks Amazon"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"I found it kind of ironic that in Inside Man the characters speak of Dog Day Afternoon. Basicly they are the same movie. Some guys hold up a bank and you have an all day stand-off. It's the same movie that we've seen a million times. And can Denzel Washington ever play a part that doesn't involve being a cop or an authority figure? This movie adds absolutely nothing to the crime genre.

But then something happens that will change both of their lives forever. If you are anxious to find out what happens read the novel by Carl Dueker. Heart of a Champion is a compelling book for all ages. It is best for any teenager between the ages of 12-15. This story relates to the problems of everyday teens. For sure it will clench your heart. It has been rated a five star novel(*****) by many authors and publishers for sure.."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"Heart of a Champion is probably the greatest book I ever read. It is about a boy named Seth whos dad died when he was just a little kid. His father played golf and so did Seth. Seth didnt like it very much however. He started playing baseball with a kid named Jimmy who had all roads leading to the majors. They go through all sorts of obstacles like school and Jimmys dad getting divorced from Jimmys mother. However, after all the twists and turns throughout the book, there is a great ending at the end. This is a great book for baseball lovers such as myself. It has a good plot and what makes it really interesting is its baseball knowledge. The author does a great job of putting in baseball facts and strategies as well as exciting games that Seth and Jimmy play together.

It is the #1 title for a reader who has a love for baseball. Deuker's love for baseball is portrayed in his easy-to-understand commentary of the baseball action. Probably written for ages 12-16, it is a book that sugar coats nothing about a baseball teenager's life in a small town. Jimmy is a boy dedicated to the sport of baseball.Jimmy often touched the people he played with.One was Seth to whom he sent a ball rolling to him at Henry Ford park and changed his life forever.They became the best of friends and were inseperable year-roundof themselves and the sport of baseball.

Read about Seth and Jimmy as they go through high school. The book Heart of a champion by Carl Dueker is a phenomenal book. Enjoy one of the best baseball books written.

The both of them played ball with the high school team and one of them got in trouble for drinking and wasn't allowed to play for the team.

There is no action, and the dialog is simply too advanced for young kids. The elephant is shown maybe 4 times for less than a minute. I There is waaaaaay too much dialog.

Maybe the creator of the film should have checked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"Why is no one in this movie the least bit likable? Why does the plot hinge on so many illogical events? Who wrote the wooden, dragging and implausible dialogue? Why, in a movie about the circus, are there so few scenes featuring acrobatics, or animals, humor or entertainment? What school of funerary arts did the director attend? What is the point of this movie? What drugs was the \\"newscaster\\" character on, and did these substances make appearing in this clunker less painful? This was the WORST $3.99 I ever spent, and it was clear within the first 120 seconds that I had made a bad mistake... This movie makes your typical American soap opera look fast paced, intelligent and engaging. Honestly, the 2 minutes of shots of the elephant and the 60 seconds of the lemur riding around on the lead character's shoulders were the only times I wasn't rolling my eyes in annoyance.

However, the whole experience was bad in that the obnoxious background noise (I'm being very charitable here) was so distracting that I couldn't concentrate on what was being said. I'm not kidding! I don't mind a little music intro but this was absurd and had no place or purpose other than to distract from the oral narrative. I know this isn't supposed to be like a conversation in my living room but still, if someone is trying to explain the intricacies of the tires being use in MotoGp then why in the hell do you have to put up with someone who sounds as if he's pounding on a garbage can lid with a baseball bat?

Listening to the carolers, they return to their beds. The pictures and words capture the mystery and excitement of Christmas, without trying to impart a lesson or moral.

This baritone is the last great singing-actor of our time, there have been larger voices to be sure, but no other baritone has the warm smile in his voice, the adorable personality of Giuseppe Taddei. His Sir John is a lovable old bastard. Next to him we have another great baritone, the Ford-of-Fords, Rolando Panerai. Lauri Volpi used to say he had \\"the finest\\" baritone voice of our time. He certainly was born to sing Ford's high tessitura, and hearing both of them together is heaven. The rest of the cast has some big names like Kabaivanska and Ludwig, but it's the men (Araiza included) who steal the show. Karajan was in a Bruckner-mood, not the most fun or stylish Verdi we have had from him, but Taddei and Panerai are unmissable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap copy of old text enlarged and blurry on white shiny slippery paper","review":"Horrible blurry poorly copied large print on glaring white shiny paper.

But the painful truth is that it is an awfully slow movie (at times excruciating but you keep thinking that it might pick up - it doesn't), and there are very few laughs in it. The funniest thing about it is the fact that Megan Mullaly is given the starring credit on the dvd box and she has a total of about three lines and less than three minutes of screen time! Talk about false advertising! So what if the film has no offensive language or violence? Those factors alone do not make a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring","review":"The film was alright, a pleasent enough effort, however, Megan Mullaley is hardly in it and it's not a particulary interesting film.

Sources, books, and opinions from somewhere other than England are labelled as much less reliable, sometimes ridiculed. Incredible arrogance.From the perspective of the sideshow in Peninsula, the author generalizes about Napoleonic Wars which took place in Central Europe.British victories got prolonged descriptions and quotations, whereas the victories over the British are shortened, described in a much less interesting way or ridiculed.I have not seen such an anglophile book for quite a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Paddy Griffith helping Rory write this book?","review":"Oh, my goodness, one more book about the nonsense of British superiority.

I said five because you can't put descimiles on the rating. It's very simmilar to the two towers. It's alot harder beacause for one, the levels are alot longer, and two, all the good cheat code like full health, invurnerability, and infenite missiles, can only be entered once you finish the game. You can play as sam, frodo, and gandolf, which are all cool characters. For example: with gandolf, instead of shooting an arrow, he blasts you with magic iminating form his staff. It's definatly worth th 50 bucks. You can also play co-op and online! The only thing is, alot of the time it's hard to find your character in the middle of orcs and men, the camra is always changing angles, making it hard to know if you're going forward or backwards. That shouldn't keep you from buing the game though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool idea but way too hard","review":"My husband and I LOVED the Lord of the Rings movies, so we couldn't wait to play the game. We wish we'd never heard of it. Both of us find the game much too hard, to the point that the game is irritating, rather than fun. It's neat to be able to be Gandalf or Aragorn or Frodo, but even when playing the most powerful characters, we have to play the same scenario over and over and over and, well, you get the idea.

If you were to go to the store and buy any game I would sujest The Return of The King for PS2, XBOX, or Gamecube. I also think its better than the other two LOTR games because it has two player.

Storyline, 10 out of 10. And, my personal favorite, sound effects.Not only the music, but the crunching sound of orcs under your blade, and the roar of Saruman's concotion exploding with a fire-arrow are especially wonderful. I'd have to say that ROTK is much more interactive then TTT. Nonetheless, it is a hack 'n slash game. You will find several wanted features in ROTK. For instance, Online Play and multiplayer options definitely beat many third-person fighting games. The best character is either Aragorn or Gandalf. graphics are not half as choppy as on TTT. You'll love it. The only bad aspect of the game is that you can't move the camera around. you will probably find camera angles to be a nuicance. Overall rating: 4 out of 5.

First, it was way too short and easy. I beat the game in 2 days. And I mean the whole game, including both Palentirs. I beat both Palentirs without cheat codes also.

Its also good to play with friends because you can do 2 player mission mode and you complete the level together. Or you can do 1 player and beat it buy yourself.

First the graphics are pretty darn good, except the in-game characters' mouths don't move, but that's my only nitpick with the graphics. The sound is spectacular, exactly from the movies, which is pretty cool, and the voice acting is great with the actors from the trilogy lending their voices(watch \\"Hobbits on gaming.\\" It's downright hilarious!). Controls are precisely lifted from The Two Towers, not that it's a bad thing. My only complaint with this is that even with 15 levels, it's a tad too short, enemies can stop your combos way too easily, game can get intense and hard, even on the easy difficulty. But they're only minor complaints. If you're a fan of the movies or books, you owe it to yourself to pick up The Return of the King. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST PS2 GAME EVER!!","review":"This is a must have for all LOTR fans. The Two Towers game was awsome, but TROTK redefined awsome!

The fighting is spectacular. You just beat down those orcs with your arrows and swords, its a really fun time. The orcs are different and have different features. Also whats new from the Two Towers version is the you have more characters to play with, especially Gandalf. But, most of these characters exept for Gandalf are unlock until later in the game which is unfortunate. It doesn't follow the movie like I thought it would. But, you can see clips from the Return of the King movie mixed in with the game. The reason i hate this game is because when your playing two player campaign you have to save on two different files and it gets mixed up all the time. The saving system is a joke.

It's horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GAME IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"When I first got this game I thought it was going to be only one player.

The first game you play is the tutorial as gandalf with everlasting life.

The graphics are tight as are the sound. The controls are also easy and the combos are neat. I like the fact that not only can you purchase upgrades for your character but the whole team as well. I would purchase upgrades for everyone, because my tactic is to complete each level using all the characters. After all members completed that same level, I'd move on. So, purchasing upgrades for everyone made it easier for me to advance as the next character.The game did get a little overwhelming, especially the levels where you had multiple enemies to fight, but the game is just awesome anyway.So, should you buy it. Yes. But, be warned you'll get addicted and play for all hours of the night!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game","review":"This game makes you feel like you are actually in the movie! I finished the game in only about 3 weeks, but that's only because I'm a very experianced gamer. The one major thing I have noticed about newbies that play this game is that they tend to go onto a cheat website and look for cheat codes for it. No cheats, like Invincibility, work until you have beaten the game. Anyway, this game has such good graphics, the characters of the game look exactly like the characters in the movie. Gandalf's attacks are really good, and his \\"arrow\\" attack is like 1 hit kill once you reach level 20.If anyone was to look for a good single or multiplayer game, this would be the perfect one, it is so awesome.

For example: Gimli can have super strength for a small period of time, sam can cloak himself with the ring for a while. Gandolf is the best character to use.Pros: Great characters, longer levels, chalenging, and has a multi player.Cons: Sometimes it's hard to find your character, and you can't jump.Bottom line: Unless your poor, get this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Hobbits?","review":"Hobbits!

When we went to put it together, I found this to be the most frustrating toy ever! First of all, any toy with 290 very small pieces is really not something that the average 5 year old (yet alone an average 10 year old) can handle so this is definitely a toy that an adult needs to put together - if they can! My husband who can put ANYTHING together washed his hands of the whole project after an hour and a half of unsuccesfully trying to stick the pieces together.

This set takes a little while to build, but my only pet peeve is that the white section on the left is ONE PIECE. It is difficult to make the bulky piece stick to the main plate, because there aren't many places it can attatch. The Battle Shell van is amazing! You can put the Ninja turtles in the back or in the driver's seat. Or, you can set them on the top with a Foot Soldier or two and have a high speed battle seen on top of the van! It is a fun set, and the ooze is fun. A word of advice about the ooze: Don't break it up into pieces! I have another set with ooze, and I would always pinch it and pull it and break it up, and now it doesn't work very well, because instead of being one gelatinous mass, it's a bunch of smaller pieces that get stuck to your fingers, set, carpet, ANYTHING!

I'm wearing it right now and I absolutely LOVE the scent that stays, rather than evaporates like some other fragrances.I have to alternate this with a few others such as \\"Kate\\" by Kate Moss, \\"THE ONE\\" by Dolce and Gabbana, \\"PRADA for Women\\" by Prada, & Versace.I'm actually wearing this ANGEL with KATE and the two combined are amazing!If you love it, and still have others that you love, you will always come back to this scent.

I found it to be an interesting read that's well written.This book covers Waylon's life all the way from a dirt floor in Texas to the 1990s. I found the part about his time with Buddy Holly fascinating. I always heard Waylon was supposed to be on the plane, but I never knew the profound impact missing the flight had on him. That chapter alone was worth the price of the book. It takes us through the glory days of the '70s and the outlaw years all the way through the struggles of the '80s. Toward the end of the book, he discusses The Highwaymen at great length. Throughout, it is honest, frank, and pure Waylon.This is a book worth reading for anybody that's a country music fan.

It covers Waylons days on the farm growing up, his short time with Buddy Holly, his career long battle with pills/drugs on the way to becoming a country legend, and his life after he kicked the habit by staying out in the desert for a month. This book is written by Waylon so the way he talks/writes is a reflection of the way that he actually talked and rembered things so the account can get a little confusing when the down home country accent bleeds through, also somtimes the narrative can jump decades and back in the same paragraph. That was my only complaint with this book. It does give good insight on how Waylon and the rest of the outlaws changed how country music sounded and how Waylon had to fight to get a fair contract that he could live with. If your interested in his music or how that era helped shape today's country music give it a read.m.a.c"},{"rating":"2","title":"Treadmill section good","review":"I would rate it 5 stars for the treadmill section but it is only half of the tape (30 minutes). There are two instructors, one that leads you through the running, jogging and walking on the treadmill and the other that works with the hand weights while you walk on the treadmill. Both are good. Their speed and incline is much higher than I can do but of course you only go as fast and/or as high as you feel safe. Advanced would probably jog as fast as they do and maybe use greater incline... When I was finished with that portion, I was sweating and somewhat panting. After the 30 minutes they move on to exercises with weights, away from the treadmill. I would rather use another of my tapes after the first thirty minutes. The two women aren't as exciting during the last half hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good DVD","review":"Thanks to this DVD I am jogging for the first time in my life.

I feel disappointed every time I listen to this CD. This recording lacks the sharp, well defined sound one expects of a modern digital recording -- a problem that dramatically lessens the impact of the brisk and bubbly Maskarade Overture, and the opening march of Aladdin. Except perhaps for Nielsen's orchestral nocturne, Saga-Dream, the performances are never better than average."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS CD NOW!!!","review":"You won't be disappointed in this CD.

We were pulling on it together just like the boys on the box and at some point it got a small hole, which the manufacturer says is \\"no problem\\" and to just put a bandage on it.

I'm using it w/a Makita LS1214L which is a little big but regardless the stand has inherent problems. The locking base has a tendancy to unlock during transport. The more you move it around, the greater the chance the saw will detach. The support rests can be difficult to level with the saw table making intricate trim cuts somewhat of a problem. Finally, the wheel base is now bent from rolling the saw around.All-in-all, the stand is stable when in use but you have to be extra careful when in transport. If you wish to detach the saw everytime you relocate it, then the stand is acceptable. However, there are better compound miter saw stands in this price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy stand","review":"I bought this stand only because it was a Hitachi and was lighter than some others.

There are several odd, oddly compelling songs on here -- the first few songs are really catchy -- and plenty of sly roots-rocking riffs to enjoy. On a couple of tracks, Morlix indulges in lighthearted, guylike stupidity -- the penile, puerile \\"Big Eye\\" for example, is a mere throwaway -- but mostly this is a pretty solid album.

This statement includes the dreadful Neverending Story 3. The screenwriting is so bland as to narratively explain every step of the story, not allowing any personal interpretation to enter. The story is manipulated to the point that names and places become merely references to objects, and not the rich allegorical themes that Ende originally intended them to be. Unlike the cartoon series, which I recommend for its attempt to visualize people and places from the book not covered by the Warner Bros. movies, this movie repeatedly copies the first two movies without any inventions of its own (except a cute character named Flygirl, but that's another story, and shall be told another time...)

For example, the befreckled redhead, Bastian, has two close friends - a black-haired bespectacled boy, and a frizzy-haired brunette girl. Together, they engage in outrageous and downright ridiculous escapades between classes at their middle school... how much lower can you get? Ende set out to write a story which could stand by itself as a completely original story. And now it has been raped and twisted into this abomination!

There were plenty of times I cringed and wanted to throw things at the screen.NES-purity aside, there were magical moments, some really clever writing, a few characters I wanted to strangle just to shut them up, and a lot of plain old cheesy writing.

The Cinemascope (2.35:1) film is cropped down to 4:3 so the title of the movie barely fits on the screen, the picture is grainy and out of focus, and the color is drastically shifted to the right! Allied Artists' idea of digitally mastering is copying an Nth generation VHS tape to a hard drive and burning a DVD! I have the widescreen PAL version of this movie on DVD and even with PAL to NTSC conversion it is 1000 times better than this miserable excuse for a DVD!

Just saw a new version on e-bay and I am wondering if I will get hammered again if I buy it. If these companies are going to reissue a great film how about a first generation copy taken from the master and not from an old vhs copy. Artisian and Criterdon remaster great oldies.

This film is a fairly good story, although badly executed and with poor effects even for the early sixties, but it is very unfaithful to the book which actually focuses on the survival of a small number of survivors of a global calamity and the moral choices they face in how to deal with the millions of still alive, but doomed, blinded people. This film with its simplified story and happy ending does none of these things but is an average early 60s British SF film.

The premise is interesting and the acting isn't bad, but production quality is often embarrassing (mangy looking \\"triffids\\" obviously mounted on carts), the transfer to DVD is worse, and the added footage of the couple trapped in the lighthouse is just incongruous.

Poorly acted, and absolutely didn't follow anything in the book. Pity to write this, particularly after reading of the Producer/Director/Writer Philip Yordan's death at 99 the day after I saw the video. Incidentally, my copy of the video had a non-stop background of audio for a carwash liquid commercial, ad nauseum, for the entire 90 minutes of the movie. Irritating at the best.

Something went wrong, and it all fell apart. This movie isn't that story, although it shares the same name and has flesh-eating plants. Apparently it wasn't acceptable for our own technology to destroy us so the world goes blind from a meteor shower and the plants are from outer space. The acting is typical British for the era and genre, but nothing could have saved this movie. Others have mentioned the BBC mini-series that followed the book quite well, slowly ramping up the true horror of the situation. If you can find a copy get that instead. It's only available for the British market but it's worth finding an all-region DVD player for.

Triffids are asparagus-like creatures, (alien plants that appeared from nowhere) and take advantage of the blindness of humans. They've been waiting for this day for a long time. The book was very well done. The movie is fun, if a little amateurish. Do we survive or do the asparagus (Triffids) get their revenge for all that hollandaise sauce we've covered them in for years?

Those zippers are fine for short runs, but for 26\\"+ long leg zippers, they just can't stand up to regular usage. My Tourmaster jacket has a heavy duty primary zipper, and it works wonderfully. I just don't know why Tourmaster decided to go with these small-tooth zippers for the legs.To add insult to injury, the crotch of the pants was only waterproof for the first month or so.

Unfortunately much of the book is unabashed filler. Chapter 11 is titled \\"Accounting for Hedge Funds\\", but is instead a 15 page overview of the first week of Freshman level accounting. Chapter 15 takes ten pages to explain the obvious and intuitive parallels of hedge fund cash flows to options.

That is amazing, especially since all the evidence is that the single most important aspect of creating a successful hedge fund is the marketing side. I can't imagine why the book would deal with trading or corporate structures in the US sense. Most successful hedge funds are incorporated in other jurisdictions which often use different terminology. And, my dears, how useful is it to introduce an S-corp, a US IRS term and structure used primarily in real estate. Few hedge funds invest in real estate, and even fewer non-US jurisdictions recognize that peculiar tax creature.On top of all that, you don't even get paper, binding or book covers for your money.

There were only two projects in the whole book that even appealed to me; the aran armchair cover and the flower trimmed evening bag. If you have a more ecclectic flair you might find this book to your liking. The pictures in the book also tend to show a close up view of the project without showing you what the whole project looks like completed.

It's a challenging media but makes for an interesting fabric. Again, the author helps inspire you to think of knitting in a different way.The instructions for new knitters are kind of confusing and as a new knitter myself it is a little frustrating but I had never thought of using my knitting in such unique ways.

Although the projects are not for everyday practical items, being a creative sort rather than a practical sort, I found Simple Knits with a Twist encouraged thinking beyond the norm and also promoted recycling of items, such as plastic bags, and leftover yarn. It was helpful to me becaue although I love knitting and crocheting, I don't necessarily enjoy making the same \\"type\\" of items all the time, its just enjoyable to make something that is interesting, rather than practical.

This is a Must Read, for all Christians. We who have walked our spiritual path and searched for wisdom and clarity, have been thwarted by the \\"Thoughtform\\" of Satan that has been propogated by the church. We have been taught and held in the grip of fear, of Satan so have lived like drone's, swallowing the pablum of fear.Now we all have the opportunity to see the entity and personality and purpose of Satan. What a relief and healing I recieved especially in Section 2, chapters 2&3. Michael did incredible research regarding, Christian, Buddism, Neo-Pagan to bring it all together. It is worth the effort to read it all.I appreciate that she has done her academic studies with master degrees in Electrical Engineering and Mastered in Divinity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well made","review":"These shoes are beautiful.

If you are looking to learn to applique, this book is truly not the best help for you. No inspiration, in my opinion ... sorry to say.I donated my copy to the local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"DDR Ultramix 3","review":"The game is fun and pretty much what I expected based on the reviews I read of it. The one thing I liked that I did not expect based on reviews is that it does contain American based songs and not just Disco/Club type music. My one disappointment is that I expected some sort of noise or something when I stepped on a step to let me know I stepped on it. However the game does not support this that I can tell. This may be no shock to previous DDR owners but since this was my first getting used to the game is a little tough.Also, it is a little tricky figuring out how to play and hook up the Controllers/Dance Pad and the manual poorly describes how to do it. Again, previous DDR owners may laugh but this caused us some time trying to figure it out. I have several XBox games and have never had trouble but the dance pad made it a little tricky.Overall, the game is what it is and if you like the others then you should like this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION!!!","review":"Upon recieving DDR Ultramix 3 for the holidays as a gift, I was nothing short of thrilled! It had all the songs I could have hoped for; there was a large selection and all were fun and very upbeat. Plus, Ultramix 3 has many options, with up to five different skill levels (beginner, light, standard, heavy, and oni), a freestyle mode (which allows you to dance crazily and have a blast), and XBOX live. I really enjoyed DDR Ultramix 3. The game was fun and anyone--you, your friends, or your family--can take part in \\"dancing\\" to the amazing songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best so far on old xbox","review":"The song choice is great including some of the more classic songs from older DDR games like butterfly. One of my more favorites of the DDR series on xbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3","review":"I bought a Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 2 before and like it very much. Therefore, I decided to buy another one. This game turned out to be a huge disappointment. The music in this game must have come from two and/or three decades ago. If you want to dance on the latest music, this is not the one to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice VGA card","review":"This card is excellent and I give it high C/P value.

THE WORST LIVEPHISH ALBUM RELEASED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great versions of many songs, horns are great!","review":"This is my first Live Phish release, and I am glad that I looked at it above some of the more recent shows. I know that there isn't a lot of long jamming, but it's cool to hear the guys team up with the Country Horns because it makes for some excellent versions of awesome songs. A major highlight on this album is the Frankenstein. I have to agree that it is probably the best version ever released. Reba is definetly up there as one of the best ever too. The Gumbo>Mike's>Hydrogen>Weekapaug is spectacular with the horns! The jazzy tunes like Flat Fee, Donna Lee, and Moose make this album unique and were a rare find for me. And The Landlady is definetly better with the horns, not worse. An awesome album and a good recording too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss This One","review":"This is by far one my favorite Live Phish albums out there. Phish w/ the Giant Country Horns in NH. Probably the best version of the Landlady that I've ever heard (incredible guitar work). Buried Alive and Flat Fee really provide a nice jazzy groove. Sick versions of Bathtub Gin, Reba, Mike's Song, Gumbo, Tweezer and Suzy Greenberg. The Horns make this one more unique. Sound quality is great. Seriously, if you're a fan, and you don't have this one, get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salt'n Spice Nut","review":"I would like McCormick to start selling this Salt'n Spice in the stores.

McCormick. Shame on you. I have to eventually ween my self away from My everyday use of this is important to me and I cannot continue to pay this high amount which will force me to start making it myself.

This is a live recording, but Nobilissima and Metamorphoses are studio recordings. I still feel that Blomstedt's performance with the SF Symphony is the greatest version of Mathis. Blomstedt has the overall proportions judged to perfection. Abbado does a tremendous job, it's just that Blomstedt's performance was legendary. I still give Abbado 5 stars - a great job, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book is a great idea, but unfortunately it's almost useless. The book works like this: you search for any geographical location mentioned in the writings of Shakespeare, and a dictionary entry opens with info about that location. It even has entries for a lot more authors- Jonson, Marlowe, Fletcher, Beaumont, Milton, Donne...The problem is that the entries are largely gibberish. Here's an example---were the men whom Fate appointed To fall with thec in A/' In B, & F, Corinth iii, i , Crates charges Euphanes with putting up the tithes \\" of every office through A/' In Barry's Ram i., Teiresias is referred to as \\" the blind An* prophet:; as a matter of factIf you're lucky you'll find 2 sentences in a row that make sense, but the majority of entries are garbage.

If you want more love for Christ, pursue Him by practicing each of these every day. In every activity, in every contact, and in every thought, make Christ your focus. When you make Him your priority and love Christ with all your heart, soul, and strength, God is glorified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Youch... 52 dollars for some synthesized video game music... Well I would pay even more. If you've played Chrono Trigger, you should already have this, and if not, you should be clicking \\"Add To Cart\\" right now. Even if you haven't played the game, the plethora of beautiful and epic themes is still worth it. It is synthesized, but the way it's synthesized is so well done and charming that it doesn't matter. If you have the money- buy this soundtrack, wether you've played the game or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but scratched just a teensy bit","review":"Not as good as the Chrono Cross soundtrack, but a winner all the same.

I purchased mine a few years ago for over three times that much, still listen to it at least once a week. Great music that will never get old. Three thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty damn good for game music ^^","review":"I find most of Chrono Trigger's themes to be really catchy, and ones that'll stick in your head (but not to annoy you). Not only catchy, either... but also some really nice melodies. Generally, I find the music to be neither boring nor annoying - and they suits all the moods of the game well. (My personal favorites are the main Chrono Trigger theme, Frog's theme, Time Circuits, and Schalas theme) If you have this, buy Xenogears OST. If you have that, BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Squaresoft is so great, can they get any better?","review":"Squaresoft makes kick-butt games, and essentially, they have kick-butt music. The soundtrack to Chrono Trigger for the SuperNintendo is bold and romantic, while boasting adventerous attributes. I recommend getting any Squaresoft game, because they are ultimately the bomb. I bought an entire Playstation last week, just so I could play Final Fantasy VII. A $ bucks is a lot of cake for an unemployed me . That's how much Squaresoft rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Major recommends this music","review":"I am a music education major at Middle Tennesee State University and a member of Phi Mu Alpha a professional music fraternity and I think that this music is the best I have ever heard come out of a video game.

THAT'S what I think of this great soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's nothing like Squaresoft Music!","review":"This is undoubtedly some of the best video game music there is. Listening is an even more moving experience if you've played the game. Great for background music for whatever you're doing.

Then I discovered there was a soundtrack for it, and was overwhelmed with glee."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the straight dope","review":"The OSV (Original Sound Version) or soundtrack of that great RPG Chrono Trigger. Contains the exact songs from the game, but since it's not being pumped through the SNES it sounds a whole lot better.

I finally found the soundtrack at a anime store about a week ago, and I have one thing to say. It was worth my time searching for this soundtrack. It took me almost 6 years to get my hands on the soundtrack and the music is beautiful. It includes many of the sounds from the game. PLUS, it includes TWO tracks that were never released with the game; both unreleased tracks sound beautiful. I love this CD. This soundtrack is the perfect thing for any diehard Chrono Trigger fan! Get yours today! I'd give this CD 10 stars anytime! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hearty Good Product.","review":"The resident shar-pei here loves these treats.

Drake's revelation of the traditional removal of male plants to maximize production of female flower-tops took homegrown from being mostly what was smoked by those who couldn't find some good Mexican reefer to a commodity that today is, literally, worth its weight in gold on the black market.

This book is not like most. Few books can make enjoyable reading out of a story told many times before. It is hard to read the same praise and criticism over and over. Newfield's memoir is simple, truthful, and an excellent read.His writing isn't stuffy or obtuse, he is a journalist, not a historian. The book is short, but covers the last four years in some detail, and the last few months even closer.If you are sick of reading that RFK and JFK were perfect, or that they were decietful men who used and abused thier power, this is the book for you. Newfield's own Introduction will admit that he initially hated Bobby. Only through exposure did a deep admiration develop, although Bobby was still flawed.Read it- it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How not to perform Bruckner","review":"This cake did not work out. In fact, it was a stinker.One can easily reconstruct Uncle Claudio's recipe. Take an out-of-sorts Vienna Philharmonic. Urge them to observe the dynamic markings. Beat time. Highlight the occasional angularity. Grit one's teeth in contrapuntal passages. Keep the brass in check. Go full throttle at the end of the finale. Foolproof, eh?Rhapsodic works such as the Mahler Seventh might withstand such treatment - but not Bruckner. Unless a conductor has a feel for his long lines - to say nothing of an actual interpretative point - then a gelatinous curd will be forthcoming. So it is here.This misfire is actually more of a blot of Uncle Claudio's discography than his first Beethoven cycle with the Berlin Philharmonic (which DG astutely squirreled away).There is no such thing as a bad book. Similarly, this lacklustre performance offers instruction.It has a nice cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good canned fish at a good price","review":"Unlike Crown Prince Kipper Snacks, the Crown Prince Pink Salmon actually takes good, does not stink up the house, and is easy to open without fear of splashing fish juice everywhere.

I bought this for my cat that is on a very special needs diet. She didn't like it and I sure wouldn't eat it either. Looked like something I would wipe off the sink and throw away.

Not even for my cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste, great price","review":"What you get tastes great and comes at an excellent price. Low mercury, high protein, omegas, and the like. I make spicy salmon patties and eat what amounts to a can a day. Could not be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Low salt was the only benefit this product offered. The salmon itself was the center spine section. Lots of spine, lots of bones, lots of work to eat. Quite a mess and disappointment. Not the typical sections of salmon most of us are used to buying in either canned or smoked salmon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I try to eat salmon because it's supposed to be healthy when it's wild caught. I like that this is salt free, so I can add my own sea salt and use less. I called the company because I was worried about BPA in canned goods, but they said it is free of BPA, so that's good too. This is so much cheaper than fresh salmon. Nowhere near as good as fresh, but one of the better canned salmons I've eaten. I add some olive oil, apple cider vinegar, sea salt, and a few spices and I've really gotten to like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the shizz","review":"We love this canned salmon. Delish. Low in sodium. Very fresh tasting, considering it's from a can. And of course, it cannot be compared to wild caught fresh salmon. But it's a tasty alternative to the ubiquitous tuna fish.Even better, I can't find this brand and packaging in my local stores. So ordering this from Amazon is a major hoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me the skin & bones!","review":"Given a choice between fresh and canned I'd take fresh, of course. Given a choice between canned skinless/boneless & canned WITH skin/bones, WITH wins every time.The skin is where most of the Omega-3 fatty acids come from and the bones (which, as you become accustomed to eating them, become prized sought after morsels) contain a lot of calcium. I used to be disgusted by the bones, but now I absolutely love them.The Crown Prince brand is very good. Comparable to Trader Joe's wild caught sockeye Alaskan salmon & the Whole Foods 365 brand wild caught Alaskan salmon. Kirkland also now carries an alaskan salmon with skin & bones, but in olive oil (the one in the black can, not the bear & wolf). I like the salmon in water as I prefer my foods to be as little processed/whole as possible.

I recommend it to anyone trying to learn spanish, from basic to advanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had thought","review":"I thought this was a great book until I cross-referenced the other verbs in the back of the book. The pages listed for the model verbs are not all acurate. In fact most are very misplaced. The 501 verbs are correct as far as I know but the others in the book can be misleading. I am now having to cross-reference these verbs with a verb conjugator. I am not saying that this book hasn't been helpful. It is helpful in leaning many of the basic Spanish verbs, especially the irregular ones, but after 501, you are kind of own your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reference","review":"This book has all the conjugations of most common verbs in all of the fourteen tenses as well as several \\"moods\\". I didn't even know all the tenses and moods existed. Like the typical American I learned how to speak and what words to use when, but not why. This book is increasing my understanding of my own native language as I slowly learn Spanish.This is not a stand-alone book. You won't use it to learn Spanish but it is a great reference to supplement a course of study."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have","review":"A must have item for anyone seriously studying spanish.

As a bonus, at the back there is a short grammar appendix now as reference.Don't hesitate, get this book now if you want to know and be able to look up your conjugations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A completely overrated book only for basic needs","review":"I have to be one of the few reviewers who have felt compelled to rain on 501 SV parade and its rave accounts, but it just seems fair with respect to the overlooked competition. The 501 is clear but basic and repetitive. Indeed, it will serve the needs of those students who need to be shown \\"ad nauseam\\" (from the teacher's point of view...) how to conjugate a large list of -AR verbs with no internal stem change. Other students, faster, more curious and with more analytical skills, will need to conjugate a much larger variety of irregular verbs and will request much more bang for their buck. Those will benefit a whole lot more from the best in the field, \\"Spanish Verb Manual\\", from the excellent Passport Books series, by Alfredo González Hermoso. It is genuinely complete, with 5000 verbs, compact, clear, visually attractive, with many regional uses and expressions.

Unless you go to class with a suitcase on wheels, or a small forklift, it's a little bulky to cart around with all the other textbooks you need to have. However, when you're doing your homework it's indispensable. I would question the necessity of listing all the compound tenses, it seems repetitive to me, and missing these out would slim the volume by 50 percent and make it almost handbag size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book you can own on Spanish","review":"Quite simply there is no better book out there for the Spanish student. It gives the full conjugations for 501 verbs. It is so easy to use because of its simple but common sense approach. If you know of someone studying Spanish get this book for them. If you are going to start studying it get this book along with a dictionary and Pimsleur Spanish, your success will be guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Useful","review":"This book is great!

I completed the Spanish course at the State Department's Foreign Service Institute. It's a good course, but I don't know ANYONE who survived the pace without this book.I agree with some other reviewers who call it a crutch. For me, it's more like a wheelchair. But on the other hand, I can't count the number of times I'd have been flailing trying to remember say, conditional forms of sostener, por ejemplo.I wish someone would create that machine in THE MATRIX where they upload you with Spanish, but until then, it's going to take the old fashioned way.Take the plunge and buy this baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless, utterly useless","review":"This book has 501 verbs because it contains hundreds of regular verbs conjugated in an identical fashion over and over and over again.

Even just a 30 minute ride causes my rear end to hurt into the next day. It is a narrow saddle with very stiff pads. Although I do much of my riding standing up, it still causes my rear end to hurt a lot. I feel my butt bones digging through onto the narrow saddle.

I always loved slapstick scene with the animated suits of armor taking down the German army.But the movie is only loosely based on the book. The book takes its own, completely different direction.

Neither David Byron or Gary Thain play on this disc. I can understand people being mad if they bought this and had no track listing available. Castle knew what they were doing, as this comes with liner notes and photos of the included Heep line ups. That being said, this is still good Heep. This collection covers the '77 through '91 period, and as such, it's a nice sampler of the post Byron years up to that point. If you have little or no Heep from that era, it's an inexpensive way to give it a listen, or if you happen to be somewhere with no Heep on you, and see this in the bargain bin, it's a cheap fix. In any case, there's some good songs on this disc, especially the cuts with John Lawton, but it is not the line up on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful, intelligent love story","review":"I really enjoyed this film.

That is one of the mainstays of this series. You get good looks at Hakufu and Shimei in the nude. However, no Goei at all, and Ryofu only form behind.

So it's ideal for daywear and/or at work where you don't need an overpowering fragrance or want to smell like everyone else ! Despite the description it does have woody undertones that last the longest once the citrus disappears in a few minutes. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 since it only lasts through 2-3 hours. But it is definately breathtaking yet subtle the first hour ! Be careful that you don't mistakenly buy the Elixir de Merveilles (EDP) since it is much too fruity and floral and startlingly different from the Eau de Merveilles. Overall, I love this fragrance but may not buy it again since I would like something that lasts longer. But you do need to own it atleast once since it's really beautiful and different ...not the love of your life but pretty close to your first real crush !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful smell!","review":"Did I say smell?

This is Young Earth Creationism at its worst. It claims, as fact, so many fantasies of the creationist movement that I lost track counting. If you are a fundamentalist bible thumper who feels compelled to continue the lie of YEC, by all means this is the book for you.

They recorded three albums all are hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great book not particularly about the heart","review":"I bought this book thinking it would help me with opening my heart. I didn't find it helpful in that regard, despite the subtitle.There are many books out there with \\"heart\\" in the title, including several by the Dalai Lama's publishing company. In general,they turn out to be overviews of spiritual practices, which was the case with Cynthia's book. A lot of the time, the writer seems to feel that clearing out the negativity and learning to meditate has to come first. Perhaps it does. Nonetheless, I was disappointed with the Wisdom Way of Knowing, which was a much more accurate than the subtitle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Small in size but awesome in content, this pearl of wisdom belongs in every library.

The photos are great black and white shots of diners from across the country. The short-order cooks, the counters, the menus, the cakes under glass. The recipes are well written and work (so far!). I haven't got out of the pudding chapter yet (you have to try the Banana Caramel pudding) but I have my eye on the cakes, especially the Chocolate fudge Layer Cake. This is a really unusual book, and even if you have a big cookbook collection, you won't have anything like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique instrumentation","review":"Matson Jones is like Rasputina mixed with influences from riot girl bands. The vocals are melodic and not irritating like Sleater Kinney yet with the same energy and spunk. The cello/violin instrumentation add a distinct sound. The unpolished, garage aspects give it a punky edge but the vocal harmonies and classical string instruments offset the angst."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be better","review":"An interesting disk instrumentally given the reliance on dual (duel) cellos. However, vocals are typical contemporary atonal shrieking."},{"rating":"2","title":"dissapointing","review":"To me this game is kind of missleading. It says you can be every position on the team, technically you can but you are mainly the chasers (chasers score goals), by doing combo passes you get power ups. One of the power ups is the beater and you hold down X the computer hits the bludger and you controll where the bludger goes for a short period of time. you cant be the keeper (keeper block the ball from going through the hoops). The game is way to easy to beat. I only rented the game and I beat it. you cant choose wheather to go higher in the air or lower.

Comet 260-begginer, Nimbus 2000- a little harder, Nimbus 2001- hard, Firebolt-Expert. You also get to play in the Hogwarts cup and the quiditch world cup. Which is ver cool! I don't know why they didn't include ireland in the game but it is still good. At the begginging you have to do a 6 challenges and than you can start playing. You can also play in Exibition mode (2 player mode) Which is hard and fun if you are playing against someone who is just as good as you. P.S.

In addition to those, You can be teams representing countries from all over the world. A few of them are Germany, USA, Europe, SPain, The Nordic Team, and much more. The gameplay itself is very fun (if not too easy). However...The Harry Potter books, and the scenes in the movies depict Quiddutch as a chaotic, speeding fast, brutal game, which brings me to my one complaint about this game. The game does not put you in a game anything like that. It is much slower and more organized than it should be. But in the end, this is a very fun game that is fun to play every now and than."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"I think 90% of the music that comes out to day is garbage, so the fact that I gave this CD a 4 is something unique.This is a CD with profound lyrics or genius instrumentation but it has some good dance beats, some good harmonies, and some decent melodies. Soundwise, I would compare this group to 702, but with a bit more substance. It is sad that this group was overlooked while mediocre singers like Britney Spears clog up the radio.If you like this group or 702, another very underrated/unknown group I recommend is S.H.E. It's 5+ years old and is made up of three sisters (You might remember the youngest sister, Jamie Fox,who played \\"Judy Winslow\\", the younger daughter on the 1990s hit comedy, \\"Family Matters\\"). This had great harmonies and melodies, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start","review":"A good and steady soul debut.

The author considers everything learned before the early 19th century to be an accumulation of base knowledge that produced few practical benefits. He feels that it wasn't until the Industrial Age, with its development of machines and technology, that humankind was able to improve its standard of living significantly. He goes into detail about all fields of science, from the ancient Greeks to his own day. You have to be heavily into science to read and enjoy this book, but if you are you should find it to be an interesting compendium of the history of scientific knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Love it works great!

Each chapter offers a different individual's thoughts, written by such stars as Terrell Davis, Mike Shanahan, Brett Favre, Dan Reeves, and Clay Matthews (who played on the Cleveland Browns against the Broncos in 3 AFC Champonship Games).The only drawback is that the book appears to have been released before Super Bowl 33; so Dan Reeves comments don't include his thoughts on coaching *against* Elway in a Super bowl. A minor critique, though.

I had to repeatedly jam the jack in and out and jog the internal bridge so it would make contact again and allow sound through the speakers. It got to the point where I couldn't get sound at all. My attempts to repair resulted in bigger problems. I've had the radio roughly 6 months. I wrote Kaito detailing my problem in hopes they would provide a replacement at some sort of discount.

I assume the prices are updated, although I can't really tell because I can't compare them with the old edition (which was from the library).

There is an advertisement for some Flameware items and Flamingo Pink and Lime items that she has attributed to the 1940's, which is wrong! Although Flameware was produced then, the Flamingo Pink and Limeware weren't produced until 1952.

Less pretentious than Ferlenghetti and more perceptive than Ginsberg, his poems are like modern haiku, brilliant observations and juxtapositions that somehow manage to express what most artists simply cannot._Earth House Home_ is a collection of Snyder's prose, which happily enjoys the same distinction. It's an eclectic mix, with journal excerpts that read more like rough notes for poetry; book reviews that illuminate their subjects from unexpected angles; an account of day-to-day life at a Zen temple in Kyoto; and more, concluding with my favourite section, an almost Joycean account of Snyder's views on society and culture.Get this, any way you can.

I find this aspect rather apealling. The author takes the reader on a journey with the 15 year old Michael Berg & his 36 year old lover, Hanna. One day Hanna disappears and Michael has to wrestle with the question of \\"why?\\". He goes on to become a law student & unexpectedly discovers that Hanna is now on trial for a Nazi war crime. What happens after that is a series of unanswerable questions that Michael has to deal with and he doesn't seem to get any satisfaction one way or the other. The ending is both bittersweet and sad.

The language wasn't particularly difficult, but I'd imagine you'd have to have pretty good German (or a good dictionary and a lot of patience) to read it in its original language; it's no kids book.

Dorrestein does a fantastic job of drawing the reader into the daily lives of the Van Bemmel family. She tells their story matter-of-factly and without a trace of sentimentality but is still able to create powerfully moving and stunning tale. I do recommend Heart of Stone but with the small warning that your own heart may well break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"Is this a mystery? Or a horror story? I would say that it is a novel that is extremely well written. The life of the van Bemmel family is put together, piece by piece, as the book moves along. Rarely have the characters of a novel been painted in such detail that you are sure to know them from somewhere. And just when you thought that you had them figured out, the scenery changes. It all is very logical. But, after finishing the book, your thoughts will come back to it, wondering why things happened that way.

The story, told in flashbacks, deals with a family that, like many families, looks happy and content to outsiders but is actually coming apart for the participants. The heroine's present day pregnancy adds texture to the character and is the impetus that makes the heroine deal with the tragedy that afflicted her family.Well rounded as most of the characters are, I feel that the author could have done more with the father figure.

I never saw them perform this together, only individually.Having said that, the sound is so bad that I will probably continue to listen to Birgit/Bohm for Isolde and Vickers/Karajan for Tristan. How sad that they never recorded this together in the studio.The performances are great including the acting. Jon Vickers was one of the few people who could share a stage with Maria Callas and not get overshadowed.

Surely I am not the only one ??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth much money","review":"Sure the singing would be great if you could hear it. Really, this is interesting enough if it were to cost around $5.00 to see these amazing singers in these roles, but the sound is so bad, it's not fun to listen to, plus the camera work is bad, and really, the visuals are a bit macabre - Nilsson looks pretty odd in the bouffant wig, Vickers has alot of weird eye make-up on and Hesse's acting is dumb. If you could only hear it, that could all be forgiven, but you can't.

This DVD is well worth owning for the performances & the glorious singing by Nilsson & Vickers which is the most important quality of a VHS, DVD or CD.I am not waiting for the Eaglen 'Isolde' as I have found her 'Isolde' has no warmth, fire or passion & therefore very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Achtung! lousy sound ahead","review":"Considering that this perfomance is from 1973, the sound is awful, being on a par with a poor AM radio, and with numerous dropouts.

We tried a Snugli first, and my son would only want to stay in it for a max of about 10 minutes. In the wrap, he will hang out much longer. The grocery store, on walks, outings...he's totally content. It's also incredibly versatile and much easier on the back than the Snugli was. And don't be scared of the \\"wraping\\". It was totally easy to figure out.

If you watch the little video they give you with the wrap, it's easy to figure out how to use it. The problem is, when you start to put it on, it's one LOOONG piece of material -- the \\"tails\\" drag on the ground until you get it wrapped around you. So I never bothered wearing it outside the house, because unless I planned to keep it on all day, I would have to deal with the wrap getting dirty when I went to put it on.I personally found this carrier to be more comfortable to wear than the BabyBjorn,which I used with my first two children. However, by the time my baby was 4 months old, the stretchy fabric couldn't support his weight well enough and he would constantly slump down and I'd have to hoist him up to readjust the wrap. I'd have to readjust it at least every 5 minutes. So I just put it away and never used it again after that point. So the sling does have some bonuses, but I don't think it's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!!","review":"I loved this wrap conceptually -- believed the hype on Amazon and even saw a story on People mag about its creators. However, when it came time for me to get my wriggly little girl in the midst of a meltdown in it while I was alone, it was impossible. Plus, it's been in the high 80s/low 90s for what seems to be forever -- swaddling myself in 18 feet of T-shirt material is not my idea of a good time.Put your money toward a Baby Bjorn Sport if you want the extra support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to use.","review":"I didn't really use this so it was a waste of money.

It looked really great in the pictures, but when you put it on it just squeezes you in all the wrong places. My main complaint though was that my baby didn't take to it as much as I would have hoped and I might have tried harder to get her used to it, but the darn thing was so time consuming and complicated to put on that it just didn't seem worth it. My advice to parents looking for a great baby carrier is to get a tradtional cloth sling. I found mine online for less money, it's easy to use, just as versatile as this product and my daughter loves it. I carry her in it everywhere I go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Disappointing- not worth $40. Didn't realize it's just a long cloth you wrap around and around your torso that takes a long time to put on, esp while the baby is crying. I find I still need to use one hand to support my newborn's head, so it's not that helpful. However, it does do a good job of distributing baby's weight and minimizing backaches. I just got a baby sling (posh papoose) that's much more convenient- arrived in the box assembled and ready to go. Sorry to be critical but don't feel this product is worth your money- better spent with a Snugli or a sling."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I paid extra shipping to receive this item. I couldn't wait for it's arrival - even after reading some reviews that it was cumbersome. I didn't measure, but imagine approximately 20 feet of material that you must wrap around your body. That is what you must do to use this item. Is it \\"difficult\\"? No. But it is quite a pain. What's worse is that because it is stretchy material, it stretches the longer you wear it. I do not trust it to support my baby -- and there is definitely no head support for little ones when inward facing. The sling causes other issues. Once it's tight enough to hold baby somewhere *above* your waist, there's no room for baby to be comfortable.This item freed up one hand -- at best. I could have managed the cumbersome \\"application,\\" but the end result isn't even satisfactory. I am very disappointed in this product -- no wonder I couldn't find it in stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not secure enough & too bouncy","review":"This wrap is easy to use & fairly comfortable, except that you are constantly having to adjust it tighter. The pocket in the front seems great at first, but then starts creating little holes in the wrap at the pockets corners.

I knew how to put the thing on. I'd been doing it for 6 months by this time. That was not the problem. Thankfully, my hands were up by him and my friend was standing next to me and we caught him.

I watched the video and did not have any problems putting the wrap on in less than a minute. I did however have problems with two out of five positions that it advertises. When I put my baby in it facing out, his circulation in his legs always gets cut off. If I loosen the straps, I feel like he's going to fall out. I was terrified when my husband noticed that his legs were turning blue! I also hate the sling position. You are supposed to be able to nurse in the sling, but it is impossible! Same problem, it's always too tight and he's suffocated or too loose and you have to hold his head the whole time. I do like the wrap for the facing in position, but that's it for now.

It will take several minutes longer to put it on, but I have 2 small children so either one can ride in depending on who needs it more. If my 2 month old is sleeping I can leave her in her carseat and hook her to the single stroller and strap my 2 year old (she's only 22lbs) to my hip.

The other reviewers are right--you need to be a Houdini to put this thing on properly.

I managed to get my 3 week old baby into the thing but he was almost suffocated by the excessive cloth, and most of all, was being poisoned by the toxic-smelling fabric that the thing was made of.

I was also attracted to the many different positions for carrying the baby. After taking it home and trying this baby wrap we were quite disappointed. The material is so long that it has to drag on the floor in order to wrap it and of course it will get dirt on it from dragging on the floor which will be on the baby and yourself. Not to sterile. The carrier does not seem secure at all in any position. Not safe for the baby the product is to flimsy and can move and the baby can fall out. Get a regular carrier that works for you but make sure you try them on at the store to get a better idea of how it fits on your body and where babys head will end up being.

The problem for me was as a Baby Bjorn user, I had the idea from the picture that it was a more fitted item. I didn't realize that I'd have to wrap about 7 feet of cloth around me in order to use it. This had my husband laughing when I explained I paid $40 for a long piece of cloth. To put it on, it means draping most of it on the ground while wrapping begins. Not something to do in a store, parking lot, or even on my kitchen floor. The upshot is that you can abosrb up all manner spills off the floor while putting your baby on. Fabulous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste time, money","review":"Recieved this as a gift, yesterday, will be returning it today. Comes with a video, because to actually USE it is so convoluted, not to mention, time-consuming. If you have a crying baby, spending 10 minutes trying to wrap this GIGANTIC piece of heavy cloth around yourself isn't going to work.Not to mention, I used the directions twice to wrap the thing, and both times, the stuffed animal I placed in it FELL OUT. It is also VERY thick cloth and is extrememly hot.SO, if you are in a hurry and make a small miscalulation with the tension of the wrap, you will eather drop the child out of the bottom, OR smother the baby.

What a mistake. After attempting to get the thing strapped on me tightly about 20 times and putting my baby in then out then in again then out again...my baby was still in no way properly supported by this stretchy piece of fabric. I had to hold my baby the entire time she was in it because it felt like she was going to fall right out. Not only that, but in the picture, it looks like a classy and neat navy sling.

Everytime I would put my 17 lb. baby in the carrier after about 20 minutes of toting her around she would be down to my knees.

This is by far the best carrier for a newborn. My baby's a bit over a month and she LOVES the feel of this wrap.Why I love it:- snuggles baby closely to you so that she feels that she's being held (vs. something like the Bjorn)- made of lightweight cotton so that your baby doesn't overheat as she will in other carriers- cotton is somewhat stretchy so that it's a comfortable fit for mom and baby- long cloth is wrapped around baby three times so that baby is VERY secure (I'm still cautious though. I have a hand on her when I go for a walk and when I bend down (bend down without leaning over always)).- frees both hands to say, write product reviews on-lineI still use a stroller for long walks, as no carrier can honestly say it puts NO strain on your back. The Active Bjorn does seem better in this regard, but it's not nearly as comfy for baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Cent!","review":"My Peanut is now 13 months old and we both LOVE this carrier.

Fabulous!I will admit that it is a bit cumbersome to put on as the fabric is extremely long and drags on the ground as you are wrapping it.

But if I'm reading about something that's close to reality -- with real places, real creatures, well gosh darn it, but I'd want things to be realistic. And fifteen-year-old Cindy winning a Grade I Stakes race like the Dubai World Cup when she'd only ridden in two previous races was just so -- blegh. Nevermind that I have issues with Champion, but I never did like Cindy either. I very much preferred the books that Joanna Campebell wrote -- they were realistic in many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!! I wish everyone would stop complaining about Cindy. You can't just say \\"good guy and bad guy\\" you have to see it from her point of view, besides I think Cindy was on the faster horse, afterall he won the Triple Crown."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked Joanna Campbell's stories much better.......","review":"I didn't really like this book because practically 12 books were all on Cindy, Cindy, Cindy. She acted like a brat at the track in Arabia, saying Champion was \\"her horse.\\" why did Ashleigh ever let her ride Champion anyway? It was obvious Champion was going to win, and this book is all about dating this ugly guy named Max."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT THOROUGHBRED!!!!!","review":"What is happening? I HATE the new authors. They have sucked the life out of the TB series! What happend to the littel orphan girl who was afarid to talk to eneyone?? Cindys so good she can tell wats wrong with a horse when Ashley can't!! Ashley is my fav. character. Later in the series Ashley is a hard, uncareing,workacholic person! That is NOT the Ashley I used to read about. How can the do that to her? It's like putting someome else in Ashley's body. She wouldn't yell at eneyone(except Caroline).All the old characters have vanished or totally changed. None of that can be changed now! I'm vvvveeerrryyy happy Jonna is back. The series has to turn around now, it can't get eney worse it's not possiable.:("},{"rating":"1","title":"I never cared for Cindy much...","review":"I love Thoroughbred but I have to say that this is one of my least favorites. I agree with another review that said every horse Cindy rides and/or trains becomes a superhorse! And after Glory it's: Bye, bye! Thank you for playing. Now I'm going to go be with Storm. Then it's Champion etc. I stick with books about Ashleigh, Samantha and Christina because by what's written, I know that they really love their horses. But at least Cindy praises Champion after the Dubai World Cup. I recommend the Ashleigh series and all of the other books about Ashleigh, Christina and Samantha. But if you like Champion like I do, then you should read this book. It shows the Champion spirit that I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Real!!","review":"Cindy is acting so stuck-up just because she is a jocky.

One of my favorite books was wonder's challenge, and that I thought was written very well. Cindy sickens me sometimes. I cant belive that she would ever win by so many lengths! I think that the writers make it seem so easy to win one of the hardest races in the world. And sometimes Cindy can seem really snobby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on...","review":"Yeah right, like Cindy can ride in the most prestigious horse race in the world, after just getting her jockey's licese, what, a month ago?

The spoiled, self centered, and other words that I don't deem appropriate to be writen about of a book of this calibur, is, in a sense, discusting. I would not recommend a book like this to anyone. Child's book or not. Children shouldn't read about people like Cindy because we would get just that. Cindy. Cindy wants this, Cindy NEEDS that. I don't want to read crap like this. It's a book about what Cindy wants, not about the horse, or the setbacks, which are non existent. Some people may like unrealistic blabber, not I. I stopped this series way before it got out of hand (I believe that was the book about Glory's first record setting race). And I've stayed the heck away from them since. Those that keep complaining that the books are crap, well, they probably won't get any better. If you want a good racing series then why not amuse yourself and write your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big surprise","review":"Hey, guess what? The beauitful, wonderful, and otherwise PERFECT Cindy McLean has done it again! She suddenly turned into the best jockey in the world, riding the best horse in the world (consequently Wonder's Champion) to victory in the most prestigious race in the world! What is with this? Do these people have no bad luck? Every time she wants something, she gets it! Give me a break! How often is an aprrentice who lost their first race allowed to ride a Triple Crown winner?

It was interesting to find out so much about Cindy. I didn't give it a ten because Cindy is, well.....EXTREMELY SPOILED! She doesn't even care about Clover when they reunite! Cindy bottle-fed Clover and now she doesn't care? I think Cindy needs to learn life is not just about winning. I do think though that this was one of Karen Bentley's better books. I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HAVE QUESTIONS","review":"Now, in the last book Wonder's Champion (and I really don't like that name, very uncreative) was winning the Triple Crown. Amazing feat, yadda, yadda . . . and suddenly he's in the Dubai World Cup. Now, most of us horse racing fans will realize that the Dubai World Cup is in March. The Triple Crown is in May and June (Kentucky derby: May 2, Preakness: May 16, Belmont: June 6). So, you are practically missing about a year between these races. Why not send him to the Breeder's Cup, there's another book( where I predict he would have won effortlessly). What's up with that? I guess it really doesn't matter because after this book Wonder's Champion disappears anyway. But I guess the writer really wanted Cindy to turn 16 and couldn't wait any longer. And it isn't realistic that Cindy comes along and, after 3 races, wins the Dubai. It doesn't work that way. So I guess Wonder's Champion was to good for the Breeder's Cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks!","review":"I love The TB series but I hate Karen Bently! She has toally ruined the series!

Cindy is a winning-obsessed whiny brat, Champion is suddenly a perfect mannered gentlman, and Ashleigh doesn't even act like the old Ash. Plus, I can't believe Cindy won the race! I agree w/ Ben's father in what he said in CDA about the Dubai World Cup. Champion won in spite of Cindy, not b/c of her. And since when is the track that hosts the Dubai World Cup (can't quiet remember the name) made of sand? It's supposed to be a lot like the Churchill Downs track, which Champion handled fine.If you must read this book, buy is used or better yet, get it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well....","review":"Okay, I can't say this is the best book. I mean, come on. Cindy beats Ashleigh in some really important race? And it's Cindy's second or third race! Cindy didn't deserve to win that race. No offense to Champion, he's great. But in her first race she's in tears because she lost! Sore loser. But like I said, Champion's great and I like reading about him. So if you like Champion, then you should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Cindy Can We Say, SPOILED?","review":"Cindy is such a brat. All she thinks about is winning. Umm can we say spoiled? What she needs to do is just shut up about Champion always winning. He is not even undefeated. What happened to the little orphan girl that never won anything in her life? How can Max even stand her? And then Cindy gets all upset becuse Ashleigh told her Champion wasn't Cindy's. She only told her the truth. Then she goes from champion racer to champion racer. What happened to Glory, Pride, Glory's Joy, etc.? Did they mysteriously dissappear? If you ask me Cindy is not a good sport. I mean think about when she lost her first race. When she spun on her heal and left as the winning jockey was about to give her a tip. Geeze!!! Yet a good plot and all. But it was too predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glasses are junk and so is the company","review":"My wife bought me the wireless glasses for Christmas of this year. Suprise No. 1, the company sent the wired version. We returned the wired version (shipping for the return came out of my pocket) and the wireless ones were soon received. The wireless version would not work properly with any game I had. The glasses would barely hold in the batteries and the Nvidia Stereo drivers wouldn't work well with them either. The company then told me that they do not offer refunds for any products purchased through Amazon.

I checked all inputs and since this is a HD LCD the svideo and RF are not the best to use and looked a bit washed out.

This game just didn't do it for me. The graphics are pretty cool but... I get very frustrated after playing this for a while. One reason is there are little stones always in your way, and the simplest things such as walking onto a bridge are immpossible. Also, it seems very hard to beat a level. I play this game sometimes, but not that often, only when I am extremly bored. One cool thing about it though is that you can pick what character you want to be, Eowyn, Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo, Legolas, Gimli etc. So out of a ten, this game gets a 4 or 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GAME","review":"this is awsome but get strategies from game faqs.com hit you need level 20 to eat the game gimly is the best andlevel up indwarven halls with spiders.this game rocks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Despicable","review":"This game has the absolute worst gameplay ever, third person gameplay can rarely be amazing, and here it just plain stinks.

I have a Playstation 2 which can read practically any type of digital disc known to man without problems, but it can't read this. It's not just one disc, either. All of the discs had problems. I believe that this is a result of the two-sided disc, because try as I might, I couldn't find a single scratch on any of the discs and after I cleaned them thoroughly, they continued to skip in the same exact places.

I don't see it today, so I'll try again. This book is not that great in one respect: History has changed a lot in the last decade, and it seems this book has not been updated in terms of content since its first edition of 1974. To give you an example, author relies on Vasari, a serious gossipmonger, a man of his times. How can a modern historian rely on a bad biographer and still sell well?

We meet Medici's who become Pope even though their only qualifications seem to be that they were Medici's. Hibbert also introduces us to their lethal competitors, the Pazzi family.

It didn't happen. The story isn't here and the character development doesn't happen. You have to watch the extra on the DVD where the director \\"explains\\" the movie. It's helpful, as the movie isn't all that clear.I'd stay away from this. It's a nicely shot and well put-together film in search of a meaning and lacking a story.

This was okay.In the second part, Scott is narrating while he does a workout. This is where the real problem is. He tells you what he is doing AFTER he begins a new movement. His instruction lags behind the video, this causes the viewer to get confused.Also, I was really put off by all the pseudo spiritual stuff.

I've been hoping for years that they'd create a Quidditch game and this one is well worth the wait. The action is fast and fun, and it's surprisingly easy to handle being the chasers, beaters, keeper and seeker all at once. The gameplay is well crafted, as are the graphics, and the different Quidditch stadiums are wonderful to see. The game starts off very easy, but higher levels of difficulty are quickly unlocked. What I find lacking is background information, I wish there was a roster you could check out to learn about each of the team members and different Quidditch teams' strengths and weaknesses. That would be a nice addition to a sequel game, and would make Quidditch seem even more real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all","review":"I just purchased this game and I have to admit that I am already addicted to it.

Yes, I'm a Harry Potter nut, so the opportunity to play Quidditch was one I could not pass up. And unlike the other Harry Potter games, this one takes you beyond Hogwarts and into the Wizard world with it's favorite sport.

My $40 radio shack speakers blow this thing away. The only difference between the Center channel and the towers is the mounting system and the orientation of the label on the grill. These are definitely not rated at RMS rating that they say that they are. I have mine hooked up to an onkyo 120 watt RMS reciever and they begin to pop and distort at about 1/3 volume. The Center and towers look pretty, but they don't perform like they should.

The synthetics really help make the songs spectacular and bring out the pleasant, creative melodies in each of them. I don't think I'll be getting sick of the tunes for a while. Another thing to be noted are the haunting vocals, from the bittersweet voice that sings \\"Nevermore\\" to the energetic and mysterious lyrics of \\"In the Dark.\\" If only the lyrics had made more sense I would give this album five stars, but the simply great musicality in the songs is more than enough to sway you over.

I expected it to be a bit dry and slightly dated, but it comes across as entertaining and a lively collection of historical anecdotes from this time period. The scope of the book is much broader than Arnold Rothstein himself, and gives a big picture of Tammany Hall, Sarasota, and the political landscape of America. For those disillusioned by the current state of big city politics (i.e. Rod Blagojevich, Tony Rezko, George Ryan) it's a reminder that in the words of Mark Twain \\"while history doesn't often repeat, it does rhyme\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Sportsman","review":"The Brain was a character I would of liked to have met.

I thought I couln't have too many Toscas either. Wrong! Buying this was a waste of money. Cura is mediocre at best and Patane is just embarrassing! Terrible voice! The acting was lousy as well. Cura is often looking amused at the wrong times and wonder if he found this entire thing a fiasco as well. He seemed to be laughing internally at Patane's performance, (if you can call it a performance). The only surprise is that anyone liked this Tosca at all. Any other Tosca is better than this and the original movie with Domingo is perhaps still the best available on video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Audio and Mostly Poor Singing","review":"What was good? Jose Cura. What was bad? Just about everything else. It is amazing that audio recordings this bad actually get to market. When played in 5.1 there is way too much sound coming from the rear speakers. The voices are over recorded to the point where distortion occurs on higher and louder notes. As far as the singing is concerned, it is laughable to suggest the role of Tosca could have been written for Patane. Just not a pleasant sound.

In the husbandry volume, they cover everything from proper housing to diet with examples and photos of what to look for if something is incorrect and the reptile is ill.

She then grows up to find herself living out the same pattern. Should she stay in an unhappy marriage to protect her son from a childhood similar to hers or should she persue her own happiness.The story is written in such a way that the reader becomes completely involved in this moral dilemma, and forces you to think about your own choices in life. We've all been faced with them, should we go for the choice that's most convenient,or the one that may please others , or the one that may make us happiest but be the most disruptive for those around us.

I like racing sounds. I don't know why they insist on trying to create \\"tension\\" or \\"excitement\\" with lame techno music on racing DVDs.Also, the pole lap video with on-board-view watched by the driver on a flat screen tv was kinda annoying(not consistently done either).

First, there is barley any scent to it unlike the scented NIVEA. Second, the Proraso is more watery than the NIVEA. Finally, I did not notice any better result or feel using the Proraso. I did expect that for $17 for 3.4 fluid ounces that I would get a better feel and result from the aftershave.

It starts getting irritated after day one. But, I put some of this Proraso Liquid Cream after shave on and it's magic. It minimized my razor bumps and irritations and my face felt incredibly smooth and comfortable. This stuff is magic in the fact that it soothes your face and keeps it from getting irritated.Why?

This product is quite soothing on the skin, and I like it for that. However, I am a man who prefers not to wear any scent, and I find the floral fragrance too strong for my taste. The fragrance does dissipate, but not as quickly or completely as I had expected from other reviews.So, although the stuff feels good on the skin, I won't be ordering more of it. Perhaps I can find a similar, but unscented product; if not, I'll just use plain witch hazel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish this worked","review":"This is a cool set. Loved that it came with so many pieces. However the bridle broke immediately out of the packaging. Five minutes later the blanket straps broke.

This is a really neat set just wish it could actually be used on a Breyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth purchasing","review":"Bought this DVD for my Dad who is a Red Skelton fan from years ago. He said the first DVD was fine, but the others were just plain bad - not even worth watching. Very disappointing since this was a birthday gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"Wow! All these good reviews. Frankly I thought the narrative was a mess. It only evades one star because Marlowe does, indeed, give us a wonderful examination of the Poe's marriage and \\"real life\\".The biographical aspects are well done. The point, I suppose, was to view inside Poe's mind at the end. Frankly it was so confusing the tragic end of Poe gets hopelessly lost in the prose.The rest? The first half was much easier to follow than the second half. Honestly I finished the book because of the good reviews and because I have this thing about finishing books I have started. It was like reading jabberwocky. This is not a long book but I fought to finish it. Sorry I did not like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much for the price","review":"Fortunately I bought this book through a used dealer on Amazon, as it is not worth the original price. At the time it was written I'm sure it presented unique ideas, but today all of the information, such as making a brew kettle from a keg, and mash tun from a cooler, is available in other books, home brewing magazines, or free on the web. I sought it out and bought it out of curiosity because it was mentioned in another book. It is suitable as a historical reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CDs I have ever heard...","review":"I have very eclectic tastes in music. Ranging from World, dance, industrial, classical, pop, punk, metal, you name it, I have probably heard some of it. I looked at the cover of this particular album, \\"Gee, I wonder what being in the Playboy mansion's like. Maybe this Album will help me figure it out.\\" I grabbed it, and played it when I got home. I played it on the computer, read the description... LOVED it. The first disc is the perfect album to get you into a chilling clubbing mood, with some funky tunes, jazzy beats with synthesizers, and very classy electronica.The second dics is just what you need to hear when you want to wind down, alone or with someone else. Mid-Eastern beats, soothing voices that sing relaxing sweet-nothings...Just because it says \\"Chillin at the Playboy Mansion\\" doesn't it mean that it will be perverted. You'll be surprised, and maybe expect Hugh Heffner to send you an invitation to his pad, just to listen to the music they'll play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive","review":"This exact same set is sold for $3 at Wal-Mart.

The first 3 levels are wut Two Towers mainly was, challenging, but not hard. Once you beat Path to Isengard, Path of the Wizard (Gandalf's levles) are brutal. The main factor to losing is the inability to run straight ahead. I've had to try Top of the Wall over 5 times and still no success b/c You can only run when angled. Another poor factor to the game is u can only replay levels once u beat the last level (Crack of Doom). If you don't mind endless tries on levels and the awful secret characters (Merry in Rohan armor, Pippin in Gondor armor, and Faramir). Note: Unlike the Two Towers game, you have to have beaten the game to use cheats like Restore Helth, Arrows, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game...","review":"This game is very good way much better than TTT...it has some new features for example co-op mode,new playable characters such as Gandalf the white(FINALLY)Samwise Gamgee,Frodo Baggins and as usual Gimli,Arargorn and Legolas.This game has really good grafics and great sound.There is about 13 or 12 levels plus secret levels and 3 secret characters....some very good improvements in grafics and other gameplay stuff...for example the new upgrades and abilities of all the charcters...I Would give it 9 out of 10...very good game"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Swordfighting on game","review":"Great swordfighting, swuch as blades clashing, awesome graphics.As Legolas you have cool moves.

I am huge gamer, and I pride myself on the large variety of video games I have played. But this game's difficulty is just ridiculus for (what the manufacturers call) 'easy'. I played the section on Minas Tirith appx. 45 times, and MADE ABSOLUTELY NO HEADWAY. Perhaps I'm simply bad at this game, but I think some other fans will agree with me that this was not nearly difficult as Fellowship of the Ring or Two Towers.Overall: 4/10 Sorry, but what good are graphics/plot if you can't go three levels without dying???"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's All Been Done Before","review":"I will admit, I am slightly biased, because nothing about The Lord of the Rings appeals to me. However, I played through the first two games, and found them ejoyable and stunningly rendered.Yet this third installment offers absolutely nothing new. If you have played \\"Fellowship\\" and \\"Towers,\\" you will know what this game is, what it will look like, and how it will play. Nothing has changed. The graphics are beautiful, but we have seen that in the last two. If something happens twice, it ceases to be amazing.I tried not to let my bias affect my view. I could not, however, enjoy playing the same game for the third time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Action Game","review":"This game is a good action game. The controls are easy to use and the levels are detailed and interactive. There isn't much blood except for the orcs' black blood. The game has minimal gore so it is appropiate for kids 10 and up. You can be Aragorn, Gimli, Legalos, Gandalf, and the hobbits. I won't tell any of the secret characters in order to keep the excitement. I would definitly recommend this game for any Lord of the Rings fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely LOVE this game!!","review":"I usually don't play games much and I usually avoid 'hack and slash' games, but this one is very fun! I have to say that is a pretty hard game. I have made it through on easy, normal, and hard, but I still have trouble with the palantirs of Sauron and Saruman without cheats. While it can be extremely frustrating to finish the game; the pure fun comes from re-playing all those levels with different characters and building your characters up to the highest experience level (which is 20). When you're that high, you can just plow through anybody on any level. I very much enjoy the levels of Minas Tirith (Top of the Wall and The Courtyard) just because they are incredibly crazy with non-stop action. I never get tired of playing The Pelennor Fields and the Black Gate; they are just so much fun and intense. A very good game that keeps me coming back for more even though I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I got this game for my birthday and it's the best game I have played. My mom doesn't buy just any game for the gamecube - it has to be worth it for her to spend money. For anyone thinking about getting it - get it! I really like the fact that I can play the game with my sister. The graphics are awesome. It's just a great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uber cool","review":"This game is 10 times as good as the Two Towers. (And that wasn't that bad of a game). Most of the upgrades are Superific and the controls are simple to learn but hard to master. When it comes to hack and slash games this is a noncomformist for sher. Unlike other games of its type, it has a very intricate plot. Furthermore, I have spent countless hours playing the game. (It took me only 15 to beat it once, but the replay value is very high) The 2 player mode makes the game that much better.!!SO CLICK AND BUY THIS GAME NOW!!You will not be disappointed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Mess","review":"This game SUCKS. The first four stages involve fighting the armies of the dead (e.g. ghosts) from a severely distant camera angle, and the lighting is so subtle and arbitrary that you cannot tell when the ghosts are invincible and when you can hit them. You also can barely tell who is who during co-op mode because the camera is so far away. I loved the Two Towers game and beat it using all 3 characters, and I am unable to progress at all in this one, even in easy mode. I do not understand why the developers took such a dramatic turn in the gameplay here. It's an incredible disappointment. If I wanted this kind of nonsense I could have just gone to Lucas(f)Arts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive book, but poorly structured and edited","review":"This book is sort of odd. It starts off as a brisk chapter by chapter ode to elements of adobe houses. But it ends with an inordinate amount of space dedicated to one contemporary house that is somewhat related to the houses discussed throughout the bulk of the book.Not enough space is spent discussing any one element of adobe houses, so it should be considered something of a small, short coffee table book.I liked the book I don't really even understand why the word \\"small\\" is in the title since it doesn't even discuss the concept of small houses in any seriousness.Its most redeeming feature is that it has attractive photographs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Choice","review":"In comparison to other books available about adobe houses, the content of this book offers little range and depth.

This recent live reunion(featuring drummer Simon Kirke as well), shows his voice and the band's blend of soul and rock has aged well. The absence of original guitarist Mick Ralphs is a letdown, but his place is filled admirably by longtime sideman \\"Bucket\\" Colwell. Rodgers smokey voice is in full form on \\"Rock Steady\\" and \\"Burnin' Sky.\\" On other songs, like \\"Rock And Roll Fantasy\\" and the Free classic \\"All Right Now\\" he lets the crowd take the chorus. Most of the time on live records this kind of thing is corny, but here the crowd is so loud you can still hear every word.

Simply put is another song close to my heart,Some churches and people get caught up in all the clever cliches and glamour and glitz but \\"Simply Put\\" reminds us It's about Jesus and his mission to love and save us!

Kieran and Fortune were not one of my favorite Bertrice Small couples, but I enjoyed reading about them. I was suprised at how quickly they fell in love with each other.

Neither the hero nor the heroine is at all interesting, and their decisions drag on and on and on. The tangential stories are no better, with little or no character development. Small must be writing to deadline, because her secondary characters are all repetitions of earlier characters.Lately, it seems as if each of Bertrice Small's books has been worse than its predecessor. She hasn't had an interesting heroine since the books focusing on Jasmine (and the last of those was pretty weak). Maybe it's time to let the O'Malley descendents rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good!","review":"I agree with most of the other reviewers. Small's books haven't been so hot for the last few novels, but this one is much more like some of her really good books! Jasmine is back to herself, and actually, just hearing Fortune's and Jasmine's rememberances of India's escapades gave me a better impression of that book (Bedazzled). I might give it a re-read now.All in all, this book is much more like the other Skye O'Malley books (although there are no harems or rapes). The voice and quality of storytelling is very good.P.S. I agree with someone else who said the little kidnapping toward the end was unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks good but messy","review":"Bought this for a reasonable price and were amazed at how much dirt it picked up that our old vac did not get. The main reason we bought a new vac was for allergy filtration with the new HEPA filters that you can now get in a reasonably priced machine. The problem was, when we had to empty the canister after the first time we cleaned there was so much dust in the air. We had to shake and hit the filter to get the dust off of it, and that created a bigger dust cloud. We were sneezing and coughing for some time. So we took it back the next day.I have never written a review before and felt I needed to warn others of this. I use reviews for my shopping and found this machine hightly rated and bought it.

The dust collecting container works better than the Hoover.

Cram is a compilation of the letters of Union Sergeant George F. Cram's letters that reveal an educated young man's experiences as part of Sherman's army during the American Civil War. Advancing through the Confederacy with the 105th Illinois Infantry Regiment, Cram engaged in a number of key conflicts, including Sherman's famous \\"march to the sea\\". Cram wrote candid, literate letters conveying insights into the social dimensions of the Civil War. His writings are characterized by piercing objectivity, optimism, and a dry sense of humor. His vivid depictions of the campaigns in Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas are a superb and substantial contribution to Civil War studies. Soldiering With Sherman is an informative, engaging, and core title for any personal, academic, or community library Civil War studies collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Solid!","review":"That's right, Warrant! Jani Lane knew it was time to grow up and start making more personal and tighter music and they did just that. They experiment with grunge and also retain their pop metal sound. The first three tracks are a prime example of them crossing over into grunge. Family Picnic, one of the album's finest cuts is their best heavier song they have ever done. Stronger now is easily my favorite here, a delicately and perfectly played acoustic guitars. Jani Lane's voice is also improving with each and every album. You can definitely hear the range on Family Picnic and Sum of One. There are a couple of just OK, but I can listen to every song. Ultraphobic found the median between grunge and pop metal and it is their only truly solid record. Good Job Jani Lane!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warrant - 'Ultraphobic' (CMC International) 2 1/2 stars","review":"Better than their 'Live 1886-97' disc(see my review),'Ultraphobia' was their fourth release.Seriously,Warrant never will match the success of their first two CD's.This disc,anyway seems to be a bit bluesy and even a pinch heavier than their three prior offerings.Tunes that may take one by surprise are \\"Crawl Space\\",\\"Undertow\\",\\"Family Pinic\\" and maybe \\"Stronger Now\\".If you liked Warrant's first two lp's,you should get something from this CD.Give it a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Muddy music, boringly simplistic lyrics and an emotional level that brings to mind something recorded at gunpoint: this is Ultraphobic.

Basically a transparent, and badly done, attempt to curry radio favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"Sometimes it's a good thing when old school bands try to change their signature sounds. I thought Slang from Def Leppard and Generation Swine from Motley Crue were great albums. However, the reason that those albums were so great was because the bands were experimenting with new sounds as musicians. The change in Warrant's sound in this case was simply an 80's hair band trying to change with the times and fit into a musical genre that they really didn't want to be in. To put it bluntly, they failed miserably. It's about the same failure with the grunge sound that Motley Crue had with their self titled album with John Corabi. If you are a fan of Warrant's hair band days, odds are that you will really dislike this attempt at fitting in with the 90's trends in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instrumental Music By Clannad","review":"If you expect to hear Maire sing, you will be disapointed with this album.

First of all, the sound quality is really, really poor. You can compare The ABBA Definitive Collection, and that's something better. That has been good performed, seriously.

Yes, Ripper is awesome, and has breathed new life into the band, but the SONGS! Comparing this crap to \\"Victim of Changes\\" or \\"The Sentinel\\" is a joke. Also, Tipton and Downing's talents are hidden in a wall of noise.My recommedation: Buy the live Meltdown album instead, and go see them in concert.

If this album had come out under any other name...well...it wouldn't have come out at all.The guitars are an overly-distorted, twisted mess, displaying none of the near-virtuoso talents of Downing or Tipton. The lyrics are quite simply the worst ever put to paper. The vocals are the highlight of the album. They serve well for any other metal band, but this is Judas Priest. Rob Halford is the cornerstone of metal vocals, and these don't even approach the level that he held even in his waning years.Bottom line, it'd be nice if I could say that this album is only for the Priest fanbatic, but I can't even say that. I am a Priest fanatic, and I wish I'd never bought it.Hopefully nobody else will make the mistake that I did. Steer clear of this frisbee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Tell Me What Happened","review":"Wow-what a difference a few years and a new singer make. This is probably the most brutal Priest album ever. Not that that is bad but the one thing that ruins this album are the lyrics. Glenn Tipton is no Rob Halford when it comes to lyrics, and good lyrics go hand in hand with Priest songs. The music is average-sounds like the guys have been listenening to Slayer or Testament a bit too much. Ripper has a great voice, close to Halford's but obviously younger. Ian Hill and Scott Travis rumble on as usual. The best cuts from this album are \\"Death Row\\", \\"Cathedral Spires\\" and \\"Burn in Hell\\". All the material here is tight and well played but is a bit boring. Do yourself a favor and get \\"Priest Live '98\\". It really showcases Ripper's voice and is awesome. Pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priest revitalized","review":"With Riper Owens addition Priest has recover youth from their past they sound powerfull, very powerfull and with more energy that many new bands, also this is one of that very few times when change of frontman gets credit in a band before fans, really this change worked out and this is very rare to happen, not only this new vocalist has been accepted but, this band has now the admiration of new fans like me , before \\"Jugulator\\" i never really get into Priest music so much but this time they were like a whole new band for me and im pretty sure that the same thing happened to many metal followers that never before were Priest fans , however is good that Halford is back nothing better than classic Priest but this band can be proud of Owens and Owens can be proud of himself , he really filled Halford shoes and that is not easy.HM"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album RIP'S!!!","review":"What an awesome album and comeback for the Metal God's. I prefer Halford but Ripper does a great job replacing him, great band, great album!!! The songs are awesome, the guitars are amazing, and the album is brutally heavy the way it should be. If you want the Metal God's you got em!! One of the heaviest albums off all time. Love this album as a Judas Priest album not a Where's Halford album which most of the unwarranted negative reviews allude biasedly toward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good...","review":"\\"Cathedral Spires\\" is one of the greatest metal songs ever written!!! IT's amazing! Ripper sings very well, also. But the albun is not good overall, because it seems that Tipton made it alone, the other musicians only playing half-heartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change of Heart-not as good as mentioned B4","review":"I first rated this CD at 5 stars for some unknown reason...It is not a bad CD by any stretch of the imagination but a lot of the middle tracks get annoying and there are only two stand out tracks to me...thus being Bullet Train and the title track.It wasn't the fault of Tim Owens yet everyone cusses on him for ruining Judas. Well look to the lyrics i mean Owens didn't write them come on! Sure Owens couldn't reach the higher octave of lyrical ranges but for being from a Priest tribute band he wasn't all that bad at all i don't think.Well that's Jugulator in a nutshell...take or leave!-FINAL COPY-"},{"rating":"1","title":"jugulator","review":"This CD and the one that follows are the 2 worst pieces in the Priest catalogue. Priest is not Priest without Halford. Period. It's too forced of an effort to try and update the sound of the band. It's an attempt at trying to sound like the newer \\"90's metal\\". You can definitly see how much of an influence Rob had on the band when he came back for Angel of Retribution. Let's just forget that Jugulator and Demolition ever happend."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinking","review":"It is the worst Judas Priest Work. It is good to persons who wants to hear only noisy music.

Ripper Owens is actually a very good singer, and the reason this album sucks so much is not because of him, it's because, well, the cd just sucks! I even like hardcore metal like this, when it's done well. But the fact is, this cd would not come close to comparing to other artists of this genre. Cathredral Spires, like everyone says, is a great song, hence the two stars. other than that, even if you are a death metal fan, try and avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"These aging guys are still dangerous!","review":"I got this CD only because I was curious how JP sounded without Rob. I was surprised and impressed with the faster, heavier, angrier songs offered by the new JP. It may be because I am a big fan of the heavy stuff like Slayer, Kreator, Grip, Inc...Tim Owen did a very good job. He derserves to get more credits on the success of this CD. I know that some old JP fan don't like this Cd because the new approach. Hey guys, we are living in the 90's. We should listen to this CD without prejudice. Outstanding tracks are Blood Stained, Deathrow, Burn in Hell, Bullet Train. The rest are...good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO BIG DEAL","review":"The band produced a solid effort, but htis is not Judas Priest. They should have changed their name ...

It\`s nothing more than noise without any real meaning or any understanding at all. This band was one of the best hard rockers from the eighties but that\`s all changed with this harsh rather unispired effert. Rob Halford\`s schreching vocals is sadly missed. This new lead singer is nowhere near the form of Halford\`s style. \`DEAD MEAT\` one of the tracks from this release the lyrics you can\`t even understand and with the pounding bass and drums, there\`s just no enjoyment in their music anymore. If JUDAS PRIEST continues to go on with this they would just fade away to nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNFORTUNATELY SOMETHING WENT WRONG","review":"JUDAS came back after 7 years. The new singer is amazing: he can sing like Halford when he wants, he can be himself when he wants, he has total voice control.

The only exception is \\"Cathedral Expires\\", which I consider a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rob who?","review":"I got this disk and thought it rocked. I saw a concert on the tour for this album and the entire crowd was skeptical of the new singer. That lasted for one song.

So buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jugulator","review":"THE absolute worst album Judas Priest ever made. I have been a fan since Stained Class and every album has been different, but excellent.

This album doesn't live up to the bands back catalog. Here's why: 1. Lyrics are stupid Decapitate? Jugulate? Death Row? come on these lyrics are frikin terrible.2. No melody what truly makes a memorable song is it's hook. Melody can be one of the heaviest elements on a good metal record. (no memorable melodies)3. Guitars detuned In order to accomidate the lower range of ripper Owens, the guitars are tuned a full step and a half down. The result is it sounds like Cannible Corpses or other mindless death metal"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing!","review":"I hesitated to buy this album since I didn't like Painkiller or Ram It Down very much. Having seen them and met them, I can say they are one of the best rock bands ever. Jugulator suffers from lacklustre songwriting. It's funny to read reviews by people who seem to be Preist neophytes saying things like \\"their best album\\" and \\"Ripper is better than Halford.\\" People who really know Judas Priest can only hope for some better songwriting next time around.

Its not that i cant take extremly heavy metal. I listen to Possessed and Mercyful Fate as well. But its that i cant take stupid. They should have released Stained Class in the ninetys.

They are riding the coat tails of there legend. This new music may be good for the NEW comers, but for true, real Priest fans that have loved them for so long, this is by far there most miserable failure ever. I cannot remember them putting out a album so bad. There best album ever was Screaming for Vengeance, it was a true cutting edge sound, now its over sampled, poor chorded and copied halford vocals...

I am VERY familiar with the Duke boot, therefore I believe it is not my imagination at work here. Disappointed to say the least. Upon further inspection, I also noticed what appear to be dark ink-like marks on the front of BOTH shoes,and scuff marks on BOTH shoes,between the heels and the soles.

Nicely packaged, with original cover art and liner notes. Everything looks legit, down to the fine print, \\"issued under license from Universal Music.\\" Well, they may have all the signatures and licenses, but they forgot to get the master tapes(!). The disc seemed to be sourced from a vinyl LP. Even for a vinyl transfer the final product here is mediocre at best. Anomalies exist throughout the CD, as if the source record was not cleaned. Also, either the stylus was in poor condition, or the anti-skate setting on the turntable was was not adjusted properly with the tone arm weight. \\"Fuzzy\\" would be my best one word description of this set.Nothing against the actual music though. The Dirty Tricks albums are really great obscure 70s hard rock, and deserve a legit reissue with attention to quality mastering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we buy the same CD?","review":"Pat's voice is still top notch and a pleasure to listen to.

This songwriting was way below her skill level. Boring at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Benatar Trying to be Sheryl Crow.","review":"For those of you hungry for a strong Pat Benatar release, you may want to keep waiting. This album is essentially a bunch of bad demos. Innamorata is a half hazard attempt to cash in on the latest female trend in music. The popular trend is to be laid back and guitary. Pat fails miserably because Benatarism is essentially strong and in your face. Her voice is too strong for the lackluster arrangements found on this embarassing disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of money","review":"I thought Pat Benatar was a good singer. Then I bought this lousy CD. I think its just terrible. What a boring album. I really think that this was the biggest waste of money. I paid 17 dollars for this CD, and hated it. I brought it to a place in Chicago and they wouldnt even buy it from me. I couldnt even get 3 dollars for it. They said no one wants pat benatar. No one even wants to be her. Pat doesnt even want to be pat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still going strong","review":"If Slaughter is one of those bands allegedly responsible for the death of rock n'roll then this album only proves that the band itself is alive and well. Unlinke many other similar groups who had come and go during the span of Slaughter's existence, these guys have stayed together, never straying away from the melodic hard rock sound that has become their trademark. On Revolution, their best album to date in my opinion, they have shown maturity and creativity that might have been not so evident in their previous efforts. From the edgy rocker American Pie to melodic power ballad Heat of the Moment, and the furious I'm Gone this album creates a vibe that stays with you long after you stop listening. This is by far the most memorable and melodic album Slaughter have released, and I'm a little disappointed that their newest effort Back To Reality does not continue into that direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The first slaughter album was quite impressive , i was expecting the same form on this album. I was quite disappointed , it lacks the same spirit and energy , one cannot classify this band as a hard rock band any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your wedding money...go to the library","review":"This book was not worth the money I spent on it. I judged a book by it's cover on this one, (or rather by flipping through and seeing pretty pictures) and judged incorrectly. I found this book to be lacking in the content department. It tries to cover a lot of topics, but in that respect, it only covers each topic for a few paragraphs, not going in to depth really on anything, and therefore not really being helpful for designing and planning a wedding. There were no helpful checklists or worksheets for planning, nor did it give the bride any idea about where to start planning! If you're looking for one book to solve all of your wedding information and/or planning needs, this is not the book. I reccommend The Knot guides, and also any specific guide that will help you with the kind of wedding you're planning to have (Catholic, Jewish, Destination, Ethnic, whatever). ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout for all ages","review":"The best part of 3 in 1 Total Body Fitness is that it is good for all ages.

The Taurus section doesn't cover the Millenium, rosies or the 24/7 selection.

I love all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spontaneous adultery?","review":"This is the first book by this author I have read and I was very disappointed. I had trouble believing that Sam, who was in love with his wife and had an active and healthy sexual relationship with her, would suddenly, and for no reason other than excitement over winning a case, have sex with his wife's best friend. What ever happened to restraint? Adultery normally occurs when there are other problems in the relationship, and it appeared that Anne and Sam's marriage had been ideal. I had no sympathy for the character of Teke, the best friend. She was reading a letter from a man she had not seen in 20 years and was so overcome she would have sex with her best friend's husband? I don't buy it. Anne, the betrayed wife and the only sympathetic character in the book, eventually forgives everyone, and invites Teke to go on vacation with her and Sam. What woman in the real world would want her husband anywhere near his former lover? Don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No friend of mine","review":"I have very rarely given this bad of a review. I normally give at least 3 stars just for writing. I was shocked ms. Delinsky put this dribble out. She has written some fine books this is not one. The use of the F word and sex was just gross. The fact that a best friend could have sex with her best friends husband and by the end they are all friends again. Then the story goes on that the injured wife can understand why the husband had sex with her friend and neighbor. Come on what world does that happen in? I finished this book because it was on CD and I had a long drive otherwise I would have thrown it across the room. Why anyone gave this book 5 stars is beyond me. If you want to read trash this is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprising ... but deep.","review":"I finished this book ... and asked myself where the romance ended up. I mean, I choose Delinsky because she is a romance writer with depth and skill, no longer the Harlequin-type.( boring!) I expect characters with brains and personality ... and she doesn't disappoint in this one.But the romance storyline came in a fairly distant second or third to the exploration of what happens when cheating occurs in a seemingly \\"immune\\" marriage ... and tho instant reaction of \\"throw-him-out\\" does occur, reality -- real life --- also serves to shade that instant reaction with forgiveness, and underlying love. All sorts of marriage questions come up. After 30+ years myself, I have asked: what if it ever happened to me? I think she dealt with the subject with wisdom and grace. Wasn't what I was expecting -- but GOOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"This book was excellent. I could not put it down because I kept wanting to just read on and on to see what would happen to the characters. I felt bad for Annie and Michael the most. I wanted to hate Sam for what he did to Annie but I couldnt stay mad at him because as I kept reading I became more convinced that he really loved his wife and he did not mean to do what he did. Now JD on the other hand acted like a big big baby. Ok yes his wife hurt him but he is a hypocrite because what he did behind her back was even worse so he had no right to treat his wife like that. I hated him and had no sympathy for him at all. What a creep. Anyways I really enjoyed the book and the ending. If they ever make a sequel to this book I would very much like to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DELINSKY JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER!","review":"This is a wonderful, powerful book. Barbara Delinsky is one of the really fine authors of our time. She gives her characters such depth that I feel like I'm reading about people I would really like to know. Her imagination is endless and vivid. I read this in record time and will be ordering all of the books by this author that I have not yet read. Thank you, Barbara."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT, TOUCHING, WONDERFUL BOOK!!!!!!!!!","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read, EVER. Barbara Delinsky puts us right in there with the Popewells. She showed how Sam took responsibility for his actions and how one unfortunate, blurry incident changed everyone's life and brought out the good and the bad in every character. In addition, Barbara showed how mostly everyone has a skeleton in their closet. I absolutely loved the relationship Sam and Annie had - and, of course, routed for Teke and Grady to get together. JD, of course, was such an immature jerk. It angered me that although he defended Teke to his father, he so blatently, consistently, disrespected her to her face in front of the children. I thought \\"Coast Road\\" and \\"Together Alone\\" were excellent, but Barbara Delinsky outdid herself in \\"More Than Friends.\\" I'll probably read it again in a few months. Barbara, please keep writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant!","review":"I highly recommend this book. Reading through the introduction,the author states an 'educational slant' to the design and construction of the code within the book.

A mixture of Celtic and Olde English folk styles, only the final track could be considered a 'song' in the recognised sense, the remainder of the album is more a series of conveyed moods.Incidentally, both the previous comments are incorrect. 'Legend' accompanied the Goldcrest Films/HTV production of 'Robin Of Sherwood', originally broadcast by the ITV network in the U.K."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin of Sherwood","review":"This soundtrack brings back very fond memories of the show. However even if you haven't seen the show the simple music is beautiful. The songs are good at invoking images of spring forest and the sleepy villages of yore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Show Soundtrack","review":"I watched the Robin Hood series and always wondered who did the music. My wife found this album in a record store in Madrid and we were hooked the moment we put it on. All of the songs from the show were there without the dialogue getting in the way.The music is Paganish and dreamy and Clannad are totally unique. From what I've experienced with new age music, there is nobody else out there that sounds quite like them.There are so many favorite cuts, I can't single out any except for maybe Robin, the Hooded Man.Very cool stuff and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the collector","review":"To say the least, I was very disappointed by this \\"live\\" album. The reason I put \\"live\\" in quotations is because this isn't a very \\"lively\\" album. There is no crowd cheering what-so-ever! It makes me wonder why Bruce Dickinson & crew decided to release this? Part of the live album experience is to feed off the energy of the audience, and without that, it just sounds like the band is performing acoustically on a sound stage. Another complaint is that this 2 disc set contains 2 seperate concerts, but the concerts have basically the same song listing. One good thing about this collection is it looks very nice. It comes with a super nice booklet with plenty of pictures and liner notes from Bruce, and also some very nice picture discs. Other than that, only Iron Maiden/Bruce Dickinson collectors should get this set, and even the collectors won't listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"15 year Maiden fan from Houston, Texas","review":"I love this album!

What were they thinking? And the songs themselves are not up to standard for Bruce. I was robbed buying this CD -- don't you be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly beautiful contemporary guitar music","review":"This is an amazing cd and I'm very surprised I've never heard of this composer before. The melodies are so evocative and heartwrenching, somewhat abstract, but always tonal. It speaks to my soul. There are some really nice faster, complex pieces to keep things interesting, but overall, this is music for contemplation. My only reservation is there is a harmonica featured on 3 or so tracks which is distracting. It takes some getting used to and reminds one of an Italian bandoneon player serenading someone on one of the canals, or perhaps Piazolla, though not so rhythmic and \\"tango-ish\\". The tracks with it aren't bad, but it plays the melody line and kind of changes the focus from the guitar. Overall though, it shouldn't discourage anyone from getting this one, especially lovers of contemporary guitar music, looking for something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoblit keeps the proceedings hobbling along","review":"Based on the John Katzenbach novel, for a while HART'S WAR feels like an extended R-rated episode of HOGAN'S HEROES minus the laughs.Col. William McNamara (Bruce Willis)fights for the civil rights of his men in a POW camp.- as if the Nazis cared about people's rights. He soon concocts a plan to hold a court martial to distract the Nazis while he and Lt. Tommy Hart (Colin Farrell) escape and destroy a German weapons plant.Directed by Gregory Hoblit, who made PRIMAL FEAR and FALLEN, HART'S WAR is technically well made, but doesn't evoke fond memories of THE GREAT ESCAPE or VON RYAN'S EXPRESS, though admittedly there are a few good explosions here and there. Pity the rest of the movie wasn't explosive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with the DVD version","review":"My comments only concern the DVD versus Blu-ray issue.I have the the DVD version and the Blu-ray version. My experience has been that DVDs mastered in high definition look identical to the Blu-ray version (either on a Blu-Ray player or an upconvert DVD player). Although the DVD version has a very good transfer, I could see slight improvement in the Blu-ray version. (The branches on the trees in the first scene had slightly better definition.) On the other hand, it really didn't matter for most of the movie.The real problem with the Blu-ray version was the lack of special features. The only feature was the trailer. In contrast, the DVD version has two commentary tracks, deleted scenes, and a photo gallery. If you don't care about the features and are willing to pay a bit more for a slightly more defined picture, then go with the Blu-ray. If you want the extras, go with the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"I'd give the book 5 stars but the movie is barely deserve one. The movie is based on the book and so the story is really very different. The plot lines in the book that made it a great book were either changed or completely left out. The story was so different that it is a wonder it even had the same title. Why base a movie on a book and then completely change it? There just wasn't enough substance to this movie. It seemed like much ado about nothing and didn't have any depth to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING !","review":"Ok the actors are good but I expected something else.In this movie, the German soldiers and officers are just too kind !

How dissapointed I was. What was a harrowing tale about racism and a legal battle fought in a a trumped up court martial turned into another Bruce Willis action flic, and not a good one at that. The movie was not true to the book and while this happens a lot in movies (see Enemy at the Gates, nee War of the Rats)in this case it did not improve the story at all and in fact reduced the real story line so much that it was relegated to a delivery device for Bruce's glares and command prescence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harts War","review":"This movie was good, but not the best WW2 movie I've seen. Colin Farrell and Bruce Willis are good in this movie...but then again they're both great actors!! So yeah. It got kind of boring at some parts. It could have been better but it was a war movie and it had Colin Farrell so I was happy!! If you're really into war movies, I suggest you watch this movie, but don't expect it to be this all out great movie. I don't suggest you buy it, just rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Have & Have Not","review":"Hart's War is an interesting study in priviledge and deprivation. Colin Farrell who starred as Jesse James in \\"American Outlaws\\" does a good job of playing the Senator's son with the cushy wartime job who gets captured, tortured, capitulates, and must prove himself in the war camp not for who he knows but who he is. Terrence Dashon Howard does a great job as the accused black aviator; and the film explores these issues of rascism in WWII. Bruce Willis turns in a journeyman performance as Col. William McNamara. While this may not be a classic drama, it does keep a good pace and keeps you involved with the story to the end. The DVD version didn't have any deleted scenes and seemed a bit light except for some added trailers for other films. All in all, a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like war movies skip this one","review":"This movie is a politically corect drama.

Its about POW's who go on trial in the POW camp, against each other. While the Germans help them in any way the can for both sides to have a case.
